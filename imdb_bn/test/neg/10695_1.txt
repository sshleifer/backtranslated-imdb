It's the worst movie I've ever seen, so bad it's surprising. I'm glad that I did not see black sidemic in any of the pictures: Okay, there was no fault of anyone that someone gave him that line, but he could reject the role and try to learn how to work instead. How does anyone get money to collect this picture? Are there any corporation in Hollywood that deals with any brain related to trash for male college students? "Oh yes, they will love it: it is a credible plot, some Kung Fu movement, Chuck Norris, the black root of the bad cone line, sweet Israeli (or the Arab, or someone who carries?) The son, the cockpit and the devil." Bright, and mankind Thank you very much for the rich.
