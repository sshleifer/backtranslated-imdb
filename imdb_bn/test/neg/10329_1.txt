In the # 2 spot "Lesson for an Assassin" I have ever seen the movie # 1 on the list of the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Acting shy (sorry, Sandra Bulac, but your performance was awesome!), Music score could come from a bad X-rated rating and the story was merely ridiculous. It was common with a common action movie: the dialogues were short and mainly included a sound word. But unlike the average action movie, it did not have any real steps. Boring <br /> <br /> <br /> The only reason I have continued to hope that at one moment this movie will be the least interesting scene ... <br /> <br /> This one
