This film was a Mexican-made horror movie since the late 60's. It's not good, but really not so bad. There is a lot of skill, and it padded heavily with nudity and violence, but it was a plot and tried to keep it at least (even if the plot inspired the same Frankenstein as "Do not get bothered at the domain of God" -Movie Rent). There were some padding mixed with female wrestling, but it was made in Mexico and wrestling in Mexico seems to be popular. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the leukemia Other doctors did not give any hope for poor people, but the idea of ​​replacing Gorilla heart to father to save his life to his son (I do not know, I am not a lawyer). Replacement works, but the Soni-son is becoming an endless person who terrorizes naked women, and whoever gets on his way, kills him. A police and a crane who has a subplot involving her lover (this has really added a lot, but this is a good reason if they want to throw some masks into the female wrestler) <br /> <br /> The film was kind of cheap, but the day Not very bad for a movie. Plots were basically just recycled and there was nothing that was better tied up. However, this movie is fun in its own way (I do not know why this is a Mexican horror film and baton charge of my usual bad movie). I think it might be because it is a mix of very weird things and meshes. <br /> <br /> If you like Chinese foreign movies, nudity and female wrestlers, then watch it.
