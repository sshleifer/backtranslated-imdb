It is difficult to determine where to start. I bought it for a few questions and most of the worst Ivy ever lost. It did not have any picture behind the DVD and some lines were a plot plot, it warned me, but generally I like the bad movie to laugh, so I decided to leave it. This movie is made up of three short stories, each one is traveling on a particular bus at one point. (It is never clear what is the importance of the bus, or is set in a city) <br /> <br /> The first story is about a guy who, by a car, his wife's wishes Against it, to abandon it. This car is sorted and adopted like a giant broom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is not normal for a dating agency to discover its date only. In <br /> <br />, our bus shots (or any bus) are treated when a descriptor puts on the garbage load relationship (Really, like him on the commission to say 'Relation') <br / > <br /> This film does not actually have any freedom fighters. The acting, the dress and the little Spfx are not all complimentary to ting.There is no respected members even cast out interesting ladies. Simply, this movie is a disappointment.
