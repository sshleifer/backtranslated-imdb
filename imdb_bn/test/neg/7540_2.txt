This film is located in Newcastle upon Tain, dragging the Northeast England, where I was born and grew up. The film is fundamentally overwhelming - it shows the city, the children, the entire town. In this movie they are all stupid, violent, thieves, ghogs. <br /> <br /> I think I am plotting (predictable), performance (unreasonable), direction (lazy and strangers), but the city and its man's director to me are all irrelevant compared to humiliation. <br /> <br /> In my summary invited the director and writer Mark Herman to leave the North East.
