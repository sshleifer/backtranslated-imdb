The film was a moment, but anyway my eyes were frustrated. This is the remake of Trace (Walter Hill) and so is Sierra Madar's Treasurer, low tension, bite and human emotion. There were some nice performances but the story was tall and lacking in any real depth. I saw the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, and were not even inspired, and both of them had very little to talk about or play on their skin. This movie has been completed with death in the past and it does not have to be created, it uses good money for money. It does not thrive in action action spark and thriller for an action movie. It is good to see snow fall, but not for me.
