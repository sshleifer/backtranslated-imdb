I do not know who has funded it, or why, but this "want to be" vampires are really awful. It tries to be a hip, and appeals to the viewers of the young MTV generation, but it is frustrating. The acting is awesome, and the directions are horrific. I had heard the budget was 600,000 dollars. I wanted to know where all the money went?
