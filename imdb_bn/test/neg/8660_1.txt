What a crappy movie! The original character of this movie was thought to be born and born in Canada, but there was more balance than his parents! Is it just me or Woody gay in this movie? Also, does Canada dress like all the girl sluts? At least this is how it is in this movie. All women are dressed like strippers. Do not waste your time with this one! The only good thing in this movie is the setting of the beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why is Bollywood going through a pale? It's due to such movies. Hindi movies were really entertaining when I missed old 'old days! I could not finish this movie because it was very bad. I think the Hollywood Hollywood style must be stopped trying to repeat because it is not working alone. They should stay close to their capital because it gives entertainment to Indian cinemas.
