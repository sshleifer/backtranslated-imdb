This movie has some of the worst performances I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was in high school qualification. It can be hard to illustrate the image of Jerry Lee Lewis. Just ask jammy fox (although Ray's vision of the concept of Ray Charles was more intimate than his personality and musical ability). Philippe's brother's screenplay is included in Hager's Duchess, and Alec Beldwin plays Jimmy Soggert, something like Shakespeare, like Decked Duck. When Robert Duval played a preacher of a country, I bought it. Baldwin does not believe me single words. Wynona Ryder's part was best, and he was mediator. (And who can say if anyone can meet Luis when he is 13 years old and at the age of 13?) Some tests on the Internet have shown that the information presented in this film was true, at least not more fake than Hollywood. Organic pictures This picture did badly on the box office, and it should have.
