After watching CaddyShack 1 I had heard a signal and decided to look at it. The movie seemed bad and I asked myself to stay away but gave me stupid and really bought this item! All reviews and all the bad truths that you have heard about Caddyshack II The film is merely thinking of ideas and perils of defeat and the jokes I've ever heard of, Gopher, the whole movie's acting is really bad. (Randy Coed was funny though). <br /> <br /> Just stay away from you as much as possible I can say this movie. I deeply regret watching and buying DVDs but not sure what was worse than that. Stay away from as far as possible.
