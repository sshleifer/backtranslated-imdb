I reviewed the matrix with one of my friends. We love both the Matrix and we love the construction of both movies so that we want to see what's going on behind the matrix scenes. It shows that Matrix Revived tells you very little about the art of film making or how even the matrix was created. It is basically a huge commercial for the Matrix, a movie that has already been seen by the audience of The Matrix Revisite! <br /> <br /> If you really wanted to know about the process and problems and stress and detail that went to create matrix, the matrix's original DVD does not have much more than bonus features. There are some information that they show in the documentaries that I could not complete or finish. The matrix was a difficult and challenging film that is worth getting more than a "documentary" which is informative and interesting as MTV.
