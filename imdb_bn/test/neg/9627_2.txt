Last night I saw "Mirroromas" and it was an unhappy experience. <br /> <br /> is a film that is rich but slow, poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> However, when I went, I knew it. The two gentlemen I went with (believing comic buffs) wanted to believe that the visuals could be simple and that's why they were. Unfortunately, the inexpressiveness of the direction means that after the scene, the scene passes little in the direction of dramatic tension or conflict. However, this is a comment that can be produced by many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and directed to. The camera lost its momentum by lovingly living in beautiful pictures. <br /> <br /> I am sure that I did not leave without the assurance that the film's style would be valuable. I have tried Neil Guyman's work, but always with the feeling of "Emperor's new dress". I hope, but there was no exception last night. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can continue to analyze Gayman's work without losing my life. Read the rest of the comments and all its errors are eloquently described. But I do not understand that he did not feel any understanding about the 15-year-old's mind, and added nothing to the sum total of human knowledge on what he was saying and the increase in adult accountability. A girl can change the relationship that she may have with her mother. These movies are directed with central themes and they are strangely, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination. Not all beautiful pictures in the world can make a part of the defective work.
