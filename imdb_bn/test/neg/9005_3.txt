"Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible restoration of an extraordinary movie, it's only exhausted for the former Supermodel Rene Russo's helpless shot. <br /> <br /> This is it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan has phoned his part, and Dennis Levi (as usual) played a boring Irish police, but I could not close his eyes from the beautiful Miss Rasso. There is a good love-making scene on a staircase, a terrifically sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll of sack. Oh, and a picture stolen from a museum and hangs a catamaran. <br /> <br /> But hopefully other directors Ms. Recognize Russo's perky qualities and hope to throw him in more, visible role.
