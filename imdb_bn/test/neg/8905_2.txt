I watched the TV guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Gram, I liked movies like Boogie Knights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started just right, but you could say the story was lacking, and through almost half way, it started to get lost. This theater does not remember to be in the theater, and I was sure that it was not long. Acting was unreasonable and unbelievable, the conversation was stupid and expected, and the story was confusing and stupid. Perfect is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I liked movies like I have been compared to movies, but this one is not around !! Heather did a lot of work from planetarium. I gave it 2 out of 10 but since I clicked the wrong number, I want to give it 1.
