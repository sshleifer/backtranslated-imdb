I know this Chuck Norris DVD that it was his first film and it shows. We all know that he will never win an Oscar to act, but what we do not see for him. Although there were some earthquakes in California from this movie, there was no desert or hill between Hue 9.9 and 5. Delivery exceeded 12 miles away from 120 to 125 to 52. I want the writers, producers and directors of these films to see at least one map. As a truck driver who spent a lot of time in California, from the beginning I could say that the geography was wrong. However, there are bad ways to spend a half hour. So grab your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a trip back in time.
