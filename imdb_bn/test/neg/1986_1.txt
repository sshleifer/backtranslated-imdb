<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a result, it fails on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The acting is frustrating, the putting off and the anticipated symbolism is meaningless. <br /> <br /> Claus Kinsky is probably the best thing about this movie. But that's not a good thing. Sure he has an intense and 'unique' appearance but eventually he can not actually work. <br /> <br /> I do not see this picture, there is no need to say anything, and not say again.
