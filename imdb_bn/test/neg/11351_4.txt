Don Cossackelli's entry in Mount Garris's Masters of Horror series is a story on and off on a Mountain Road. Coscarelli is the man behind such civilized gems being famous for the Phantasm series and as famous as the bizarre Bubba Ho-Tep; But he has brought some qualities that make these films great for this TV episode. This plot is the driving force of a cycle that follows a crazy and follows the guiltless routine concept. During this time, it is a young girl driving down the mountain road. After the head of the crash, she thinks she is crazy face to face. The whole Chase sequence is really ridiculous, the young lady is often so close to the snare set; Just a few seconds later to show off to the dog, and it was seen in the show of her husband - who can get a lot of information about the escape of the insane killers only; With the line "unexpected hope" The only true highlight for me was the Phantasam's Tall Man, the presence of Angus scream. Coscarelli tries its best to implement terrible imagery as much as possible; With such things as a rotted corpse of a dead baby - but because it's all so stupid, this piece is hard to take seriously. The first episode of this series, and the first that I saw; I really hope they get better.
