** Some light spoilers may be considered, but this photo is not more than anyone else's review. ** <br /> <br /> I knew that nothing can survive with the full brightness of "Kerry" originally. A film about social criticism which was more than a fire in the gym. Kerry White was "victim", and his story revealed helplessness that should be truly absorbed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has played the role of "Rachel" for the character of "Ragel" must be "carrier" "Indeed, for the audience to share the fury of the victim, he may be a sympathetic character - a true stalemate who is more likely to face more than his own behavior, Rachel expresses any kind of emotional depth of dissatisfaction, and Sissy Spesk's" carrier "connection. He thinks and plays that he alongside 'attractive and popular brigade' as well as t He finished the washing. He, like everyone else, was a soul that was contaminated every bit, when Keri was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> This does not work. There is no satisfaction to see beautiful children - even "Home Improvement" is not a boy too. This movie is moving into the climatic scene, and it is so unnecessary that no bleeding was seen in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And especially one person who is taking this movie It was not supposed to be done ... but I would not say who it is. If you have seen the original "Kerry", it is the character of the character who died unjustly. <br /> <br /> At least they created the connection correctly; As it should have been explained. But that, and hand tattoo, which was rather nicely done, this movie is only going for it. <br /> <br /> Another awesome "scream" is closed and it gets fame. One of the most compulsory movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1 out of 10. I was not expecting much, but I was still very frustrated. An unfavorable character, a series of references to anxietyatic pop culture, and a last scene that compares with Gastroston Shocker of "Carrie"
