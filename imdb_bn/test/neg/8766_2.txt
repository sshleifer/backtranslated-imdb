Behind the DVD for this movie, "Quantin Tarantino of Chai Christian Movies." It is not as humiliating as it is in Quentin Christian films. This image is badly written, performed strictly and with a purposeless intensity. The scene is interspersed with play in a confusing and unrealistic way and with some excellent time-laptops photography. Freeze frames for flashbacks, gray smoke, time-frames (unimportant in the story), the film works without any other reason than the credibility of the movie. The camera is cut with Huffjard, some nice crane shots, with no sense of ridiculous montages. Thinking about the poor blocking and discussion viewers who are talking to a lot of scenes. Oh and the audio is terrible. Special effects were limited to modest and thanks. But all this is just technical. The movie fails to engage in an emotional level. The conversation is so much fraud and before the camera is rolling, the actors can read it just a moment. The story ... there is no motivation behind the sequence that happened. The characters are struggling to take hold of one dimension. And the characters must have a position of faith in Christianity and every single view. M. Take a row from the night, to be involved in Christian movies, the characters of the name of Jesus Christ in each scene of the movie do not have to be Christian. Goodness! Please do not try to show this to your unsaved friends with no hope other than smile.
