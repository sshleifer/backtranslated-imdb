AFFAIR In the 1970s, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood played the husband and wife as the immediate lover. She has polio and leads a similar existence as a pop song writer. She is an aspiring lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Like their relationship, destruction from the beginning, and she knows it, but it goes along anyway. If you are trapped to see it, then look for two things: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo which is never mussed, whatever it is, and in this horrific flashing she will soon have a melody melody. He tracks it for four or five or six minutes, so you know classic padding in advertisements. This is one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman in the woods should shoot the floating woman and get out of her pain. Also, keep an eye out for all farmer tops and dresses. Comparing, Wagner shows relatively timeless, with frequent hairstyle and a series of classic cases.
