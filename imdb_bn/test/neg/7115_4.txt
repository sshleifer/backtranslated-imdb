Just an hour before I finished watching this my friend. As a dragonboy fan, we think this film is so bad that it is good. We will say one thing: With the help of six pine beer you can survive through this movie. This movie should meet with many dragon fans to laugh at their ass. The best character in the film is Lord Horn, his makeup, his smile, and behavior cracks the incredible experience. We liked this movie, the cartoon version was the same as Turtle Man Island. We believe that the cartoon is the only character of the cartoon man. She is a sexually stoic and stupid kind.
