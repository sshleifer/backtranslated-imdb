I do not understand this type of spoof movie. You will get some serious / semi-critical films that everyone knows and focus on unexpected fart-jokes and its importance. We saw it a lot, many times, and it was not really fun. In my opinion, this is just a simple way to do something that you do not understand. It seems to be more vague than this, and the choice of the complex, although I honestly do not see anything that is worse than spy hard or hot shots. This movie is easily understood from the title, Paul Fiction focuses on the fun of childhood. I decided to watch it because this movie has become very emotional and powerful for Tarantino's sick mind. I hope one or two good jokes, since the pop fiction (in my view) was humble opinion, making fun of too much violent and unmatched films. I was sadly disappointed. This plot is mostly the rap-off of Tarantino's film, some scenes spoofing movies, often in the same child and humorous fashion. Pensing is poor, and often you can sit there, guess the outcome of each scene, predict every joke, often think about the best one in the spot, and refrain from your mind. Acting is bad. Characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and deliberately thin the paper so that they can make the characters described fun ... The problem is, it does not work. It only creates a film that makes it very difficult to sit. Humor is young and hairy. I can say about this movie that only positive thing they have been able to find some actors who looked like people like them. The actual real actors involved in the film are a terrible waste. Possible little is the same type of entertaining movie fans generally. I only recommend those who really hate PL fiction, or Junker Parody fans of the movie. Everyone else: Avoid 1/10
