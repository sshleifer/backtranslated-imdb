This is an adaptation of Edith Warton's work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this movie never disappoints the feeling that people of this 20th century film do not understand the suppression and frustration of the 19th century. Ward and Dalton is not so bad, but Alicia Wight's wooden performance surprised me. He was supposed to play the continuous element of the story, but he stood like a long stick in the whole movie, and I never believed a word from his mouth. When he asked Selma Ward, "Why can not I remove you?" At the end of the film, I could not help but answer: "I've been thinking for the last 150 years!"
