When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started to find out their old movies in the video so that I can see them with their eyes. I think I really liked it specially, and I thought it was its best. Now I'm a little older, I can say that although it is fairly average, I still consider one of her best movies. In an extension to her, a police forefather was frightened by her involvement in the capture of Norris and his capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial killers are now all angry, and people want to think of them as a complete 90's discovery. On the contrary, it is good to see that the current outbreaks of action movies (as well as stock n 'slashers) have been spread in 80 minutes of 80 degree and 80th 80s. Norris attacks both humor and human compassion in any kind of effort and may be someone with a laugh, head-like chalk. As a great fan of Steve James, I can recommend this movie, as well as the supporting role of Diego as well as Blue Brothers Mitch for the legendary Billy Draigar. Not great, but better than anything of Norris in the 90's.
