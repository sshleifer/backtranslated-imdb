All right, this movie was not good at all. I would never like video games over the age of 15. It is good to play games, but it may be liked to play a comment about video game players, it is weird Just play a video game, not a sorry story about getting a trap. I use my cell phone, hopefully I will not separate my girlfriend. Summer is the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very good thought story along with being a musical. Even if you do not like musical instruments, anyone would say good in Greece. My brother always played video games and watched 30 minutes and the rest is very dangerous. I feel sleepy
