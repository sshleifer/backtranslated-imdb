Disney Studios "Snowball Express" is not like most of their output in this era. There is no hippie or hot-rodder, a ramshackle hotel / ski resort resident blue-de-dancer Dean Jones from a dead relative. When Jones and family reach the city of Colorado, when they are asleep, people direct them - they look more like "delivery" - they are suddenly uncomfortable at the hotel (we hope it will look like one-room), but actually the accommodation is very beautiful. Jones's teenage daughter saw an impressive look on her face (which does not bar a local Yahoo man jumping on her), and of course, the stupendous Pump Dean Jones Slopes, which is in large quantities of Prattles Slush. This scripts have probably benefited from some magical snowflakes because of the frozen energy of this square. * ****
