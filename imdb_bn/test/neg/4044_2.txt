Actually, you have to stay with yourself to create such a horrific film! Actually, I feel more embarrassed that I was sitting on the whole thing. It looks like an old 80's advertising movie, looking for super-counterfeit "special effects", imaginative imagery and very impressive conversations. Perhaps they just wanted to see it, maybe they look fantastic on cinematic 80s, as it will come back to style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think that the promised eye candy will save the movie, you will be frustrated - the so-called "innocent" man and cruel ugly. They can not do any work, I do not realize that they can not care less if they want kids without any talent! But I think when you are making this movie, you do not get very good choices in this stupid, hot girls just because of their cruel shit, their own ones!
