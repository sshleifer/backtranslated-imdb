This movie is junky, it looked really fun in previews but I did not smile once through the whole movie. Do yourself a great favor and do not waste your money on it, do not waste anyone's money. I gave it 1/10 I can believe if I could give it less. I was a 15 year old and I thought it was a trash to see a good movie and to see J and Silent Bob strikes back.
