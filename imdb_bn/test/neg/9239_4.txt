(May be a spoiler may start ...) <br /> <br /> "I 2" series of "The Eye". It is about a pregnant woman who is able to see the ghosts and spirits after the incident. <br /> <br /> Sound effects are temporary, but I am afraid of it but it is the only awesome thing. The cooling effect is certainly cool so some scenes from the prick are comparatively similar and repeated. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a terrific and unrelenting impression, where "I2" is a forgotten horror-cum-drama movie. Ignore this observer. "Eye" is good enough to watch.
