It opens with the company's credit to tell us through the World International Network. I knew I had seen this company's credit before but could not remember where, but I knew it was at the beginning of a bad movie, so I seriously thought about changing channels, I saw only one movie in the other channel which was an IMDB critic. It's not really important if I think it's really bad, because I'm still able to review it for this site. <br /> <br /> I hope that all was not good. This is a plot that I have seen many times (many times) before being involved in a harmful time while running, like the incredible hook TV series without shirts tips. Jamie completely transmits the transformation of the crowd and goes away and works himself in a Catholic reform school in a completely transformed manner. Have you noticed describing the use of an attack in the last sentence? "Completely conrived" answer. Let me repeat to think that this is a completely addictive movie where everything depends on restraint. Another problem was that I had a church-based reform school - it's a much more sympathetic and kind, I believe this kind of organization that Alcoraj can look like a country club, I'm saying it's really a fact. Look like the chief priest Donald Rumsfeld's spatula, you remember that there is a large amount of sugar coated with it. <br /> <br /> To be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists, etc. There was not really bad bad thriller. Although it's a very good one. I never wanted to congratulate the movie
