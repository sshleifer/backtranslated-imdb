Michael Fife wrote this fabulous story based on the arrest of Edwin Jane of Planefield, Wisconsin and ordered. Zine was trapped in a fierce assassination by sending a shock wave of terrorism through the rural areas of his countryside in the late 1950s. His evil mind and stomach world is suspected of being caused by his supremely motivated Lutheran mother. Ed was given the nickname "Butcher of Plenffield". She would robs the new dead body of similar women to her mother and she would have sex with them before her garage 'a deer like them' before. His personal trademark is being carried out with reverse hanging bodies. After his arrest, there are many articles made from human skin found in his house. In this movie, a young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) Jean (Why Holder) searches for personal person, when her shopkeeper's mother (Priscilla Barnes) is absent. The act is much better than the ridiculously liberalized documented genes. Also cast in: Adrian Frantage, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Bryman and Amy Lyndon.
