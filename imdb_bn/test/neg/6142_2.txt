My Rating: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Above - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show is very formally distorted. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY2 and CSI 100th. I do not know, you can find the episode you are viewing in other CSIs. But in this one, you can not go into this episode, why not try as much as you do, so in my opinion, this show is not worth seeing. I know people have opinions, and I respect her, but for me, this CSI is not good enough. So if you like suspense, realistic performance / performance, good plot, direction, character development / attachment and you like good show overall, but I suggest you see CSI Miami.
