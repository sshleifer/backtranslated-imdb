So far I have seen that the worst movie is not near any plot and its plot is very disconnected. The line of the story lacks both the content, mysteries and subtitles, which will be shown in the Russian language line. The set seems to be only a room with the effects of various discussions and at the moment you think that something is going to happen due to the lack of acting, drama, mystery, horror, gorge, story lines and myths. Guideline Style has died (FISH CAMERA). It seems that the only work in this film is within the last 10-15 minutes and the performers make the action worse due to failure to properly represent suspense. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dogs roaming around.
