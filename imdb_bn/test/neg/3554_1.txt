I used to sit one of the most annoying films, it was completely formulated. A cookie cutout in a movie, you can predict about each scene in the movie, because only knowing the generator, this movie added nothing new. Dialogue is not funny, interesting, or intelligent. Actually weak and soundtrack annoying - Basically everything seems to have been done by an amatuer film maker. There is nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, it is long that it gives an easy thumbs down. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade F.
