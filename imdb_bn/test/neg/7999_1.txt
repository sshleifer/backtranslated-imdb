A person, claiming that this movie is a classic, is seen to have seen this movie in the mid-1990s or seen it 10 years ago. Otherwise I can not explain the title of this 'Classic Nizaya Film' title. <br /> <br /> The war scenes of this movie are helpless. Rather than casting Frank Nero as his own, they could recruit some experienced martial artists instead. In any way, acting skills are not important in a movie. The power of Nero's fight is that all the fighters of the road. His kick and punched lam <br /> <br /> The old action movie with good action is enough. It's just a waste of time.
