Wow, I swear I've never had this before? Yesterday I just saw "Golden Temple Amazons" and I do not have some memories of what has happened in this movie already. How bright is this movie, I guess! So far, I'm glad to see it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, it showed a miraculous drawing of a miracle to burn a free target. Do I often fool by using a DVD cover application ?? Especially more than John Francis ?? And I still literally learned to prevent even after hundreds of terrible experiences. Well good After reading comments from other users, some parts of my memory came back, though I still saw this movie with other Jesse Fran√ßois Masterpieces the previous day, such as "Kilimanjaro diamond" (and, yes, it was a great DVD cover as well). <br /> <br /> "Golden Temple Amazons" opens with a wild animal in the African African Amazon ?? I'm aware of the conflict but do not blame me ?? The reason for the murder of a brittle young girl's parents was that they accused the soil of the temple for stealing gold treasures. After several years and the hormonal changes, the girl comes back to the jungle to take revenge. He is seen with a golden adventure that is not less interested in revenge but he does not think of taking back some gold. The primary pillar is clearly secondary to all female exhibits of female nudity and ineffective sludge. Annalia Ivers, Eva Leone and other non-anonymous people regularly visit Franco's preferences and voluntarily wander with their chests. If you enjoy watching all these perfect female turning curves, the rest "Golden Temple Amazon" as an annoying and incapable mess. There is no violence or activity and less than half of the film's genuine fillers, bit and pieces of National Geographic Documents are edited and edited in such content. Awesome DVD cover will definitely have a great addition to your collection, but stupid fools to open the box.
