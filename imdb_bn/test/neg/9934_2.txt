Since 1966, I became a fan of Star Trek fan. Still. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are secondary for letters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DC Fontana really blew this one . This episode is so embarrassing that master tape should be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half is not the best in the first season.
