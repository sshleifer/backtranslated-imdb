Someone told me that Pink Flimings was a word "insane". Now I suspect this guy really saw it, because I will not present it briefly in one word. Hateful, weird, um, more hateful ... it's to be done. Every time you think it may not get more messy, do it. My special "liking" was one when Divine was his birthday party and when the police came to bombs it, they ate the guests with hunger. I admit that this is a movie where it is so great that you do not look at it easily, but it is not the creative work of art. It's pure shock value. <br /> <br /> At the top, the jackass boys look like a bunch of PCs.
