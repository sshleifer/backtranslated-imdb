Gordon Scott has created some good Tarzan films, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I found that, poorly, at least the interior sets and empty cloned "cloning" sounds, which they think are going on in the dirt road, bad acting, and worse acting in Cast Casting, I was thinking, "relax! It's TV show level! " Then I saw, in fact, the three TV shows pilot episode bonum sim-perfectly-one. <br /> <br /> It was very good to see Scott out outside (lonely), away from the lame set, some scenes; And there are some pretty nice moves to fight ... but as oh, ow, and ouch conversations. And I mentioned the acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) is a better actor than most of the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A small Sherman (i.e. Scatman) stitched to see Carothers acting as a local. But probably the overall time is not worth the investment.
