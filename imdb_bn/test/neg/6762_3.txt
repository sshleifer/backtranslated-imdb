I once described this movie that you would like it or you hate it. From reading some of the other reviews and ratings, I would say that this is true. I'm placing myself in hatred. I have seen some really bad movies, boring movies, even low budget movies. This film is bad on three fronts. <br /> <br /> This island has returned to the world's exterior (Jeff Morro), its Vice-Fi / B-Movie roots, Dr. Lace (Minus giant headache). The doctor and his assistant Arne (George Hahnlan - Gentleman Urgent Ur of Urgent), along with a Les Girlfriend Assistant Vera, is tracking a meteor. It's the cruise of the cast and it's almost doubled. Lace Vera and Arnie are her "Suzie" (Sincro Unifying Scene Synthetic Integrating Equivalent - Computer Ur). George and his robotic maid Rosie (and his relationship with "Susie") relate relationship relation to more credible than just cold, clam-like feelings, which is for sheep laces (and vice versa). All their interests are not a common meteorite. It's really an alien art nouveau / industrial deco power storage device, which is moved around like a 3-legged dog. There is little alien "power" that controls Hubblebill (solicitor, chief scientist there) The aliens definitely go and get to go, polluted and evil. Such is the science we are giving? It is surprising that Alien was afraid of the Explorer. From watching some of these movies, we shoot at first. There is no need for questions later. <br /> <br /> The whole film is really synonymous to seeing boring science experiments, such as adding an egg color to warming or celery. This is a low budget caiaphai film or it is a bit of sugar and old that it is not true. It's really really annoying really. The whole movie is trying to figure out what's going on. Yes, that's it. What we learn about what is happening is mostly through solidarity and autocracy. Now add vague dialogs, cardboard performances and cheap sets and you have been made an add wood clone (however, Ed made some really annoying films - please avoid the dead velvet). Dialogue ... Oh, the dialog. As James: <br /> <br /> ".. 2 miles below the sea? <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? It's a billion miles." <br /> <br /> Trying to drag this image <br /> <br /> A banned planet, this islands Earth, the magnetic monster Or the same lighting as the outer limit, the Twilight Zone. For example, a low-budget cipher movie (or TV episode) that is compulsory for technical issues and a strange situation in the past. Basically, these films are enjoyable at some level (story, underlying meaning or mere humorous nature of dialogue or situations). There are no movies in this. It's just 90 minutes of annoyance. I could not even enjoy at Ed Wood level. I definitely recommend skipping this one and instead see one of the movies mentioned above. It's very bad, if my name is Forrester was, I never thought of showing this film to anyone ... except Frank.
