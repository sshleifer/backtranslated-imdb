It's weird, even though the film shows full X-rated sexual scenes and violent murder features, how it should be done does not seem frustrating. <br /> <br /> A team of scientists is on an island in the Caribbean Islands to investigate radioactivity. Events After their arrival, an evolutionist islander goes to a happy business of killing men and having her way with women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it is completely clear, it never fails to shock or stir. As soon as sex pornography goes away, it just loses its edge. The suspension of the disbelief was broken and we realized that we were just looking at sexual relations with people. <br /> <br /> There are some blood and gore with murder, but it's a D'Auto flick which is really quick. See the same 'Little Dead of Living Dead' for a much more rounded experience. <br /> <br /> 2/10
