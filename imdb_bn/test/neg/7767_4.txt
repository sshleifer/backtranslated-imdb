I do not expect much from the movie so not all disappointed. Cary looked ugly, Mr. Big was colored with his eyebrows crayons and did not say Samantha f ***. <br /> <br /> The Charlotte kid was too boring to look at the scene - the title could easily be "SATC: Parents' night out." Camera angles were not exactly that, especially in the face of Carey. <br /> <br /> A black woman who threw a black woman did not have a proper exit, and there was very little presence of gay men, who had thrown them for no purpose. Samena is moving back from LA, severing the flow of the story, especially when she comes for fashion week and there is nothing to do. The film seems to have been made slowly because it could have been good, but the scenes were thrown to showcase different clothes or given the opportunity to return to the exhibition without adding much to the audience.
