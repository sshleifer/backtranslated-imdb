Ed Wood is rolling over his grave. He could make a hundredth classical classic for the price of this waste. The worst script in memory (this makes "X-Men 3" Sparkle "Citizen Why"); Most amateur guidelines; Pre-cinematography; cheesiest "special effects" (I'm talking about "Friday 13th" order zone); And throwing in a vain, rebellious, deep disturbed, maternity ward sequence. The lack of any talent or sensitivity that is kept on this junk screen is amazing. The "art" that can reward someone involved in this celluloid ces pole with future projects can be a serious alarm.
