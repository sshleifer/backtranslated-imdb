Be careful, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" is associated with any product. Fast <br /> <br /> <br /> After Kelly's last film "Southland Tales", she has proved to the world that she is an inspired director. It was kind and slow. In the "box", there was not much change. <br /> <br /> I can see the image of what happened to Warner Bros., and I was able to eat it properly in the studio: a full-featured film Richard "Twilight Zone" based on the older short stories of Matheson. <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Unless you have deprived this movie completely for you, do not read it: <br /> <br /> pushing the soft (Cameron Diaz) button. <br /> <br /> Arlington Stewart (Frank Langley) used an alien as a utensil to manage "tests" which rested the fate of mankind. His face was frustrated because he was hit by Alien Lightning, which killed him, but then this red button made him resurrect for the test. Obviously, by pushing the Button Button, because of the full knowledge of whoever dies, he will surely be affected as a result of failing to consider another's life instead of himself. Finally he and her husband (James Marsden) chose to kill their son instead of being deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly is mesmerizing the story about her photo "message" Obviously, any person with the brain says in the beginning, "What if I was that person?" Richard Kelly is not even the person's conversation, even his character's normal. Actually, they avoid it together. They appear to be both educated, working for a prestigious school and NASA, so why not have a good ability to see the BOX out of both. <br /> <br /> If he was the main character there actually have this conversation, the whole movie will be there to be finished Could! Instead, we have to go forever for marriage, NASA and NSA Arlington Stewart should be pleased to receive this official program, to show Mercado's life outside our world, to teleporton, to kill his wife, and to control "drones" by drone Steward can be anywhere and anywhere in the time. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happened. It's a mixed mix of funny ideas- mash. <br /> <br /> How it is marketed is impossible. It "saw" the ad and used music from them to sell it. Actually what you get is slow, dust, ridiculous (yes, the drama was sunny in acting and visual influences), and dirty films that are fantastic, fun and united. At one point, Cameron Diaz and his son were abducted and then suddenly he returned home to the NSA's big black car. Where did he go? Why do they take him? We really care? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All of them will die. See what's playing in something else. Do not waste your time, or money.
