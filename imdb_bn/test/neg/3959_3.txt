Respect of words should be removed from all the nation's vocabulary. It is responsible for the increase of male stupidity and the death of millions of innocent people. Anyone who does not agree, can not read this comment. <br /> <br /> Expected this screenwit, Yakuza, a criminal thriller associated with great respect for ethnic background. Acting out Friends of thunder and violence will not be frustrated, but especially to the last violence, there is a bit useless, inefficient and impartial stupidity towards the violence. Unlike other critics, I'm not very good at Robert Mitchell's performance. It is definitely an actor who definitely did not improve with age. He looks like a tired oyster (it is not very good with part), and his isolation wind that makes him appear in an earlier years such as an impressive screen comes through confusion or lack of interest. Why Tampera and Richard Jordan are great people and young, intelligent, very good as well as creators. <br /> <br /> The best way to stand up to this movie is to see it as a tragic comedy. Directions have been established by the character of Mitam. Asked for a party on the basis of wrong estimation of Taqqura character. Errors become clearer, but the knowledge of respect they claim will not stop returning. So they started shooting from all sides, launching a sword and dismantling their friend's apartment apartment (although the man consulted with them? Stop this, please "fight all together"). The bodies are starting and the story ends with mithaam. The character makes his point: If you give him your little finger, I'll feed you. Then, what can he do at least, right? So he took out a knife, resigned and stopped breathing. (Out of frames, fortunately). It was a moment that was probably supposed to be serious. It just laughs me. <br /> <br /> Location is very good at this movie. I liked specially illustrated scenes. A fascinating future building by Sacheo Ottani (the Kyoto Protocol was signed) beside the international conference hall in Lake Taarcachike Lake and the surrounding architect Sacheo Ottani (signed by the Kyoto Protocol). The architecture's presentation seems even better than the recent documentary skyscrapers of Sydney Palak's Frank and Gehry. Which is about architecture and nothing else.
