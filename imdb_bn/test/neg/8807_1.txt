"Hood Right" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I just can not believe this movie made, let alone be distributed. Someone in the Universal studio thinks that people will see and like this "movie". The only good thing is the ice-holder as the Ice-T She was funny. <br /> <br /> One thing that hates the movie is absolutely active. Bad enough once or twice, but like that WHOLE movie Each scene has some special effects on speed in speed. The director should always be banned from making movies. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
