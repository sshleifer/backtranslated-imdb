There were only two released features about this movie; The beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and they portray the form of human form to transform the form of wolf. Forget about the plot or the story from the book - they are completely missing from this movie. In fact, only the main things managed on the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will recognize only character traits. If filmmakers have made a good film, I would not have been so frustrated even if it did not relate to the book. Unfortunately, they do not. Plagiarism and storytelling, low-budget horror features of Flickr, acting wood, and manager efforts are common. Oh yeah, the humble way for loop cows to their leaders is pure. I think the recognition is for an acknowledgment animal handler. Wolves were beautiful creatures and managed their role well.
