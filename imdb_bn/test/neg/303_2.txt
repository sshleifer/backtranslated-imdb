This movie has been done before. It is basically a European combo of "Napoleonic Dynamite" and "Sudden Lives". There are some fun bits, but otherwise it's a clich√© bore. This is a good first film effort and director (who has written and wrote these features too) promises many commitments. But the writing was harmful and the story was not very original. I swear that I heard some of the other movie lines. However, the performance was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is not too important to stop gay-themed movies with political tangles and tired tales. The main character is fairly good consistent for a homosexual teen of rural Texas, so no saccharine, coming out of the drama here!
