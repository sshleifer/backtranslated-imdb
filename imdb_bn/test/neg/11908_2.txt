Canterville Ghost (1996). The director is very sad to produce this one. Maybe it's a generation, but I really liked the Charles Lighthouse version. There is a time and place for "Emoting" and this product does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, Shakespeare was very good at reading, but still inappropriate. Do not recommend again. Closed-up and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding external elements and scenes takes away really great work. The playplay writer will have to look for another profession to reflect his career, probably afternoon soap opera can be a better place. Check out the really good version and pass this one.
