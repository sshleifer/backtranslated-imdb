Boy, this movie is bad. And not a good, delicious, fun way, is it? Even MST3K could not stop it from even boring, and confusing as it all gets. But the most annoying part of this messy mess was Ireland's terrible high voice, which I was tired to hear in the first five minutes. Not really how to mention its character unappealing. Even his father ran away and left him! I can see why? For more than a few minutes, her little mouse voice heard her cry, then she was tempted to make big losses. I was finally the end of the film. Plus, it's useless and annoying. When the long hole of the earth fell into Wonderland in London, it was in the first ten minutes that he worked as if the obscure Australian accent tower did not protect him from the various platforms he had found. . He should just connect to the Atlantic version of the train track and get done with it. And with this weird, confusing emotion with the density of this Atlantis underground bone, I have to ask - where is the light coming from? They have generators that imitate the sun? It does not matter. However, there is no real plot, strangely enough Goth Vannibians are trying to find the most frequent cathodies (perhaps they can hold a stain in his face). Stupid, unmatched film. For this cinematic hatred, Golan Globus thank you. You can burn the seventh ring of hell forever.
