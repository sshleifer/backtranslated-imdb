I attended a screening of this photo. After the end of the movie Travalta came to the question-answer. It was a small screening room in Tribaque. I did not want to do what I wanted to do for him. It made the film at its worst times. There was bad writing to start the script. The author wrote in a statement. The dialogue was tearing and clich√©d. This is the only bright thing that he can do to bring this writer / director back to Scarlett Johansen, John Travolta and Lyons Gate Entertainment, which he did in Fiasco. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie to all aspiring screenslines, directors and movie makers. Because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible to reach your goals. Hey ... Just look at this shit and tell yourself ... if they can make it, then they can be useful. <br /> <br /> PS-Trivalta has a great question and answer though she was easily, spoke freely and was a beautiful man down the earth. The director / writer stood side by side. When John tried to engage him in the conversation, he stood like a piece of wood and never joined. I looked at her and thought ... how was this person able to "pitch" successfully in the agent, studio accelerator, top talent? ... when he can not open his own screening screen. In attendance, the conclusion from some of us was that there should be a strong family connection between his business. <br /> <br /> Follow it with Geo Richie's Zero Star Masterpiece "Snake Away" after you watch it. Curious funny and worst actress wife Madonna. He is so bad and looks so bad in this movie that I think it was the way to return to him for all the misuses he took from him in this house.
