To be honest, I was never in Congo or even in Africa, and even after creating the television movie Heart of Darkness, I do not think I want to. The film completely covers the highest level of the book. Although I could not read the book well, after watching the film, I appreciated the book more than hundred times. Director of the film Nicholas Diana, did a horrific act portrayed in a film by Joseph Conrad's novel I tried to give some credit to the book for trying to make the book impossible by book, but it was not working for it. The film failed to release any part of the novel other than the plots. In the set and scene the book was lacking in African African conrad. Marlow saw such a great surprise in the book, but you did not get the same experience in the movie. No, I do not blame the director; Acting in the film was just terrible. The actors were all lazy and reluctant. Throughout the whole film, I used to think that the actors were not expressing any emotion as if they were reading from the script all the time. Marlow Actor Tim Roth did not portray Marlow's boldness to travel to Congo. Marlow's journey was to find cartage, but I did not enjoy it in the movie. I would not recommend seeing this movie, especially if you already read the book. It does not come near to justice for Joseph Conrad's novel. Conrad's word reader captures and take him on a ride with Marlow, Mr. Kurtz, where his film is not on its find. A great novel, but a very poor film. The Heart of Darkness, based on the book written by Joseph Conrad, which is also known as Heart of Darkness.
