I hope I could give ten votes to this movie, it's funny. If they wanted to be fun, then I could give it ten. I would give it 1, but it's the most fun darn you'd like to see. Watch the monster blur flash across the screen! Where does it come from? what is this? It flies, it's afraid, it's power-centric, it's a string! These birds have real personality. When I first saw it, I was ten, and when Big Bird appeared on the Street, I was sure that they were one and the same!
