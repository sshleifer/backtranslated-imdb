Ring! Ring! The horror director has been hotline, how can we help you? Um Yes ?? Pronto! I mean hello, my name is rugge ?? Wrong, call me by my initials! OK, Mr.RD, what's the problem? Well all my reviews of the movie "Dial: Help" were negative and hard, and, frankly, I think my career was a good day. Ok m. And D, and why do you think? Well, I've gained fame and got a well-established culture status. Due to my controversial and threatening film, one is concerned about the canvas of a movie crew and the other is a terrorist screaming of rich people of a home on the edge of the park. Ways Crowe borrowed the idea, but "Dial: Help" revolves around ?? Just make mistakes ?? Do not miss anything! No, Mr. R. D. Go ahead and tell me what this image is like. Um, it pushes a sexy model about a spiritually covered phone line and kills the people around it. Uh i see That firmness is not really as stupid and harmful as a destructor or rapist, but I think there is a deep theme in your movie, is not it? Oh yeah, sure ?? Um, what does that mean? Well, what is the phone line symbol for any other terror? Or is everything happening in your wife's heroine mind? Um, nap ?? It's just a phone that goes to the cats and kills people in cords, vibration, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. Radi, but how would you explain these miracles to the audience at the end of the movie? You see, I'm slowly discovering the phone-mystery plot can not be important or relevant, so I concentrated to process only all potential phone-gimmicks possible. Phone jimmicks? What do you mean? You know, like wind blowing through the horn, a sharp dial tone, and walk around and turn around the table! Very original, Mr RD, but absolutely awesome and as an experienced manager, you must know that, ultimately, people expect a reasonable explanation for all of these events. Oh, but there! If I remember correctly, it's all with negative and unreleased power! It's all a bit unclear, I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Oh well, they always say, a good motion picture depends on more elements than the story. At least you've processed some of your regular trademarks, so that your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! I tried to know that the Lord has tried, but murders and bloodshed do not disappoint anyone! It's really sad, Mr RD, but what is sex? Everyone liked a good part of the sledge and nudity in their horror films and said that you center yourself in the dangers of a sexy fashion model! Yes but ?? But what, Mr. Ardi? Well, to tell the truth, we publish Charlotte Lewis's shot as cover on "Dial: Help" as a erotic thriller, but in reality the film has no sexuality and Charlotte has refused to be even helpless. Mr. RD! Now I'm really frustrated, it embarrasses people and lays them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just want everyone to "dial: help" to rent and love it! Well, I can comfort you to round up that every major director is a little wrong decision, without hurting his career immediately, but be careful next time and do some research first, okay. R.D? I will do; Thanks! Welcome you Say you have any ideas for upcoming movies? Yes, as a matter, I do! I was thinking of a gaoloke fierce washing machine! Is that sound impressive? Hello Hello
