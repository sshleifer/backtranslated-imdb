This film tries to be artistic but comes from Puerile as a film school student's first attempt. Later it tries to be a boyfriend but comes as weird as a virgin's first attempt. Finally, it tries to be cruel and chic, but apart from Kinski's acting - which is strong but quickly moved into amateur melodrama wrongly - it's almost as firm as your hand around wet noodle (this is an appropriate metaphor considering the non-boyfriend. ). It's in a blowjob scene, let's go to Sawgie's career - better than Lama's performance. Now run away when there is a chance. Instead of go find yourself a Victoria's secret undergarment catalog - it's more finely and more loving than this tripe.
