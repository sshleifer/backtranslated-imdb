WEBS is a fantastic kinky movie, although little watchable. Richard Greco plays an electrician who sucks mutant spiders, or some parallel earth like this. The film was created only with a decent budget, which explains limited people and a somewhat tiring playback that works very little with a very interesting generation. Essentially 90-minute episodes of the TV show "Sliders", and nothing else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and continuous review of other films)
