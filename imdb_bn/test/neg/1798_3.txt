The diagnosis of the disease in the "Darkness of Heart" was mostly not expected. Although based on the most educated and interesting texts in history, the film has become uninterrupted. The story does not move the viewer to grasp. It comes across only in a way lacking. <br /> <br /> The text traces are easily shown, but it is still not "heart of darkness" of Conrad. Benedict Fitzgeralds (who writes "The Passion of the Christ") uses the script as inspiration and thus becomes "the heart of the Fitzgerald". The movie is not only worthless, unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
