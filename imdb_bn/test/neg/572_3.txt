A movie about a mysterious love letter which puts a small city in her ear should be fun, romantic and easy to entertain. Instead of saying more about this movie and not expressing it, it reaches a level where you are grateful, even if the dialogue is not properly cited. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> But those two actresses are very welcome in a movie by screaming for some real people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is not completely successful. As I said above, the theme seems to be suppressed and I realize that it is a life and love element but I do not want to see a movie about it, at least not at all. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend that the very talented Cast who is left to live for themselves.
