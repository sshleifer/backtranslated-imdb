It is only one of the hundreds of movies where the directors try to keep too much drama in a movie which is not dramatic. Like love at the beginning, the part where the monk dude throws an arrow in his own hands, then he shot the hole in the hole after five minutes - there is no sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot line is CGI, which will be widely contested by a homemade flash movie. Actors seem to be working hard to showcase the 70's robots; The conversation makes it so fun that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> A lot of things have happened, how or why, such a woman suddenly stopped before a few hours, without any explanation that they roam in a zoo. And when he is flying on this thief, his first reaction is to take a picture rather than ten minutes later - his walk-like life (even not moving) - depending on him, obviously, it is not. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not recommended. I still wish they were working on MST3K new episode.
