Oh dear, oh dear. When low-budget, non-pointless matter is popping up interesting names among buyers, trying to look attractive to credit, it really falls on my nerves, involving everyone in only the smallest, most vulnerable possible roles. In this film, we have Richard Leinch in one scene, a short look from Martin Kov, a short spot for Vernon Wales, a little more time for John Philip Lyr and a little time for Karen Black. Random Link and Karen Black Some scenes of this scene raise some smiles with their appearances, and basically it is very painful, because none of the original cast is very good. I could not help, but it seems that if films were to be taken to film a movie with a movie, then it would be very good, but since the film has never achieved much, some small visual scenes of entertainment can be seen. My opinion in the original cast was only charitable or preferred performance by Steve Weststell, Excel and his girlfriend I believe that I played by Alina Madison (she never heard of before but there are some measurements on her screen and this is a good look). In this case, the intrigue is easy, the evil exposed mine goes after those who are interested in stealing his gold, and it should be good for the slasher fun, especially it is specially managed by John Carl Buechler, which has special effects for many of these three main slash franchises ( Halloween, Elm Street, and Friday 13th) and the type of films that work on small gemstones like mesolium. Unfortunately, the film is sadly lacking in mystery, likability and satisfaction. There is one or two light moments, but there is nothing to try to watch the film, I will not say. In fact, along with the above mentioned Cosmos, this entire film is very old and characterized, which can not be quickly closed enough for the unfortunate lack of interest to me and a genuine interest. I did not find it funny even on the idea of ​​a bad movie, which is rare for me, because I love very nasty movies. I want to say, to avoid.
