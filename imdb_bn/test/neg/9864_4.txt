As long as you remember that the production of this movie was a copyrighted Paul and it is not intended for a serious release, it is surprising that it is not terribly awesome. I love even the theme music. <br /> <br /> And Joel (or Mike) and MST3 have never shouted for any treatment of the boat, it is! Watch it with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and for a good time you can. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So perhaps knowing enough enough to repeat good luck. <br /> <br /> and see my favorite part .... Where Dr. Dr. FF says that he has 12 hours to comply with his wishes ... and he really does "12" with his finger .... It's like "Evil Shame Street" .... .... Whoa boy <br /> ... And of course Mrs. Storm is declaring "Just look at you .. .. Fantastic Four" is just so impressive .... you will laugh, you'll cry ..... <br /> <br /> So if you love schl√§ky Sci-Fi Here, it is fantastic for you!
