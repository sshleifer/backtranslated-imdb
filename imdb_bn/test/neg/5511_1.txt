I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (of course, not sure). When I saw this at the local dollar theater at the age of 11, and it was so violent that I almost went; I think I did not understand that one was released before the end of the movie. Anyway, I thought I saw the biggest movie that I grew up. I can finally give it a rating rating. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (that was strangely satisfactory)
