It is difficult to compete against classic goodness, but once you choose that choice and you have to find the best and brilliant resources to keep your product top drawer and quality cut edge, once the decision has come to an end. Your motive is to target the second or third (or fourth) best, even why try? I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and circulated. I will ask the producer, "What do you think? Are you trying to create a deficit?" Perhaps the producers thought, "We want to test this biblical story from another perspective ..." then I would say, "OK, I saw the show, now what's the point of view?" The scenario of this "possible perspective theory" eludes me. I can usually see the program, and at least (at the right or the wrong) get a sense of what the manufacturers are trying to accomplish. So not here, here. I recognized the names of "Robert Halmi" (producer) and I can combine with some interesting products in his eyes; Tinn Man, Earthusius, Flash Gordon, Jason and Argunts. Imagination, low budget entertainment based on history and comic book entertainment. A perfect section for sci-fi channels. So I still have to ask Robert Hally ... "What were the ten commandments, what do you think?" Unity FJS
