Ivan the Terrible is a more illustrated stage game than a "Big-Screen-Amass". Citizen Why - Similar ways in many ways - The opposite is the opposite (as we expect such a rental) For example it has many locations shooting. <br /> <br /> Acting means the character's motivation and audience thought; If you are able to understand the character then how is it done? And considering how much less action can be taken, how can the story affect the story and thus what are the characters and decisions other than 'exaggerated movement'? <br /> <br /> As well there is a historical level why the acting style should not be surprised. The emergence of the proletarian rule of Germany and the USSR forced the filmmakers to lag behind for those who knew the movies. Since access to more modern works by showing the evolution and techniques of their movies, they used to know only what they knew. <br /> <br /> The Nazi control of the government in Germany was destroyed by the Great German film industry of the 1920s. That's their total control over the film industry. And the campaigners can only "entertain" the German soldiers; Therefore, the popular German silent films of the 1920s were needed. So many Yan the horror film tricks provided to movie crews such as German films (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There is no confusion and personally found it too hyped, it is by no bad movie experience - and definitely not in bad film ever. The acting is fine, and the excellent part of cinematography (even today's standard; more down). Of course do not flush a popcorn; Nobody can keep his brain out of this door. Most likely and very emblematic date - If you can not watch movies by closing down the lights of the house, you can see it on the big screen, because most of the cinematic elements of these films will be lost in B & D experience. <br/> WARNING: SPEAKER: Do not read the comments below, if they affect the personal view of the film, <br /> <br /> <br /> ... and if there is a clear communist propaganda (opposing capitalist propaganda) Does not) think so. How does Stalin himself see for Ivan - clearly in the direction of the film's direction (see other comments) - and anyone in the world who clearly understand the historical awareness of the world outside the US perspective. Probably the former avatar of Ivan Stalin, or maybe not; Stalin and his motivation, decision, loneliness, propaganda of lack of it compared to Yane's true historical record - it uses Ivan's personality. Also note the obvious use of the special colors of singles: For red (for USSR) banquet views. And probably in the blue (in the US) the time when specific shots we wear? <br /> <br /> But there are many wonderful scenes such as the use of shadows, or the exotic shots of the public, Ivan Return Moscow.
