When small rocky cities of Texas started rocketing from government exams on the effects of cosmic rays on animals, people started to die. County Sheriff tried to investigate but other government officials were interrupted by his efforts. It shows that there are a mutant space gorilla on the victims of flood victims. <br /> <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like giant movies. So I thought that this movie would be a great opportunity. Sadly, I'm not. <br /> <br /> I do not think of bad acting, a little dialogue, a brutal musical score or a giant plot hole in this movie. There are many movies I have seen and enjoyed in similar bad ways. <br /> <br /> But there is a terrible pacing where one type of night and night brotherhood is different from the different night. And it drags that due to that. There are some scenes that are just going on and nothing is happening - searching the wood for the formula; Only people have been walking in the jungle for a long time; There are several seemingly endless dance teenagers in a group of woods ... but nothing is going to be interesting. If these scenes were small, the film was not annoying (though I do not think that these scenes will save only those saved). <br /> <br /> Now I've given this movie three facts to ensure that I gave it a chance before slamming this review. Sadly, it has gotten worse with each watch. The fourth will not be.
