OK, so not every Australian movie is all good. Yes, there are probably very few with merit. Anyway, an absolute bomb, qualified as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted to like it. I figured I'd like it to go a fair. I even saw one of the screenwriter Dave O'Neal, so I think this film is a traitor to give a bad review, but ... ... the plot is fairly thin (I do not bother about it ... read the synopsis), which I can forgive: There are plenty of movies that can be bound by some of the coolest jokes. Unfortunately, Away of Jokes puts his plot in the form of $ 2 prostitution skirts. Probably the only ridiculous movie that came from 6 people came in poor performance and dialogue. Go away like a week-old egg sym ... If you see this movie then the joke can understand but the joke is not worth it.
