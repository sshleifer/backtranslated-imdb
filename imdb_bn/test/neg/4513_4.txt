As a fan of Miss Francis, it was so much excited to be ready to play on TV. As long as I did not see it ... how this movie is a major example of important casting and how to manage such a crucial part in understanding the purpose of management. Casting a central role is such that for the production of such a series, the program ... is entirely dependent on the full actor Carissa as the anthem and La Mancha. And in this movie's cast, the whole thing was destroyed by the filthy castings of Malista Gilbert's main role. Mrs. Gilbert did not even come near the single moment, the sensitive, mature soul of Allen Gilbert was "white-bread" throughout the film ... I was just reading Aussie's most hunting line while reading: "I still believe in spite of everything, the heart of man really Good "- this is said by Miss Gilbert, that there is a lack of conviction, so that he is well-spread and one Can achieve. Effect The legendary merge champion of the film and dance was the conversation coach for this generation - his salary will be paid back! Even after destroying the Miss Gilbert deir, other performances are mostly satisfactory, especially the young Plathite with Edith, Scott Jacoby Peter and Clive Rebel. Especially as DOSEL. Macmillian Shell's Stage and Film (Joseph Silkarkut) is not the soul as deep spirit and spirit as the role-maker, but he's okay. Denis Roberts and James Koko The Van Dances are relatively diverse in their part - they are shrinking and bombarding, but again on the page only. Due to this, the project's passage has spread too much (mentioned in the previous post) - this film is seen in less than 45 minutes of watch in the film version - due to the dramatic effects breaks, the difference is apparently required for the story-appropriate MOOD promotion. This is not particularly for young people who are first learning about Anne - in the original version of the movie and even better, ANN Frank's TV production: The real story of the actor acting on Ben Kingslaw, whose last thing is Annie's status, heartbreak and capturing reality! Note: Especially uncomfortable is that Martial, who plays Anne's sister Margit, is not included in Open Credits with other members of Secret Anxiety ... she is starring with Mephe, listed on post-credits with actors. And m Crawler If I was Mrs. Marshall, then I would have sued!
