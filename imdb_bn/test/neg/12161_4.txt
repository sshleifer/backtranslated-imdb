I went to see this picture because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both were trying to look at our watch before the end of the movie, so that we could see more that we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it's It is divided almost equally into battle scenes (about a dozen, all less or less interchangeable), and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> If someone thought that the son of a small tribal chief, half of the world's victory over this matter, has been relatively easy to plot plotting. There is a fair bit of raw material to make a fairly good story there. However the author fluffed it completely. We get no real history. We get a Hollywood version instead of that. <br /> <br /> How strong is Tarjajin among young people - to the end, or do they think - the trouble? Why love for a good love <br /> <br /> <br /> How does he get out of jail? Well, an old monk, who recognizes her natural goodness and glory, takes this good woman across the continent as a sharp person who symbolizes her love for Temu√±a, to find her enough to find her dead because she is there There, talisman in his hands. And of course he goes away and, (inadvertently), becomes rich and powerful, rescues him. <br /> <br /> How does she escape from the chain? Well, he went to the temple of great wolf gods and goddesses (or some names) and Tengri released him with magic. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> Why would he want to be ruler of Mongolia? Naked-God again, apparently, apparently To know the infinite Tamuzin, and - Surprised! Surprise! - He gets it. "Law," he says to himself. "What is the need of Mongol, law, good, easy ones." Golly, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And then finally, how did he win decisive battles against his rival's more powerful force? Good tactics, of course, but again with the help of the old wolf wolf, who sent a storm to the height of the war. All the soldiers flashing like thunder and lightning (Molongs are afraid of thunder, you see) - but not our temudin. The soldiers became completely brave, praised by the king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what people are doing to make such garbage. The interesting thing is that it is divided into all kinds of radioactive reality: Sleeping plenty of milk, dirt and violence. It seems that the producer of this movie wants to get the little things done properly so that the viewers do not see how big things are children. <br /> <br /> The graphic closing up is in violation of: slashings bleeding, blood fungus, blood cloud - Bloody people really spend a lot of time. Despite the reality, it is impossible to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I must mention the ultimate fight of the satiric CGI final war. No one can think of these things realistic look of how out of me. They do not. Oh, and all of it are exciting panorama for Hollywood style-spectacular scenery and all of the super-close-up stadium stuff stuff in battle scenes. And the super-sound effects of the standard Dolby whips and thumps and constant low frequency tension. <br /> <br /> tired Avoid <br /> <br />
