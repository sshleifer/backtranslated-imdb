Director Dr. David Michael Laties director H. Yes. Just a little less average than Welsh's 'War of the Worlds', it's not too bad to think that it can work with the budget - just $ 1 million. For this budget, the production price was not very bad - its best part was visual impact (I was totally influenced by CGI considering the budget) and the sound design. The story of this movie is very short-lived (but again it was due to their budget - features had to prolong the specific scenes to create for 97 minutes), acting (because there was no story to work with the actors again) Very few exceptional camera shots and music. However, again, I can let negative parts go mostly because the film was made for a little budget and still had good production value. Nevertheless, you must see to see how low budget versions of World War I can be made with errors. 10 out of 4
