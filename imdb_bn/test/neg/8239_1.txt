I sat while watching this episode and looked at the clock and started to grow. Suddenly I thought they were going to give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. The whole family roams around some Christmas trees like Hallmark Channel, then becomes pale black. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the end of one of the poorest seasons. There is nothing to create any tension for the coming season. As the next season to be seen in any kind of encouragement, the suspicious nugget suggested by Agent Harris was a sub sandwich scramble that New York is interested in getting boys in New Jersey. Wow, really? I would never expect anything from mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It seems like they are trying to lose interest. Plot lines that they started have disappeared from a show I have never seen. They are annoying and pointing but rarely give anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They will throw in front of us and wade, nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> /> <br /> And what are the dosage of drug addiction with Christopher? What are we going to tolerate? Please, arrest him or make extra money or something interesting. <br /> <br /> It was one of the few shows I was looking forward to but now forget it.
