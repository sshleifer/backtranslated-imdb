I could not hear the soap girl, but I saw a poster with a five-star review from Film Threat outside the theater so that I think, how bad can it be? Well, I did not find it soon. This picture of my god was awful. The most wooden actors I've ever seen outside of a porn flick Absolutely compromise dialogue I did not understand how it was made and why someone agreed to be part of it. And I found it completely unacceptable that it was actually being shown in a theater and charging money to visit it. How is it ????? And most importantly what was the GUY from thinking of film Threat?!?!?!?!
