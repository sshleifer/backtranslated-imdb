This movie was frustrating for at least two reasons. The mystery created by the terrible lack of lack of direction in the direction of the director or lack of direction has not disappeared. I do not know it was like a delicious bubble of wheat which appears to come out of the smell but you keep chewing it because it's a great one. Like most thrillers, the promise of a hatahicaker was still a failure to reach me when it was in my eye with bright eyes and ready to down the volume. (I was watching the movie alone in the dark) this so-called thriller transformed into just something else in Lego. It just went out of the gas and kept me unexpectedly in a style movie like an exceptional TV. This was probably the rating.
