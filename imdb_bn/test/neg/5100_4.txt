River Queen tries to pack a complex, sweeping, historical story in just two hours. Some exciting battle scenes and Wanganui scenery are nicely captured. However, the film suffers from some poor lead - feudal Morton (Sarah) came across as particularly helpless. It seems reluctant about how the role should be played - as a firm, determined character with a helpless wif or a clear view of his destiny thrown by luck. Character of Kifar Suchrland - Private Dowell - for the pointless and for the most part - unknown. The caf√©ar Irish bog needs some polishing. On the other hand, Clifber Curtis, Temura Morrison and Ravri Pane (Sarah "son" as son ")" were well rounded and credible. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the Rani River became particularly narrow. It seemed as though they decided that they would finish all loose 120 minutes ago. For example, how did Warmu know how Sarah and Daleel all over the world? There is no explanation and very unhappy <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an open mind. I did not read or heard far away from its annoying production. What I experienced was a spice mash in New Zealand history, beautiful pictures but finally frustrated.
