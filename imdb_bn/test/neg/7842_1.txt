A commentator says that if you like Austin, you would love this movie. I liked getting Autone and I was frustrated with this movie. The film works hard, probably very difficult for laughs. Perhaps all the volumes of this movie were shouting that it sounds funny to scream. I got where I was trying to go with this flick Zoro and Scarlett have a cross in the pingere but it does not work. Austin Powers was a stupid but intelligent, hard-hitting Blade Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin's lack of intelligence. <br /> <br /> I waited to laugh and I was waiting for anyone to wonder whether this manuscript. My 15 year old girl also thought the film was flat. My 17-year-old man chose this flicker on this title, after 20 minutes went out. <br /> <br /> It seems like many people have this picture of IMDB, but for me it is a good comedy good time or a lack of jokes. .
