And probably I did not see it! <br /> <br /> But looking at Caste, I see that the Dog Master has returned from the dead, I know now it will be like a plug! When I think that the audience is stupid that they are not going to catch the flaws of success, I hate it, because I think that all of Hollywood, producer, writer, director or above. A big giant coming back to a brain dead dog, what do you say? <br /> <br /> I can not believe that someone like Louis Gosset, Junior will return something like that. <Br /> <br /> Did Jason Godric deny that? Well, I hate to say it, but if he took the role again, then it was a mistake of the same continuity. I bet (if he really turned it down), he must incredibly die that his character died in the second film. <br /> <br /> I'll probably catch it on some channels by accident in the air by night, but in no way I'm going to rent this DVD or DVD!
