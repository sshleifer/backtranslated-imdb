I have sold this DVD and bought it without the second thought, even after it is known, it is always one of my favorite books. As soon as I went home I found myself completely disappointed to see it raced. Although it is true that this movie is based on some books, similar matches. Characters are changed (i.e., the Finn seems to be more terrible blurred than any other, where the jin appears in some parts of the mountain), the scenes are shifted incorrectly or completely changed (such as lapar), absence of many letters and absence of famous lines / thought. The movie tries to portray some of the feelings of the previous feeling, but it does in an outstanding way that creates flat boring movies. This is the depth of character and sentiment that makes the book such a classic and takes the movie and completely destroys them.
