It's just a bad film. R.I.C.C.O. As bad as it is. But bad. It got me completely lost after me got begun. Then the path was closed then way off. Do not watch this movie away, trust me with all my heart !!!! Brothers who are brothers are not the next Hughes brothers, who made really big films from Dead Presidency, Hell, American Pimps and Men's II Society. The only person who saw me play Paris Campbell, who would be a great actor, if one day made better films. Christian Caperlaw did a great job for what he got. I hope FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece!
