Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who has created some private vietnam Vietnam to return to Laos and retrieved some Americans as listed for rescue. Hackman suspects that, in fact, half a dozen or so MIA secretly being tortured by the Laotiatiers and kept in remote camps for more hard work. Hackman is richly blessed by Robert Stack, whose son is also believed to be among MIAs like Son of Hackman. But the situation is that Hackman can manage to purchase old and outdated weapons only, although he has led a communist Lowitian and his two daughters to take the help route. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie was deliberately promoted to support the myths of Vietnam, which still holds our MIAs for promotion. The myths were real enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIA I think, instead, this movie was partially created to finance the myth. It was irrational in his face. Why will our former enemies refuse Mia return? Campaign? Where is the promotion price that is kept secret? To add labor supply? Vietnam and Laos do they need one hundred extra workers? Objectives behind this movie - with its winning music and high body calculations - was frustrating. <br /> <br /> But how about the movie itself? Preventing its theme for the rescue of mythological abuser MIA, it was a regular semi-military worker, more than a few dozen good and bad in the 1980's. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep his head above water. He is only always reliable. <br /> <br /> In the other, this is a formulaic plot from The Dough Dosage, I tried to assume that any group would sacrifice themselves for this mission. Among the three Communist Asians, I had one or more dead meat. That is why Asia's helpers appeared in such films. (I was correct twice between three people.) I see Patrick Swazi as Rooku's former officer, who is the youngest in the group, who has never earned "respect" to others because he has never seen a war, he must also go to some heroic mode. Wrong He survived a hero, true, but intact. I thought Hackman would have to go fifty or fifty, but he's okay. The formula does not really stretch for fundamentals. Clostrofobic power from Charles Branson's "The Great Aquate" is a cluster in the former tunnel of Passwi Fred Ward, in which a snake is forced to crawl with a snake pipe, so that he can reconsider the Laotian Pau camp. <br /> <br /> The title, "Excellent Valor", is a tribute to Admiral Nimitz Yo Jim√© made to men - "Great courage was that day." Nimitz certainly was right about that. Remote to the point that the men fighting in Vietnam were equally brave Anyone who saw the war or even came closer, had the courage to put their lives in line for the boys for the line beside them. The film does not really judge the way it uses our bitterness about Vietnam and Vietnam.
