Alexander Maria Lara: A very nice and enticing woman, but not a good actress. In all the pictures I saw him, he would appear to me as the exact same character. Find out if it's available at the top of downfalls, drama, bombs and now you're upset! He always plays (plays) young, well-established woman, who is a little naive and does not know what will happen to him. He probably worked with plenty of five different facial expressions in a repertoire settlement. I personally believe in a difficult time that he can play a mysterious and little objectionable character because it is not here. So she is a nice girl next to the typestast, which she is, but again, she does not get lost while acting. Til Schweiger: The same thing! Films: Cruel Fools. This was a great role for Adam Sandler as an American film, which I do not like. I displeased that it was a movie with people suddenly, I thought that jokes were not funny at all. I shuckled twice or thrice but when I was half through, I was just bored and annoyed and wanted to finish this flick.
