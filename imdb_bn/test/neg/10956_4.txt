This is an entertainingly bad B movie. In fact it really is a much better quality than B movies. It was a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I saw bad acting. Zombies were great, clearly this was the Romero zombies, and was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously not the Oscars, and if you are not in the zombie movies or not in B-movies, then you probably will not be able to enjoy it, but if you like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main Clint Eastwood Western Character guy is quite good, although they do not really explain how clearly he can cure himself from gunshots and zombie bite. But if his dialogue is more than a line, his bad performance is really clear. <br /> <br /> It was good, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he ever saw it.
