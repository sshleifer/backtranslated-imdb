1994's Heart of the Darkness Film Film was not able to live up to outstanding books. This picture had unnecessary scenes that wanted to mislead the viewers, instead of understanding them to help them. The director was definitely not experienced, and if he does, then he does not show it. Above, the book's scenes were removed or changed, the scenes were rather important. The film made me indifferent and my time was completely waste. They did not have the idea of ​​how the characters were playing, and the actor Marlowe and the rest did not publish the publication of this book. Overall, the film was terrible and there was a lack of mystery that otherwise it was necessary to remotely make it attractive.
