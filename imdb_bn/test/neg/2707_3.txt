The laughs in this sunny movie are low and far, and I can not help but amazed about how this mess was created in the first place. The genius of Griffin Dunn is about the only good thing in this movie, but his best efforts are easily overtaken by Madonna's objectionable performance. I was able to sit through this disturbed fit, but probably this time-waster I'm pretty fantastic that can say.
