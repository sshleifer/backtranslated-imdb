Consider "I Know All" Action Hero is lighting a cigarette in the dark. Although the bad guys try to hide. (Perhaps I come here to give a signal light) <br /> <br /> This is a scene you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the comedy section.) <br /> <br /> Fearless instruction, scary script, bad acting, cheap special effects (They used a tunnel so that they could play in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (which also led me to look at that kind of error)
