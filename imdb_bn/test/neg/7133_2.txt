People can say I'm strict but I can not help it. The movie was so bad that I was absolutely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you asked me. It was extremely hilarious and stupid but despite this one, scary scenes, there is a serious ass-stupid story. They actually went deep into Keayako's past investigations and found out that his mother (who miraculously spoke in English) was a wonderful and "feeding" evil spirit to his daughter. Stupid? Yeap. All right, it started with Kayako, a common housewife, who was somewhat nervous and was killed. This part is still okay. At this moment of anger, he became a vengeful spirit, who killed someone who entered his house. Acceotable Now, his assassination began to grow a bit, where he actually had the chance to fly across Tokyo to end his prey. (His victims were traveling, did not they?) It hit me hard. Now if a ghost could actually do anything that would not pay the public transport rent without traveling to the whole country, I do not think so. Someone ask me * then snorts * kill me To give crown on everything, the ghost was once shown as a vengeance (Ju-on: The Grange, which was better than this trash) is now portrayed as a few viewers who really enjoy themselves and feel that it is their mission in the mission of the people. The events became worse (for me, the visitors) when the ghosts were coming in large size of hair. I mean, ??? If ghosts have such power, then I drown my mind seriously. I really do not like movies that portray ghosts because they are not. The overall results are just plain bad. Like love 2. With a good story and less ambitious, this show has been good
