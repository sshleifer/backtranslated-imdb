This photo is a bit more than ersatz Verhoeven. Filming is supposed to be telescopic, but simply sick. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes, which is replaced by a story which thinks itself seriously. Brechtian breaks for the existence of advertising brakes are tedious, even painful; Undoubtedly there was no real intention to render this film Brechtian, it's just like what happened in an accident. If you want to watch reality TV parody, then see celebrity demographics - this is great and intelligent and most important. I rarely felt pain while watching a film. Avoid like a rabid rabbit.
