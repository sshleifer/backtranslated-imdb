I saw "professional" reviews Julia Roberts claiming herself "shiny and very funny". I do not think so. Actress playing herself? And when he tries a comedy trying to do it with his usual head? Hollyweird narcissism talk about it on the absolute. Why does not he stand there, "I, me, me. Look at me!" The director and author should be shot to think of something better so that it can be a charming seagull. And Steven, the story is your problem when the audience starts to pay more attention to the weird camera angle. Cappra, Hitchcock, used all the creative cameras, but they were talented enough to lose viewers or not just close the camera. You seem to have forgotten a basic rule of making movies called "Styles". Pit and Zeta Jones chemistry are quite good, but perhaps, if they make the film more concentrated around them and it is disputed with disrespect, it can work. Again Jetto Jones showed how much more talent and beauty he was and Roberts had a dream. Unfortunately, this film spoils talent and fails in many accounts. I want my money back.
