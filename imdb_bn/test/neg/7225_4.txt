There is nothing but turmoil, a happy, but good for those who know eighty, annoying for those who are not interested in it. There is no screenplay in this film, but a hero arriving in the full-fledged underground New York of the aristocracy and night clubs. It is aimless, vain and naive. But not completely unpleasant.
