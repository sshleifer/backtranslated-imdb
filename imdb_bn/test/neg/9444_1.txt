Ed Wood, perhaps the worst movie producer of all time, has left us gems which are very bad, they are happy, weirdly funny and so cruel and innocent. <br /> <br /> James Lane and his financial person (mother and father, it seems to be from credit), created in a weakly-produced film like 'Ed Wood', 'Dreamland', but there is no lack of charm or innocence. . Dreamland is easily bored, and the only good thing about this 90-minute waste is to make sure that James Lay and his colleague Purpe will not make another picture again. <br /> <br /> I must have taken some time for the crew to join this horror film with some dramatic scenes. I am sure the production director, once seen the completed movie, his name demanded to be converted to credits in accounting of 'Donna Snartbott' and 'Brutus'. At the end of a shooting day, the crew can imagine his 'brutus' by paying a $ 5 bill. <br /> <br /> I will not mention a lot of technical problems with these small video tapes, but I must mention that some of the comparisons of this comparison with David Lynch You know when you log in to your mother's IMDB and post such a wonderful BS - nobody can save a violent psychiatric patient, forgetting some 'dreamland' - something that is produced by Lynch. What is horrible about Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to the film, Mr. Leigh
