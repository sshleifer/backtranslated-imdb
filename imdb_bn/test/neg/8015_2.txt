I hired it because I could not afford to see the pre-Hollywood-fame Clive Wayne and Kathryn Zeta Jones together, but it was certainly not worth it. They give two stars instead of one after another, because they see their innovation before they grow up across the pond. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The greatest theme in the world, horror. Oven seems to be really uncomfortable to be such a turkey, plus she wear a ridiculous, severely sick-chin-length wig (at least I hope that a wig and her real hair does not). And where he sees the joke of a country with Jeta Jones, so you feel embarrassed for that. Joan Plowright wanders through the whole movie - perhaps thinking of how he got himself in such a zombie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, and the writing stinks too.
