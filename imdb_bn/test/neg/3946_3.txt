This movie was not very good in my opinion. Although half an hour is not complete waste (thankfully I do not have to pay $ for it), it was not too scary. There were some parts where I was jumping and seeing some violent / violent scenes, but only a single person would be scared of this scary. <br /> <br /> Overall writing and performance was very weak. Character does not improve or increase as people. Even in the end, the main man, whatever his name, was not up to the people and was recovered from the fire in the last minute. The plot was also inconsistent. The police officer who was killed as he did not die. The girl mentioned in October that to kill the evil giant lady you had to read something from the right text. Funny they did not bother that how and still managed to escape. Malcolm-in-mid-middle child dies in the game but did not die in "real life" Also, playing the game itself was very weak writing. It was right for brother's death, just to play them again. But you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and before you play 3 people die ... why do you even need to play? If you like movies like ring and watch its scary and fun things, this movie. If you know someone, you can see it smiling, do it. If you like the "horror" movies that make you laugh loudly and have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do that. Otherwise, stay away far.
