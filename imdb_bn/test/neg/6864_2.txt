The film was printed on the celluloid waste. It's a crushing scene, much like a particularly awful train debris. <br /> <br /> It is like explaining the explanation of life's life. The main plot point is the character played by Steve Gutenberg, a party animal that is not gambling, because it will violate its parole. The kids refused to play with him as coach, because he gambles. But ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a large amount of money saved their shelter. And where do they get the money? Gambling !!! Add these wonderful scenes to the funeral home (why the funeral home is home-bedroom?) And in vain peripheral character
