I like Arnold, and I love the subject, but it's a very frustrating movie. When I first saw the preview, they were dark and evil and Arnold's name was not mentioned. But I recognized him, who led me to believe that he was making a movie that is a more serious, suspicious mood. This was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit, most of it is pretty good!). He, so far, had to avoid the movie with no real religious theme. And I was excited. I was roasted. It's just another action, explosion, gun fire movie. And it's a pretty bad one.
