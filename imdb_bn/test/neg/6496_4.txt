Most critics write devastating about Micklevill, but I wanted to see myself. And, unfortunately, they are right. The greatest budget of all time in the history of Russian film, two international stars, colorful mass scenes were apparently very close to the Kremlin - but in the end it does not seem to be a beautiful, sweet thing. You do not believe that this director has done a wonderful work like Ugarah and Barn by Sun before. The characters do not believe in characters, Jane, McCracken or not Arden. The only general Radlov mentioned. It always leaves the surface. Politically it is the glory of the army for me, especially the Russians, like a respect and duty. And, living in Siberia for at least half a year: My daughter Michchovs is much more than the one pictured in the movie. A question-10-point-movie director, "Forest by the Sun" as a director, I was totally disappointed with the best I saw in my whole life. Sorry Yet, there are still unique talents Michalkovs supplying amazing beautiful pictures.
