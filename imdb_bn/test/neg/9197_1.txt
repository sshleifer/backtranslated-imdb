Sorry, maybe this is part of the wave of firearms from 911, perhaps it's an old fairy tale, perhaps it's not meant to stop your socks, but sorry, this movie is awful. As the title, Cliché 49, I think at least that there are many clichés. It's a fiery story (wonderful management of dangerous fire to manage to be dangerous when fire and life is protected) about a fireman. And her daryary life, a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style. We started the film with the hero of the collision of a collapsed burning building. This film is about trying to love this guy, so we will get some tears when we meet the end of the scene from the beginning of the film to the end of the scene. I found it wanted to care and went went up into it smoker. Clichés such as the death of the best friend, the love of the first site, the awakening of the new job, the firstborn, the dangerous husband to the husband, the character / the higher the father, 2 2.4 children (well 2 but very close enough), sacrifice your life to save others, reward for bravery ... etc. It's every fireman's life, every police officer, nurse, doctor in some way. It was lazy, if his death was meant to be 'life shining in front of his eyes', then God can help the poor chap, I was surprised that he did not scream too much for smoking. Flashbacks are mostly dumb and predictable, played slowly, and a soundtrack that could put shy cows out of business, it was very impressive, it was exactly like a muzak or copyright free elevator! All expenses will be avoided until Sunday's meeting is needed to meet the growth. Or maybe it's related to your firefire - warning - your life will end up terribly, or if you're a brave firearm in the film then you'll be mad at life. Unless your John Trivola (one of the weird Velcro Style hair !!)
