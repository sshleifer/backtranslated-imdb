Wow, pretty amazing that some of these bad things can actually be made. I give this movie 2 because it is so bad that it has a specific "car break" appeal. Its so ridiculous and it has a certain entertainment value. Plus there are strange nudity and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start? The acting is beyond horror, it is like shooting a high school game like you. Theresa Russell must have done something a bit worse for her compulsion to make this movie, and her performance reflects how happy she is in the middle of this zodiac. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just a stupid FBI agent, as Dan Kurtz's cast is a piece in pieces. His acting actually laughs loud to me. <br /> <br /> Screenshot and C for instructions. Cartney Joyner and Mark L. Leicester should be taken out and shot.
