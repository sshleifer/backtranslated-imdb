I never got to accept a signal from 'Gone with the Wind' that I was humiliated and angry. It reveals, I have no problem with the quality of these actors or actors. The genius of the talented people whose talent is wasted on this piece of garbage. This book and the film surrounding the movie can only be used in vainness. I think it will be reduced to Hollywood's misleading movies. I do not believe that the favorite characters created by Margaret Mitchell should be soil by other writers' ideas and explanations. Film and book publishing and film making should be on the list of the worst concepts in the world. The sad thing is that people are actually making money off this tripe.
