Today's date is the worst piece I've ever seen. Even annoying I even complained about blockbuster for stocking it. I and some friends looked at the back cover and thought that we were for a very horrible movie. Plot line seems to be changing in movie time and there were many irrelevant padding. The film is astonishing, I guess they are running from the film. The sound quality was terrible and even though the first female character had a very Spanish accent, even though he spoke silly foolish. The man offered a short bit of eye candy until he tried to kill him. After always losing time to discuss the workshop and its many power tools, he wants to keep a plastic bag on his head. Among all the other ideas I think you have to believe that this movie really exists.
