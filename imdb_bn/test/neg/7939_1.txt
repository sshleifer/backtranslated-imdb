This is probably the longest, longest time I've seen the worst movie. Do not forget to do any research related to Detroit (the suburbs of Detroit Forest! Bovah !! !!). The writing was terrible, the premises were completely impossible, and quite obviously, the letters were shameful. For my life, I do not understand why seasoned actors will be so low and take part in some of the horror of this god. Now, I have never seen the original and the film does not respect its true form. It is my understanding that the original Detroit was not set. Why they will be separated without elaborate details about this setting, just tell me that more than the cast that they wanted to pay. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this junk, unless you are in Detroit and want some comic relief.
