While watching "The Last Days", I realized that filmmakers are probably trying to create this unique feature for this Hollywood action film. They have failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried to manage this time instead of slowing down another flat-action film. He darkened the light and added a lot of blood and tried to enter the film into the atmosphere. This method might work correctly (see "Se7en") but here it seems like just a cheap strategy and trying to scare us. Hyams offer a few more here than a decent action director, and basic shoot-outs and here scenery, lacking, except for the "parallel" end / x finishing. As a photographer, Hayam shows real power, shows some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing but hard work. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Andrew Marlow is the greatest enemy of this movie. In some areas the script actually shows the writings of good religious thrillers, and sometimes it shows some spiritual intellectual thoughts (prompt scene between Arnold and Gabriel Veyron), but these small plates drown by the banks of the Negative River. Generic dialogs / characters, plot holes, and grapping advantageous plot points that indicate all the characters in the right direction, only some of Hollywood's black pores are Marlowe's screenplay. The shadows of good movies can be faded very quickly. <br /> <br /> This picture is surprisingly good. Arnold, still holding bigger than life, tried to frustrate the end policemen, not more than the average results. Strange hero Arnie stick, it's what you do well Gabriel Byron brings a nice wind of atrocities in the role of Satan, the strong point of the group. A stray role for extremism firmly, Bayern restrains himself and adds more danger to the character. As normal Kevin Pollack was able to bring at least some chocolates in the film, but he did better. Also find a small minor role from Rod Steigerer. <br /> <br /> It looks like he is trying to isolate the unclear mass of these Hollywood action films. He was walking in the right direction, but there was no script or fundamental to write there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
