The United States AZN TV buys the rights to this movie and the network uses it with the English title The Pickpocket. <br /> <br /> 1997's PicPocket amateur home-movie style movie is unexpectedly amazingly amazing. The film depicts the long-winding series of an annoying, confusing people's annoying vaulting. This lead character, Xiao Wu, simply does not walk nicely.

According to The Pickpockets, the world is the world's most impressive unpleasant word, China. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The camera shake, shake and climb something. Finally, the camera still stays, but then it falls on the actor's knees and the crew understands anyone's misunderstanding and starts to hold the camera down again. Most cone films are made in remote, long, long, long shots. Several times if the camera is somewhat close, there is nothing compulsory to connect with the audience with an event. <br /> <br /> The photography is fuzzy, faded, and often vague. The color is used - well, there is no sign of intelligence of using color control. Most shots per 20 shots are held very long. It is painful to sit through a few movies. This picture is painful to watch, and painful to hear. And then it simply ends. <br /> <br /> John Wao fans can enjoy listening to DU XUE Soundtrack part of SHUANG XIONG (The Killer) because the lead character is hanging out of the video store for a few minutes. . However, be warned - PICKPOCKET will steal your good time.
