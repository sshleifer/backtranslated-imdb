Note to self. Sometimes do not see a serious movie with Charlie Shane. Great comedy, awesome seal. This movie considers the Navy as a helpless group of Rangers, when they are actually the most elite of the world's military. Charlie Shan helps to destroy the navy seal reputation. Thank you for making an incredibly selection group of people with one terrible appearance in the worst action movie I've ever seen. This is a great story that can be made in an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Shane? Here's the possibility for a very enthusiastic story, but Shane has decided to destroy them with their "funny" comments.
