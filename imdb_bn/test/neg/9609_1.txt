This show is not so much like to know where to start, it's hard to know. Unacceptable characters, terrible plot lines, terrible writings, and terrible acting. Do not even let me start with the unreasonable theme music. <br /> <br /> These shows have gone beyond contact with US viewers due to heavy Canadian references across the world. "Tell me Derek, would you go to Queen's College? How are you? We have to go higher." Uncensory, other shows are filmed for financial reasons such as the Stargate: Atlantis in Canada, but those shows may sound somewhat annoying (like Rodney a ZMM called a "z-pm"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's wind). I want to digest it for the same reason. Focusing on teenage life in Canada shows that the US does not translate well to the audience. <br /> <br /> This program should be canceled and the rest of the masters should be burned in the reactor.
