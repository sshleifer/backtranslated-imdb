Gordon Scott is the worst of all Tarzan's English in his well-curly hair, hourly images, and weird pidgin. As with other actors in this world, they are an equivalent with any fourth grade primary school drama class. I saw a car dealers used in TV advertising who could do a good job. They look like client Moore Lawrence Olivier! And where Jean (Blue Eve Brent) gets her lipstick and eyebrow pencil in the jungle? I have been made for this children's kids but wow! Plot line seems right but the director was more needed than his actor. I understand that there are some flaws in the film of the film Weasmullar, but it seems like a "low budget".
