This movie is saying to each other the urban legend to get extra in the microwave puddle and each other's chickens with the kids. Unfortunately, then it's going to introduce your basic mythology. The first one being about being a janitor with a bit of a secret. This one is okay well. Then it became worse that the next story about this kid is covered with the body of this goat, and it continues and continues. It does not start with long and long interesting ways. Then you usually get the shock scene and it ends. You need more than this in a mythical movie. You need at least three stories and should not be long, it has become especially uncertain, especially you can see how it ends a mile away.
