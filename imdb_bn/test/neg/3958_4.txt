This was probably intended as an "arty" crime thriller, but it failed in both numbers - there are few thrills and not enough substance. Pladding pacing makes it difficult to sit through and sometimes action scenes are edited very slowly and deliberately offers lots of losses. At least acting level is high. (**)
