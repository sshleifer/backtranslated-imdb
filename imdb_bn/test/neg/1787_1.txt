This movie is so unexpectedly bad that it is not worth seeing anything about it. No impact, no mystery and poor dialogue poorly distributed. Oh, and a camp or no fear holds it. Do yourself and see the real Friday 13th (or especially) the Slipway camp, but do not watch this movie as you do. <br /> <br /> Even the look of Michael Baer's in the beginning can not save it. Generally, in such movies, you expect violence, suspense, and little pride and some T & A. This violence was executed poorly, "mystery" was ridiculous, there was no gore and T & A was in plenty in the first 5 minutes, then nothing was done. At least one of these things, the appropriate creator could at least make it viewable. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing about it, Buck Flowers is awesome, he is the only person who realizes that he is creating sculls and hamming it properly. If the other tone was fit, the camp was fun, no pun intended.
