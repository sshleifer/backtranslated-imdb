I usually love tin / high school style flicks, but this image was largely lacking in originality. The only court in this movie is pressured by high school to cheat up their friend's four friends and their friendships. There is not enough depth in the story or the characters to draw attention to the audience for the full length of the film. The performances are not bad, though there is not much work to do with the actors like the tripe and clich√©. ... After watching this movie, one must think that no producer on earth can come across a project and think, "I have to make this film." It might not get rid of a theater. Andrew Gurland is a hack, to avoid or burn.
