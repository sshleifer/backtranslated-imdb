After reading many brilliant reports of 'To serve all my days', I went out and bought it for Christmas. Money wasted, I was afraid I was looking forward to seeing something in the same league like 'BrideHead Revisited' and some of the great productions of British television, but it is not neutral in them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Yes, this is his moment, but they are very thin in the ground. The main actor is attractive, mostly Andrew Andrews (Sebastian in Bridehead) because of his extraordinary similarities, only dark. But his unconditional talent is destroyed on a character, which is surrendered and confident. During the WW1, Somme impressed his prickiness on the impact of his experience. He concentrated in the earliest episodes centered around his nervous condition, after he was obviously better than playing clean, socialist do-gooder. <br /> <br /> Women are completely incredible, just as real. Her first wife is a hodge-podge of annoying chips and sticky, girlfriend, perfect sophisticated whore, and the latest female political sources. The most interesting character is Howarth (Alan McCannton) and one of the other masters named Hawthorne, I forgot the actor's name. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> By Episode 4 I just wanted to get through the burst thing. <br /> <br /> The music is equally exhausting, in most cases a musical piano tune and limited music span by a boy in limited time. There is no expense from location settings that will give some visual relief from the experience of otherwise excited vision. <br /> <br /> I like stories like this, as a rule, and I am very disappointed with this continuing trend. If you want to see something after the WW1 and its effects, there are far more vehicles to rent or buy. One that seems to be 'Unknown Soldier' ​​since 1998. The characters of the Masterpiece Theater Presentation are real and fascinating, and like 'two-sided dolls' are quite different to serve my days. 'Goodbye Mr Chips' or' Tom Brown's School 'for boys' school movies. <br /> <br /> I know this has gone against the general favorable view of this mini series, but I strongly recommend that before setting $ 80.00 in Acconi Media for their 4 DVD set, 2 discs were set in 2 discs on my set and frozen Inevitable problems with skipping.
