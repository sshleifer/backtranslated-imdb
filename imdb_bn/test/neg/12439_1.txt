Sometimes once I run into a movie that's so embarrassing bad I wonder why the movie exists. This is one of them. This annoying cartoon sounds, and footnote The Bad Fighter with Bad Conversation is a terrible attempt. Eddie is very annoying as Disney Tony, who runs a bizarre tweet family business at the request of his father Don (William Hickey). Tony, I said, an annoying little tweet. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is horrible daffy. It's very cartoon. What I'm trying to do is that you can not create parody of acclaimed plays like The Godfather. It does not work that way. Believe it or not, you will seriously take a parody of a dramatic movie. If you do not take it seriously, it will feel more like a parody. The thing about doing a parody is that you can not think too much like you're doing a parody. You seem to be taking at least a little bit of the movie seriously. Looks like they're just joking Woody Allen, and this makes this movie terribly terrible.
