This video has audio for anyone listening to their sleeping time. And the same thing can be said for the video. <br /> <br /> Is Morgan and his wife asking for a minimum wage to make it rough? With a camera rolling? And her little wifi-leg complaint? Give me a break. They are both wealthy They are filming their counterfeit $ 350 / month with $ 1,000 / month each video crew. <br /> <br /> I respected Morgan, but now it's nothing more than trying out his "30 Days" Experience to make fooling the audience of any volunteer. <br /> <br /> Morgan, you are being pictured for working 6.00 dollars an hour and you are making payments by helpless employers who do not see this big filming the whole thing in camera ?? And we do not think they are paying down the table?
