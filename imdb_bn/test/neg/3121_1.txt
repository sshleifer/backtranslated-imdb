It is difficult to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, even intellectual inquiries for the meaning of life were the general reactions of fashionable and physical comfort, clean clothes, hair nut, smog middle class chickens in the United States and Western Europe, the film was a stinker. Plots are a few of the former machines, a misomash (if it is the right Latin grammar); Acting is sometimes violent (along with men's limit as well as women) that contain broken DeadPen Straits; Catherine Dunnew (or some) of the subconscious aspect of breast is a buzzerauer commercial; The repetitive orchestral rehearsal of abandoned building is sure to be with the money of the director's mind, but I have thrown a stupid symbol in this silly film - I am disturbed because my time failed to see this scam. Excuses for an industry flick The scene is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under his clothes, this king has no substance.
