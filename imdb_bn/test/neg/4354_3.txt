I have tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I can not find the whole thing about it that everything is terrible about it. I'm sure it was a bold step to throw Jack Palenque as a playwright, but I do not have a single fiber that believes that he can do all the work, can do very little against the type. Yes, I understand that Clifford Odds is a brilliant writer, but it's not clear here. This strange and compulsive mix of 50's hipster dialogue seems to obscure any real meaning, which explains how any actor or even a good person (Steigar, Ida Lupino, Shelley Winters, Everett Sloane) think of how to supply their lines. No, they do not understand the meaning of what they are saying. And already, Wendell Corey and Palance see who might be facing a stone at an awesome competition level. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateur and completely overwrought. The physical interaction in characters is stilted as dialogs. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss that disgusting set? It is so busy, ugly and transformed that it adds robotic, character disconnected values, dialogs, and imagery. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to suck power from me. It seems that every morning when they come in excess of the value of the volume, that's what it comes. It takes a beautiful Lausanne movie to show Rod Stigger and Shell Winters bad, but it succeeds. <br /> <br /> I can see that it can be effective as a game on Broadway or outside, where intellectuals and bits of power can congratulate themselves for the artificial development of power and pseudo-lip dialogue.
