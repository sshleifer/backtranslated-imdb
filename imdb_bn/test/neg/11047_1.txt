It seems that some viewers think that the only thing that viewers dislike the film is graphic violence. In fact, violence, cartoonism is both violent, deep errors of "Old World". Characters are unidimensional, partial, primitive. The "intensity" is served by a director and this director with a goal, the most sophisticated way. Let's not confuse a stupid shot of adrenaline with artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems that all the cards have become tired, so the script becomes almost strange to his efforts to find the "awful" new layers, which can continue to "shock" the viewers, which are already quite fool-soap-opera "verses" already in big bunches Served It is difficult to imagine that even with the best artwork of the last fifty years of Asian film, it is also weirdly known, which is being fascinated by pieces of the trash. Think of the frustration in front of Hemer Simpson movie theater: "Can I buy five corners of the ice cream for the same meaning?" Go for smart, Homer, ice cream.
