Arthur Hannik utt played his very favorite playful role as a mountain man (probably the ozark), who hunted with his favorite koan dog. However, when Hanunik utt rides after him, the dog seems to be drowned. Soon it has become clear that both Hananik utt and his dogs, both of whom died in the water after moving out of water - did not respond when someone heard them and responded and heard their dog's death. Yet, oddly, Hananik utt realized gradually slowly and gradually slowly! I think it was actually working as a padding, because there was not enough material to fill the slot for half an hour. <br /> <br /> Later, "Wonderful wrapping", he comes to heaven - or at least its place concept. He is invited, but since they do not allow dogs, there are other ideas! Overall, reasonably well played but suspicious spiritual values! With no twists or satire, this episode is a little soft - not enough "Twilight Zone-Y" for my taste.
