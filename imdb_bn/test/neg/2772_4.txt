What I like about this flicker is that of Joan Woodberry, who was scared of me as a scary part of Charles Perler's classic "Algiers" as a pretty scary roles. She is Rita, an orphan who can become a lady as well as a criminal. At the top, his encouragement reminds me of Joan Crowford's letter, as such. Mildred Pierce, who realizes their ambition by firm determination and willpower. If you are looking for a movie muted classic, look somewhere better. At some points, it is difficult to know where this story is going. I got the first idea that to take vengeance against the father and son, Rita has planned to plot the plot, who led the boy to rape the drunken drunk by the boys. But the time of payback is only a small point and a little bit confusing in the film ends a springboard, where Rita is increasingly involved in corruption in the city. However, it is only 72 minutes, so the second laziness to look at the second should be cleaned. My copy is called a platinum box called "Mobster Movie". The quality of the photo is good, but the soundtrack sucks, continuously skipping the dialogue piece. There are eight movies in the $ 5.50 box, making each film a fairly 69 cents. Anna Archer's father John Conduct, as Rina's childhood friend Bob. Alan Ladd does not get many screen time. It's definitely Joan Woodbury's picture.
