This is a stereotype plot. When a young soldier is not ready then he tries to enter the competition and is not elected to represent his battlefield. It created separation from the battlefield and naturally he tried to learn to fight a strange new master. <br /> <br /> The battles are not high quality. They are very easy "ways" in a way that 1 + 1 is easy for each adult. The warrior trained and entered the ring, but he did not train and did not take a donkey kick. Coach yells this with that and no success with that. And after some ridiculous fatalities he does what he says suddenly and once he hits his opponent. This war resulted in a turning point, although our hero has been a beat up in his life until that point. Think about rocky movies and you will have a good point of reference to how deeply depressed you really are. Fights fiercely shot. <br /> <br /> The final thing to take away this picture is the stupid romance. Chesy songs and painful moments I do not call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These people could really make some quality entertainment, but the director could not do the job. Or my opinion is another crew. Perhaps they had a small budget, I do not know, but what is the end is that this film is bad and has 3 ratings out of 10.
