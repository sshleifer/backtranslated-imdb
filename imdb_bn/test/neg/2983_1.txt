It's the all-time movie I've ever seen without any doubt, but once started, it was like breaking a bad car on the street - you can not help yourself, only you will see it. My eyes !!! The performance was horrific, the production was horrific, the filming was awful, horror, horror, horror, horror. I'm happy that the priest is cutting, because of his acting in POOR it liked to work himself. I mean the tenth power starring suck-ful. Chris would have killed many of his letters just before turning his side. And what was his head with that freaking wig from hell?! I sincerely hope that no one will pay, i.e. funding should be done here, and sometimes they should be paid to try another film project, not everyone was involved, sometimes it is not. It's just a huge piece of garbage that I feel embarrassed that I had to stay observers till the end. Do not see it, it will not get you one hour and one and a half hours of your life and then you have to spend time registering on this website so that you can now comment on a comment that you must do, after seeing this movie Aftershocks live Work as a Catherine for (and I'm using the word "film" here).
