I was very interested to see the movie festival in Sydney. I left the theater, just like many, I did not sit there before the last credit. It was fiercely shot, the word was damaged, and the act was worse than an episode of love. Now I know why this film was not able to find an American distribution agency to publish it in America. This screams in the production of a low budget high school.
