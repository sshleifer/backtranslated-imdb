Yes It destroys a Norwegian and has two great books and an idea that will work well in the film - this film is actually the worst Swedish film of all time. I hate so badly that I did something I never did. But it was so terrible that I was almost compelled. I just had to sit in the end. Like most 80's Stallone Action Relay, it really takes the stone-age Swedish action. So logical errors and stupid mistakes are full of fun - but who can look good in those terribly starring, Mark Hamil, a mine field or a fool ass, vain and unreasonable? <br /> <br /> I ask you: Do not we watch from zero, from the time of the nose, the hero and the enemy of two friends end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> Another thing: the product placement in this movie is incredible. Although other countries have realized that it should not be so stupid, the Swedish film industry apparently did not understand: using Hamilton only to open a single window? Or .... this picture makes me really crazy.
