Very curious, it seems like a very good movie to me, if not a little less. It has been brilliantly shot but not together With the performance of Lee Armi, this is the only release point of view that I have found in film which consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part was covered by basic marine training, in 2007 it was seen, dozens of movies and dozens of series in the series have been seen before and it is not particularly sticky. After 30 minutes I got the idea and they could bring it. Drill sergeant seems to be the only believable character and everyone else is simply cardboard cut-out. General acting suddenly and suddenly the curtains do not exclude something interesting and a little more than the sergeant screams. Boys train them and finish in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat weirdo sergeant shoot (what a surprise ..) Probably, wrong belief that it was actually a scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> So, an hour passed and nothing worth the note did not happen. Some <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> time. At first I think they were rebuilding some movie scenes from old films, it seemed to be bad. But no, they were actually muttering their script line. Then the camp was blocked. About 20 Vietcong enters the camp at the main gate. They are very bad for them like flies, because they are just walking in some type of gun post in Dhaka. That normal behavior? Was Vietnam All Suicide? If so, how did the war in the United States last two months? The rest of the movie continues with even more completely unreasonable battle scenes. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is completely vain. None of the characters express sympathy and the story is frankly weird. Some war criminals show a little more than the war criminals, some people are shot dead because they are the cause of the rebellious attitude and whoever thinks that a frequent hole in the wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> <What was the message of this movie ... people in Vietnam died? Are people that are animals in war situations? If you really want to settle the stupid people, you send them a war zone? Or can Vietnam really burn concrete? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie is about 8.3 meters, then now the apocalypse 38.3 <br /> <br /> <br /> 5/10
