I watched NBC Friday 11-29-02 for the first time in this movie. It was a pretty good movie, but I do not think it will create a mup pet movie Jim Henson. I first of all, using the word 'pepe' "sexy" now and then, and Pepe says "will suck it?" And I Definitly yelling Jim Henson Kermit "I do not want to be born, I do not want to say" Jim Henson! "One minute to twelve minutes, this movie is not just like a classic Muppate film. Of course, I realize that Baseball is stealing diamond from Nicky Holidays" The Great Muppetshopper ", but cheating on a businessman's Meppets to make a smoker's nightclub in their theater contract Jim Henson was here today, he hated this picture!
