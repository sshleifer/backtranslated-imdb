This movie was probably good, if they did not use CGI (computer-generated imagery) for Verboblow scenes. It shows the creature a fake and the variovals see cartoons. The CGI is great for some effects such as the Jurassic Park Deinors. Twister But when we see a movie where the animal must see the whole thing, then the CGI is not the road to go. Look at an American Werewolf in London. No CGI Just makeup and a mechanical animal and what you brought were more realistic than what was shown in this movie. This photo has offered some gags which was fun to see and humorous in this movie seems to have attracted me, but it is more than a movie that I think was not well and it is not good enough. In my opinion, an American Weorolf in Paris does not hold up to the root.
