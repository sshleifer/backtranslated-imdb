The movie has started very well..because it is possible to believe Isabella's worries .... But later, Lord !!! I do not know what a horror film, drama or one must not see! The creature that attacked the chef did not have any connection with the movie .... made !! Well it looked quite real at the beginning, but at the end, the last part of the movie, make-up (especially tooth and eyes) was very hilarious. If you want a good "Exxisist" movie watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Together with "hard candy" (complete annoying, merciful plot and finishing), I'm the worst of these two films. I saw from Liongate !! But the film company has given the horror movie a fantastic movie, but with this one you will never be able to break it !! Exorcism movie fans, stay with just two "Exorcist" and "Exorcism of Emily Rose"
