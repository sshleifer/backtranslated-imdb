I went to the movie hoping for a small action to mix strong story lines. I realized that the written work and movies should be changed ... for many reasons <br /> <br /> The change in relationship between scientists (they were the parents of the book) In this way, Carmelengo and the director transferred to Carmelengo at the scene and changed the position of the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard confirmed his father as a cardinal, a hayseed accent but missed all the symbols. Both the woodland and Carmelengo ascend to the heavens in the helicopter and landed in the Hanks, and the priest landed on the Chapel described as Christ-like figure. <br /> <br /> On the job who needs to be remade by a director
