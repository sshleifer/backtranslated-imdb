All of this looks turned right and interesting. However, due to the passion of characters in the characters, it is so perfect that it really closes the horror and it is a shame to the serious audience. Unfortunately I have not seen it yet though this story is probably much better based on "I went with a zombie". "Wisdom" looks so exciting and may be a great movie about Jumbo and Voodoo, but in reality it has become very embarrassing, which is shameful. It's hard to say what's hard to say with. I guess that's a lot of strange scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, Alice (who thinks that girl named Alice Dodson, Lewis Carroll inspired her heroine Alice to call her) and lover among younger brother. Absolutely nothing has been made in them and then they are married. However, it looks great, and it was worth a look - but the movie was so badly edited. 3/10.
