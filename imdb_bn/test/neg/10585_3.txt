When a harmful teen is bitten by a pest, he flies superhero dragon ... <br /> <br /> The latest spoof movie to hit the superhero movie screen. Regrettably, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with the aircraft !, the top secret and the presence of nude song movies), it is still suffering from the latest scandal ... it is more stupid than fun! The faults mainly lie with gags. It's not just fun enough. Jokes do some work, such as nail gun scenes, but other parts fall flatly. For example, x-men spofes or whole farting sequences. Burning Saddles is not this! One of the main topics of the best spoof films like Biman is that although the dialog is very interesting, the throw for most parts is completely straightforward. It even makes it funnier. Even if there are simple conversations on the front, there may be fun things happening behind the cast. Again funny The main thing is to keep them all sticky. <br /> <br /> Recent trends can show scenes of different movies, then try and fool them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films is rarely available. There is another flaw in this movie, which was really fun in the original versions of the scenes, and in most cases it is more fun than the spoof scene! Caste tries to get the necessary spirit, but with many illogical conversations and scenes, it's hard to work about. <br /> <br /> The latest incognito films, such as not as bad as epic movies, date movies, or terrible meet the spartans, but some people involved here have made good, fun movies in the past, it is not good enough.
