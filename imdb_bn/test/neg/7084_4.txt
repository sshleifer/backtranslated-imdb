This movie has many actions and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that the attitude of the Russian Revolution is almost the same - there is only one hour below to tell us the story. Indeed, after the First World War, Kharaj proved a disaster for the country and a temporary government 9 months later Leninists tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy without taking power, mainly because they pledged to withdraw Russia immediately from the war. Now, go back to our story. <br /> <br /> Our revolution here is "rumor" in the Russian newspapers, which still seem to be an effective country until violence grows suddenly and the noble person Baron Nikita 'gives life to Nikki. 'Crashfof (Douglas Fairbank Junior). She wanders with her house servant, Tanunisha (Nancy Carroll), and started a new life in Constantinople. Prior to the revolution, Baron made a regular habit for a girl for a game, not from any emotional emotion, but as a matter of fact, out of boring. The revolution does not change this, and she's obviously going to try to take advantage of a very simple girl. It certainly does not listen to him like this guy watching toying with him. Tanushush follows the baron because the revolutionaries have no place in the literal sense after falling down on Baran's house and he does not know any other life than waiting for Niki's hands and feet. Once at Constantinople, Nikki quickly sharpened life as a Pelillus worker, and when he met his ex-boyfriend, Russian elite Zimina, who had planned to go to Paris where the government was gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Nannusha, the litter scheme is not included in it. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by the first actress, Nancy Carroll, to completely destroy the outstanding performance of the contest. He does a good job with what he has given, but it is not much. Lilian Tasman has played a small role here as a vamp sheep in Russia. Lilienne was often given the role of acting here, but her voice and fascinating look on the ground and focus on each scene she saw. Guy Kibbi has also shown something ridiculous as America's tourist who is aware of the Russian royalty, which has been exiled from their country.
