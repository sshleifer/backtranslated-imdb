"Arthur Core" was yesterday's television. I used to work on my computer and watched and saw what happened to some of the worst acts ever made. I played acting immediately (all included - even Cushing Peter) and were awesome, unintentionally enthralled by the comical action sequences and doll monsters. <br /> <br /> The image is about a Victorian scientist who is a stereotypical buff American hero on a ground-boring trip to the rural areas of Wales. They rarely know that there is a great disturbance in the central center of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Almost 2700 kg / m3 underground and iron will burn alive in the sea or in living water.) Remember that the creator of the doll "Beast Master" is the greatest appearance of all time. No, the true genius of "Earth Off-Core" is his stupid stupidity - without real action and real philosophy, a c ung-ho action philosophy. It's just a gong-hoy movie and its stupid one. Those who enjoy the MSST 3K-Style stuff will love it - it's unexpectedly bad, and actually bad so it's almost enjoyable in a strange way.
