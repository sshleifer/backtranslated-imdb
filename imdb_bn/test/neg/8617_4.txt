A good story is well hidden and not really used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and highly dependent on action and theatrical photography; Somehow forgot the development of characters and stories. <br /> <br /> Close your brain and see ?? Perhaps you will leave time fast, but if you are a person who finds deep and meaningful soap, you are not going to get any real satisfaction from this movie. <br /> <br /> Only see if you do not have any good work and only paid for video rentals.
