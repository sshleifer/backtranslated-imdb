Space is a vacuum, right? Therefore, the place sucks. Vampire also suck. Is there a truly bad vampire movie able to double in space, right? <br /> <br /> Start with what it can be a fun courtyard. Bram Stoker's Dracula's story is re-established in the future. There is a salvage crew sent to search for a lost cargo ship lost in a place called Demetor. Supporters of the original novel will oddly assume that it will be an easier reuse of Dracula in the future ... Unfortunately, refraining from sharing the names of the characters, it takes a lower root and twenty minutes later the B-movie goes to the galaxy when the Coolie becomes a vampire . When I tell you that he's the best actor in the movie, and he's not saying too much <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " After leaving Baywatch, you should leave Erika Eleniak and having problems reading from the poor Udo Kier Coupe card. This guy played Dracula in the 1970 version of Frank Langley. If you can manage to sit through the whole film then you will be rewarded with the worst last fantasy prize. Finally the actors and crew realized how they created a garbage made and closed the set. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Think about the fans of Vampire. This one sucks twice as hard.
