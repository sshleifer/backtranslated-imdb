Well, it seems that the stylish Italian movie has forgotten the golden bar. And recently the filmmaker Lambero Bava is another obvious proof of this concept in the brain's disguise recently. <br /> <br /> I feel lucky to see many movies from this cheerful director (like physical puzzle, delirium, macrob and both giant). <br /> <br /> This new entry to my DVD collection is a strange and impossible display scene soon after the car's crash scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The total waste of the genius from suspected scripts and international cast. The only character that provided less or less sendable performance, the fierce Mark's son was embroiled in a completely annoying world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all the works of Mario's boys are rarely appreciated. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing the expectation of her Murder House to be an expected one.
