For various reasons, this movie is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of this movie's historical flaws. Well, I have a knowledge of people of Roman history and I even got wrong evidence. I forgive mistakes in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to be educated. And a two-hour feature needs some shrink to shrink a long saga, of course, requires a historical license. But this movie has just become round. <br /> <br /> worse To tell a story of a distant time, using film flashbacks makes the story more confusing. If there is no knowledge before the duration of the audience, they will quickly lose. In addition, the film was pictured together in Italian and English, after which various actors were later dubbed. Occasionally, the actors think that they are completely different movies that have been edited together later. Actually, this is not a mistake. Actors are definitely paste onto ancient Rome generated from a cheesy computer. <br /> <br /> I always find Peter O'Toole recreational because I give this annoying mess any star. But there is no reason to rent it. If you are interested in Roman history, there are many good movies available.
