Erid Idel, Robi Colton, Janet Sujman - It should have been almost impossible to make mistakes. Of course this is some interesting moment - when the Robbie Coulton "I can not help myself" on the Lone Chaney Jr. tremendous wavewall line, then the blazing scene is seen. But finally the plots, scripts and sides are flat as pancakes and after 180 years of "Heil Marie" after 90 years old, Nun is tired. When I was a kid, the movie carrying this film fits better, which is a really unfortunate complaint of a movie with a committed cast.
