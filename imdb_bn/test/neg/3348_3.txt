Some people, Karl Ramrevich learn how to live after telecommunications, even after death. She is interfered in a tomb. That night, Julie (Meg Tilly) was attending a group called "The Sisters" at night. And Carl's "power" is full bloom. <br /> <br /> Silent movie. I saw it in the theater at the age of 21 and was generally bored. PG rating should stop me - this is a horror movie for kids. In a real stupid view, there is a corpse breaking through a concrete hit to hit a young man! For the refugees, the dead bodies are the head, which makes the body impossible to use its weapon, and there is no way to break through concrete. The film is not working on it when you are seeing these stupid mistakes. It has two good views - two "The Sisters" are "infected" by the floating bodies of their crowd. At one stage, one of the sisters dropped a dead body in his stomach - his arm went into the body and he could not pull it! That view is with me every day. And at the end there is a clever little bit involved in a corpse and a toothbrush (which was my audience's smile). But the rest of the film is a gentle, dull memory. For children only - adults will be bored. I give it a 3.
