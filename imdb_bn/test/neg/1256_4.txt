Well, the movie was not terrible, but anyone who made the screen game did not do well to create contagion material. The film was less than average and did not tell the story correctly among the most interesting people born. I recommend reading the book "One Kind of One". They left a huge part of his life. They sometimes did not understand the actual characters. The actual events of his life were time out at the time. And in the end, they did not actually represent their true personality. So please do not watch movies; Read the book. Anyway I'm just not a joke, you seem to be 100% in the real story, but they did not even get close!
