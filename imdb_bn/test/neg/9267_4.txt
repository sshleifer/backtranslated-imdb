Along with opening up a cheap pound shop, I thought it was valuable to see any cheap DVDs that looked good. And when it made the word like a crystal-like crystal film on the back cover, it's actually a movie story! And feeling one or two stories feel very familiar. It's still a fun light / horror comedy. Plot: <br /> <br /> One of the stories: Classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple think that they should try to prove their financial life with their $ 1,500 car. However, when the man moves to the car, the car starts talking to him. The car (known as Benz) says that to get everything he wants, he needs to buy a bun for $ 5,000. So when people are breaking relationships, Airyan can do all that can really charge. <br /> <br /> Story Two: Kitchen Culture <br /> <br /> It is now spread to a person who can run out of his zamindar, how flat the flat is, and his frozen tuna pasta for six months, has turned himself into a green molding version! And when they get locked up as friends, they end up being a big fall, directing a final war to see whether the real person or his freeze clone will survive. <br /> <br /> Story three: Really true. <br /> <br /> <br /> A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets wi to match. A man is perfect for her. But he is sure that the man is very perfect, and when he thinks that he 'stops' seeing him, he starts to talk. See the film: <br /> <br /> The first thing I would like to mention is the rating of the film in England, where it has been given 18 ratings, even nudity, no oath or blood in it. Another strange thing about all the stories and other stories is that they all have a good ending, where the gold won! And when the first story is very close to Stephen King's classic Christmas, the second story easily looks like the low-budget Muppets episode of the film's highlights, the director Tom Parkinson's denial of the story! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'reconstruction; It seems, they have enough embarrassment to make this a very horrible 'comedy'.
