I think the film was considered "cool" for 1961, but looking back (45 years) its attractiveness was as stupid as its entertainment value! Approved, special effect works well with the series started on TV in 1964, but for the big screen ?? I was equally exciting that once was a fish tank! Lastly, I should agree with the Octopus scene where it connects to Sevay. Definitely not good ... or trained! Overall, it is very bad acting with very bad effects and I still recommend it - funny smile to have fun This is probably one of Irui's biggest movies and I think she thought it a lot. Barbara Eden TV was the husband of Mikhail Ansar playing "Jenny". Now this is a cool part about this picture! I always enjoyed seeing Star Life husband and wife team star in the same film. Good luck!
