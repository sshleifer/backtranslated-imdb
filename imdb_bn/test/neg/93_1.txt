I totally enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999), which is the last of the three final films in the series (the first is Urban Menace (1999) which I have not seen yet). I know it was Baaaad, but three Leeds are a beautiful decent work, all things are considered. <br /> <br /> This, though, was really rogue. Ice T was awesome, and he's the producer! I've never heard of Silk the Shocker (who clearly learned how to spell it), but its performance was the worst I've ever seen in movies. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones did a great job in his small role, though he later created some shocking, racist "jokes" in his Asian radio show after Asian Asian tsunami (then on other occasions sadly). Let's go, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one comes with a credit. Curiously, TJ Storm and Arnie Hodson (both of which are quite bad here) have been a lot better, the underworld crew, which was created alongside the city of Menes, is corrupt at the same time. How does it work, I do not know. <br /> <br /> I am now trying to comment on the ice, whether he apologized to see this image, or tried to think that it is a great part of film making.
