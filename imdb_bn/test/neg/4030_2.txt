O my God, it just does not get anything worse !!! I always love the fool-cute BB-movies which are so stupid that they are funny and I thought it would be one of them, but it was so stupid that allowing it to be released was absolutely disrespectful. What were these people thinking? They are not really real filmmakers and I really hope they went back to their days and realized that they could do it! Even the lowest budget B-movie standards have no acting and non-special effects anywhere. And as women did with men wearing clothes, they could find any woman that wanted to present these crappy things. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> If possible, I give it a "0", it is not even worthy to get "1" for the terrible. Do not waste your time (and especially your money) on this terrible loss of a non-film!
