O boy, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this video tape. <br /> <br /> In soundtrack music scenes, the dialog was difficult to hear. When people were in the telephone, on the other hand, there was a problem listening to the man. It seems that at least two different types of movie or video stock have been used, because color and focus are sometimes moved too much between edits. And there were many focus shots that do not seem deliberate. <br /> <br /> A budget indicator (one of the many) came to the news report on TV. Only a "news flash" title card is extremely scared with video effects on a TV screen and a voice-over by a newscaster. They could not draw a newscaster's footage, and then actually show it on TV? <br /> <br /> The image starts with a surgical scab and an assassin wearing a mask, which runs a scale. It seems he is a panoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital, to avoid having a lobotomy on him. <br /> <br /> School is released for a break in the students, and three young women decide to take a sleeping party. Three people decide to break the party, and a geek named Science decides to destroy it. The sleeping party is quite annoying, and the boys simply show wearing masks randomly, showing off the mask, and then showing the disappearance. One of the girls, the mother and the father (the surgeon to make the labotomy) showed. None of the killer knocks the throats slices of humans without really noticeing. The film's visible lead is less or less of a film. Perhaps it was bad acting, or perhaps it was deliberate because most of the movies are a nightmare and nightmares in between a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The last thing too horrible. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the Chasey United Home Video VHS Box Art, which was revived for DVD release I can not honestly say it is a picture, or an image, or a combination of both. The women portrayed in the cover are not in the film and the clothes they wear are more open than any other item in the movie. The cover throat glasses are more scary than the movie - where people influence a stupid pop-id look. In that case, the killer is mostly in the head: the head is shaking, and the eyes are crying, blurred for the camera. Often the skeleton was kept in focus on the camera, when the mask-covered face of the killer was closed but the background was out of focus.
