Even MST3K can not make this painful, long, and finally mind-flexible fun or entertaining entertainer. Although the worst movies are bad and bad in themselves, it is one of the few videos that literally uses a bad word. <br /> <br /> The element that makes it so crazy to see is not so much. Lack of the story, but the fact is that a lot of background has fallen within the first half hour that it is harder to follow and follow than highway while driving with a headlight. <br /> <br /> The film's hero, Atar, is not the eye-candy for this literal strength of a film-sucker. He was dressed in a lind-cloth and dress-like costume, like Joel inserted, he played more in the fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend only to die, and I mean the cheese is hard to follow. If you have an enemy, then suggest this movie to them. If you put it through it, I appreciate you. You should be able to do it through something.
