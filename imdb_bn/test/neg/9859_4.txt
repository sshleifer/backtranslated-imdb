Due to being a chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the recovery of Gary Casparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer in 1997. I hope the match will look deeper and Caspova had to say a lot. The boy I was wrong and confused by a mile. This documentary is very much like many modern documentaries - lots of flash but no real stuff. After watching it, I'm sorry, I felt like wasting my time. The most annoying aspect of the documentary is that it can not be in a place for a decent period. It usually has MTV type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick word bites every five seconds. It is tragic that the 10-year-old child's attention to filmmaking has accumulated. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to create a movie about chess, but that does not mean it should be sparkling. There are a couple of interesting ideas though 'over game'. The idea that the computer can feel like a human; Whether the computer has developed a unique new level. Caspova also thought of this at the end of the match, but this image does not go deeper with this idea. Also, this picture tries to bring a bizarre theory. It turns out to be paranoid that people are running with computers. Kashpov had doubts about this, but there is no evidence on this day so far. At the end of the film, it turns out to be strange that maybe Antoili Karpov could have been a man who secretly took the initiative with deep blue assistance. Interested in thinking, but I do not know how reasonable or realistic it is. I still will not recommend this movie, even for the chess addict.
