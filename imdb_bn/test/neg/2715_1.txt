Yes, it was a horror movie, but there was a song at the beginning of the movie, I think, "I've got a woody" or something of that effect. I would like to find a sound track if one has available. I saw this song at MSST 3K, and it was terrible, it was in the moment, and that song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like kids in a bikini, this is a movie for you, but if you do not, then do not bother. It was a great element for MSST 3K, although I must admit. I really want to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only that song, but there were a few fun and classics as I am concerned about.
