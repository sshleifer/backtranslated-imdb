In order to quote the critics of the film, "it slowly stopped." The plot was quite credible (though some characters seem to be very random), the script was written fairly well (the dialogue does not appear to be compulsory), but everything went very slowly. There were many breaks in the line and the distribution of the line was not that cool. This movie was potential, but it turned a teenager into a narcotics. My advice? Wait for TV to come up before watching it.
