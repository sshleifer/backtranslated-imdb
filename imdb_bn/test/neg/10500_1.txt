I usually movie "1." Not even though I'm an impressive critic, I try to find something that makes the movie suitable (which is, say, guardable). The main thing I see is a coherent plot. If it is alone, I can see it! Let me start by saying, it's not even a movie, it's more like an elementary school project ... it's gone! And I saw every SI-Fi movie that was ever made. <br /> <br /> I have read reviews of professional critics many times, which say, "It has acted like a TV made in TV ..." (and so etc.) "And I said" Oh, come on, I hope. They think of a real criticism. "Good bad ... bad! This is really the worst" thing "that I saw that it lasts a film length (if I consider it a movie, it will be my greatest movie ever), and I want to watch every movie in Uwe I made the ball! This movie looks like Francis Ford Coppola in the UK ball! :) I would rather see Joyce's revenge day, then this one more Let's see ... even 5 minutes ... it was a good scene and it was the last! - OK, for serious criticism, now Ron is fooling his work. <br /> <br /> The script is written badly, The document is distributed in a wooden way, the effects show more cheerers than the power, and even the screen does not even allow me to start the zoom-in transition. Edited, and then said, "Okay, free it"? I'd rather burn it than for free! To stop all I can say "Love DVD and VHS players have a stop and eject feature!" If you do not, do not rent it, you'll be glad you're off! :)
