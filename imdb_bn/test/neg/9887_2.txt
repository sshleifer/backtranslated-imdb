I read the book after watching the movie and did not take care of it for some, it's a bit annoying; But trashy books are often a good movie, and this may be one. The story of discovering his fascinating power over the boys, which he feels reluctantly provoked, because it is suspiciously controllable, and it is a strong firm determination because of its normal girl, which affects him through his webfood. This story will be a clear appeal for young viewers for which movies have been created: one kind of objection to girls and other boys' tendencies: And I do not understand how filmmakers can be blind and their <br /> <br /> starts To get the title (which is the best book about books): It is derived from quotes from Hess, it is also used as a paragraph . A person is afraid and running his fat both blood and chocolate, his face as bad as another. This is a wonderful metaphor for the state of heroin: it bursts between its people and the wolf, both of which feel similar to fearful. The film debates with Aggregate and instead presents the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop! How the title of the book can be cunningly intended for filmmakers "like water for chocolate" in chocolates and they want to break their same symbol. But they did it; So why is the movie? Character high school in the book - or inside and outside, like a tin gang, who likes black jeans and T-shirts and falls anywhere between heroine's addiction and her pet-pir. In the movie, they have become a fierce clubgoer. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, discovering the age of her age as to how much of her sexuality is driven by her son; He is the person who started contact, then went back, started again and did something more. In the movie she is not a girl but a woman, and the person living on this campus is no longer in high school, but a loss of law (and a comic book artist, for booting), she comes to her, unknowingly as a compassionate cousin in a system. He initially keeps her close, but then she believes he will: Hey, you know that you want it. I felt a female director took the proposed opportunity to show a female hero in an untouchable, active role. But not <br /> <br /> Because of the five criminal acts, the heroes of the heroine are driven from their home; The reason the movie went for a run (!) He is a great runner, prone to kicking off the wall building, and he and his clanmates both scale the building in a trice; Very similar to the heroes of the martial arts film and very similar calf, or something similar to them. The book did not turn into the actual wolf, but the thing bigger than the wolf; Movies are just ordinary wolves they are. In the book they are transformed into "haoling" style, with fork; This is one of the things to make the hero aware of his pain, as well as bringing his pleasure to his body. In the film, the variavals have become witchcraft acrobats, accepting the huge swan dive and being transformed into the mid-air, mocking yellow like a tinker-belle; It looks cool, does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> The group is a little white trashy family transferred from Virginia to Maryland in the West. They live in Bucharest, but everything is different, no romantic The book wants to have a whole pack in normal life and can ensure that - and indeed, their survival - a necessity is to keep their real nature secret from humans. And so keep saying characters movie; Yet the head of the tribe is a little underground boss - but apparently not a criminal boss, because he hates the criminals - and there is a permanent agreement with the police, who provided him "meat" for the pack. It seems a big exception to protecting people from being intelligent; But maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for stupidity and fanatic murder. <br /> <br /> The heroine at the end of the book can learn that when she is not trying to live her life, a divided life, she stuck between man and animal kingdom, unable to be one thing or another. His boyfriend is not sure that what he has taken for him is strong enough, the pack can not be surrounded by him, and he is compelled to separate them. He saved him like a lassie in the film and they went to Paris (why Paris?), But they are not really happy because they are conflicting between nature - _her_ nature. <<br /> But the difference between the movie that most enjoys is that the book's characters behave in general, although in the state of adult novels, anyone in the film has been annoyed. Each other line is a threat or another kind of one kind: you will be sorry; You do not belong here; You will not get rid of me; I gave you a chance; Etc. I like to clean the people I face in this way. <br /> <br /> There have been many good vampire movies, there is never a good vairwal movie. Stuck to this book, it could be the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
