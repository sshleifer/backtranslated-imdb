It's a dreary, inactive, self-important bore. When you suddenly gave a film life, the only argument is that you know that this initiative has gone. Philip Simmur Huffman plays Truman Capote as a brutal, intense, self-motivated, cartoon-like, insect-like joke. Why is he not interpreting this way and we get small background information? This script was written by Kopte's 'In Common Blood' and related to his affected brothers who killed a family of four families. Harper Lee (Catherine Keaner), acclaimed author of 'Two Kill A McGrabber', was with the Capet in his initial investigation and his presence immediately proposed many other interesting topics for biology. Unfortunately, Lee quickly moved in favor of an undisturbed view of the Capet by embarrassing his miserable existence. Seeing Dr. Smith in 'Lost In Space', he heard about his "fine back" for listening to his two weeks. But the difference, when Smith was not in the Capet, was fun. The precious self-importance of the film kills it, as is the reluctance to add shadow to director Bennett Miller. Like seasoned piano scores, the film provides an overview, no contrast, no emotional color, and no intimate play. If the capo is really annoying, why would you make a movie about it and expect the audience to see it? Although supportive roles are well-edited (Chris Cooper is his usual strong spontaneous relative), they serve this little dramatic purpose, because in the end it is about the Captain (!) Director Bennett and the screenwriter Dan Footman mentally failed to connect with the audience for their reason because they Was definitely the Capet's "Legend" cultural baggage Bara overwhelmed. Their products are still born in Oscars Bate ... and there is more evidence that in a great image like this there is more "true" than this, which is more than half the whip.
