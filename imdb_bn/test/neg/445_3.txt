Once upon a time there was a great American film. What's so horrific and comedy combined with equal thrill. These pictures featured cute instruction. Ground breaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting. It was 'an American Werewolf in London.' After 16 years, the long-awaited sequel was finally pinned to the poster board outside of your local theater. Of course it has at least some of the main thrill. Think again. An unbelievable mess from the beginning of an unfortunate end from the 'An American Werewolf' in Paris. The issue started with leading people. Tom Everett Scott's performance is tough and tiring. From the beginning, he proves that all young people are available. In his defense, even Shakespeare's Thespian could not find a better performance than a seasoned child and an idiomatic dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, who had lost his soul, was able to finally move to the world after carving one after Varoov one after another to walk the earth. Then he quips to Scott and his friends. 'OK, say yes.' What a memorable departure. Julie Delphi looks at Scott's mysterious European love interest soon. Basically, he is a French girl playing French girl. It does not have much of a stretch. But all these stupidity is not even the most frustrating thing about the film. Special effects, an integral part of the superb original film, are very less in this flow. Look like a purple cartoon. And it does not matter how well you fit the cartoon with the signature lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get a cartoon fear. Therefore, the Least American gang, under the leadership of a very weak Scot, has found excuses to return to the VariWolf's Catacombs Layer. This vague special effect is much easier here to keep the computer enhanced animals or kinky animal mask under dark cover for crew. Some have said that if you do not see this movie as a sign, it is not comparatively bad. I disagree, the film can not stand on itself and it is more disrespectful than the brightest. If it is not shown as a sieglle, it should not be mostly titled from the 1981 film. I do not care how much you love to love, Or you worshiped 'American Wayrolls' in London. Just like I did myself This one is worth not to waste your time. 'OK, say yes.' Terrible 3 possible 10h.
