Anyone can make a movie these days Budget, production price, or experienced crew will not stop this day from being described as "director of dreams" from "dream realization". <br /> <br /> Director Lin Gate decided to go to the market as a Sindhu in his original movie when he did not need any precedent for a film production. <br /> <br /> <br /> I personally found the lion gate, there was a lot more error than koyel to realize the people of Dark Harvest 2. The fraudulent marketing of the Lyon Gate of this film should be investigated by the Office of the State Attorney General and the officials of Lion's Gate are sulfuric acid and kerosene to film, film and breach them in good sense. <br /> <br /> For movies, it's not even worth the comments.
