The low budget "movies" like this just give me hope as an aspiring script. In other words, if there are people who are willing to earn money for this kind of scalp money, then there is more to hope than for someone like me who can actually write stories. This picture is okay, or I have to say "down" with the world's "ad wood". The story, if you can call it, and the dialogue, without mentioning the Sophomore role, it is bogged down on the section. Only someone on paper could run a steak through this stinger. Since the majority of literature is dead, the film should follow it. Have a good or even just passable movie, you must have very less decent text. Legendary Cart Siodiodak Feel Springs. They use lots of stories for low-budget movies when they come back, but they are still good, serious entertainment, such as "Donovan's Brain". Throwing for this "job" should seriously consider working on their respective hamburger joints or shoes stores, and forget about future weak efforts to appear before a camera. Avoid like this plague itself !!!
