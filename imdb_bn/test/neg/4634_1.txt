I saw this movie and was disturbed by my mind! I'm a fan of peanuts, but I do not understand why Charles Schulz could release this disaster! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Snoopy will let his friends sleep in the outside of the dangerous condition and will get out of the bar and some cold jump without the clock! The story was completely meaningless even for comic strip characters. They do not take much time to go to France, even after they went to France, I thought the author (I still can not believe that Schultz) did not know what to do once they went there. <br /> <br /> Peanut is not the best, 80 minute movie in a 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> Charlie Brown goes home, there you are your best. <br /> <br />
