Perhaps I was very generous when I gave this film half a star of five, but there was a moment at times. However, the movie "American Werewolf" is a missed opportunity! There is no real plot connection to say the higher root, but the story is similar to "London" in some ways. Possible Spoller Alert * American kids go abroad, someone falls in love with a beautiful girl. The other child is killed in the same night with a feral, whoever catches a cat, and despite the warning of his maternal friend, he sprayed lungs, fungus and birds in the light of the whole moon! <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some differences between the stories, for one; The girl is one of Vernobol. Secondly; There are three American kids. And third; There are some weird things - @ $$ Weiroft counter intend on the world! It's like a madman, that was not a joke! * Spleker Ends * <br /> <br /> Movies are suffering from many things, first of all, the weak acting goes down! Tom Everret is amatuerish at Scott's performance at the best, and he and Julie Delpy, who play his love interest, do not seem to have any chemistry together. Secondly; A weak script seems to be all that space. Many elements of obscurity and dark comedy, which made the original great, it is absent. And whoever says that Verobol's heart will eat, will you return to man? Lastly, I heard that there was no part of this variaval! Third; Terrible special effects; The variobol effect is done with computer animation, which works like dinosaurs, ghosts and space ships. But Verify, seems to be fake and artificial, when used for animal animals like verviv. /> <br /> However, the total tarkidama few things <br it from preserved, there is a cafe in Paris was a ridiculous scene when Andy (Scott) sephaphina (delapi) with coffee drinking, and chewing gum left on the table as a bunch of condoms Try to get swollen! Also; A very cool mix of alternate rock bands like Soundtrack, Bush and Smashmouth. Although they do not have the word "moon" in the title of a song, but like the original movie, the soundtrack is great. And another interesting scene, when Julie bowed to a cyclonic body, trying to stroke and her ribs came out, I started laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> But this film seems completely lacking in intelligence and mystery. Original And the ultimate change does not help much in the end. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Average five stars average (average.)
