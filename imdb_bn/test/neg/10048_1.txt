The English translation of the title of the DVD version of this movie is "Horrible Cemetery," but I think it must be an error. It should have called Haribil's graveyard. Dreadful acting, awesome edits, horror stories, and horror music all keep this horrible movie at the most dangerous graveyard. <br /> <br /> Awesome.
