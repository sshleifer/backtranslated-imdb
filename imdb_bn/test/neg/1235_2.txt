I would give it a second chance but the first one was very frustrated. It will not hold a candle in another series. There are many meaningless dialogues which do not add to the story. I do not seem to agree with others that it is interesting to develop a story. It's slowly and plodding and I know I'm planning to do only the Compans. Perhaps it will be combined in other installments but I'm going to see it and strengthen myself to find it. I am the Apache tradition from Texas / New Mexico area but I can not recognize much of what is happening. Maybe I'm just unaware of the incident but this is not something I have to educate me about.
