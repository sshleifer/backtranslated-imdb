Michael Caine's character has problems. He was a simple, inferior, insecure person in the mid-40s. She is married but her wife does not seem to love him. She has a bad relationship with her only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that, a beautiful young girl, played by Michelle Johnson, is following him very slowly, kissing him, making fun of him, and trying to start sex at every opportunity. What do the poor colleagues do? <br /> <br /> This movie should be brought out of the comedy category and should be kept under science fiction. Only one intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Mitchell Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion people in the world - they can mostly choose her - she goes with a tired, old man. It crosses a misunderstanding that crosses a middle-aged imagination, you only hope that everyone involved in volunteering involves therapies. <br /> <br /> There's no really fun here. Knowing something from Caine has some quick effort, who often seem to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like fingernails on a Chalkboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - her crying scene that will not pass for high school play - but she is beautiful and she closes her clothes. So buy a DVD, go to scene 4 and 9, and forget the rest.
