Well let's say that when a Dutch movie is bad, it's really bad. Something comes along with something a little bit (Lake, Caracar) with Holland but not often here. Costa! About 4 girls are going to Spain to go on holiday, party, get drunk, get kick (you know the drill). It's about the world of clubbers or proppers. Pro people who are trying to loot the crowd in their crowd. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it takes to write scripts, but I suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you see a bunch of random views for 90 minutes long. Nothing, and I mean that there is nothing credible in this movie. This is very ridiculous for what's happening with the story. Suddenly, this movie is a form of action-action items. 'Black with a one-on-one fight' and 'Clive Kare Chase' scenes empty out a watermark-car (it can be more cheesy). Also character-development and casting are unknown to the creators After watching "traffic" 3 days ago, I fell from low flare of art. It's making movies at the most tragic times. And do not start less about the budget. Even with a low budget you can write a good script. It seems almost filmmakers are very busy for making a decent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl made a little more water in the end, but for the rest of the part, such garbage will not waste your money.
