I just got to see, back to "Comedian". It was ... okay. It shows me on the screen. I'm going to give only $ 7, that does not mean me. <br /> <br /> Do not make me go wrong now, it will create a great HBO feature. If I see something on the TV, then I could have been able to enter. It gives an amazing look after it has reached the stage before and after the comedy. It shows interest to anyone who likes to see the comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to movies, I like to entertain. I do not get educated. Now I know for Jerry Safefield before he goes out on stage .... well. But in reality, I used to laugh and laugh with my jokes. <br /> <br /> Another thing: with Anne Adams' bad attitude! I look forward to seeing my HBO special before I accept my order from Burger King. She was not funny. She is kind of person that loves to hate.
