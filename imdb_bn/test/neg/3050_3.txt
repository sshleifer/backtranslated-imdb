Before Stan Leyrele became the smallest half-time of the greatest comedy team of all times, she underwent a contract with Bronco Billy Anderson in the comfort series, most of which are parody of the main features of Hollywood. Most of Laurel's 'parody' movies are simply funny, and even less fun for modern audiences, who are not watching the original movie. Fortunately, 'Mood and Sand' is a movie which is still well-known: 'Blood and Sand' has played Rodolf the Valentino. Only nine weeks before the purple, 'Blood and sand' was released, Branka Billy gave some ideas about how fast the film was made, edited and distributed. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> A print of 'Mood and Sand' with the original title (Hob type font) has been shown, so I report that Lorel's role actually shouted with a 'E' to the rubber vaseline. But I agree that Vasselino is fun. Lorel had a wide variety of disguises, which Valentino 'blood and sand' (she made him more!), And there is a parody in the scene of Valentine from the film, which in 1922 made women filmmakers fooled. Carmen's original image has been identified as Carmel (the woman that I want to sink my teeth). <br /> <br /> This movie (originally meant) is clearly held in Spain, but there is still a ban. Lorel uses a different hat-tapping gesture here that could become a trademark for her (like Hardy's unique net of twildle), but I've never seen it in any other Lorem movie. There are some interesting conversations: Rubberb Vaseline tells other maternal, 'Save a calf for me.' When Vaseline became a successful trader, a needy said to him, 'Without a calf, sir ... ... that's funny, but I was disappointed that without the' What's the matter? ' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here is a fun moment that was not often planned when Vaseline Bulfighter looks for audition. The swaggers in Laurel bullring, and - before you can say 'corrida querida' - he tosses an ox on the fence, where it lands with a touch around other auditioners. The calf is probably a fake, but the funny thing is ... and, yes, there is a title card with a joke about 'throwing lightning'. The recurring moment occurs when the recurring streak is repeated and the vaseleine has a second calf sling. The balance on this one's butt, and just for an instant before sloping. Very funny! If someone plans to joke in this quickie comedy, I'm unknown gagsmith ... and those technicians who rigged the bull in the land on the rigged salute. By luck it probably happened, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it. <br /> <br /> In a silent era, whenever Hollywood made a big budget feature film that was set anywhere that people would not speak English, it was a simple cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in local lingo Then, after breaking a shot of the same text in English. I am surprised that this low-budget comedy spent money to copy this device: We can see a notice board outside the carriages with a message in Spanish, then it will flush the same text into English. Unfortunately, the photography of this cheap movie is so dark that the effect has been damaged. <br /> <br /> The actress of this movie is striking ... with the wife of Bruno Biala's wife Leonard Anderson and Stan Lawl's common lawmaker Mei Dahlberg; Modern is not a beautiful dance briefly. (Mansion starred in the Badwood Act.) There is nothing to do with Chaplin's film, so I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's semi-brother Villa Dryden play a brief introduction. In 'Mood and Sand', Laurel offers a fun performance that is unlike the then known Stanley character ... but this film is much less fun than Oliver Hardyier's brilliant work. My rating: only 3 out of 10 Trivia Note: 23 years later, Stan Laurel's last American film - 'The Bulfights' (1945) - he played Spanish Bulfighter again (with his Spanish voice post-doubde). Eventually, that movie used stock footage from 'Blood and Sand': Valentine is not a movie, but the tireon power remake. 'Mood and Sand' is more fun than 'The Bulfights', but not much.
