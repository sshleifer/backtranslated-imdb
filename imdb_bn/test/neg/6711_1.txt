Since then two things have changed. First of all, I'm no longer a child, and the second of the new movie is the most terrible. This is the worst movie I ever played on George Claude Van Dam in my opinion. The plot of this film, this plot is just an excuse for drawing some scenes of scenic scenes which is painful to watch. I like action movies, but it's not an action movie ... it's not a movie ... it's a group of annoying scenes related to annoying scenes for the audience that loves movies. I'm sorry, but I do not have any respect for this movie. Then he has a serious intelligence problem. I hope Segal will create some good new movies in the future. Good luck to her!
