First of all. I do not look down on Americans I know many people who are intelligent people from the United States. But this movie is so bad that I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Movies are mostly away from the truth. No exception to this movie. Lots of views are incredibly false. For example exit 2 space ships. You see them drop off the entire tank in their space. Just a small distance from each other Remember that the space shuttle was exploded in the past? Just came off that part of a tinsy winsy. If the whole ship is not bigger here, then it is common to drop larger fuel tanks. What stupid 2 propositions will be raised up and do at the same time ??? Its second is a piece of Russian station (s) cone. I hate to bring you this far, but today astronauts go to Russia. Since their equipment is NASA's more reliable. Space shuttle is retired. And NASA just uses it to pay the bills. And there is no better option for this. And the whoppers list goes on and on. It's really an insult that does not take place in this place travel. And I know as many as half of these guys. But the most annoying part (Read: The whole movie) is the promotion and patriotism which is disturbed with you. My god !!!! I had to look at a CNN business commercial for an hour like. The actors solve their small problems by shooting each other, the middle fingers of which they face, start fights, ignore the police, etc. ... But when their love comes for their country and dedicates their life, suddenly Everyone commits suicide (bomb explosive) ?? Maybe there is a lack of feeling of my true "patriotism", which can sing the national anthem in Swahili. A golf cart riding wheel with George Bush behind the wheel, draining the battery up to the bottom of the wheel. But this movie was very handy for me too. And when I finally retained and dragged the flag pole and fabric of the flag of the American flag out of my hain. I'm glad that I finally ended this movie. I do not know why so good actors have participated in this narrow mind, stereotyping, propaganda film. But I'm kind to them. It represents a country where you can kill if you have money or power. As long as "Uncle Sam" thinks you are a good patriot. As everyone is happy, as long as it has destroyed another country, nobody is concerned about it.
