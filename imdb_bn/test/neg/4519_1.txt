It's absolutely nothing like the WWF and WWF's 'Attrived Era'. I've always been a dedicated WFF fan and I have never seen a glimpse of the competition. Now, I wanted to take the WWW charge on that day. At least WCW will try something new and fundamental instead of keeping the mask of the real motives of the event and it will really be in ECWO. The WWF has always happened to catch up with Hogan, Andr√© the Giant and other old wrestlers and often the main ideas of the 'Atria Era' competition. The WWT was the same trash which was already bent down and wasted. Wrestlers are scrambling the terrible, brand-split mind, and story lines and conditions exist. WWE is so bad that the characters and wrestlers can suddenly become a previous shell by holding barriers to major events and creativity. Of course, the show is sweet, innocent and easily minimizes brain-stained children and stupid people of the small, lazy, pariah, internet wrestling community, which in fact makes the company feel better. These shaws and rest on the thought that the best of these shows and products can go to hell directly to anyone.
