What a terrible film. I can not believe that I actually saw sitting there. A very, very, very, very, very unfortunate effort, whatever the redeeming feature. Haitiated Etet! The so-called "racing" sequence is ridiculously awful, and the plot was so bad, I forgot it. The fragment of the film was made in the Spanish Spa-Frenchamps Course, I think, 1988, during the actual Grand Prix time. I was there and was happy that I was not present in a paddock scene shown in the picture. It could be good ... what a misery.
