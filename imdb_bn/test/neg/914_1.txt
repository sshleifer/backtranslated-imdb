O my dear God, I was very sad to see this movie four times in my sister's house and it was not about sex and gun stories and horrible vaguely acting until you asked to avoid it in the shootout. The H. Rul only proves that he can not work Ving Rams has ever played the most horrific role in any of his films, does not allow me to laugh a part of this film or jump or feel any emotions I would be surprised that people really enjoyed this It seems like some horrific films of life. But it was never in my five bad films, the music was not good at it and the story I think was made by some people who ordered a pizza and wrote only ten bullet points and then made it into a movie. Absolutely horrible
