I see something absolutely funny --- even remote fun --- this stupid movie. An unreal, silly, ridiculous concept - just ridiculous enough. Strongly believe that the main character, which seems so clear, intelligent and imaginable, will not be acceptable in a college. Even close to a place that is even more difficult to believe. The actors portray characters directly from Characterville. We've seen many movies a lot of time watching movies. There is nothing new here. I found it on TV late at night, and since there was nothing else, I saw a whole boring, stupid movie. What total waste. If you are a teenager, you might find it fun. The film is made for a unfamiliar mind, so teenagers go for it. The rest, there is no way.
