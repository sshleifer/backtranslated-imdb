This film is much more fascinating than any other film in my life. Special effects are terribly damned. For example, at the end, when the tears are falling on the door of Concord's goods, the thing spin like a toy. Airport Special Effect (1970) is a better way than this bugger. Also, the height and height of the Concorde's power will be turned into inside. (Even if it's all open) but the movie has its best points. Most of the time when it's over. That's too sugar For example, if thigh land falls under the blurred snow, it will be broken into one million pieces. Overall, 10 out of 2 Instant flop Great smile flush
