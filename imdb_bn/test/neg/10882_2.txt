Clearly the raw feed video is even more smart than all of us who lost our money on this flick! They will earn billions of money from video rentals and they will pay a large amount of investment in low budget which will fund "second stop" (unfortunately). I think they spent a few dollars in American dollars to pay for the actors, rented the rest stop locks and burned a truck, and dragged a motorcycle behind the truck for some more technical payment for technical staff. That's it. Should we all be as smart as these guys, I would not have them tired of having good financial revenue to be gifted to a stinker promotion. The film's stability was good, and it could be a really awful movie, but it failed without providing a clear story line. I'm always looking for a jewel from upgraded film companies, but I did not find it and you would not even get it. I'm just sorry I find out $ 3.99 plus tax wasted.
