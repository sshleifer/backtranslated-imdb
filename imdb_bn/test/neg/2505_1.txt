First of all, I refuse to consider this piece of music as a music video ... I consider it a small film that uses parts of the song "Thriller" to its soundtrack. To me a music video must not be more than a song, and the song must play the full length of the video. Calling this music video is Calling a Poetry called The Great Gatsby. On top of this ... let's face it ... "Thriller" is an annoying 14 minutes, in which there are highly dated varirule converts, uninterrupted Vincent costing poems (only VP recites does not mean that it is not a link) and I have never seen it At least threatened zombies. Of course, this was certainly a cultural event, but do not forget, it happened at the same time when A-Team was the # 1 show on TV, so the culture does not allow much credit on it ... the end point of the media's impact on a music video ... What did Billy Gene and "Bit brick" add to this equation? From what I can say, it only adds some practice to stop the song for song or mortgage dancing scene for some dialogue ... so you can say that this video really encourages Pami to make even more annoying music videos. Not very good my definition
