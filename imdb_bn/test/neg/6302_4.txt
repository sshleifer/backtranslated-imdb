"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always finding out as an excellent composition of Australian film. I found it quite frustrating. The main actor is superb - Terrence Stamp is getting nicely grown, Guy Pierce will have to do more comedy instead of his favorite roles and I was a fan of Hugo Boynning because I saw him playing the Oberb before. Cinematography is great, but if you're ever near Australian outback, you will know that the air is so clear and the light is so bright that it has shot box-like films and it still looks spectacular. <br /> <br /> What is my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no sympathetic female character in the whole film. A woman who achieved her secret shooting ping pong balls on the road should qualify for her sympathy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, when they sing "I Will Bevarvaii", then aggressive on a group of the Aborigines. Drawing any kind of parallel between the drag revolutions and the struggle of the troupe and almost complete destruction of indigenous culture, which I guess, is the view that Paris Hilton shows the historical intelligence of a level of eligibility. Finally, and the film's greatest flaw is that it's not funny enough. Did Stefan Eliot actually talk about a drag judgment while writing the film? Most of those who know the drag queen (or three or four) have objectionable opinions and they are not afraid to use them. Now, I understand that many drag queen bentettes could probably deny the categorization of the film, but Elliott could have gathered enough "Suitable for Kiddies" to complete the film. <br /> <br /> So all, all well, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
