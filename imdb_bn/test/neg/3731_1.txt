Minnesota seems to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, one of the most hateful movies ever made. It must be done with a woman who has to marry a disgusting crowd. At the time of marriage, he meets his brother, Jajak. Instead of deciding to run away, they have sex at home after eating cakes. The other brother comes after the fire of his gun and he kills his wife. Jazz finds his bathtub in the bathroom and wakes up. He became a friend with Zaxax and they tried to get money together because someone blackmailed them because he saw them and body. These loops and various characters die or come back to life, but it does not come together with anything that can be called a good plot. Performance is terrific by quite a lot. Cameron Diaz, Kenyu Reeves and Dan Acrooyd. Direction, dialogue, and visual effects are just awesome. A disgusting and horrible movie.
