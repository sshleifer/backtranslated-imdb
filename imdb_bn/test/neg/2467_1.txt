At this celluloid I sometimes are stupid things away and away by. I mean, we've started to start calling it "skinmax T and A Flick", but that was a couple away from the boobs, that was. I mean, to get some sex scenes, I get the point of making stupid films, because it is the only reason for such a movie. However, there is no sex scene in this movie, and there really is no point. There is no linear time, the scene travels like a bird in the air, people do not appear for any reason, then leave and it is never explained, the plot does not improve and nothing will happen. I did not see this until a movie was as flabbergasted at the worst. Has even the director been a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I do not know, but from its appearance, he thinks that he is still working, something proud about this nasty part. I literally stepped away from the picture of this film, but I still recommend showing it, because every film in the country should be shown in the school as it should be done during the making of a film. Go from Exotic Space to Plan 9, you have a new competitor for the worst movies ever made.
