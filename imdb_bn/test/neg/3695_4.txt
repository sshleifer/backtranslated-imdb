A woman who is wealthy as helpless, has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdown, which smoothly deceives her by gigolo husband openly. Naturally no one believes in him when he has been accosted by a demon man who came out of a demonic satellite. For the happiness of her husband, this event could eventually keep her away from the event. <br /> <br /> With the very early scene, with its ridiculous news broadcast and ridiculous satellites facing you, you'll probably be sure that the only release price for this movie is so funny that it's funny. Although this sign is not too far, it is not the most obvious. <br /> <br /> This genre is different from most movies, it is actually a scientific or horror film, but indeed a serious drama which includes a sci-fi scenario between intelligent plot. This is not a good or even medieval drama, but if you do not expect a valid play, it will exceed your expectations. The performance is surprisingly good for the low budget effort and, most importantly, it is well edited and nicely paced. It's annoying and generates less interest to see what will happen next. Nevertheless, the film of 1950 can not take care of this film with title like "50 feet women" attack, for them it is still a movie!
