Oh dear! The BBC will not close its pedestal for the sake of this one time drama. I find this novel of Jane Austen is particularly difficult to portray with a modern audience, the heroine rarely is not counted for Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund to count the heart of a woman to leave a beat. But I must say that I was waiting for progress at the end and sadly disappointed. The basic stories were preserved, but the dialogue changed so much that the voice, method, feeling, intelligence, depth, and depth of which Jane Austen lost was destroyed. If some past can be seen as the date of adaptation, but its weakness must be extremely heavy ('his life a long party' ?????), certainly cast was enough, but I think Billy Piper was wrong, it needs to be more moderate, I A modest outsole could not find any impression of secret depth, she was more like a frolicking child. I will again have to wait for the BBC to knit her magic to see.
