I saw episodes about living on the minimum wage. It has gone until Oprah Winfrey's look for that episode. Weekend weekend is enough bad people to end the fight. Then these hypocrites are being exploited. I have not continually appreciated the complaint from him or other of his significant other. How do the Questen have the ability to pay their medical bills from the ER? Sure he has shown that the bill is high, but after his "disruptive" experience the wards provided the remaining money (from his own pocket). How many billions of people get privilege after 30 days of paying their bills. Instead they are hungry and "robbing Peter to pay Paul". The charge of the whole episode is not a humble thing for him. The film and the restaurant scene scary. Another privilege he has is poor people.
