It was bad - bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shot and bad audio (though I was watching a DVD, I sometimes did not hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing up my speakers, even in the same conversation). . The plot was predictable, and the letters mostly comprised of incredible neurotics, bi-pole, and caricatures. Character development was terrible ... Bratty was a little sister (why she was writing script too?), A drunken mother (again - no purpose?) Hello girlfriend (why did she not dump her a long time ago?) 'Dark suits gang' I can not think of a good name to guess), Drug seller's hot girlfriend (if your LA gangs are guessed, but really ...) etc. I can not believe I am What I saw row.
