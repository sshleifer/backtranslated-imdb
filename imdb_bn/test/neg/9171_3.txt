Finally, I was going to be a funny copper flick and saw that I was surprised to find simple direction, strange conversation, unexpected speed, unsupported slapstick gag, and overall ambiguity across the whole. Just not funny! The sets seem to be cheap, usually the best Donphald dresses are proud and confusing. Even the title song is annoying. The letters of the whole children do not come near the representation of married couples, when their job losses, their lives are inverted. In order to achieve a great goal towards the inefficiency of welfare and unemployment, filmmakers can not get into trouble, at this cruel level, Hispanic, Black and Gay stereotypes have played. The look of the film is similar to what American style of love is. It's not a compliment. Subjects Facts There are plenty of white collar stolen in this world that only carry uncertainty winds of every condition. A clever fundamental idea and outside of two capable stars in the Zen Fund and George Segal, the practice of this social commentary date is encouraged for minorities, and encouraged by homosexuals. If you want a better copper film then you are better off with George Segal and Robert Redford Hot Rock and with Ryan O'Neil and Barbra Streisand with Hots Up Doc. Now that's funny!
