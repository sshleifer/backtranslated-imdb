I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the shield. Characters are not trustworthy, as they find themselves in ridiculous situations. I was the only part of the lavish film when the most palliative character was finally killed. Special effect gory consists mostly of dead or dead body scenes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, a godding torn on the goats in the middle of the night can be impossible to believe, can be caught by a group of weird, intelligent cats. . It is equally impossible to believe how they came to know, actually the creature was caught, even photographed. <br /> <br /> The person who snaps the life of an unknowingly, is a living Dr. Pena (Giancarlo esposito). The only animal is anticonvulsant Dr. Pena her darts gun. <br/> <br /> The ship captain (John Rhys-Davies) is known as a 'veteran of war'. He used his military skills by shooting people in the ship. Nowhere does it show that the Navy does not repeat the pattern of shooting everywhere. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neil plays an insurance investigator brought to cruise ship to catch a thief. She spent most of the movie tagging with her trying to kill animals right now. <br /> <br /> The creature does not meet together with the goblins. It does not behave like one. Instead of a small, shy, secret animal hunted in the night, we see everything near Bulletproof Freddy Kruger. A simple search author on Google and special effects crew was very helpful.
