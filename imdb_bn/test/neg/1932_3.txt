This film is more on its plate than a Sumo Wrestler and the result of the audience is frustrating. There are some good performance, but the subpots are exterior and are largely settled. In addition to <br /> <br />, I found all the letters unlike them, and if you can not identify with at least one character, get excited about a lot. All in all, this is a classic example of trying too much with very little.
