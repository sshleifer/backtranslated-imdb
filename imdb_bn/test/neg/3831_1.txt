I was present at the premiere last night. The movie starts with a bang (probably due to pre-premiere excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, most of us spent the rest of the war from sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any work of the guest, unless you want to say _Sons of Provo_sense but it is a mistake. It just flattened, it died, it was painful. The story did not go anywhere, Jokes was gentle, even if you are a mormon and get the inner jokes, but it feels like a runaway of time. There were two released attributes: Karbi was playing spot! And the song is very clever (only for an LDS viewer). So, my recommendation ... Avoid Movies. If you are worried then buy music CD.
