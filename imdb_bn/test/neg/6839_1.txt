Ridiculous horror Someone might think that the stars in the movie will be able to make it a great deal, but they do not. It's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to try this movie then see your high brain function. Or, get a bunch of your most cute friends together and give it a "mystery science theater 3000" treatment. This is what I was doing in the second half of this turkey <br /> <br /> and do not confuse it with the 30-year-old thriller film "The Day of the Jackal".
