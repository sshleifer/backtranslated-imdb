I agree with most of the above critics. Still, I was surprised to see the presentation of a gay couple's love scene. Why? Because they - director, producer? Although there was no compulsion to present various discriminatory couples among all the hottest hugs with nudity and French kisses and all kinds of nude distortion in bed, they were totally unnecessary in length and in the story, at the moment of showing the same experience with lesbian moments, they were very anxiously painful hug By doing, almost two non-nerves With veneers, even the manuscripts often go on. So, in fact, the makers of this film consider homosexuality as a nationality, because in some scenes it is called a character. What a difference with the Spanish movie !! The Romance movie of Romance in Rome seems like a projection of an Almodovar film, and I was surprised to see the total lack of response to the Italian audience, they were afraid to respond !! When Spain people will get rid of their ritqu√® situations and imagined Almodovar and smile at the floor down to their seats. Obviously in Italy there is dark energy in its history, which prevents some natural and natural emotions. Mercy I must add that this same comment was censored by another journalist. When we can not allow others to embarrass or express our opinions on certain issues, it is very bad and dangerous. Where is the freedom of speech? I do not know whether this sensor will allow me to make this comment, and I hope he does not get the same treatment from some other narrow judge. Again regret
