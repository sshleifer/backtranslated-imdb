I miss the most in this movie that it does not give space for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork film without a series of stories. Many places of worship, nothing to worry about, because the film will tell you what you want to remember. Many different problems are touched, but no one works for you to remember. I do not even know whether or not to be a fun film that wants to be serious or serious film that would be fun. Many scenes are very unreal, and played quite poor. The film is quite annoying.
