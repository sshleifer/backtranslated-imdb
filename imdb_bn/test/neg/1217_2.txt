Zzzzzzzzzzzz It came straight from the "gosses" cookie-cutting mold, and some other malicious clips were thrown for good measurement. I was still interested in seeing it in a book about Italian horror films, and wow ... I guess I got what I deserve! <br /> <br /> Very slow and in Tokyo, this killer shark takes place in the land of the movie, which is not really that wonderful. It seems like the only way they were showing a shark through a shark shot in a shark. Shark is not the same frame as an actor, and it's very bad ... most of the letters are so annoying that you really want to eat them. <br /> <br /> One of the four kids' group to meet a mysterious Indian at dawn on a child, one day in the "plot" concern. For some reason, some of the Indian artifacts give them an ancient artifact that takes them into the form of a giant shark to attack their tribe ... seems to be an ancient temple because ... they were very good to fish in the sea and the ocean. Worried they will take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> This is also a good thing, because it did not know ... After a few years, a giant shark appeared and the people of the sleeping community started to force. One of four people is eaten shark, determined to kill the remaining three things ... Especially (big shrewers here) the authorities have killed a shark and they think that the threat is over. Yawn <br /> <br /> The compulsory death scenes are incredibly tiring, and you will come a mile away (my favorite girl who fought with her boyfriend when they are sitting in the van, then jump and say "I'm going to swim, "Immediately awakened by the shark waiting). This picture was very nervous called "Deep Blood" because you rarely see cloudy water. Actors operate their refreshing role like all their limbs, and there is also a lively sub-plot that involves a tropical rubber-typed bad boy who threatens our strong heroes, and then better to help sharks to kill. <BR> <br /> It took me a long time to find this movie, it is rather unclear, so I do not think many people are wasting their time. However, if you should lured into it ... do not say you were not warned!
