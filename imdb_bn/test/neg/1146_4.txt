I just saw the Christmas Lampoon Christmas Vacation 2 in the DVD, at least the original, wonderful holiday comedy, 'Christmas Vacation'. I saw something like this. You can say right from the beginning that this film is not going to be measured. It is very bad it is a title which links to the original Christmas vacation. It's really kind of sad. The film can not stand on its own merit. I think many people will see this film on the power of the title and it will not come near that level of comedians. In addition to the title, the movie is too short for the original 'Christmas Vacation' and fewer connections with Christmas than even fewer connections. The comedy is very simple and the plot is poor. Children may find some humor here but most adults only get a chocolate here and there. A flow of this movie. Do not waste your time with it.
