The film, based on the Broadway hit, failed to attain the quality of any artificial film. You can not really take the game and make it a movie. Whether this movie is so tempting by rock music to watch it, it really is not far away from the quality of a Broadway show. sitcom reruns look bad. Musical fiasco, and Can believe others rate it so high.
