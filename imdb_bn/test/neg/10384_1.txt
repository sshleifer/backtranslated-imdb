When I saw Black Water Valley Execise, I encountered the situation and the dialogue so incredible that I was sure that it was supposed to be a comedy. Some desired delivery bits are an abusive laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you he had possessed!" "Are you telling me the devil is my daughter?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story goes off in all directions and the thing should probably not be Everybody seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even pret). And I have not gotten even worse acting. The father of Isabelle is the most prominent person in this area. The director told him that he would have to get his @ $$ stick, because it gives the general impression. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> I do not want to run away from Black Water Valley Execise because there is entertainment value ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you are looking for a decent horror movie that is understandable and actually scary ... well, do not walk.
