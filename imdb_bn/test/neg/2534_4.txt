The film closes the promise, but it gradually moves slowly and finds its artistic attraction. Set designs, dresses, and music were wonderful - one can get around perfect. But the more I come into the movie, the more I felt, the entertainment of the director is not for the audience but for all these efforts. Although, I like to see it without some short musical scenes, I can not enjoy it. The director shows great imagination, but if he had fun with the film, he failed to share with the audience, or at least with me. I did not get the feeling of radioactivity and I did not sucked into this universe. <br /> <br /> It was a big reason (amazing) Zhang Ziyi You can say that he is trying very hard, but it seems he is very worried that he is almost amateur. She is an able actress but has her limitations. I saw his acting that he did not really react to his fellow co-stars, an error that made chemistry ineffective. This movie language barrier only enhances the issues. He and Odagiri worked as separate planets. He is not a very good singer who gave me time to sing, but thankfully he did not have many scenes. Odagiri was ok but did not leave a lot of impression. <br /> <br /> I do not care for individual characters. There really is a unstable lack of characteristic. The only reason for their care is that they look good in Royalty. Although it is difficult to care about what happens in the movie center except for a forced love story, The film also takes on minor scenes which did not add anything to the story and was actually confusing. I can not think because of the reconsideration later in a sub-plot after I'm doing what we're doing in the main storyline. There was also a scene where it was said that it was difficult, because it was so stylized that why. <br /> <br /> I mostly feel frustrated because I really like the idea behind it and I like it. Music and dance corography are really great. Supporting performances are typically excellent, both acting aspect and singer's fantastic. It was very bad that lead actors are so soft.
