It is painful to see that those who made this "film" never seen brilliant wonders as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is terrible, and so is the actor. They will not be able to act as soon as they face, just as I felt the time looking at rough garbage. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and does not have much humor in it. I am sure that I can do a good movie with my friends. To me it's an extraordinary one that could fail a lot of this movie. Not a single trick or funny line. No trace of intelligence behind it. This is a kind of movie and I really want to meet a person who likes this movie. Isha!
