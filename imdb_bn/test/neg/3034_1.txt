I'm sitting in less painful activities than I spent watching this picture. <br /> <br /> If you try to try it, it's going to be something to teach Guy Richie Fleck ... Think again! Production, dialogue, acting, script, film work, and plot often I have seen in a movie. All fidelity was off-off credits in my fave part. There is no good excuse for closing the TV and going out in the history of the movie and doing something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Root canal work is done instead of wasting your time and money. this!
