The Kite Runner began as one of those "important" films that most of the people had disappeared because they were told that they wanted to be among the elite and quickly turned into an awkward silly movie of the unexpected feeling. /> I have never read the book, and did not feel the need because I do not care honestly. Of course I say unbeknownst to say but I do not really have any other interest, "Drag your hearts down, get emotions from readers", copy other novels, even if set in Afghanistan. <br /> She said, I saw movies. I heard the good thing about her beauty, and how it touched and decided why? As it turns out, why was not a very good reason. The so-called main character was not completely disrespectful (I found it was young, and it was a movie about the War of Liberation, but genuinely he was awesome, I hated him and not by the good 'anti-hero' way, he was just neutral, stupid, Self-absorbed character that I did not feel) but the remaining story was so stupid that I could not believe that everyone Tata was beautiful, and how they cried, and they threw him out. I'm sorry, but I feel like doing something realistic, science-imagination has moved me, imagine ... but this? Please Too many other movies for this pure stupidity! Amir's brother, Hasan, my biggest PV ... really? Are you sure you do not close it in thousands of stories? Positive that certain tidbit was not added just to try to pull more tears out of your audience (because you see people who are crying during a movie)? When I looked at my eyes, I wanted to know that it became "sharp", knew that it could move from there (not returning to Star Wars, "Amir, your brother, Hasan," "NOOOoo, this is not true, it is not true Impossible! ") Oh, and it did not. Climb to fill the serious hole with and just stupid plans to tell the story. Like "Good man miraculously fades away from bad boy with help from a foolish boy, who, despite being sodomized with wickedness and you are willing to help with the weapon of surgery, without any hesitation." Oh, do not forget about the absurd "Finally, when you were young, you have to take vengeance on a child who was thrown to you, the surprise of being astonished, a psychological adult" (believe me, you want to live a sincere life through the film but that will happen No. You know that the child has spread you in high school ... He is not a terrorist, Sam He's an accountant current.) <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm referring to the CGI-tastika Kite! I think those "Matrix" movies and "Transformers" were equally with Bravo! It seems that this movie was made only for Western audiences, who needed a cause for care for the Middle East (this would be a very emotional friendship friendship!) This is one of the most shallow films. One I saw was bad luck, it poses as deep good ... but when you get it down right, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, America's original audience will do what they have to say and follow "so it's about controversial elements so it will be good!"
