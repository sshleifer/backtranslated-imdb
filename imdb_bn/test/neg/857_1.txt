Even those of us who love beautiful animals - and I hate them - this is a difficult way to find a talent in this unusually bad movie of a movie. Perhaps "101 Dalmatian" inspired by his smart and faithful dogs, thinks his stupid and polite people and his silent "happy" and predictable finale, alternative title "101 Turkey" springs. That would cover only everyone involved in its unfortunate production. Before learning about the disappearance of Hollywood invisibility of some of the British customs, for my horror, it was a Canadian film in Victoria BC, which was a nude British theme park in the city, which excluded tax dollars in Ottawa, before I dropped it. Canadian mediocrity equals terrible holes Let me count it the worst way. Fun Plot? Asinine script? Neutral performance and sophomoric direction? Fantastic cute cute animals? Continuous clich√©s and expected slapstick? Secondly, I do not have time to see the complete list of failures or IF failure without browsing the IMDB. Yet I had detailed eligibility, this space would be empty. Trust me, it's bad! A sign of the real horror (Canadian) film on the huge peninsula. You've already seen it, my condolences. If you are not, then you will be far away from it as a sir or a bobonic plug. Or other movies with cute animals Do not let your children see it as if their tiny minds are warped by those even small minds who are meaningful, fabricated and portrayed for this harmless folly. Probably tonight, when I retire, I will have nightmares with the terrible animals who roam from the bed table while fleeing a frustrated flight. I hope so too. I would be a much better thing than this shocking banaloglock watch. But then, I dreamed that I should be seen for a second time and its terrible terror and cold sweat wanted me to stay overnight, and the prospect of seeing it again like a bad dream is tremendously shaking. I could even find a bit to see his stead watch. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Killer Tomato Attack" Perhaps Video Instructions for My Vacuum Cleaner
