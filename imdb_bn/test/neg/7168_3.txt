Oh god The second in the book is more than a bad restoration of the original than a signal. It's not all funny, its plot has played a lot <br /> <br /> A repetitive situation is like a comedy pilot and a different diversity on the concept of "recognize God" is used which is basically a very good thing. John Denver did not return for this film, and it made a big difference. Geor Burns, <br /> <br /> Playing God, he did not do the same chemistry with that little girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I'll give 3 ratings out of 10 in this movie, but only <br /> <<br /> George Burns; The rest is not something special. <br /> <br /> If you like the first one, do not be bothered to see it.
