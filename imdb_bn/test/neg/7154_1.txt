I was looking forward to this photo. I liked the road trip thriller. I like to track gender, drugs, youth, action and a great word. And I was especially interested to see if I was interested in taking a movie tour especially across Europe. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, although the film was obsolete. The street is driving in the wrong way? Perhaps a shallow grassy ramp rolled up the van that rolled impressively? If they are so bad drivers, why would they do a delivery job? And that's just the first scene! Not too bad enough to be campi or silly. Just awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Time waste Something moved to the other side ... something else!
