I am a Praise in this review is a bit spooked by some of the reviews. Because they were not written by the same person they sound, but it has all the internal information that you can read from the cover cover story. Please do not tell me that the director has written his reviews because it would be very sad to think about them. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the fact that I hated this movie and was unaware of it. Great idea, shame on the death penalty. And it was the most disconcerting of many good actors (including those who had some very bad ones including lead lead) apparently they had appeared in different movie series. <br /> <br /> I wish that aka was uncomfortable, innovative or just just interesting. Sadly, it was like watching a strange homophobic home video with anti-ambitions. A missed opportunity
