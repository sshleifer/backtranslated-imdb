Edward D. Talk about Wood Jr. He was passionate about his work, which I would like more people to do. If we were all hopeful of Ed Wood and hopeful of being confident, then perhaps the world would be a better place. Many times I appreciate his braveness and I try to do the work he likes to know about Ed Wood's story and most surprising biodiversity "Ed Wood" (1994); I still admire his story-death attitude. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and "Glenn or Glenda," his first and most confessional film , Probably her worst. <br /> <br /> About a cross-dancer called "Glen or Glenda" Glenn is a death movie (director / writer Ed Wood herself) who, Barbara (Dolores Fuller), could love her love for her boyfriend, to provoke her passion for transvestitis. No, where she dresses up women and wear a wig and thus ... Glenda! The glen / glenda story is described by a doctor and he is talking and watching through a mysterious character known as "The Scientist", directed by Lugosi, who is also a horrifying star. Oh, and there are some bays about the character of Allan / Anna, which has become a transformation based on the story of Christine Jorgensen, on which the title of the film is titled "I have changed my gender!" Previously was based. <br /> <br /> I still have your jaw? Well, as much as I want you to close this picture, if you never see it, I will not lie about a film and I do not have a word to lie in that plot synopsies. It is true of every thing. It is a film about cross-dressers and transsexuals, which is something that does not look very interesting and is not done very interestingly. I'm sure that a good screenplay and a good director (it was not) that despite the fact that "glen or glenda" may be a very moving picture. It is a confessional film in the wood part, because it was a transvestite in real life and on screen. But again, it does not make a good movie or watch a watch. "Glenn or Glenda" is a movie, which is a diverse, unorganized mess that shrinks into the new edge of a bad movie. Bella lugosi shouted, "Drag the string!" On the inexperienced footage of stampeding bison. Most of the movies have been described in a neutral voice, reminding me of some of the worst small documentary films I have ever seen. This is one of the worst small films that stretched for seventy minutes and doubled. We sit there for the waiting ages for the plots that do not come. There is no real effort to create power while locking at one position for a long time with a camera and in one position for a long extended time, where nothing happens. The valuable moments for any time are the Lugosi who manage to bring some light to these dark arches. I think logosi may be like a god of film, but personally, I could not be less aware of what I would be supposed to be less or no. I tell you what he was: a gifted actor who wounds making trash But he and Wood were very good friends and loved to work with each other, very good for them. <br /> <br /> I always love Edward D. for the emotion of the movie. Wood will appreciate Junior, but I have ever admired his movie as long as I live. Once said a film critic Ed Wood's movie "innocent fun" but I think it's even suspicious. Innocent? Yes Fun? No sir And if the "Citizen Bike" movie world is mounted, then "glen or glenda" is probably Mariana Trench.
