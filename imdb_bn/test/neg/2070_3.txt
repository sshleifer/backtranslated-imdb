The plot for such a movie is a giveaway. You can write a story like this - how you can make a mistake in gay plot lines and all of India's colors and music. I would see several, but this was unwatchable. Sadly, white people are the most colorful in the picture. Vanessa was rioting with a face like a sailor, and Jack had great eye candy, but everyone else was annoying. Saif Jeffrey, who was exceptional in my beautiful landraet, did what he did, but the story was so annoying. Savings pity was actually background music, which instead of filming, or just fixes the laugh in the film. There are many more good gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. I can give a lot less budget movie, but it should not have been made by anyone else.
