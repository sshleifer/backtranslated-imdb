Technically hateful (with the "pop" of the audience in the scene) and strange amateur, "patience" requires many patience and probably most of the viewers will be closed; But the conversation is amazingly true and Joe Dallesandro, reveals his body in almost every view, also gives a completely convincing performance. A curio, be sure, but more polished "trash", made after two years, to proceed to a certain step. I recommend that you instead (* 1/2)
