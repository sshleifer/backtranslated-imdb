Christopher Lambert once said that he is still making movies to make good and easy money. When I see his latest release, I can trust. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actor himself is not very bad. But the plot is stupid, "Mortal Combat" - there's nothing to do, like the song, the end is really **** y ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the only good thing about it is that how my friend and mine were May laugh about reluctant. I even wish to waste my money even something else. <br /> <br />
