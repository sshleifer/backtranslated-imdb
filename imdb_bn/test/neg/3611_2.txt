Varnishing fame George Sluijer (he created both European hunting and Hollywood remix hunting) pointed to Crimetime. He should not blame for this confused, poor film because all problems are contained in Brendan Soma script. It is sick and lazy written. For example, the murderer hanging around a nightclub, begins to talk to any victim, a predator and a teenage girl. The next scene where she told Vilhen, "I told you everything about yourself, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately the girl has closed her life story and an extraordinary example of the scriptwriter to bring a character of life through dialogue. I know how difficult it is to be bloody but should try hard for a scrapplet created for writing <br /> <br /> The message in the picture is difficult to explain. It seems at some points that it is trying to eliminate the privacy of a British natural forest killer's crime (perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game MANHUNT) but the script is not quite enough to carry it. When your sex scene is found that does not indicate the development of plots or characters, you know that you've got a badly written playlist and the chromatmat is a badly written play
