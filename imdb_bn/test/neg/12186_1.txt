Last night I saw this movie, I was a huge fan of the book, and I was very happy with the version where Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon acted. But this one, it's just awful. My God, I do not know how they dared to distinguish this classic story, and completely separated the letter, started switching the little boat and the third created the emmy. And Joe explains, terrible, Joe was a feminist, intelligent and mad angry girl, and Jocus acting actress acts as a stupid and very annoying little girl in this movie. And Lauri is going to war? I'm OK with the fact that when a book is made in a film, something is okay, but the whole story does not have to be re-written. Very very bad work done.
