My wife and child were billed as bills of 2002's very own cosby show - but unlike the latter, it was unreasonable and obsolete. In fact, Michael Mikey wanders around this bad writing and Michael Mickey's inferiority and this event is frustrating that this event is frustrating - it has been seen that the show has become more tedious and annoying. <br /> <br> was supposed to have been a promising hit, finally the idea of ​​where a shit has become stupid, afterwards the idea became so OTT and ridiculous. And for the second clair, I ended up hating this character so much: Later on he became a weak, boy and crying teenager in episodes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
