Oh boy Oh boy There is a picture of Sandra Bullock on VHS clad cover and his name is written above. For the name of Sandra Bullock, I was thinking that there was a chance to sell the film in the nineties. Bullock's fans do not have to be frustrated. Sandra can only watch this movie and its performance only call you acting. The rest of the movie ?? It's fun to see it in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad but it's getting worse even after. Very bad The directions are awful. Acting horror The script is awful. The dialog is awful. The action is awful. The music is actually quite good. General score for the tradition action movie. This movie is so bad that Andy Sidrice has sometimes been produced. It is so bad that the film does not have the correct word to describe this weak attempt. But there was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (decor) jack lamota who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now bring the movie to the DVD. It can be cool! And they have to write on the cover: Hong Kong Academy Award winner Sandra Balak <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
