I'm a fan of Slashar film, especially Scrum 1-3, but it's the only murder after one. For my surprise: The second part is very good and you've got a summary of the summary! So do not waste time on this and do not move in the second part, Part 2 is really a plot and it is quite selfish. First part: 4 out of 10 out of 10 seconds
