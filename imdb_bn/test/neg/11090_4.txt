Julie Delpie played this horrible movie about the relationship of wickedness between 14th-century France's father and daughter. The film tries to break the romanticly impressive figure of heroic medieval drama, displaying illustrative images instead of time, defining emotional inconvenience and showing violence. <br /> <br /> Opening this film with a child, Franco is growing up in the shadow of hundreds of years of war, with his father telling his mother to stay safe and wait for his return. When Franco discovers her mother with her lover in bed, she takes action. Franko murdered him in the name of protecting his father's honor. Like a son, the father grew up, Franco grew up, and left his family, went to the same battle. This setting was accidentally explaining something for the incident, such as when going home, we have already noticed that something wrong with Francois. The war did better with him, he had changed. <br /> <br /> Girl, waiting for Batris de Cortmart (Delpi), her beloved father, to return to the English captivity. She was left pure to the heart and had to take care of the estate when her father had gone. In the absence of his father, Betteris will have to face financial problems, which will strengthen Better's hope that his father will save him. But, after his return, he noticed that he lost his desire to enjoy life, and he tortured and insulted everything around him. From this point, the film has been described in various ways, how Frano tortures his family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And in fact, many films about Inchext, such as Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)" is more frustrating than contemporary, which was contemporary. <br /> <br /> Deli has many bold nude scenes in this movie. Actually he seems to be angel and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes. I believe, and it is not certain that some birds were killed to create this film, which really bothered me. When the actual violence is used for animals, the quality of a movie is reduced. I hope this movie will be republished without that brutal scene. Those scenes do not contribute much to the story of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very long. Script problem. We can not see Franco and Beatrice before the war, we're not really getting the answer why he made so many changes. I could pass this picture, but I would like to mention some scenes to see this scene: <br /> <br /> * The view of a young child who is able to kill cold blood is really frustrating. I saw it the first time on "The City of God (2002)". Here, Franco kills his mother's lover, when his father goes to war. Excellent view and very graphic. * Better's scenes are raped by his father until he finds that she is pregnant, she is really frustrated and attractive After the rape scene, where Dellie was burning her clothes and cleansing herself. <br /> <br /> * Brother's disgraceful view, where the father puts food on his son's head - then he insults him and annoys the war. Later, with the clothes of women wearing her clothes. <br /> <br /> The film won Caesar (French Oscar) for the best costume design, I agree, the clothes here actually show the true movie for real time. The location of the film is Ch√¢tu de Puivert, a 12th-century fortress and a historical monument located in Aude, south-central France. Beautiful castle and mountain scenery, really helps you set this film over time. The film was nominated for 3 more Caesar awards, but they were knocked out of the heavily successful French film "Non-Revio, Les Encints" ("Goodbye, Child", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Released as "Beatrice" in New York City in March 1987. Only in France in November 2007 will be shown in France. It looked at YES3 on May 3, 2007, at 17:45.
