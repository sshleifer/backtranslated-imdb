I admit that I enjoy many movies that have a low rating on this site. I can see what the manufacturers are trying to do, but I can be grateful for their work. Thunder Sound was a story I was interested in. I wanted to know that filmmakers would attack to tell stories. They tried to make an entertaining movie. The plot is resorted to, but most workers are plots. Ed Barnes did not know what to carry a rifle, but he still is not considered to be considering his own good work. The main problem, the whole movie is destroyed !, is awesome CGI. It's very fakeo soooooo look completely unacceptable for animals and backgrounds. As well as animal concepts could have been really good, as production fails, but production fails. It could only be a memorable film if they had finished it only. They seem to go back and just like all the awesome CGI fixes but out of the meaning and still release it. Save your money because someone fails this movie. It could be really good because I give it three stars, but completely failed, I could not say enough anywhere.
