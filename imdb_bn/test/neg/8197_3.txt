This is a movie which was probably created to entertain middle school, primary high school age children. Perhaps it is funny to them, perhaps it may look a little awkward. To me, acting is poor, and the plot is not so much value for the poor, adult audience. I saw this picture as weak and annoying. Sometimes the movie was likely to be interesting, but it was not really implemented. Animals look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they do not seem to have other substances without appearance. I was not sure whether the film was trying to make any other attempt in the comedy or it was another attempt to frustrate it again. This movie was not just good for me.
