Diversity critic said it was "overwritten and overlong", and I agree with it. This is some incident that seems to be forced and unlikely, such as Cal (Crudup again 'lost, empty, and dust male again' as male) and Julian Moore found an incredible place in a map of the United States. This story was one of the stories of the "man to find meaning in his life" in the 1970s, and I myself saw Jack Nicholson playing his main role playing Cal. The whole "hit the road to find meaning of life" theme is still interesting kind though. Does it all return to the family really? I was not so sure. Actually, I especially like Karen Allen and James Legs, who unfortunately only support the role. I want to give it a 'five'.
