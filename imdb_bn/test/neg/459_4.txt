Twenty-five hundred years ago, the last pirate pirates wrote their names in blood and fire on pages of history. It's a fool captain's story, whose name was a year of terrorism in the heart of the seafarers and businessmen from the Caribbean port at the London's London homes ... <br /> <br /> Hmm, the film's opening is something we think we're a ship I am for hell, the pipeline, the movie is not a reporter? Well it's not. It is not without a full price as a Curio piece. Outside the 20th Century Fox, Philip Minié and Arthur Caesar adapted the Anne of Indie from a short story written by Harbert Rennell Sass. The direction of Jacks Tornur is providing photography to Franz Wexman and Harry Jackson Technikola. Jean Pietersen played the title title of Anna [Aka Captain Providence] and the support comes from the trials of Louis Jardan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> With clichés and fills on the set pieces known, the film is also a throw that is mostly misfiring. Peter gives it a good well, and screen lights with elegant effervescent beauty. Although Robertson's jurisdiction, though implicit, actually shows the part and does not function properly as the rest of the male. Some critics have tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and secret meaning, because it is direct to Turunur in the director's chair. But there is no depth here, it's just a work for a professional tuner, but it's actually a slash lack for its slimly designed and functional part. <br /> <br /> The best disposable 4/10
