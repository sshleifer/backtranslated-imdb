Spend your time in any other way, even civil war is better than this movie. Curiosity is not funny, do not have that fun rhymes in Dr. Sais. An evening waste is a very lousy way. My kids 4-16 suddenly smiled a little bit bored with her and sat for playing Barbie and Puronora sat in the PS2 game and surf the net. My wife is not left and dish. So I ended it alone. It was the worst "kids" movie I saw. If you want to watch Shrek 2 for watching an interesting kids movie, that is fun for kids and their parents in the movie. Avoid this movie. It's not funny, it's not funny, the cat's makeup is just about good things in it and you can see it on the disk label.
