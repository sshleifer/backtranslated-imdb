I have been in the digital divide directly in the DVD sequo, where I hope cots are cut in all cases, which is a good animated movie which is very rare in the original. It is not a horror film that is a very middle-class film that is intended to show the love of friendship and love for each other, and until clearly (which it is not here) will be quickly grating for adults. Cranke tries to win his father's approval, and the film has a very thin plot line trying to find the true meaning of wealth and success. It has comedy moments but it is not enough to carry full-length movie.
