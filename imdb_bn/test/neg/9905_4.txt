The first two hours of the television version complete the character and plot exposition - after a brief overturning at the beginning of Las Vegas by Tornado, the work does not start until the second two hours. Still, some character relationships are not cleared up until the second part. Actor enabled performance turned on, but nothing special (however, "Aftershock: New York Earthquake" is better than those). An exception is Randi Quaid, whose character is essential and incredibly annoying. This plot is an excellent map of "Independence Day", "Speed", "The Day After The Day", "Earthquake", "The Towing Info" and many other movies. You can predict what can happen in the future, and you can predict the conversation, the word for the word Special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects of "twister", the tornadoes of this film seem less realistic than "Wizard of Oz" and other effects are definitely done for less than the series "CSI" and "Cold Case". Totality of single episode If you see disaster movies for the made TV, instead of "The Day", see "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" - you get better plot, acting and impact.
