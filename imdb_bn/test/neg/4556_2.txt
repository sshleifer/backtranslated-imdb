This image was so bad that it became enjoyable. If you want to see a soap opera cast, you have to make an action film, it's for you! Overacting, irrelevant events, impossible dialogue - it's all in it. The main character has a divided personality and can not keep his mind on whether he is a thief, loving or hero, who is risking his life for others. He is legitimate in any of these roles. These other characters determine the value for a lot. The company's boss shows the same unpredictable whose building set is lazy, and so is his wife. And the punch line - who has taken "chips" - the beggar believes. I find myself heartbreaking and because of that, I recommend you see it.
