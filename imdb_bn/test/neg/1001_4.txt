I was very happy to see the big fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking the Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (general), and in this little movie, by Rupert Everett (Delmont Dempo), which was so much more than everything else. Very short scene in which he portrays a wealthy, infinitely entitled, spot-on and entertaining on the spot of a wealthy Lord's vain lord. But someone who was a little chemistry for a love triangle spoke among someone. The music was of a boring movie-of-off-week quality, and voice-over jerking and totally unnecessary. Obviously for a first time with a small budget, the manager's job was not enough or lacking enough. very bad. <br /> <br /> I can understand how I hate you at the beginning, how you like it at the end, and on the contrary, so there are some types of stress, at least in terms of perception. For example, when Watson's character was refreshingly honest for her husband about her feelings for her husband, she began to draw closer to me, especially when she had announced to her husband that she had no control over her actions and later easily declared that, He will return to their marital flat without asking permission, no apology will be sought. And I would like to make Wilkinson's handy / moral relativistic character of his control, and instead want to change him (differently to his wife). <br /> <br /> This movie is not strange about a story of "love story" or "steel magnolia" sickness, from a lady in a strange way, so I misunderstood how long the next plot was published. (What is this car driving? The dog of the dog?). Where is the scene of meeting with Wilkinson and how daring Watson It can be seen that any deceased boyfriend can never know, Florence Nightingale avatar, etc. until he raises up like a child, good god! If you ask me if he has given me a lot of time in the hands of a rich man in his hand, So he drives his hard work, makes his wife crazy with unnecessary drama. Another one to empty his life The way was screwing around him; The dead man was an extra bonus for him because he put his previous work on top of the blame. <br /> <br /> If Wilkinson leaves him for his secretary, then everyone is good. He praised him for whom. Instead he works like a puppy dog, his open desire for his wife's affection increases with each kick he gives to him. I'm not an anti-PC or anything, it's not true, even after considering all the hard facts of the medieval age, we all face it. The last for me was (and the director's intent I'm sure) depressing. The film lasted about 80 minutes and believed me that these two were not together, so I did not enjoy any promise of their relationship. I'm not impressive by a story missing my passion, it's just a little more reasoned and must be hacked. Who is asking too much? <br /> <br /> My Score: 4/10
