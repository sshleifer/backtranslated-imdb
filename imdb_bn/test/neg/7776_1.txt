Terrible terrible movie for television. Lifetime brings us the expected triangle; Another foolish man's fool has designed a wicked woman to find an intelligent wife who has no clear information. <br /> <br /> I can see these movies. You can ask, why do I see them? I do not have a formula. Generally wrong. And the movie is so bad that I will not get out of here. I wait for the bitch to get her pence up. And generally I'm not satisfied with how he gets his dessert. <br /> <br /> Now you can trust our vixen, he steals embryos from the clinic, and how does anyone do that? Without blood tests, DNA, search and recommendations. He is going to kill the realtor, Gabriel Rose, who is with him, in front of the house in front of the house, no one else sees him in the daylight? He killed his mother, Susan Hogan, and you can predict this guess when the mother suddenly mentions her allergy to the chicken and her pockets of drugs dealing with this allergy are in her pocket. Guess what I will not continue this. <br /> <br /> Finally, she was alone in the house with wife and anxiety. Good victory triumphs, but very slowly. Victoria Pratt's role as evil girlfriend is enough, looking a bit too disheveled and obvious. The Tori spelling is mostly standing around looking for blank. It looks like he's got big bets Davis's eyes, and he's going inside his head. I'm TRICK her best choice. And Tahmoh Pinkyak acted as husband to assure his wife. He and his ex-girlfriend have nothing to do, although he watched him kiss all over the city, when he sent his wife to his wife, he was half naked with him. The city to stay overnight. Yet he continued to deny romance. <br /> <br /> Lifetime does not disappoint viewers about their ripe plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands. I want to give this brown a "0" rating.
