I worked at Memorial Harmon Hospital (TMC) and worked at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston at Allison. At first the hospital shots sadly in the suburbs. The Texas Medical Center has a density population density like Wall Street !! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. Before being doubled in size, TCH was the largest child hospital, two! Methodist, his 1500 bed is one of the largest hospitals in the world. Texas Medical Center Skylline is larger than Memphis. However, the best images of Hollywood are somewhere in the middle of some weird hospital (without the original picture of the hospital taken decades ago). Also, they combine several real life characters and portray them all as one (super-nurse). I actually know the medical technologist (s) working in the blood bank. Actually two works at that time, but the film only shows a pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT, and another MT accepted the valuable patient's antibody Rhodox ("Alloventibi" research for more information). I will not mention their name (privacy). Real-life lab scene had no nurse. Hollywood mixes these two technologies (likely to save time and money). In the movie, the military helicopter (true) must be transferred to our children (NICU and PICU) in all the ways in Galveston UTM! Why can you ask, when we just have big children in the hospital down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refuses to accept them. If you read correctly, they are REFUSED !!! Being appointed by them, I was ashamed. Saying, I'm not affiliated with this facility anymore. Any other comments will be repetitive to people already posted by people who actually live here, or live through experience.
