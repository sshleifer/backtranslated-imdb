Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swapping graduate plans to hijack a casino, Ala "Ocean 11" and pin it to Helles Angels. Bad decisions For a movie featuring Hells Angels and 62 numbers and Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly transparent. The Hells Angels really deserve a good film centralized around them. Do this snoorefest Fortunately, it is one of the DVDs that combines Joe Bob Briggs' comments, so the pain of sitting through it is very few. If you look at it any other way, then advise me to do something for you. What not !! <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Joe Bob Brig's commentary; Elbow Van Dyke's message to his fans (he's more than once?); Photo gallery; Theater trailer; And "Black Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop", and "The Hollywood Strangler" trailer
