Doug McCulla has played some of the series produced in this British-produced series and it must be the worst. I know that for the time being Future has its critics, but at least that movie features location photography and relatively good production maps. This problem with this movie - production values ​​are "so bad they're good" crossing the love zone and "so bad that I think I'll go and see what on the other channel". <br /> <br /> The first scene in the case is a cruel cruising and McCullum facing a demon. It is painfully clear that the monster is an average person who has become hideous on the rubber giant, which is going to be 20 feet tall by the project behind the backward. It has become more painful that our hero is trying to escape from the demon by walking around the scene. Did I mention it one of the more firm set pieces? It does not seem to have been portrayed in the living room of any person, except that there are left leftist leftist in the year's budget left. Even the former doctor said. Peter Cushing was a fun line of blood and what was, "You can not make me embarrassing - I'm British" is distributed very flatly (a very similar line is spoken by ugly in appearance), plotting and memorizing a script in a memorable dialogue. It is not just disrespect to the conversation that even after talking to the monsters, it is incomplete and rare. It was not bad that bad guys like Hanondas like Warrants of Atlantis, so they could explain the plot. Does anyone really know the plot here? <br /> <br /> A very annoying British movie that could not save the twin genius of Caroline Muno. The complete mood of the film is summarized by the final order involving two keystone police
