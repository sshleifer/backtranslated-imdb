Maybe you have to be a former hippie in order to fully appreciate, because of some date fashion, music and dialogue, it is nothing for this today. <br /> <br /> Four fun loving college artists enjoy unprotected days with nude model painting and motorcycle riding. They take acidity in one scene and go to a zoo. A sign was flashed on the screen "if not given to animals" and suddenly they laugh at a cage and hanging from a chain tire swing (?!) An evil artist (Larry Swansea) tells flashbaza how his industrial career was almost destroyed due to almost helpless hands . He sent black clothes wearing jambe henchain to kidnap people, then injections them with a serum that distorts their face. He's trying to create some abstract work (I'm guessing here, the given statement is a bit light, it's lightly kept). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) came out to save his friend after his friend Scoti (Chris Martel) died and his girlfriend Jeanette (Eugen Wingate) was kidnapped. I zombie make-up in Zombie Lake was awesome, but wait until you see it here! It's Douglas Hobart, star's death star. A minor role is played by Z-Classic Blaude Funker's director Brad Greenter, which is much more enjoyable than this deadly dull Turkish (House of Nighttime). Unnecessary Note: The 1984 Rigal Video release has the wrong cast feature (direct video label for the video's bleed) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
