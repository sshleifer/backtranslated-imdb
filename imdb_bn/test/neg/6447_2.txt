I rated the one better than the terrible because I had seen Jonathon from some banner again - even if it had the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the idea is short, but a whole movie. The writing was forced and concreved. Secondly, Aman Bane always looks like his eyes - even when he is not trying to do it, I still think. She is not just funny. She always plays a little muffin girl who wins over her disappointment, Amanda always feels curious. I really want to see her something serious. I really want to give him a chance, but he always throws the role of this trit where he wiggles and makes the face and that's the best thing to do? Finally, the whole "I'm a dark" segment stops the revenge of the nethers. There was nothing that was unpredictable in this movie. <br /> <br /> shame, shame, shame
