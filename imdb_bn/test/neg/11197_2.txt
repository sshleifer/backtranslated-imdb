Come on, come on! There was such a wonderful possibility in the film, but it seems that they went out of money to finish the script, and telegraphed the movie's entire movie about 2/3 seconds. Characters consider these movies as a complete cause for existence in other characters, who did not ask for information about the most intense courts. They also fall into some of the stereotypical behaviors because it must be expected in this genre of the movie. This is really tragic because this movie can be so much. <br /> <br /> I'm really expecting it to be a good movie. There were some good acting. Mark Hammel did a great job until the film was reduced, so Sally Stewers also did it. It was fun to see successful in their work and their craft. Majandro Delfino was good for a while, until her lines became turbid. I felt sorry for him that he wanted to say these lines that shot only the credibility of the whole film for the viewers of a thoughtful movie. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. She really has an amazing range of judges from her other movies, I saw recently, lucky 13. (which was a piece of nuts). If this guy can choose his exact script and be lucky with the right director, he might be a star. <br /> <br /> Around forgot! The music was so heavy that you could think that some small films were transferred to the project. I call this type of music "teller music" because you can tell what's next based on the music. Sometimes less. <br /> <br /> Cut half of music from this movie, get a good movie editor, a small rewrite or two and it will be a very good movie.
