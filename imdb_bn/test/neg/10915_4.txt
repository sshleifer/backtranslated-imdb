I'm not mistaken, I love Stephen King! And a pretty good movie on all of these. Wretched Kujo is very scary and the film is suspicious. But after the first few minutes, the poor Donna and her little boy Tad were kept in Pinto, by St. Bernard, I started thinking why he did not do anything to help himself. He could have stuck his legs outside the door and could push the car behind (I used to say that it was a pinto for Pitt's request and they entered Dhaka) and were walking around for safety, but it was a very small movie. . When the car started, did he pop in the opposite direction and hoped he would take part in the driveway at least? No, he tries to turn three points in a car with a bad alternator. He came out of the car and looked once in about 45 seconds and tried to find a baseball bat near the ground - how much time wasted! I mean, if you're going to run to bat, do this and at least there's something to hurt your dog. But, forget the bat. Was there any equipment in the car, like a tire iron or something? I do not see the car looking good on its spare tire. Frankly, unless you bite until you bite and become weak from emissions and your son is sterilized before standing against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film he was beaten and burst, but God was still wearing high heels!
