There was a disappointment to hell. It was not near a B Western film material anywhere, and should not be comparatively compared to a gorgeous movie like Silverado. The conversation was dust, the plot was intense, soundtrack was excessive unnecessary, and the act was awful. Even the pros can read some from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing of this movie is that it has displayed some of the country's top cowboy shooters, but you can see them in a better light in a SASS video. This feature packaging is very enticing to it, and the preview is decent, but after all it's after.
