It is clear that for this photo they wanted the story line driven by character. But because of the story line immediately you dislike the new main character. The following islands and dinosaurs did not have any effect on the flyover and it was almost like a cartoon. All activities on the island are only repeating the entrance passes of 1 and two parts of 1. The storyline is anticipated at a boring point and it has become completely disgruntled and I feel cheated. This image is no other than 3/10!
