This has got to be the worst case over acting from silent era. Just one or two actors but virtually entire cast. Lee was humorous and Bo Sawenson was fine, but the rest looked like their first act. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not uncommon. Most dresses and sets were credible, but many things to viewers letting our audience know that they can not double to check or get all professors to meet with time. <br /> <br /> I can not think of one aspect of the film that I do not like or cut my head. Your time will be well spent on burning lamps collected from your bellybutton.
