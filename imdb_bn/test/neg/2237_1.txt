I went to see movies because my boyfriend wanted to see it and his friends already liked it and liked it. So I came with a neutral point of view, I really do not expect the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I got. I could write a 15 page paper why it is easily the best movie I ever see. But for your benefit, I would suggest a continuous supply of professors and disasters. At the beginning, the performance was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines that were laughing, and some suspicious scenes. The sad, well-played, little humor and mystery is the end of the good points. The whole start story could be great. A Jewish girl's family is ugly, she goes into secret, after facing the person responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge Sounds very good But the film will not be enough "satisfying" for Americans and Jews to seek Nazi blood. I have no problem in the killing of the WWII film or the Nazis; I saw Defiance and liked it too. However, this is the way and attitude that will kill our heroes. I'll give you a prime example of this movie's kind of smog. Our Hoodlum gang attacks a German unit and kills / kills the sergeant and everyone except the two soldiers. They asked the sergeant to publish information from another German unit. When he "respectfully resigns" to betray the life of his fellow soldiers, they play baseball bats, cheerking and sweating with headache and playing football. They took the head of Nazir, John! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here's a fantastic situation: A group of American soldiers is captured by the enemy by attack. Following the same scenario and the American commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. Shake his head with many celebrations of the enemy. If this scene was a movie it would infuriate an audience. The American soldier was a hero to keep his man above himself, and those savages brutally killed him! Okay What about Nazi sergeant? Well he claims to die of a Nazi and cruel death, is not he? Eventually, Nazi Jews felt the same. See hypocrisy? By celebrating the Nazi slaughterhouse, we keep ourselves in the same compassionate level. Major hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis killed about 300 American soldiers and made a campaign film about the German sniper. Pictures were released at the end of the movie. Hitler and his colleagues roam in joy when they shot an American soldier outside the window and fell into a fountain. After the soldier, the Nazis are as good a soldier as soldiers. This view is supposed to enrage American viewers. Those sad Nazis are sunny on the death of our brave men! Well satire, is not what we are going to do (or should be) full time, we see the English Busters? The smiles on others' pain only because they are "bad boys". How do American Americans create a hit film, how will they feel, where they take bloody retaliation of American settlers? Or does Blacks glorify the Nat Turner rebellion? It's okay to have hypocrisy errors. <br /> <br /> I will minimize other reasons for rating 1. 1) There was to see commendable characters throughout the movie. Brad Pitt tortures a woman with a finger on his wounds, because he suspects he betrayed him. Is he a good man 2) Tangled far longer than the scene. 3) Brad Pitt's South, the supposed Tennessee accent is a complete and completely annoying way. I'll leave 700 words now. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it seems that the general population will not think, they just want blood. And this is why this movie got so high ranking. I recommend this movie for the ignorant, or if you are a Jew and want to see only a wonderful "imagination trial". Personally, when I was finally leaving the movie theater, I felt I was skeptical (or I think I could not bear more than 2 hours of emotional rape).
