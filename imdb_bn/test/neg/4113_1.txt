Man, I went to this movie in the great preview. It looked like it was a great story and had wonderful special effects. <br /> <br /> The boy I was wrong. I wanted to walk from the theater because of those terrible special effects. A cartoon dino from the cart board will work even better. The story was good, if it was taken by a big film producer. Who will trow some more money to make the impact more life What I liked about this movie, where the trees pop up everywhere. <br /> <br /> Two characters on the street, one place, even worse, If you see those cars you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4x row! <br /> <br /> and then "Butterfly Death" which will set the whole "evolutionary change" in progress. If that person does not go to the butterfly, whatever the next Dino! So that's the absolute bull. Therefore, if you make some changes in the past, the same will be the same instant in the future. They did not create "wave of time". But hey, if the future changes in a split second, the film will be even worse, but more realistic. It's just one of those movies when you want to get a great smile. I spent a lot of money in this movie in the theater. And then they told me the budget of $ 80 million in this movie. Where is all the money ????
