Now do not make me wrong. I do not like bad movies ... No, I enjoy bad movies, troll 2 ... .... painful, manos, luck ... go to torgo, mad make guru .. medieval background Traffic noise? OK, so it's clear, but it's a film that's pretty obviously trying to do something well, but it did not make it. Why not Well blame the plots will be easy, but hey we look worse, there were not many holes and I know it does not have much originality, but then there is no need to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the whole scene), the monster is okay, the truck is quite boring, so where was it wrong? Well, I want to blame Harley for the appearance of 'Chris Moyle' ... so I will! Comedy and horror are difficult to make bad comedy and horror worse, and there is a problem. I kept this man from his mouth (in the literal sense), the constant humor of humble Adam became annoying, so annoying that you lose faith that the fewest people will not react by pushing him from running cars. Door ... and I thought it was the giant bit that the director wanted to trouble us. Why bad movies are fun? Well, you get lots of fun in them, all the jokes in the script, all the jokes. This movie does not create greedy division of 'worst movie' because it is bad because of boring nof Do not get bothered, you'll see something else and you'll be a good person ... I promise!
