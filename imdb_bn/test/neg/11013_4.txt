If you really really enjoy fading films, ant-brick eating, and a voice-over narrative, you can enjoy the movie on the world, but it's a movie for you. Basically, some scientists working from the bio-dome try to contact the highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actor in this movie) as well as try to break congress and elimination plans. Two scientists (and a girl who was rescued from insects) used everything (computer, green color, and terrible acting) all over the film, but it does not help. I think they could not spend any pesticides because the film would end very quickly. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is something of mystery. It's not a spoiler, but the "phase I" starts right after the credit starts, when you do not reach the "last four" until the last credit roll. Obviously the director knew that the film can be kept in phase 1 through 3 phases gradually from the sequential stage: "Stay there! Only one stage till the final credit!" As an MST3 episode, it was not very good for two reasons: 1) It started with QTM season 0 when they were initially beginning to be not good during the following season; And 2) This movie is not so bad, even J & TB can lighten it. There are references to one or two gamma, because they finished the reflection of the 5 gamer films. <br /> <br /> This movie is a trick / wonderful ending, but I was very happy to reach the end. .
