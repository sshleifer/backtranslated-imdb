Who Russell did not manage this weird (too much) boyfriend thriller and if I did not know that I was the director of Brian Depalma, then I could have dragged my life. Everything about the crime of passes screams to Dappal, from a minor cinematography, which is a little more brilliant, a local story that becomes a straw and slash plot, even the title "Daplma, Daplma, DePalma" <br /> Unfortunately, Brian Depalma has been increasingly seen as a poor man, Hitko has been passionate about imitating Russell's own style for years. Should not try. Certainly, a erotic thriller in the style of Tommy or Bill Dollar would be bizarre with capital B but at least it was a unique movie experience. The story about a dangerous double life prostitution and a drowning of religious persecution was a very common scene in the 1980s video market. Oh and Anthony Parkins played the same role in almost every movie they made in the 1980s. Yawn <br /> <br /> The only issue for any real note on passes is controversy. I think studio's most happy people did not have reason to hear it because no promotion is bad publicity, but for controversial sex scenes ... no controversial sex scene? The only controversy in China's Blue that I can not remember is that with the Truchian dominated the police force at the duty. Not saying he does not come quietly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
