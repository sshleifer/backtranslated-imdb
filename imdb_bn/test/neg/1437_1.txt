If you're easily offended, I do not recommend showing this movie. I did not even even get angry and this movie disappointed me. It's very annoying. And it does not make sense. All internet things are so cliche, and the producers probably did not understand all the "Internet rules". When you chat with someone you can track their IP address. Really? (See imagery here). It was stupid. Meaningless And I do not even see the end. I can always say "it does not understand, this is not ..." This movie is pure shit at its best. Excellent comments are correct?
