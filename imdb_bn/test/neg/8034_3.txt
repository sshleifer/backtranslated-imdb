Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; But since we now have most of her best films actually led by late Mario Bava; It is clear that he was not one of Italy's most gifted film makers in seventeen years. This picture proves quite simple that despite the simple plot; It's a wide mess and above all, I want to say so far that the tragedy is more than Freder's groin's Gialo effort, with the fire world, Euguna. Fred apparently denied this movie, and I certainly do not blame him! Just follow a bunch of plots and run petrol anywhere in the middle. They happen to be in a house while searching for fuel; But it might be a bad choice, the owner is just going to manage a devil program ... Hmm. The film plays a major role for Camille Ketone, who is going to absorb your grave's classic eye spots after a few years, but failing to make an impression here, despite acting acting with talented actors. At the end of the film there is a beautiful scene, but it is not really enough that there should be eight minutes of tidium to reach there. I have high tolerance for Italian films which are not sensible - but I could not decide it too. Miss it, miss nothing!
