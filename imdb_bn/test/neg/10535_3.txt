I saw this movie yesterday, and most of the algorithms wrote "I have also hoped for Steven movie", God, I love this guy because his war style is unique and very tragic. There was some doubt because I read that "Joe Rule" is playing it, but I hope they will give him a sunny role, so I will not be bothered to show him. And the opposite happend offcourse, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what hack is thinking you are going to join a sry *** crew like this. Steven was needed to break and cash? If you like Steven Movie, please avoid this, its pure drama, you will only have some special effects that gave me 3/10 votes. But Jassa's "acting?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hopefully Steven will be happy again in the future movie. People are not too valuable to hire this simple thing. <br /> <br /> Bad and kittens :-)
