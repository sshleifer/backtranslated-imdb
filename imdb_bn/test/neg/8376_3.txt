I'm not saying to laugh at once during this joke. From the opening scene, our hero Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) disables herself, with weaknesses, and neurotic disabilities to deal with the lowest responsibilities, such as maintaining a balance of checkboxes, keeping her words, or making a coherent thinking. I think we are encouraged to draw on his weak weaknesses and encourage him through the process of getting out of depression. I think we are sympathetic to him because he was frustrated by a series of enthusiasm created by dog ​​purchasing, but he was actually brought by his own humiliating nature. I never received a slight indication that Solar was never the character of a freedom fighter, which failed to feed the dog for a few days. I did not expect any radiance or shine of humanity to realize that he never realized that his life is so hungry because he was embarrassed, self-pity humble life. I do not develop any connection with this character. She does not care, and so am I not. I really want to kneel him down. At one point <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the film. It is used only on a coast, neglected, shocked, humiliated, alluring and disposed. So be warned. Although the title "dog" is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> The role of Scott Canes is as fun and trustworthy as the best friend / cad. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of her on the screen. Mena Suvari was delightfully boring. Lynn Collins's "Heart with Stripper" role was good, but the character was weird and clicked together, referring to zero chemistry between him and the rebieser. <br /> <br /> <br /> Romantic? Hardly Comedy? If you say that
