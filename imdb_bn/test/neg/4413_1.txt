I saw it in a movie film in North Park Theater in San Diego, in 1959, and I was 11 years old. It was the three features that were shown that day. <br /> <br /> Because I did not see it, I wanted it because I was a film buff and I'm terribly overwhelmed with great, good and average movies. <br /> <br /> I am most definitely aware that a more sophisticated audience member, between 8 to 15 year olds, is happy with the giant smile of the tree. <br /> <br /> In a theater showing three adventure movies, a 11-year-old triple bill does not forget anything, but I can not remember the names of the other 2 pictures. (One star George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> Update: The other two films of this triple bill were much better. In 1959, George Montgomery and David Farr played and "The Agrie Red Planet", in 1952, they were "Watcai" with Gerald Moor and Noor Hayden. Good morning Hayden wrote a few books in health and fitness.
