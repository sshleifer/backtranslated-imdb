Star Trek Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek's Final Frontier is very bad. In this terrible continuation, the crew received a signal of difficulty when the crew went to the shore when the angel representing the Earth, Romulus and the Kronos (Klingon Home Home) was kidnapped by the rebuilt Volcan Bent for his quest for a starship. Venture in great barriers. There, he hoped to find God. Using mysterious and bad writing, he agreed to betray the enterprise's senior officials to betray Kirk and take possession of the ship. They do not reach a div-like tribe where they reach great barriers and find a planet. It's hard to determine where this one is so bad. A good idea that the core does not really improve. Wherever a man has gone before, the plot can not go anywhere. The authors often did not have any idea how to finish this Fiasco. There is no secret of anger in action scenes, the view is annoying, and humorous old. Now I will pay attention to my wrath on William Shatanar. When he takes a managing chair, then ego increases. Most of the focus is on him, Speak and McCoy, but not enough for others. Moreover, Shatner is generally convicted of acting in previous films and television stains, but in this case it is simply bad in general. Now Kirk is helpless, a real trick, and stupid. Out of the worst scenes, three leaders sing a song "Ro Ro Ro Ro Ro Yu Boat Boat Boat" in a round of a campfire. In any case, the worst of this Star Trek franchise. Instead of five, I gave three to ten.
