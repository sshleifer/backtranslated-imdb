What a disappointment! I enjoyed John Claire's book about Scotty Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and the cinematic melon. In the book he is not a city detective who has dedicated his wife and is involved in fisticuffs. The character has been torched for the film, in an outback copper using his boxing, and is not contrary to a fantastic girl jumping on the bed, although I do not know if she and her other sexual interests can not be seen; Taylor was 39 and his face was leaky. <br /> <br /> But Stamina's character is awesome; He flew from Australia, apparently went straight to the commissioner's house (instead of trying to arrest him during the black tie reception), protects him from the murder (in the process of fighting), takes a girl to a casino, takes it to the page and bed with the other. So much for the jet lag! Returning to the commissioner's home (showing good street knowledge behind London), he got beaten by bad guys, but still till breakfast! It is extraordinary that the commissioner has miraculously repaired his aircrafts and headlights within minutes of the assassination in limbo, and a character's watch has sensitive beliefs within a specific period of active bombs. <br /> <br /> The best thing is that Joseph Bottler is disdain for helpless Malone. And at least this film escapes from London's travel, although some scenes are performed in Wimbledon Tennis Week.
