Invite a visible silent young man to his apartment in a rainy season, young Spinster, who is not associated with women of his own age, and keeps the eye of the gentleman from a retired set. Nervous and hugely humble to hide his own sexual insecurity, he is very happy when he excels himself in the bedroom house of his guest ... but when he opens the window at night he is not very happy. Sandy Dennis is not an innocent actress, but why is she attracted to this sad-paved role I guess I guess we do not know. Depending on a book based on Richard Miles, and as far as possible away from a commercial drama, this dirty material has not only attracted Dennis, but also director Robert Olman (whose work is the best, steady). This story seems to be a gender-retro of "The Collector", it is a tag that has sold movie rights, but it is not considered as a conceptual form. Even the best sequel of the movie (Dennis shopping for prostitution to please his wife) even played mostly ill and angry (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Barnes is very good, who used this drunken, glamorous sick woman for his comfortable pillar, but he managed very annoyingly by Altman, a strategically established toilet and meat-colored Andy (Altman was clearly unprepared) at this time a mature with adult theme For photo). Sandy Dennis has a boxing scene very well; He is not silently distracted here, he thinks before he speaks and he cautions his actions carefully. Unfortunately, the role itself seems to be a bummer, an apparent slide in the mental disaster which happens to be off-screen. As such, abnormal finishing is narcotics, and overall results tepid. * **** to 1/2
