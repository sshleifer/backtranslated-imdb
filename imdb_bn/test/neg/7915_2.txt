Ruthless voice acting, second-rate animations, concrete and non-funny songs (though the bid was feasible by the team by the davil), and the time 99 before the plot was less plots than the land: fossils in the parade. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I did not see the first picture.

For a 'heaven' flick, this was the only good thing Devil. 2/10.
