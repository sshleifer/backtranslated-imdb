I saw this movie 20 years ago and there was a rather memorable memory. Looking back at the cinemax this month, I realized how smart I was after films. This is the most typical Spaghetti Western, nothing remarkable about it. Script, direction, acting, photography are all a big blah. Sergio Lyon sticks with the West!
