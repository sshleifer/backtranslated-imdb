In most cases, "Michael" is a disaster ?? Ten Minute Kisses and Nine Blind Steps <br /> <br /> Travalta and McDowell do their best work, often with Nora Effron's vague script above the scripts. But the film comes like a snack. And even in the context of his imagination, the characters behave regularly indefinitely. (Reporter who regularly gives the story of a lifetime? An angel living in the world from their perspective?) <br /> <br /> Someone has forgotten to say romantic comedy Maestro Afron that William Heart, many other bright films, Tom Hendes. The term "climax" of the film redefines the term. Effron may be shooting here for Heaven, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long, long ride through the movie hack.
