I saw this last night and to be a fan of the first giants, I hope that this Sigelital will have the same funny, amazing attitude of its predecessor. This is not unfortunately the case. Set-up is the same as the first, in which a group of monsters can break into reality by getting rid of a horror movie ... (The first was a movie theater, an apartment building and on TV.) Once the monsters were released, madness and genocide ensues . As much as the plot develops, it is much more. In the early part it worked nicely because of the horrific make-up FX, fast speed and unpredictability. However, the seagull does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are many letters that we do not really care for one way or the other. If they were annoying or stupid, they would certainly have some kind of gratification when eating at least hungry / demonized / alive ... but these types of people are just waiting to kill. Plus, most of its letters are in different parts of the apartment building (and beyond), they are constantly enduring them, which has kept me out of the story. There are some fun bits, splatter fx and courtesy of camp. For example, blood drops by constant construction of a floor, like the constant flow of the other, as the other was as alien acid ... the greed of the first non-verbless birthday girl destroys its entire party, and a terrible giant child blurts on its way. Pregnant with a child in a rented room. However, that sequence is a ridiculous looking rubber giant baby doll thing that bursts from the child's chest of the human that continually flies to its intended purpose throughout the room. I got some chocolates out of the scene, but I do not think Bava's purpose was. The scene probably worked well, if they kept the child's neighbor only to attack the woman, but hey ... the other little things do not help the subject of extraordinary acting of bad dubbing and characters. In short, I was driven to watch the irregular version of the DVD and can not imagine sitting in all the ways with the previously available R rated version, because make-up FX and gore I got the only thing from it. Also producer Argentina's future hottie girl, Asia is a primary role. In fact, he probably gave the best performance of the whole cast and he was just on the screen. Argentina / Bava fan may just want to test it to see it, but perhaps they will look at their watch as I did. Gore's fans may come out of some FX, but bring the Little Selwin out of his / her chair from the dead / living to the most insane carer of the baby doll. You could make bad, but it certainly did not live up to the original.
