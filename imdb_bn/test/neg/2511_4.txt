Desert alien body- snatchers Little blue rocks that are made from cheap plastics. If the overall story is not bad then the acting is not so bad that it is so bad that it surprised me that some of them actually entertained me on x files! And special effects? Hello ?! Where do they get FX crew from their secondary school? I mean come; They can do a lot more! It was amateur and very basic. I did not particularly enjoy it (and my dad was sleeping at that time!) And of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady! Its so generally and highly anticipated. Bleugh !!!!!
