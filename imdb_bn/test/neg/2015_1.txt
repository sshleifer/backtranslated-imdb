Regards from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This first movie comes from the head after watching "Cinema". <br /> <br /> You know, I saw many bad movies in my life, but after seeing this I had only two questions: 1) Was this just a parody? br> 2) How can people create such things? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this "film", but actually it is not really bad "film" does not know what it is. I mean bad. Script - are you doing my fun? The acting is so awesome that I'm having fun in this movie where "actors". I know, this "B" movie, but came ?? Will this be a reason to be such a garbage ?? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what a last !!! One must miss the end! Just wait when you see the worst thing you have done - because you have never seen it before the end (and I hope you will never see it). <br /> <br /> Avid this movie at a price and do not say that I warn you ...
