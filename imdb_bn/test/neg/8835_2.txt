I have no idea how commenters can consider it as a decent B. Western. Or how a commentator said that the conspiracy was more consolidated than most. Nothing can stay away from the truth! This movie is a huge non-sequitur! This is a slander to the western filmmakers of the 30's Best Artist. I've seen Wayne's early Lone Star and Republican Westerns, and it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Bad guy, known as Shadow - weeps aloud! Initially, Shadow's schemes hold open-sided coaches. Together, its gang rustles all the cows in the region. Then they decided to move on bank robbery. To do this, they have to paint the city with a machine gun - why it is not necessary or no explanation how he got a little nano toy! <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Shadow is usually generally a typically bad guy with all kinds of evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He provided his gang with his instructions through a fake wall-safe. (The nose is called, who?) She is obviously clear, because when her pregnant people need to talk to her, they push the wall safely, and PRESTO - she lives there. (I can imagine that he confronted them and said, "You have given some secret, overwhelming instructions to me about the bad things you did - fill me the wall safely and I will give it to you.") Why Shadow was to contact the forces of his army Most of the elements of this mess were never explained, why it is safe to be explained. <br /> <br /> She has a pure tunnel, convenient point which covers the road across the road, to execute her many baddies killings. There is no hidden panels hidden in the hidden panel behind fake security, but outside the main cell. <br /> <br /> The back of the back of the back is hanging on the back of his cow on the back, between Matlock We learn that he murdered the mason's real owners - two brothers - and took an identity. The daughter of the dead brother recently came from the NYC (trial by her dress) of 1930, and she has never apparently met her original uncle, because she has even cheated him! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wear black hats and good guys white hat, you will see this movie. Here, good guys throttle their hat on the white head band, which they think they feel they have suffered before taking a shot! It's like a game of pick-up basketball - only the wine surrounds their heads instead of closing their shirts. <br /> <br /> All of the surprises are finally finished. Immediately after defeating Shadow and his gang, we keep looking at Wayne and his wife (in-house nephews) enough to see the verandah in front of their home. (Do not remember that there is romantic romanticism.), Playing with Yak Owen's 3-4-year-old son, dressing in clothes! (Hugh, this is fun!) <br /> <br /> Thanks to this nonsense, Owen screen became a legend. Only a super star (packer or not!) A film resume could surmount this entry Long stay duck!
