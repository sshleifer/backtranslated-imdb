Although not really terrible, this movie has mostly been damaged and drawing incredible errors and revisionist pictures of Beach Age history. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Actually, a character does not develop without a one-dimensional parody, but it's a TV movie that you expect? Mike Love's Fool is All It's on Turkey because he is the band's painter and the role of resident talent in attempting to re-write history with himself. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> Plus, music is excellent. In contrast to the Bio-pick "Summer Dreams" made for the previous Beach Boys, this film actually features genuine Beach Boys' music instead of the animated cover versions ... Also, it combines rare rareness related to Beach Boys and rarely surprising numbers - Hair track - but an example of the sun "I live for the sun". <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on American Network TV. Part one is the best two and the first day of the boys and the development documents at the top. Turning around two times, the character of Brian Wilson has become a perfect cartoon and the actor seems to be laughing - but how can anyone take this whip seriously? If you are not a Beach Boys fan, you probably will not get much more from this movie without a very dangerous and one-sided view of the band's history. But then again, if you are not a fan, why would you see it?
