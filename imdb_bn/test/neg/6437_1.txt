If it is classified as London's 'real life', then the producer must be on different planets. <br /> <br /> This is the most depressed, suicidal, dark, dingy, TV dragon. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> The distance from reality. <br /> <br /> About this program, I can not say a good word. The only thing that will be a big fight on Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even characters are completely incredible!
