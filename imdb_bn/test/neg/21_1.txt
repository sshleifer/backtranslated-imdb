Bloody birthday is a complete rubbish slasher movie from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I think acting is very good considering the film trend and its obvious low budget. I do not know what's going on with cinematography, but it looks terrible. The way is too much-involved. Perhaps it's a bad move to DVD or maybe it's always seen, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There are no freedom fighters to talk about. A few have died but really glorious. I would not be bothered with it if I was not you. The best thing about the DVD was a 15-minute interview with producer McRosenberg, which was very fun and honest. The director was not good at talking about Ed Hunt, and the film acknowledged a failure, but he wants to rebuild it because he thinks this is a suitable plot. However, in 2004 he died so I guess that would be another person to take that challenge. I am not surprised that what has been going on in the past few years, at least one one per week is reproduced in the movie. It may not be worse than I think the original but I can not care less whether it is rebuilt or not.
