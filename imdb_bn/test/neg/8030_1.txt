This is a movie that I have almost gone out of, and my friends are not with me in the movie theater. Generally, if I do not like a movie, it seems that it is still valuable to the person sitting in the end. In this way, you can really claim it has been given the chance to free yourself. But with the million dollar hotel it was so horrible that I wanted to finish the experience very quickly. I think that if this movie is made by a lesser director then perhaps I would not be so frustrated that I usually did not like it much. But coming from the Wenders, it was more threatening to see. I know Bondo, a good friend of Wonders, who wrote the script in this real movie, and I wonder why Wonders allows him to be friends as a friend. "Staying in the job, bouncing", is a sentence which is easily springs to feel like this mess. A neutral and transparent effort to come together as a torch-torch, crooked, and courageous stereotype of every possible contemporary movie, I've always looked at the eyes, especially the cell phone, Jeremy Davis, Milan JovviÄ‡ and. Mel Gibson, among which I do not normally dislike I could have finished the happiest time for a nuclear bomb to drop it on their joint heads to finish it as much as I could. On the positive note, the first five minutes of the movie are very good, a very provocative soundtrack from U2. However, the opening film of the film, the rest of the film (which has since taken a spectacular nose-dive) all frustrations due to the frustration they promise for the filming quality, which is sometimes not delivered or even stopped.
