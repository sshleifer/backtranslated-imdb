Jizz, this was very annoying. Leading people (Christian Shoine) have got to be the worst actors I have ever seen. And another thing, if the character of the film was ten years or not in America and lived here for more than 20 years, then he would speak a lot better than what he had achieved here. Or say "Skikkelig Gebrokkent" in my own language. But the Norwegian duo in a Hollywood made-in movie look great. This shameless hack was just a shy shame. The story itself is medium down. I suspect that this dream of Christian Shoieen was just for a dream, just as he froze a beautiful babe after another, clearly in the film.
