Love and human bodies directed by Danis Arkansas are their helpless repressive films, because it is completely different from all types of movies through its carrier. Creating any other film is not a matter of objectionable, it is a problem that is a masterpiece of a film full of tunes out of the master. Some mysteries have been created because the movie starts a good note. However, what the image shows is a relentless effort to create something meaningful as Arcand shows us half a dozen oddballs, those who connect with each other in life, show bitter letters. Sex and homosexuality is not a result here. The more annoying thing is, in a fix related to the feelings of the crimes that are related to each other and their feelings of sex. A movie that wants to see some different Denys Arcand movies will be of interest to them. All, of course, would not be too much for the film.
