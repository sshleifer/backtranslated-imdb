I thought that Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie until I saw this psychology. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and looking for a movie for about one and a half hour. We saw almost every movie we created, we could not find one. We decided to see less budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring unexpectedly clad women. We finally decided on the Last Slam Party. Oops, we made a mistake. It seems that this movie was portrayed with the cheapest camera which can be found in K-Mart. Actors are sorted out as a Salvation Army, and Steven Tyler. We just have to leave that imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. Spirir alert when there is no mortgage in the movie watching. Then all the events just come to find a dream. This movie can be about 30 minutes. If the camera is still zoomed on the shots and the walls are scanned, then it is much smaller. I can say I was not happy with a single pic.
