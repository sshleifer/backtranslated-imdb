There is only no rental quality about this image. All right, some of the clothes are okay, but they can not see anything, because of the Fan. And what's with her hair? I can not believe this is part of the series! I will say a word about this movie: It was considered to be bad for a religious wind by the initial custom of MST3 and I recommend to anyone that how bad the movie version will look for the film's moral support. Nothing else.
