Although this picture was right. I do not think it was fantastic. It was too slow for my taste. Many plays, but not too much steps near the end of the movie. This film was originally a dramatic film, with the repayment, if you can call it but not the end. To me, dam scenery and city water flood scenes were fine, but very brief The film itself has been made well, acting is good, but it does not do it for me for a long time. It seems that the very small mystery or tension was created through the whole movie. At least it seems to me that the other reason is that I recently saw '10.5 'and its series of '10 .5: apocalypse'. 2 big budget "event movie, which, in my opinion, is very hard to follow, especially the impact and demolition scene, I will give the killer flood rate: 4/10
