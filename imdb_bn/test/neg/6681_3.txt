I was interested in this movie because a beautiful video has been made for someone with a clip "Bihloreteite". So I saw the movie. And it's really stuningly beautiful. Animation is a Best Composition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not hold up. It started with attractive platinum lines of people visiting people to grab Rose Bride, but suddenly the elevator was filled with water and kept hiding their walls, people went away and finally without any reason, Utena turned into a car and ensues a highspeed chase. <br /> <br /> I liked many anime for the ability to create an alternative, but this universe is just stupid. You're going to watch this movie, turn on the word, it's even better.
