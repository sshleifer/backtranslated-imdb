I think the movie was on one side and I recently saw it and found the documentaries of western filmmakers who were impartial without material. Actually prostitution was not present everywhere in Tanzania on earth, but due to this fish business, there were prostitutes before Russian and other businessmen reached Mawana. Poverty in Africa actually leaves Tanzania in Africa and it is not due to the fish fish business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to help their families with their aim. This movie is just spoiling the good picture of this calm loving country. While filming on the authenticity of the filmmaker, the film can not be proven to be a real weapon for a weapon in the face of criticism, it seems that trying to prove their points using few letters is really something else. Yes Tanzania is a poor country Yes, there are prostitution and street children but they are not the product of this business, it is only the common scene among the western countries and even the poorest countries ... What is a junk? <br /> <br /> Pilots themselves are asking to send weapons to Angola, which is about 2000km south of Tanzania and the war was DRC located miles away from Mvango, the director could not prove how the weapons were sent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> <br /> The blue nail lake did not reduce all other species. Contrary to the image of the image and more than 25% of catchments in the lake Victoria decreased, others have eaten it locally. That one lets get right.
