In this terrible effort of a Blair Witch, several African people go to Africa to investigate an animal named Huff-Cast. It is clear that there was no script to speak, and everything was fixed. If you have a good actor, it can work, which does not make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying to achieve points for the originality by exploring more obscure myths and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the bushes where the characters are "playful African ingredients" like eating elephant dung. Lion has some beautiful footage (from the National National Geographic perspective) but there is no fear in the whole film. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Cubby Holocaust or Blair Witch project, then this movie will not be a surprise to you, and perhaps you can see the lion's footage on the invention channel. <br /> <br /> Certainly a half-aste effort. A note from filmmakers: Boys, please let us all save our home movie "How did I spend my African vacation" for the next time your family and close friends. Nobody else wants to see it.
