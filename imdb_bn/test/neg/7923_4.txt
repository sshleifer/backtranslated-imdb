Movies like these do not need sequels. Part of the benefit of Don Bluth, who walked away from Disney, is that they do not have to bear the endless title of their straightforward animated cash-in sequels from straight video. But apparently it was a great idea to make a sign of "all dogs go to heaven", so we could get it. <br /> <br /> Charlie replaces Shane Burt and she's not really good. Most films are a poor excuse for just one pic and it's almost as dark, different or not entertaining. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the future generation, who will suffer endlessly, Hollywood did not like to have a time that depends entirely on the successful character, until Bilal could express shit. <br /> <br /> Please, do not want to sign a picture of children's films.
