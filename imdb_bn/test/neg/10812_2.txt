Take your video camera, turn off all the lights in your house, and the movies are running around half an hour flashlight and you get the original idea of ​​how this movie looks. It is very annoying to see such a movie. To be fair, there are dellight scenes at the very beginning and at the very end of the movie. I like the scary movies and the characteristics of animals but this one is not just something for me. So sorry I really tried to like it. Other than having to find a way here we do not seem to have much of a plot. I did not learn much about any of the letters, so if one or two lost by the side of the road does not matter. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" now retains this title.
