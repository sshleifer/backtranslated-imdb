The film suddenly closes a lot, the use of illustrations and simple short clips reveals a larger story, which usually requires more than one budget. However, as it continued, my thinking has started, combined with an over-exhaustive husky MacPain type voice over the movie, is not starting to look so good. I hope this was only the role of the story. <br /> <br /> The story really caught me and took me to this movie. The idea that an empirical scientist created a virus that actually protects the infected cells from other infections was an interesting scientific concept. Then things which most of the malicious disorders were discovered by the scientist and suggested for its human examination, I thought it could be a very small film. Yet the launch was not good. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Although the acting was not extraordinary, there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the film, and the recordings were well done with different mixes of characters. But this film fades through. They were not used again after a few short clips, and I felt that there was a chance to miss some extraordinary character development by reflection to return to them, but it was not. <br /> <br /> Imagery becomes isolated from growing stories, often repeating to represent something that is happening. This disconnection and repetition is reflected in annoying and confusing commentary. It starts reciting the word after another. A short, silly sentence and someone reading very relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. If there was something to describe, four or five words would be used, it is very long, repetitive, round, looping, ... you got the idea. <br /> <br /> Now it can be confused and reflecting on the character, slowly being caught in your thoughts, angry due to lack of food and water. It really made me switch from the whole voice and at the end of the movie I saw that I could not hear some rings. <br /> <br /> Many times that an event camera looks one of the other characters for another after their response, which seems somewhere in the confused and thoughtful. The same scene repeated from the same scene, for example, a character sleeping in black colored sleeping, then again burst on the sleeping character. Look, we've fallen asleep in character, we know the time has passed, please proceed. Overall many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots for time to meet. <br /> <br /> The acting was not bad, and the characters were correct, but not absorbed and developed. There were some really cringeworthy moments when they were interacting. For example, when one of them is hungry, he asks that the camera shows them and a group comes back to the shot, they break, look at each other, the camera goes back and says "no" slowly. It raised a snigger or two. Their dialogue was gradually or completely unnecessary, there was no middle ground where the dialogue took place. <br /> <br /> There were some good scenes, but they were really tough until you met them in isolation, and it seems almost like what happened to this opinion. The film has been shown in a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> is not seen here more than the main story. The character is infected with viruses that kill animals, which are being engineered for them. We have been told that it develops at some dramatic level and so what we hope for. What we find is that the letters loaded together, throwing them together, pouring water from their mouth in an intolerable stream, then they all can sleep, all these steps happen at the beginning of the movie. Then, how do they all say "good" together, and this is it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This discovery of a serious change in these characters and by adopting it, it can improve these characters, show their decisions and Shows things that connect to the characters shown in Flashbacks on the interviews. <br /> <br /> Finishing is not even thought to be confusing, stimulating or provocative. It only shows something that can happen and that's it, although it's long, in the style of painting it has a voice over it. I really fought with this movie and saw a few press members (including a famous TV critic left in the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but I was sorry for the lost time.
