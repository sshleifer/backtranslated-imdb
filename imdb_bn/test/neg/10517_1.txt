Everyone knows that the late night film Oscar is not a claimant. Fine I mean, I'll accept a few tips and bored and I get some skin-a-max. It is quite bad when the TV Guide makes the movie fun in the channel's description. Even it gave half a star. To be perfect, I throw the whole thing because the people it was soooooooooo worse. I could not laugh I mean these words are coming out of the mouth and how they are trying to be serious. Most of the time I think people are trying their best to not laugh at the screen. Actually I think one scene they laugh. Still do not have movie cinema. It was like Sopranos episode with a fat gay guy. Only great show in Sopranos. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, sex scene just outside of 90. You know that using shadow and silhouette instead of meat. I gave this flick a two reasons why it makes for a good drinking game movie. I mean with all the cheese, it helps to get wine. If late at night and what's on TV is a tiny little guy and his exercise bike, then I would recommend Tony Little.
