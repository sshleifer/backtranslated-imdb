This is a very bad movie. Anyway, I read that it was made by a high school teacher, so maybe it should be given for at least one TINY bit of spirit aspiring (yet awful) special effects. The plot here: a monster appeared in a pack of trash and pollution in Milipitas, California, and started a destructive devastating attack. I'm wasting a "great surprise" about how the genie looks, so read the rest at your own risk. You have been warned! Look like a demon, wearing a gas mask like two tires. In some scenes, an actor dressed in a costume of the monster. In another scene, the giant is made by stop-motion animation. Acting terrible The dialogue is terrible. Special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. stay away!
