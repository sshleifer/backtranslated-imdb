Humor is a very different thing and the audience's preview preview audience enjoyed it more than I did. I found it a spiritual affair, representative of the old-fashioned ethnic humor of Australian film in the 1960s and 1970s. The boy did not meet the girls' plot due to the lack of chemistry of Lucy Bell and Nick Zionopolis, when I found a thin smile on the ground. If you want to spend your money on it, wait until it does not wait for the video.
