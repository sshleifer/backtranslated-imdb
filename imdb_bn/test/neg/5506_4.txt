I'm not able to think of Frank ''s attack' in the "One hundred days of Sodom" on Marxis D. Side. People (in this case women) abduct to serve as a privileged elite slaves? Check out. Kinky sex? Check out. Tortured with torture? Check out. Will random hunting victims be selected? Thank you so much for Franco. Do not go to Hogg and recognize the movie viewers in the joy of Coppola (and indeed Coppaggi), another distortion that will reap the crops in the tedious long and annoying sea of ​​Saud. <br /> <br /> I hope this picture will fall into 'so bad' section. But even the naked meat and numerous sexual violence units were also not frustrating for the dialogue, the horrifying act, the confusing plot and the tin cap - Dubbing and English sub-titles (one belt and braces from the women's clothing). Alsation though gave a very professional performance. <br /> <br /> Of course I could be wrong about de sade angle. Finally, I did not understand that the actor was a trans-sex playing 'Head Warden' in prison. Future people will pay more attention to the form of hands. According to another critic, this image was banned in the UK. Well it's definitely nothing else, though I think the nipple-tunnel scene has been cut to satisfy the sensor. The DVD I saw was clearly visible in the Spanish trailer (which you saw if you were thinking it was compared to English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also has an interview with Jess Franco, though you need a better Spanish than I understand it. Unless I am misunderstood, it's not a dub or sub-title. And it mentions that the actor who played the role of Franco was unaware of Ajita Wilson with a Moses. The kind of malicious, that (s) he had given the necessary appendage to move to surgical.
