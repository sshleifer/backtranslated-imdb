I think myself as a fan of Jess Franko and her trash film, but almost every time I see one of them, I only miss a chance and plots that can not play well. This film, unfortunately, is no different. Franco added the playful theme of the classic film 'The Most Dangerous Games' with the help of ordinary brand of its normal brand crash, but the film has the potential to be most likely, but the plot here is often lost, and for Franco it takes forever to get the round point of the movie. Later on through Franco's film, you may be forgiven for thinking that the director might be better, but in reality I have seen that there is a reverse fact; This and the terrible 'killer Barbie' are his two worst films. The plot focuses on a stripper and his sleazy boyfriend. The couple is invited to a private island by a wealthy woman and her lover. However, soon they found that they were not invited for social reasons because they got 'release' on the island so that rich women and their friends could hunt for their games! <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this picture of what was the first cover and it was King of Sled Flickr. If you think, then, I would be pleased that this movie features most of the features of sex scenes and general puzzles; But I'm not. The reason for this is that in most cases sex and sex is annoying and most of the time I provide the condition known as 'inch fast forward finger'. However, seeing my end in all my trends ensures that I had to lump it. There was a time when I do not think the girl-girl may be annoying, but I have been proved wrong since then. The positive subtract is very interesting only if it can be removed from the film, and despite being stupid foreign pop music; Very good blend with the actual sexual scene. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; When the plot was finally going on, it was too late and, unfortunately, this is a very unimaginable film. Overall, I only recommend this movie to those who can see the 180+ Franco movies in their minds ... Everyone else should be killed in Vampires Lesbos, Faxless or in Execise instead.
