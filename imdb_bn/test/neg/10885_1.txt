The only good thing in this movie is, I now have a movie on the worst list. If compared to all the other terrible films, the rest of the spectrum will stop. Indeed, this movie is the worst plot, the worst movie, what I wanted to do throughout the whole movie was to pull my hair and the writer and anyone who made this movie a possible ass. I'm an appointed soldier, and when I spend watching my favorite movie like this downtime These people should feel terrible, that they had to monitor before they left before, and it seemed to be rediscovered that they would be lazy again. I am so surprised that our great country has allowed us to do another one. Actually, for the first time I commented on a movie, I had to tell the world to waste their time. Delete this movie from the face of this planet. It makes us sad.
