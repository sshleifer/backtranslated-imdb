Now and again, a movie comes completely by accident which makes you doubt your closest. We just started reading the novel "Northgar Abbey" in the school and decided to refresh our memory of this humorous trash with BBC adaptation. <br /> <br /> Interesting thing about North Germain Abbey is that you actually want to kill yourself. The film is nothing like a book, for example, very harmful characters have become transparent stereotypes. While playing Ishwala prostitutes, John Thorpe looks like a leopard on acid. Catherine, the main character is God's most depressed stupid and boring actress in the world (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes look like basketball), Mr. Tilney looks and feels like a retired porn stunt. The plot completely closes at certain points in the movie, I do not know what the director is thinking, because there is no reason, the 7-year-old black child, whom we have never met before, takes the main character. Cartweling started out of Abel and in front of him. Yes, okay, cartwheeling. Such nonsense is sometimes interrupted by Catherine "imagination", where she is being taken around a cathedral through an Agaar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That is, the BBC has originally discovered a new way to kill anyone. One of the most ridiculous bad films of Uttara. Do not see it until you get into a padded cell.
