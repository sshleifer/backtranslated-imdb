I love a good western movie, but it was also more like viewing on stage or in a work at the local street carnival show. Hope this can stand for 38 minutes that it will improve, but it got worse and I had to finish it. Each actor line read directly from the script or the cou card. Lines and actions did not have much forecasts, such as a natural phenomenon or conversation. Rachel Kimmes Wig was clear. American American sisters playing an actress, may play non-local part and may have. Native Americans may be looking for clothes better and a little more authentic. If I decide to see it with a friend in the future, I will do so with the expectations of looking at the amateur amateur comedy film, not with the expectations of good Western observation.
