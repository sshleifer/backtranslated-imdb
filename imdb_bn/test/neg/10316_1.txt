I bought this movie from $ 5.88 billion in Walmart and broke my own rules. Basically, if you have a big star in a movie and you have never heard of it before, it is usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, because it is frustrating! They plastered the image of Sandra Bullock and named the entire lid of the DVD by screaming and kept this little fish right. I was thinking of donating a charity disc or giving it to the library, but I do not think I want to make someone else in this movie world. The worst line: "What does the army friends mean?" "What does your parents mean?"
