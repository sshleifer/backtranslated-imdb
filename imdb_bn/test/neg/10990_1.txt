I had a different experience with this movie - it was never shocked, fun or funny for me. It is a big source that the label did not give any indication of the spoken English in the film because it was not your standard film. The other was a lack of subtitle choices. <br /> <br /> I think the lack of dialogue is annoying, especially when it was often with extreme expressions with facial expressions. The inconsistent development of the weaker conspiracy was surprising. Was there letters, or only vague gestures? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm asking you to correct the "Conversation" spelling with the proposed option of "Dialogue". Perhaps this movie is completely designed to puzzle or surprise it, including part of the IMDB, but I'm more annoying than being surprised.
