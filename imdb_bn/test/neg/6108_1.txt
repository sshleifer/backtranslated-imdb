As a writer and a restricted Orthodox Jewish woman, I was given extremely below by this movie. The conversation is hackneyed and damaged, the letters are aligned very well aloud to the lines louder, those who are truly textured are not allowed to expand. A trick musical score tries to create silence, forced the viewer to knock it silently and silently to stop the script with the lasting catonia. <br /> <br /> As a teenage revolutionary on an autocratic character, this image has been blown away by the wisdom of its revelation - patriarchal mistakes - and thoroughly its strength, squanders hammering this point. As a result of the complete lack of artistic crime imaginative development; Moral crime is to reduce personality: martyr and symbol.
