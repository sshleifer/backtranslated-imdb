A trash classic! Basically, what we have here is that some American teenagers (a man, a woman, both of whom are beautiful people) seem to be mentally attached, so that they fall asleep each time, they can live in each other's dreams and express their sincere desire to each other. .. think Mills and Boon fills the files and you'll be somewhere near the mark. Indeed, it is one of Ed Wood's famous bad B-movies, and especially in the silent episode of Melrose Place, like an unhappy hybrid, special effects, and so many amateur performances. The actors who live in (I do not say the law) say these lines are their lines, as they are going from cou cards and jute when they are supposed to show an emotion, and it is a great shock (or can not lose) art) because they fade in obscurity Has been there. The overall content is simply a ridiculous mix of styles that can not be taken together altogether, and the end result is an interesting curiosity that will be influenced by the old people of the film for years by a doubt. Come I'm probably the only person who commented on this movie, but if you are reading and seeing it, please come back, it is alone here alone ...
