This movie is one of the worst remakes of my life! Acting is ridiculous and Karnan has not improved his piran since 1978. Especially 90% of special effects were taken from Paraneh (1978), Up of the Deafas (1979) and Humans of the Deep (1979). It makes Piranha second: it's a spamming look like this on the American Film Institute list.
