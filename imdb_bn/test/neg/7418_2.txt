Unwanted ... One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story looks really original, but it was poorly screened. Lance Henriquesen, a good actor, ends up in this shit. But, he made a lot less budget movie ... you have to pay the bill, you know? obviously fun. Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this bunch of stupid actors. Sincerely, Andrea Roth was just the scene of nudity, and other actors ... well they were there. Continuous editing was a fade-out fade, and that makes me sick! It was the most awesome step that came just and it made you angry. It was very predictable, annoying and slow. This is a malicious Tempo which is just wrong ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not say anything more ... do not rent it or buy it. If you can see it on TV
