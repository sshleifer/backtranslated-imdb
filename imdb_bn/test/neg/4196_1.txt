Shami Walker, a man with an unlikely name, shows his two daughters for one and a half hours in a field ground. The whole plot ... of course, the bad performance of the whole board. Walker roams around the shrine (ma? I found it! Ahhaha ... not funny) and saying, "girls? Where are you ?!" About 1000 times Whenever he is driven by a pumpkin, for some reason, a chipmun word is flushed (like a pumpkin laughs at it, yes okay ...). Her daughter shouted for most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream (perhaps they are still stuck in this horrible movie?) Twin girls directly show every one of 'The Shining'. Most cranial grains look similar, so the findings of Walker are very old. The filmmakers understand that there is nothing for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they imagine that the camera shakes quickly around the camera, reverses the film, using the red lights of the same shot in different corners, the terrible appearance of corn, and 360 degree camera rolling ( At least I think they were deliberately done, but it is probably the most inefficient Examples of error). More often, when Walker is roaming through the road, you can not see his face. I think the camera containing the camera can not be elevated ... This movie gives you a new perception of 'Dark Harvest' (which does not have to do with this film, its cornfield apart from its features). And do not be fooled by ratings. Walker said the term "F" three times and now we have a "horror movie" The cover is not seen in this movie ... and when you want that Chesy scare will come back from the first movie, you know that things are bad! Instead, we found a guy in the yellow boots pursuing our hero (unfortunately he was dressed like Mr. Walker, so I did not understand that he was following for a while). Long before the Walker I found out the identity of the Yellow Boot guy (almost 2 and 2 of the movie is almost finished). The film ends and ... and if it is not slow enough then some slow! The last word you hear (without your own smile) is a very bad word-dubbing. If you can not say, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they did not fulfill the promise of other signals!
