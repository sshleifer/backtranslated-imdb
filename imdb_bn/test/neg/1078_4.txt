I was really frustrated by this movie. It's great actor and potentially a great plot, but it seems to be just tall. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was skilled in his role and beautiful, but 90% of his work was done on screen. Finished with Austin Minis in the car. Product placement is wrong, so wrong. <br /> <br /> the direction was closed. Edward Norton was a bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the beginning. Each time the camera will cross him, it will take a long time and Norton Greise or something will happen. Mom, Hollywood, give us a little credit! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was less than just average. I was always one to praise the work and talent that I have always been in a movie, but this was not the only one.
