Rebecca De Morne can be an impressive beautiful actress, but if she does not say anything beautiful for the parts she has been given to play ... <br /> <br /> <br /> One of De Moran Described as a woman who had a terrible injury as a child. My father is now growing up and now he has grown up. She suddenly got shiny. There is a relationship with Bendarus, who we suspect is being serial killer (ouch! How real!). Sometimes he remembers Bendarus' mother in "Mary", the character of Legal Tipper Header. But I do not believe that: Hitcoch has died fourteen years ago and many rulers are trying hard to replace him. Here the director pulls all the stops to a thriller with an unexpected end, but ultimately it's almost impossible to finish. This movie must be closed for the mandatory "silence of the Lamb" series "Conversation with Serial Killer", murders (people and cats), split personality, and more calls for the crowd. Probably they did not, and they were right.
