This film starred Ben Kingley as Frank, it is an injury to some Russian mobsters outside Buffalo. She is a raging alcoholic, and this has reduced her work performance. During the strike, he fell asleep in the car, his uncle's uncle sent him to San Francisco, where he could join the AA meeting and get a job as a mother tongue assistant. If you think that it does not give any sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse Well, it really gets better, but it's not too bad long ago. Frank suddenly became a Master Martian despite the complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people at the funeral home and AA meetings were interesting. Visitors began to route for him by targeting positive changes for his life. A welcome link as a sponsor of Lynn Wilson Frank, although he has almost nothing to give (his character tells us that he is gay, but it does not have any significance). The film revolves around stereotyping with the introduction of Tea Leni's character. She is completely unrealistic, and as the role of interest in love for Frank Flounder, there are two actors chemistry together. About the time he comes to the film, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. Its characteristic is seemingly random; There is no harm in his behavior. Comedy is low-key and only occasionally funny, especially frustrated by the desperation of the descendants desperate. <br /> <br /> There are lots of problems with this problem. Kingsley's pronunciation is terrible and inconsistent. It is an alternative in Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the film, Frank told many people that he is a Hitman (with a full intelligence group), but nobody takes care of him, or wants to do something about it. The film relies on Clive scenes to carry through its final act, especially when Lenny's unbeaten character throws Frank at the airport, only then can he go on a journey to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a strong consistency and an interesting first half hour, the movie quickly became a complete disaster and devolves in complete meaninglessness. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year's white. Hopefully many years of hope, "you will kill me" do not expect to celebrate many years. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
