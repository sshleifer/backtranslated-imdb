If you are not a fan of the 80's and you have to be particularly strong fan, or have to be one of the two leads, then there is nothing to suggest about this movie. <br /> <br /> The story tells others, the concept of dull, basic concepts and a little mental comedy is almost a thought. I saw it in about an hour, hopefully it will become a corner, make a turn or it will somehow enter the gear but not ... it is not unreasonable, it is simply lazy. It goes by A bit of walking around the crazy, shaky foot in the strange corner, screaming like crazy, but I did not get the power or emotional real feeling, it just became compulsory. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh, especially. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If anything happens, it is actually closing ... two women Lead, fine, great, drug dealer woman, okay, their landlord is a landlady, okay, their friends are ladies, okay, we just look at the other person who lives in the same building, oh, woman ... I I did not look, but after a while it seemed that the film did not do that A conscious decision has been made to make the decision and it will be felt again and for some reason. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of 80's fashions and culture, lots of plus-side And if you're a fan of Helen Slaughter, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. There is some screen-time for Carroll which is cool, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you are a huge fan of the 80's, you buy Helen Slater and Carroll, you can stretch it up to 5 because of it, though it's still a trick which is not funny, which it halts enough. If you are not a fan of those things then you can create 0 because there is nothing to enjoy here.
