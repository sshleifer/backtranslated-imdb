Do not make me wrong I really love the "art of the courtyard martial arts", and I am surprised at how many films there are in it. This one is one of those, and it does not even be the best one. With Mathias Hose I thought it would be good. Although he can not save this film, and to be honest, he was not very good. Just do not pay attention to other people; Fighting in this movie is not all good at all. I really know what I'm saying, because I've seen so many movies like this. There is a bunch of scenes that can do with the plot, there is absolutely nothing to do. I think they gave the movie a bit more time to make a bit more bit, uuuuuuh ....... bad as well as the bad guy (as we do not even know before).
