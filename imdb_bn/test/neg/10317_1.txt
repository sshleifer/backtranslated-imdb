My first warning should be that this DVD was for sale at $ 5.00. But since it's Sandra Bullock, which I usually like, I bought it. My frustration with the film started almost immediately. Dialogue is slow and strong. The color is distorted. I keep the volume adjusting to hear the conversation. The acting is amateurish. Even a murder of murder is a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cashless girl gave me a dollar to stop the movie, I followed immediately and happily. This is a wonderful bad movie. Tomorrow I am going to the white elephant Christmas party of this DVD company.
