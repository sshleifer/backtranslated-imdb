For this film, it is difficult to decide which and what are the target audience. Jean-Pierre Limousine probably had the chance to discover a serious level alkali problem and get the chance to use it as an excuse for soft-colored films. See, love, acclaimed and respectful souvenir dish bels are reducing memories - as a result of Alzheimer's - though deep and heartfelt, I do not consider the novel as insulting in the carrier's brilliant performance. I do not have any problem with the slaughtered pornography - and if I want to leave the movie often, then it is so common that even today - but I have a problem with authors / managers who try to accept it as the revival of medical research here. The sad thing is, there are excellent actresses like Julie Guevette - Clara et Moi and Awesome Actors in Anna Mogolis - After the last week's Le Fluze hit Double Play and now they are wasting their time on such a draw.
