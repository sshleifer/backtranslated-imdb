All dogs were a quirky, funny movie to go to heaven; Those voices with good name talent originally borrowed an adult contact in a cartoon. It was just interesting that adults could stay away from something good for the kids. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately ADGTH2 is a stupid developer trying to run cash bikes in the first quotes. Charlie Shane In this second movie, Barber Reynolds and Shane Easton are a wonderful replacement for the voyageable changes in some of the lovely movies, but forgotten songs make it an appropriate choice as a co-star for him. Add Dame Deluge to the first movie and you think it might be a decent mix compared to the relatively modest comparison of this sequel. Unfortunately, with other good voice actors, such as Abbeybels' terrible role, like Bebe Newewirth, this movie can not be protected from all the insatiable production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) of this movie. Scary editing, synchronization of voices, and flat out spaces, where the characters face the dialage, but this film is not integrated to look like the College Interns Animation project rather than the appropriate performance. <br /> <br> First of all, I would say that if you are a big fan of the first movie, I would like to give it a very big pass.
