Seriously, the sci-fi will stop making movies. They are all horrible. And it was John Rice-Davies and he could not help the film. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) brings food to the famous chest of Chandrabaku, in the cruise ship operated by Captain Rudolph (John Rice-Davis). Then the animals escaped and began to kill crew and passengers. Captain Rudolph and the crew then went after the animals, gun ablazin. But they can not stop it. So they call for the Navy. They can not stop it. Then all of the things kill 5 (or even though they have a lot). Then Captain and his daughter, with some people, how to kill it. Stay away from this movie. Chupacabara incredibly shows Chess, the navy shoots in the slightest movement, throwing grenades on the ship and acting is terrible. 3/10.
