It was a set of family films in the 1950s in the countryside of America, where a boy shot his cousin to steal his dog drums, not only family legal battle, but also started a conflict between communities that began to take their cities. <br /> <br /> This formula is that film tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness is that Scott Buckulla (defense lawyer), Ron Perlin (father / drum owner) and dog, the only person who could actually work. (John Shock and Kathy Garder, the original "family affair" to "Sissy", was right as aunt and his wife.) The children were not good (basically they were acting like they were) and it's a problem when a problem movie really revolves around them (Aaron Fars, who played the bandit Dani, actor Russell Crowe is certainly not a genius but likes to be liked by Ham). <br /> <br /> (Line by the prosecutor after the speech of the Scott Bakula defense stop speech): "If we do not launch us, we'll be lucky." <br /> <br /> The favorite line of Ron Perlman's words (after his boys got raped): "Now make him a friend, it is a very difficult part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / Used to buy.
