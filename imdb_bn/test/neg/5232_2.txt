The essential thing was one of my favorite Stephen King books. But I saw this movie among the worst adaptations of the film adaptation that they saw that they became so ill that it made me sick. Even the concept of the book is considered fraud, which is not always shown as a reminder of the book, it is not always shown in movies. The album was so enjoyable that it was like Stephen King, but many of Stephen King's films did not follow this book and became a trash of Hollywood trailer trash. 2/10
