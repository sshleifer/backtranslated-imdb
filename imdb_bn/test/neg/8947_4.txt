Great acting, great production value, good direction <br /> <br /> But in the first half the script starts with picking and interest and then separates into the second half. We are clear about the character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves the answer to many questions. <br /> <br /> The raised conflict is compulsory but the follow-up is weak. For example, we are very clear that Raidard is in favor of Kipling War but we do not know that philosophical attitudes change through the film. <br /> <br /> This is a picture that makes me look at history books events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is historically correct; So much so in this movie, I just do not know.
