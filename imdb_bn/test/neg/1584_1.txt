I am not surprised to comment on this user for the film, as the film "[prove] that love will find a way out when it is predefined." I started this way, not to criticize a particular critic, but the quotation released before it hit the hyperbolic, antarctic travel, even on the theater. Even the best movies do not "prove" and they also do not fulfill its purpose. Best movies entertain visitors and remove viewers and fail both criteria "English Patient". <br /> <br /> I very clearly remember the promotion of "English Patient" studio: "From Amadeus Producers" and "One Flew the Kaku Nest", "It's well-announced." An unknown or helpless listener is very important in this stupid statement The word "producer" may miss, and with the great director Milos Forman wrongly associates the "English Patient" director, this comparison is remembered by Mr. Furman Opponent in. <br /> <br /> The novel by Michael Ondeve is based on the film, it is unfortunate that the movie failed to capture any quality, by any means the book. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When it was released, I I realized that rendering of the novel's extraordinary magic failed, , But not their characters, and their characters were flat, neutral, and incompatible. This film is the complete decoction of the novel in Andatz and one of the worst descriptions of a complete born in a genre artistic film. <br /> <br /> Those who rely on this film are "very clear", and especially useful for talking with adjectives. "Grand," and "hypnotic." Well, there is no one of them. In fact, even the orthodox novel can not be described as "Safing" or "Grand". It can be described as "witchcraft" and "hypnotic" - but these are the same qualities that the film failed to deliver completely. Often, as a reader like Mingalela, it was completely valuable in the novel, and Seluloid is simply a pale, skeleton version, a version which has not only missed the soul of the story, but focuses on it's wrong characters. He created a cinematic transliteration that was not only respectable for the metaphors of the story, but they had no clarity. <br /> <br /> With the novel of the patient and Catherine Clifton novel, the "focus" is missing along with the central focus from Mingala Hana and Kip. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Christian Scott Thomas published an integral, unfamiliar, continuous, unreasonable performance that was intended to expressly express a great, driving, passionate love affair with the audience, but actually two flat, shallow, unintended Only an illogical, perfontinary liaison has been distributed among adulterers. Both actors provide physical and emotionally inadequate and unexpected, and any performance clearly meant by the great grandmother's grandiose and overblown presentation with great mental feedback. <br /> <br /> "Not so much unwanted critics of this disrespectful film like" Grand, sweeping, like David-Lean "just do not like to mention. Comparison of David Lin ("Dr. Jha Vago") is another humiliating director who is abusive. For example, take a view of the "patient" blizzard, which is no doubt in which the "grand, sweeping" attributes live (or have to live) attributes: The storm is not grand - it is not even trustworthy. Later, the automobile characters and their emergence after the storm, which could dramatically and emotionally affect the viewers, was entirely lacking in drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so weak, it was clearly a comedy where it was a comedy, clearly comedy. <br /> <br /> This image has failed. It failed as a novel rendering, and it failed as a movie. It seems that this year's "debuted Oscar's car" (as is increasingly being added to the "Crommer vs. Cromer" or "Termination Terms") is in progress. Only thanks to God that even hip-powered academy <br /> <br /> Nice actress, Fargoette had a good idea of ​​awarding Best Actress to Frances McDermand for her real performance. "English Patient" was not an act that was not ashamed to be too much acting (Willam Dufo) or a truly forgotten, middle act (Phaeans and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> This is not the continuity of a movie, but firmly (and clearly tasteless) fans will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the shadows of the timing will steadily suppress this intervention of a film, and with gratitude, it will never have the power to dig it itself.
