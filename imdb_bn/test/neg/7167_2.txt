'Book II' is not a movie, it is a reminder. This annoying, unhealthy and almost helplessly tired misfire probably works as a religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond the few wiseracks from George Burns. Loyn has played a little girl who (God) asks God to mount an advertisement campaign which allows people to believe in him again. Not really, that's the story. It has a lead load of older cobblers which is a much surrendered, 'explanatory' religious waffle but rarely has some decent dialogue and of course some even total absence around magic or charm. This is not the 'miracle on the 34th street'. Suzanne Pleshette fast setting concrete conjures up this harmful padma but pudding-written script and garbage performance by provocative Louanne immediately send it to where you know-its depth of fireplace.
