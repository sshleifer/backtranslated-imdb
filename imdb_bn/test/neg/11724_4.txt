Do not make me wrong I have a significant soft spot for both producer and director for Charles Band's works. But when you want to name your name in "doll vs the demonic toy", a eyebrow will arise, which also takes an anonymity. Bad-movie funny, "Head of the Family" is rather lacking, even though it is a better job than your expectations. Jacqueline Lovell has a certain talent who deserves better than this type of movie. J.W. Perera is quite funny as the Titular monster, although for such a supernatural she is easily hoodwinked. Y'now, I'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and malicious .... <br /> <br /> And the lens being a lead character called Bogan? Nice boys Americans did not know that Americans did not know!
