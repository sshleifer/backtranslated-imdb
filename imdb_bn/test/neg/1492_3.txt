I'm really frustrated by this piece of work It is cool, shallow, repeats itself, is mostly not right and sometimes it is at the wrong end. I think it is made for primary school, especially because it keeps repeating over again when leaving a big gap. A little child can actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a good way to appreciate a theoretical substance is "a short history of books" or "books of physics". If you are familiar with the issue about a very basic level, you will not get any new information or feedback in this series. Do not waste your time with it. Although beautiful eye candy.
