The image of the character of Ichabod Crane was so terribly impossible, my wife and I was hoping that the races (or any other character) would not only cut the head of the crane but would do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> This Brent Carver man played it at the top - like he was on Broadway. And he was so unknown Jack that we had no sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> I could go with the specific criticism of how this film failed, but I do not like to devote power. Just skip it and go for the Johnny Depp version. That is, or sleep crane animated pumpkin rental (animated). It's pretty good - entertaining for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Read the original story of Washington Irving, still good.
