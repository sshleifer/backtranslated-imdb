Some of my fellow writers have covered the material of this movie's plot so I have to comment on some cuffs ... <br /> <br /> 1. It's entertaining - but that's not what you think about. It's chessy but anyhow still watchable. <br /> <br /> 2. Thirty, Daniel's love interest is about thirty Dan, who ignores the unknown girl, is a virgin. <br /> <br /> 3 Miriel did steal his shirt from Mr. Spok. Also, if my guardian angel looks like a mueller, then I'm going to apply for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. OK ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of terrible crime tripe that?! Murriel says that it was a donation prayer that kept his parents together. I was just ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want but the only way they can stay together if they decide that they are going to do this. <br /> <br /> 5. I'll counter the atheist's comments by illustrating how non-Christian in this movie. Apparently they are all slovenly bullies. <br /> <br /> 6. For some positive - David White is a decent actor. He credited the movie with only a little credibility. She mostly holds this film together on her own.
