Actually, I can accept or leave it for the death penalty. My problem with this documentary is that there is absolutely no sympathy for the family, the complete love-for the murderer. The execution of the Wanda gene, it's completely unilateral view, has only strengthened my determination that he should have been given death penalty for his crimes. He tried to argue that he was mentally challenged, but none of the videos supported the scene. He feels uneducated, but his whole family did so, but that does not mean that they are all frustrated. If anyone opposes the death penalty, I will fully understand it, but ignore the crime completely, as it does not happen, and try to keep the preoccupation at the top of some moral mountains, it is objectionable in nature and it is not for the problem that I will be associated with.
