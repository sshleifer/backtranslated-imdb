This movie was so stupid and slow it was slow. The only good part of the film was the sticky gold pant girl. There was no cow's fountain and what was a horrible movie about 80 without a little Gore. Plus killer was not all scary nor was there a murder But if you want to see the worst movie in the world, it's for you. I do not waste your time like watching this.
