It's a perfect display to see, it's not the best or the worst. I have seen it for a long time and I do not like new stuff. Some shows in this show have been changed into trash and many are living differently. I dislike that crap. I have no IQ why they completely change this show theme. The first season was really enjoyable to see and was partially amusing. Second season just stupid in this world. I do not know why the writer / director has changed this program. A lot more people prefer the first season than the second and the third. From now on I will see the first season of this show, whenever I see a new episode, the sick changes * f * ckin channel ... ya have heard! It gets a 3/10 because I have enjoyed some first season but hated the second and the third
