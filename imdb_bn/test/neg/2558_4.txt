This movie was a rather curious viewing experience. The movie is certainly based on a game. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works fine in a game but it does not look enough to see it in a movie. The film was very 'stupendous' and it was not even bothered to make some changes to the dialogue to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead of presenting today, a literal playback is often accompanied by a leading character and staged dialog. Because of all of this, the story does not really work and the movie is almost completely full - and the experience of the unexpected viewing. <br /> <br /> You will take time to find a comedy of it, watching it. First you see a play that you see, it contains playful characters, but after the film progress you will find that this film is another tragedy, which is more in the comedy genre rather than the dramatic genre. <<br /> <br /> Characters and dialogues are really things that make this movie a playful and hugely top that sometimes becomes ineligible. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susanha York, among others but they do not really raise a level of 'watchable enough' movie. <br /> <br /> The story seems completely obsolete. Basicaly's story focuses on nothing about nothing and only mainly by Peter O'Toole and Susanha York's brother / sister characters. But the story is okay? The film seems like an uninterrupted and obsolete one which rarely offers. As I said earlier; I'm sure that the story is good and interesting to watch but it's not really suitable as a movie and just does not work. <br /> <br /> The edit is just terrible and it turns out and even the specific sequence is bad, even ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Director H. There is more hope than Lee Thompson, who has made good films rather than great movies, translated into screen-level screens, projects. <br /> <br /> Value of your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
