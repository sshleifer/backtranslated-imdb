Looking back at 2006, I would think the most, "Snakamania" on the Internet for a film called a flat. But it was unknown to me that the DVD Rip-Off film on snakes was on the snake train! After seeing this, I feel it in the below-row B-movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That is why the wife's family does not tolerate her severely, so they curse her that the snakes will "turn it on." Six hours a passenger and a group of passenger passengers in Los Angeles include a former hound police and some drug traffickers. Will they reach there before taking the snakes? See the film: First impression: I want to say that some scenes with small snakes look good on the secondary path, but you have to wait eight minutes to see the main influential shots! Sadly, they completely kill any good memories of the film (this movie lets the 1985 video games look like T2!) I noticed that there is no screenplay credit in the film! And the directors make this movie so much that it destroys the whole film. The final scene in the film: <br /> <br /> A neutral B-movie with an incredibly bad end.
