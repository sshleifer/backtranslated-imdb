The play Macbeth wrote William Shakespeare until 1604 and 1606. Nonetheless, other versions of this game were created, including remixes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa also operated a Japanese version of Macbeth. Entitlement in 1957, "Kumonsu H." In the recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegian, the game started with King Duncan about the success of his two generals, Macbeth and Banco. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth quickly gets an extraordinary feeling for the blacksmith, greed and power, and in his power everything can gain crowning: even if it is involved in murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Imagine a fabulous Macbeth that a few hundred soldiers, including AK-47 are being killed and at the same time "low" has been transformed into their own. Just fun about the next, but what he did is to call the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it throughout the whole movie. That's right! Shakespeare Ghetto Fill It could hope for you all! Not ?? New Macbeth is fairly violent and violent enough to match any other modern day action film, but it lacks a good strategy of acting, correct language, and camera work. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> After Duncan promoted Glennis to Thane (as the three documents had predicted), Macbeth set his eyes on the throne as soon as his wish was over. After promoting Macbeth, Dancan invites himself to Macbeth's house for the night's drug and alcohol. Prior to the start of the festival, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) tells Macbeth to kill Duncan to take control of the throne. After the bodyguards were drunk and everyone slept, Macbeth entered the house of Doncans and killed him. After his murder, Macbeth came with the title of titles and all the Duncan items with crown. As soon as he thinks he has got what he wants, he learns that he is more than a bribe and is going to solve his problem. <br /> <br /> There was a big flaw in the movie. Once a seemingly flamboyant and empowered Macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy dog ​​across the whole film. I really do not know what Worthington or Wright's fault was, but both of them realized that Macbeth was a king, did not have a knot about what he had done in his husband's literal conversation. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been arrogant, arrogant, and stupid. But when his character changes the drug to the Lord, he thinks personality changes too. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to recognize her character and tremble for her personality. He does not seem to be quite annoying in the drama or 1971 version, but he reminded Macbeth that compared to the murders, he could possibly do anything else, that does not match perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I thought was unexpected was all the nudity. Wright's fault might have been this final. Witches are not a bit of acting, you do not call parading around your birthday suit acting. At one stage of the film, I was wondering if I was seeing Macbeth or the unique position volume. 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> When I do not say wrong, I find out Shakespeare's conversations. It is called shamelessly, but when it is spoken by an Australian gangster, it's really weird When Macbeth begins to kill people, he can inform them by speaking their first English language in English. In Macbeth's life there is a lot of work, blood, gore and nudity for the last of life. When you start thinking of yourself, then you forget all the positive information, "OK, what did he say in this last sentence?" In some movies, I do not think the actors knew what they were saying. The new age of the film can easily be dragged, it is not for "you and", "you". <br /> <br /> The camera work was just fair for me. One thing I could not stand was the constant pacing behind and back in character. Using the camera technique that splashes the type of Blair Witch type and leaves me a little bit in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same idea of ​​the camera work, Clover field but it does not work. It wants to get me out of my chair and they can be easily installed on each seat in airplane for small burf bags. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, nevertheless, there is nothing other than the underlying acting of the film, the right English use and belly-bending cameras. Soundtracks contain one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or rebuilt for each scene separately. Not a variation used in interesting or impressive media. From now on, the directors should release dangerous drug underworlds in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. 400 years ago, Shakespeare's idea was to make Macbeth's future presentations just as the game intended. I would recommend using a soundtrack prepared by medieval clothing, yes old english, sword and shield and ian. But by any means, modern Macbeth makes you something good for 'ol folk music, camp fire, and a bustier.
