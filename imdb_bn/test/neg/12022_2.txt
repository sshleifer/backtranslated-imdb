I'm coming here to fight because the picture was so good and so well I said that I'm not twice as big as its development, the less I worked. Without revealing the plots too much, I can only say that a part of my 2 VHS sets is a weird, but unfriendly plot that is unfit for free, open joy. The main character was appropriately naif-like but intelligent and very very open. He was forced to comply with the events of his father's separation, cultural shock, when his Pakistani roots were trapped with broken society of the English's narrow society, because of his father's suspicion as Saberia, and his cousin turned into a feminist militant. His best friend suddenly became the symbol of rising punk movement in the seventeenth century. Among other things <br /> <br /> I was so angry that every actor was created in the first part and how much was enough to establish their characters, only the whole thing would be transferred to the worst pornographic episodes second part, much to support the development of the plot More so, and even very clear even lover is clear. My biggest pet dog when the directors let their personal fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie, and it was a supreme example of me. <br /> <br /> I felt a little like a group has been invited like. Very clever, funny strangers, not only allowed to close the door and communicate with the guests, and we were all forced to show bad Buddhist instead of seventeen sex movies. These amazing actors humiliate hard work! Why not just start with a cheeseball flick? And why will he play such a great lead character who can actually work, and then when he builds a great performance, then cut it off? I almost felt that he was getting tired of endless sex scenes, where he did what he did, he pumping his pelvic for another bronchial nude actress. <br /> <br /> The following line - Part is one small talent, part two is the soap opera distortion of the second layer. I know the book is quite clear, but I think that these fine actors were absorbed in the real life, because their character was in the movie, and it made me angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can pull such suspicious frustration of the actors and the plot, and it seems to be artistic. My suggestion is to see only the first part, the strong rubbish hip second toss, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
