Well, I took some friends to see this movie, one hour before the start of the show we started getting good seats. So you can probably imagine where this movie is seen :) But the tension soon became horrific, the film was a complete failure, it is unfortunate that it is tragic that the script is written badly and relies heavily on the actors created for it ... <br /> <br /> The whole film is the only Good acting Stefan C. The chef who was awesome, the plot was weak and even "funny" scenes were considered forcibly and irrelevant, because the main actor is the best comedian of Iceland, it is very special ... <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie anymore because It works hard and sometimes does not distribute.
