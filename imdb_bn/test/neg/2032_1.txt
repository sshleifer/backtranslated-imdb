This was the most unintended horror flick I've seen today. It was initially forgotten after about 1 minute. Acting terrible The most awesome thing about this movie is when two boys kiss, Yake! Movie Festival Judges What do they think when they have given the 'Best Movie' note to this trash? To see what should be done as a filmmaker I was not the only reason to stop this film and if there was a thin plot line on paper. I was not frustrated by this next idea. Not even a single bit of nudity or gore! Also, I thought it was difficult to use "Living Evil 2" for about 3 minutes in the movie ... could he be admitted? Because it lies in the movie and the most interesting part.
