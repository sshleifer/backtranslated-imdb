This movie contains a really funny mix of generators - toilet humor and action in between. It really does not pull it - it should stick to a genre. The best thing to say about the movie is that the dog is beautiful. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the most annoying sequel, when deciding to stop the difficulty (Sandler) and Carter (Weinz). A hunting lock / closed at a total. I'm pretty sure what's the point of this sequence - it seems unreal in extreme. The owner of Hunting Lodge ("Charlie") is a very innocent person. For some reason, Moses began a conversation with Charlie, Jack Off, gay sex, sex in a trinity ... Charlie seems to be sort of dressing his "wife" like a dress. There is no reason for this really teenage dialogue and scene. However, the whole scene is indicated at the moment when a naked Musa ends up with Carter's gun with his butt and Charlie sees them with a window. This makes humorous people cheer about homosexuality - at the same time intimidating and untitled - which is not fairly fun. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always annoyed with the film of Adam Sandler. This is the first I saw - after that, I'm not sure that I would like to see anymore. Btw, this is my husband's account - he has seen Happy Gilmour, and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe Sandler has to give another chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skog
