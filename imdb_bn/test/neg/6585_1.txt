This movie is awful. It does not make letters in books and some of them have ethnic or ethnic rhythms. Including an overwhelming little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not mentioning tongue-speaking elves. The book was a simple story about faith, and this movie is not a dark, ugly, and inadvertent scary movie. <br /> <br /> Animation is fantastic, but the story of Hollywood has been destroyed. <Br /> <br /> The best thing is that the box office will be banned in this movie, and perhaps the producers will learn to learn from spreading with a story that does not need any improvement. Hanks was overdone and I did not see why other actors' voices could not be used.
