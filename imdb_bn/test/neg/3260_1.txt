Check out this movie ... really how true really is. I'm not really hard to please, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hit me deeply because I like Chavie Chase, Jackie Mason and Dian Canon. Writing was just terrible! I would have chevy at least advertisements he libbed some good stuff. There was nothing to smile in this movie. I went in to want to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but almost cried <br /> <br /> At the beginning came the special appearance of Crav√©e Chase. This worried me from the beginning. Chevy actually wanted me to be more. It's more of a "special appearance". Not very bad appearance was special. Mason's character was a good secondary character but got old as a major. I'd rather see Diane Canon's more (more). If at least his character was funny, do not write well. I miss gratuatis teen sex scene Mr. Gopher went from being smart and innocent to be a muddy venturer who deserved to fly. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that makes me interested and we could not see him enough. <br /> <br /> I'm taking it back. Try ... to see half of this movie, then ... Alamo, Maine and Caddy Shake Eye. remember.
