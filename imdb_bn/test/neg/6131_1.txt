Jesus Christ, what happened here? This is one of the most annoying films I've ever seen, how screwed such an excellent idea for a movie is possible. I was so excited to tell the truth, even though it was like Blair Witch, the real alien animals were behind the camera. It is frustrating, I sh * t have been reduced to continue this mound rapidly, and I did not have that time watching movies. High ratings here at IMDb believe that the true alien gives 10 for this shit. <br /> <br /> Good attack, attack. The movie starts saying that what you are going to see is the real, blahblahblah Then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as I have to believe their bullsh * to enjoy this movie. You know that the next thing I saw in the jungle in the night, sometimes driving a stupid car. Is this a movie, or a Disney theme park ride? The first 20 minutes of frequent frequent and flashlight with a bustling dialogue between the police seeing a straight road. Where was the alien ?! They were certainly asleep! Then we learn that the bad acting is not only reduced to high school drama, because the police came out of the car behind the camera to find a missing person who was 'night-beating' and fell into a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what will happen to him? From somewhere, we see 'nightfishing' walking like 'zombie'. Cop is apparently too stupid that something wrong with this man Obviously he was really stupid, such as the Jimmy / Alien guy injected some parasite to the ears, thus transforming him into an alien. Then the police / police went back to his car, took a young couple back in the woods, sexually assaulted them, went to them, changed the man to a foreigner, and then the girl drives the police and escapes. If you did not get this quick plot launch in your movie then this movie was bad, then the next 40 minutes will be. Seeing this movie as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork is painful. Scripts, although it may seem interesting behind the DVD box, it is badly operated and sadly, we go straight to DVD bothering with pornography. <br /> <br /> The only one that kept me awake was constant flashing and high sound effect (mournably). It is not enough to see the same woodland for 63 minutes, we must "frighten" viewers and the bad actress will have to endure crashed flashing strategies to gradually become completely annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think you have to pay rent, I said, why? There's a better SciFi / Horde film. Even the dangerous rebuilding of physical graduates is even more entertaining than this. For all the good love, do not bother with her bad. My eyes burn, and for the first time I wanted suicide. A 1/10, to avoid like a disease.
