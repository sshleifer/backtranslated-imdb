This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It's very cheap (apparently video shot), played horribly, and just plain rotten. I can not believe how cheap and perfect this piece piece was. It looked like a home video! I mean that I believe a man I know some rooms dug down his video camera and made this vapor within 2 or 3 hours. It's that bad. Did I see the name from here? Asylum ?? And I will not hire anything with that name again !!! When you rent a flick, check whether it is seen by "company". Even though one thing is true - if you like terrible acting, like amateur movies, then you might like these damaged choices. It's absolutely annoying and terrible !!! You have been warned !!!
