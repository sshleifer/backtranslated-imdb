In most parts, a deadly relentless initiative, dance expresses his opinion about the dancer / dancer (Antara Mali), who, with the establishment of his career with the people around him, his actress wife (Abhishek Bachchan), feels a little bit beyond the small business compromise . . Excellent idea, it only proves that the worst concepts of her dress and dance movement are behind this extremely cheap Indian Indian potboiler, even hard work has been done for the strength of the victims of fierce embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The story follows a radioactive prediction pattern ... The dancers and bees meet and have an affair (yes, sex included) ... Beau gets success, but he spurns his effort to help her. Beau throws attitude and they walk out of each other ... The dancer fills the most unlikely director, who wants to 'do what he wants' ... the inconsistent effort bag even more Dynamic popularity ... Bury is attempted to reach, where he explodes, how he can not live with him ... D-Oh is the end. <br /> <br /> I did not really expect much good from this film. So why did I see it? Because I have an Antara Mali idol. He has the opportunity to reach the actress's grand height with impressive IMO. Alas, his role in the film looks much better on paper than genuine brutality, harmful for a movie that is considered to be an inconsistent character. To give her credit she keeps a game effort, actually asking him as an actress that few scenes shining well. I just wish the movie was more worthy of her. The introduction of the baby also runs in some good fifties, the last scene is slightly salvaged through some salvage, which happily reminds you of her father. <br /> <br /> If you can sit for a return on the back of the dog-shaped stylish pot but only recommend a few grain courtesy good moments in Leading actors.
