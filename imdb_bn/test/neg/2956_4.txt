After 15 years brought back Anna Cristi (Grey Garbo) to see his father, Chris (George F. Marian). He is a boat captain and he is traveling with him. During this time, he met Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fell in love. Matt and Chris are not eye-to-eye, and there is a secret to conceal Anna ... ..................... <br /> <br /> What an annoying story ... ... George F. Marion and Marie Dresler are playing a drink at a bar. The scene goes forever and they are both terrible. Their burden is difficult. In fact, difficulty understanding the entire cast. I've missed the whole part of the dialogue between Bakerford, Marion and Garbo, because it's unknowingly! Garbo is obviously something special, as you are attracted to the screen you are going to and the presence of it gives me the 4 stars that I have given this picture. But really nothing will happen - it's annoying story with a shocking tale. You have to be good to stay awake.
