I have long been a fan of the authors, read biographies, saw specials, and saw Karen Carpenter's story. This movie did not really show Karen Carpenten. He is shy in the movie and most people feel lonely (except for a girl friend). The original Karen Carpenter was very different. She was outgoing and friendly. He had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film attempts Karen's solo album and does not meet Phil Ramon and his wife Ichi "Karen". Ike knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but she was a volunteer and one day she went away to go to her hotel room. Also, Karen was taking medicines to increase her thyroid, so she could reduce weight, but she could stop taking them because psychologists did not even recommend her. Also, Karen's husband is known as Bob Knight, but in real life, Tom Beris was named after him. Also, Karen does not divorced from Tom, but only separately. Karen had to sign the divorce papers on her day of death. Also, Agen showed Karen the nakedness of the closet, where she was wearing white clothes. The music was very good. The only thing that I would suggest to see it was.
