I can say about this flat and stupid rebuilding of Carroll Kane in 1979. Comilla Bell does not have much of an actress, and she is guilty of harassment by Jean Johnson, an anonymous phone caller, the role comes no power and vivid. <br /> <br /> But if you find some great looking home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than what you see in TLC or HGHTV. Jill, the wealthy doctor and wife spent about 90 minutes traveling in the house, for which she was providing her real service, searching for strange words and looking for things that are "bumped" in the night. Hiding behind corners and colleagues in the bottom corner of Hollows, we see a beautiful master bathroom with him and his lion, which is like the Roman tabs, incredibly back glass shelving's huge kitchen and pieces of resistance, a unique cavalier and a pond that shows a self-watering system. . <br /> <br /> Because the film is not compelling enough to draw us in fear of Jill, we are confused by the greatness of the house, which is not something you should watch while watching a thriller. Followed by an intelligent man facing Jil, we tremble because he is breaking valuable things and hugging Kawa pond, because he is not supposed to be killed. <br /> <br /> This movie is predicted much like most teen slash movies. , And some of the last but the original. When the time was over, I just wanted to know where the room was and if it is real. Jill and the children remember that she was not a child. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - for both houses.
