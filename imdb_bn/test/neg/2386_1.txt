"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, some may be reasoned that small budget films may seem to struggle for less, but I further say that a pseudo-intellectual antioxidant "Indie" film that claims to be even more bad is worse. <br /> <br /> Chris Johnson wrote and directed "The New Twenty" and I will never return 91 minutes of his life which I have lost in his film. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the screenplay failed to provide the hero-hero or hero with a moral corollary that the audience wanted to see success or failure. <br /> <br /> While telling the story, three dramatic conflicts of people vs people, people vs. the world, and people vs. themselves <br /> <br /> New York colleague focuses on a screenplay and is involved with man versus itself, where each movie character is self-absorbed at one stage of depression and self-destructive behavior that is the movie's autographs in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> Each major character is involved in unwanted bad behavior. (Heroin addiction is not a character, the character is an addiction; a drunk, who has sex with his drunken boss / investor, although the character is smart writing for sex with such a lazy character; a man who started as a decent person, but a Attracted to a dirty investor, and for some unknown reasons, the same foul-muthed business is transformed into a jackass;  র গাইক, যিনি কিছুই করেন না তবে অনলাইনে তারিখ খুঁজে পান এবং একজন গে এশিয়ান লোক যিনি এইচআইভি পজিটিভ বয়স্ক লোকের জন্ম দেন, কিন্তু সম্পর্কের কাজ কেন এবং কেন প্রেম বিকাশ হয় তার কোন দৃশ্য নেই)। <br /> <br /> Establishing the cause of the attachment of important scenes, suffering in the mother's womb and suicide, which can explain why he would sleep with a fiddle bag; The background will explain why a decent person will be attracted to the character of "Gordon Geo" and will become Jacques; A story line for whip cyber-geek; And all the more interactive contact between Asian men and HIV positive lovers is absent. <br /> <br /> Without proper details, all character actions are compulsory and transformed. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORES <br /> <br /> I found Mr. Johnson's instruction without a clear perspective, mentally disrespecting the actors. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can be described as the best at Mundane. Mr. Johnson chose a little space and failed to catch the greatness of New York City. This failure has created a clostrophobic film, which is like filming on a stage, and not like a movie. <br /> <br /> This image was largely absent from the film. I think Mr Johnson has been blamed, because he can ask for a full score to understand each shot. <br /> <br /> Conclusion <br /> <br /> "New Twenty" is an annoying and unacceptable failure to produce the film.
