I have recently seen many Asian horror movies, but it has to be the worst ever. It started quite interesting, but lost the momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie. Added "drama" scene, flashback sequence and serious intrigue holes left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "some terrible" ??? If the ghost did not start the murder? Does he want to return to him? No answer! Overall, not very scary and the filmmakers have to come up with such good ideas ... <br /> <br /> There was a positive actress, but with that. <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
