Allow allians to defeat a giant monster named JÃ¶rkar, then to tell postman, send your average stupid teenage girl to a Tommy Ward (Rais Pag, a movie you've seen in a movie) who has been chosen to fight. If the tree can be lost, then it is destroyed, so he goes to fight Jakarak attacker! This movie is bad, very bad. So bad it just requires a negative number to give a whipped. The horrific written, bad direction, the top wood acting on the road beneath the Power Rangers, you just run out of a hawker for a lumberjack, to come out of it and cut them off! And finally do not start the theme song. Those who made this SME @ $ # should not do any work with their cameras or movies. Zarco was a great visual monster that should have been one million times more than this in a movie. Do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, it's 80 or so minutes of life. This is not that actors never work again by. <br /> <br /> 3/10
