This is terrible trash. I like the 'Hah du yw wm', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's 'Standup Act', but with 'Hippie' and 'Planets of the Appes' (re-imagination) under 'Great Pidgin' I like it, went badly '. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'Annele and I'. It overwritten but slightly ended, a luvvie-ish air expanded it and Bernard Black is simply combined with a low camp. And I thought it was self-generous * before * Dillan became deadly writer. But for the first 2 episiodes that raidiates such roles as possible, I did not even notice that it was not worth the slightest kitty. <br /> <br /> They're saying / doing * should * be funny, but in anyway they do not move more than to be silently humorous "I can see that someone who wrote it might be fun." What I'm trying to say is that the situation / comments are mildly ridiculous and yet very hypocritical / gentle / confident surreal which is valuable for a sitcom and illustrated. <br /> <br /> Life is too small. To avoid.
