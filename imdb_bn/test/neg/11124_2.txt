Dr. Pena (Zycararo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (who likes to study the faint word for one of the self-incognito sufferers, is extremely rare - reads: indefinite - animals) and controls the enemies of his enemies. Large, graduate, fast-moving animal. To reach the mainland, they looted it in a Grecian cruise ship, and in spite of being unaccessed, it is open to the credit. I guess the strange noise coming from the inside was not a good enough resistance to guess the noise. The monster did not then thant the monster; Running a part of the passenger movement outside the passenger ship (John Rice-Davis), a square java special agent for any reason (Dylan Neil), a squaki-voiced blonde tie trainer (Chelman Simmons)), a bunch of guys with machine guns and others Try to stop it. The main prey (which I think comic relief is thought to be relief but it is difficult to say) seems to be an old rich dog (Palla Shaw) with an ippy terrier and a snack by gold digger (David Milburn). Apparently, the monster can be thrown with a single tranquilizer dirt, but dozens of bullets can survive with hits. The silent design is acceptable (though unknown), but the rest of the film is incomprehensible to the mystery, surprise or interest. An annoying Sci-Fi channel "Original" movie; They've just made dozens of such films with almost inexpensive characters and plots, but with little change in animals. Already enough!
