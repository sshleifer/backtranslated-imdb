As a retired US FSF MSG (Skype Maintainer), it will be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that a teenager could ever get a flight line, is much less ridiculous in an F-16. The military spent millions on making the world the best for them and this film makes the air force and all of its members seem to be the best fools. Yes, I know it's just a movie but it gives a message to young people that we are all stupid, and believe that we are not. The missions involved in any kind of mission were highly detained, even military computers were very safe to hack by any teenager, and other errors in this movie make the potter pan more credible. Sorry, for me, this movie has no entertainment value.
