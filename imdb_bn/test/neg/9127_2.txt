The problem with making mathematical cinematography is that you create an excellent composition, or a lemon: there is a little middle ground. It is not "a man in the city - a Berlin-Symphony" or a "man with movie cameras". Unfortunately, it does not look too much <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It really shows us or with pictures and words, rather, say, Or do not have anything to do. Koyanisqatsi uses cumulatively pictures to propound a thesis. It is just a patchwork to search for a point. (Although, oddly, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than ours. There are some inconsistencies about anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media films, which are deeply involved with technology, as I say, and do not do as you like. Only Yankees have to love, Ah.) There are some chaos and misconceptions about this episode. The previous episode was both a song and a joyous moment; This time the tones are consistently glum. Gustav Mahelt will tell you that it does not work only on this period. <br /> <br /> Styleist, Nakoajashi is a mess. Whizzzy digital components are particularly confusing. It completely affects the whole thing, completely, and it also reduces the 'realistic' nature of analog 'found footage'. (I mean, I'm sorry for the boys, Quanissakatasi was a part of the joy that it was a tribute to optical film use. But now the historic artifacts of optical film, they will have to 'take' in the digital domain; but I do not think they are taking it away Digital components often look like video links from CNN or BBC World.) And the "available footage" The digital manipulation is often ugly and generally only fools and false colors and solar life thinks me ... <br /> <br /> <br /> James Bond's title sequence . <br /> <br /> Aham. It seems strange, this movie is easily stolen by Yo Yo's performance; It's about illogical as a Lawrence Olivier voice over The pictures must be forced in the water to stack against all the caribars. <br /> <br /> Phillip Glass itself is weird; There was no hope of closing the Vardi prison! (Made me smile, of course, this is not a favorite response to any part of the movie). Even a Brahma sounds like a piece of music. (?) Probably they changed their piles. <br /> <br /> From our 'Inactive Questions' section: Are Geophrey Regiao Really Happi Indians? Or does he just make Hollywood Hills suites? Oh, and the snippet bits of the footage from the previous 'episode' of the triangle are a commentary like these movies, which is also a globally mixed part of the media?
