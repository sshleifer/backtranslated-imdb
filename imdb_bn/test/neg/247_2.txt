Ah, an original title for a very lazy film. The voice and the face seem to match the dubbing delightful. As a result, I had no idea what was going on as this mess unfold to meet. Flashbacks have flashbacks and do not take any real time until the last time. Aztec shows me laughing I rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. Aztec's lady comic dancer and dances and costumes are hot. Some people get acid full, there are many struggles, you have no character (I'm not really taking care of) and it's a complete noor mess. Oh, and the actual war will not happen for a while, so do not hesitate to take the time to film, sleep, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
