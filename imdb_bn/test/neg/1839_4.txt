This relatively vague Hong Kong "No Childpiece" video is the perfect desert island movie (at least its first half) for peeping Tom's age. Every set up, each scene, look at a girl's skirt in each sequence, looked down at her breasts, look at her underneath and lear at her tight crotch an excuse. How it is established is the perverted urine of the protagonist, of course (!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All are sticky, nothing is involved with sexy Chinese women except sex slavery on their minds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are quite hot and the cow is liberal, but supernatural elements presented in the second half are half-baked It seems and the development of the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, poor garbage producer Vong Jing was a terrible hurry to go outside and outside of this theater. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anti title sequence did not fool this stereotype.
