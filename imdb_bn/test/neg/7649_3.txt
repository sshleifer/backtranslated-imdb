I do not think of myself as a conservative, so I was not personally spoiled by this film, but it was clear that the film's plot and character is second to the message. And the message is all conservative either evil or fool (or both). Character is one dimensional - either good, freedom-loving Americans, or the brainless, greedy, evil conservative. There is nothing clever or creative, just conservative. I do not think of real political bias, but this is not the only purpose behind the movie. And definitely do it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you really hate the conservatives, you probably will enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and less black-white, you'd better be off watching some other.
