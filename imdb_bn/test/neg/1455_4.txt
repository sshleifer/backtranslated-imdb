Overrated Crowd Comedy Director Demem laughs at the audience's laugh, and after some funny line to miss the next line, the actors break. Looks weird - this director is "Silence of the Lambs" - There are now ways to use break! Feeling off the casting. Matthew Modin for the FBI agent is very young and interested in Pfeffer love! Dean Stockwell is working with Jacqueline Jack Nicholson, and a nomination for him! Plesfil and Stockwell to be accepted as Italian? Charles Nepeir as a headdresser and as a VV lawyer, Al-Luis is only underwired with one line - they should be disappointed hoods. The song scores by Chris E. Isaak completely out of place - like a beautiful "Pink Pink." Rebuild this movie, it's valuable, but with the right casting and the director and the mockery ... even frequently repeating "Forbidden"
