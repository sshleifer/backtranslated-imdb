The bottom of the showtime is just a good idea of ​​bubbles. Indeed, this is two or three ideas that are constantly fighting. This image is not only his cake and does not eat; This is the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) is a drug brain busy in his brain, Travel Sellers (Eddie Murphy), a cop-slash-actor. When Preston's partner was shot dead, he beat the camera from the buzzing media and hugged him in a new reality police show produced by Chase Range (Ren Rousseau). In many misconceptions and curiosity of the film, the injured partner has never heard of the remnant of the movie again and carefully. <br /> <br /> The best excuse of De Niro's childhood in his classroom is how the TV police do not act like real police to open pictures about children. The interesting thing is, the movie is like progress, its character and Murphy begin to do more with a clash more firmly. In a smart movie, De Niro's directory may act as a satirical comment; Here, it only shows how the movie really does a long march. The fact-based copos shows can be a spoof fun, writer and director Tom Day's team (who made a lot more than Shanghai a few years ago; instead of watching that movie), and instead of slamming the TV industry, they really let them leave the light (Network execs are the most difficult things they are able to say about playing ping pong at work). Russo's character has a glint of fiendish joy in her eyes, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress's origins. <br /> <br /> To keep my attention, my mind started flipping with a little mind on the screen, and it is dangerous in a movie with many plots. in this case; Shotayem (the name given to a cop show) is such a popular debris, why some people do not know De Niro and Morphy at the time of their job? In that case, if the trafficker and the people of the people around him are being investigated on television, why did not anyone tell him that he was on his way? Then again, given this villain's action probably I should not be surprised; The same joker who is angry with a partner to use his new superbow without approval, risks a deal and then how does he send him? Using almost 10 superguns, the whole house level! That's like putting a fire with a big fire. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Even worse, really smart gags suggest that this movie can really be something, only if they have been drafted a few scripts. Murphy mugs and as soon as possible he can discuss with minimal outcomes, and De Niro looks flat out of bored through most of this. After the complete unnecessary box-fight between the police and the gangsters (the significant outcome of any injury and arrest), Russo's character is 'It's great television!' Perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.
