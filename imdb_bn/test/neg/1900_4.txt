This is one of Chris's next story. Throughout his long career, he was interested in the concept of transmitted reports and conflict agents. Both are basically the same thing and encourage it to control or control issues. <br /> <br /> In detective fiction, the game is a matter of contradictory reality. The murderer wants to change the reality to fool the detective, the authors want the reader to do the same thing. Both the reader and the detective are in the same battle that they can see. Because of that, his stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In his work, he searches every combination of the techniques that he can think about. Along the way, we often have organizations that they do not think, and the time, and the intended victims and the like. But this idea of ​​the book's original magic control. It was literally a building in 'Bartrum'. <br /> <br /> Here, it's a dead man. Well, sometimes that happens, but not like this. Such was the famous writer Rafil. It is particularly sweet to the Mirapal readers, who remember this same character from 'Caribbean Missy', which also made her nephew. In this story, Ruffil was the author of the story's conveyor. <br /> <br /> There is almost impossible commitment to use a different creative team in each of these series producers. Sometimes it generates soft work. The 'Barrutam' episode was rather brilliantly directed. It is most enjoyable in one and it has an active camera. But unlike Barrut's work, there is nothing to do with his story. <br /> <br /> The camera just goes away and takes it. Initially the 'Citizen Cain' quote was very little and literal. This story is good, but the adapter has presented some critical elements, and irrelevant cameras are disturbed. <br /> <br /> Assessment of TED - 2 of 2: contains some interesting elements.
