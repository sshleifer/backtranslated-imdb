I saw this movie twice, once in college a few years ago, and again this past weekend. Although I first despised for the first time, I decided to give another opportunity. Terrence Malik is clearly a well-known director, and I think IMDb viewers, at least, think of this movie too much. But, unfortunately, I do not seem to have changed my taste. <br /> <br /> Where to start? One thing, Linda Monz's description is terrifying. His voice is becoming so annoying with that awesome New York accent (please do not try and make me worry that Chicagoans are saying this - they are not). She fits herself to sit and talk about shuffle things, which is not her a talented actress. He is not acting too! I came to IMDB to see him, his performance was so ridiculous, but people really liked it! He is unexpectedly every way - I hope Malik will kill him only. <br /> <br /> Another actor was like, but certainly there was nothing special. Adams was perhaps the most powerful cast, but he was also the only decent part. Except the old man - he was quite good. <br /> <br /> Talking about acting, why Shepard's character is so ridiculous? He bought the "brother and sister" law because ... Oh, why would he buy? Bill and Abby had the opportunity to be sensitive to each, even though they did not realize that their life depends on acting very simply. It was just totally incredible. And finally, after a considerable amount of time the farmer could suddenly understand, "O my God, they are together!" Then he goes after the bill with a gun, but instead seems to travel in the hands of the bill and ends with a deadly stab wound. <br /> <br /> Which is saying, the fate of letters was likewise stupid (and, brave I said, lazy). Of course, the bill will die - could it be more annoying than getting a pond shot by a police pack? Abby feels really content about his happy life, getting on a train and working out things. And the annoying narrator randomly finds his dead body and they are filled in sunset. But all right, because Malik did not give me any reason to care for me in any way. <br /> <br /> For this plot, this movie will be dragged continuously with a real plot twist or development. I can not believe it only 94 minutes long - I could swear I was sitting in my seat for 3 hours. The sudden lame disaster was like throwing the Bible into my mouth; I was completely fine with metaphor and passion, but this was complete at the top. Obviously the message was, "Get married in exchange for money or bad things happen to you." Very original <br /> <br /> I understand that "the days of Heaven", like all the movie owners, is a part of the industry. And I must agree that cinematography is simply stunning, and museum shots add a unique array of movies. But to enjoy a picture I need more than beautiful pictures, and this is not for me.
