I can not just start saying a fan in bad movie. And it's a really bad movie. It speaks about the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate as 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes are not particularly interesting, blunders with the whole film is actually happening just fine. Although sometimes there is a big hole shot in Pulsar's arms and green guo ponds (bad movies do not have green go?). <br /> <br /> but comes in the end and cheats you literally quite literally. You turn off the seat in hysteria. And for that, this movie gets a boost of a 2 * rating. <br /> <br /> There are some movies in the world that you want to show off to your friends, so you can see the reaction when <br /> <br /> For example, '' Stuck in Category '' for the arrival of Big Man 'Shark Attack The arrival of 'line' (when you know it, you hear it) in 'Shark Attack 3', 'Dracula 3000' (only for complete disbelief and confusion), each scene of 'Around 2' Arrival of Maternal Shark and this movie Sitting in this section proudly at the end of the picture. It's just that the cost of sitting through for that. So drunk, rock, whatever your poison is, and see some movie with this picture. <br /> <br /> Very simply, if you like bad movies, you get it, but it is a 'plane on the snakes' ... no relation. <br /> <br /> And do not pay more than that for a fever ....
