I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain" Well, like most movies I was really excited to see, it was an isolation! This is not for the invention of the DVD, but I think I inserted my head through the monitor, I was very annoyed! <br /> <br /> I have seen Kidman and Law closely because they have their characters guessed for each other, "Destiny". Nevertheless, Lau's face showed nothing except love, but Kidman began calculating seconds before running the trailer in her second! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (if we do not get it, Cornball Banjos identifies each of its entrance), and so on top, I had all that I could not laugh! Wickedly, how his performance highlights such as highlighting Lead-A-Board. <br /> <br /> Ada suffers because she has released her slave; Why do not we learn It was more confusing why none of them was worth earning and his father was unusually beneficial and (as shown in a scene) it was a very dangerous time for Negros (as they are called here). Why did not the neighbor teach him to increase cow milk or crop? Hack, why did not he just sell the farm and go home? And for all the realities of Ravi, when he sent the "bad" cock to collect, the kind of Kimbish kept them even more chickens! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indeed, he may be physically intimate with Emanan, but with his real confidence Ruby, who made Ada his own Über-Babe version. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Bush movie. Inmana tells us that he "like every fool sent to fight with a flag and a lie", and Aadar's father said, "I imagine calling on both sides of the imagination to imagine God tired". This "observation" is historically wrong and insulting. Slavery was the basis of the southern economy, the cause of war was more complicated. It was impossible to think of the idea of ​​a soldier as "false" (actually, most rank-to-file was indifferent). Filmmakers will have to delete their views for a time when the people living at that time were not foreign foreigners. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is harmful and epic. Law and Kidman corruption, and zero chemistry! The script is half-baked, and more of a serious bunch of clichés and banalities. "Little moment like a diamond bag?" Esse!
