This movie has been very slow for my taste. The concept of the story is spontaneously different, so that it finds family movements of living with mentally retarded family members, which I have not seen before on screen. However, the concept was implemented in error. Each character was fully developed in the scene of its first appearance, then one had to bear the impression that each character was acting in water in another way. That is, each character is interwoven with its interpersonal painful relationship with others, which I think is a form of mental and social obstruction. I think it has an artistic ability, because of the intriguing hatred surrounding intelligent, intelligent friends and family growing on intellectual disabilities. Acting, however, worked well without exception. I agree with other critics that the cinematography was beautiful. In short, I think the film has fine artistic capabilities because it is fine. Cutting and cinematography, but described shortcomings fail at an emotional level.
