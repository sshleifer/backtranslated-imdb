Pete's Meteor I refer to it as "authentic" and a "jewel". I grabbed this picture on Saturday afternoon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This will be the movie. The first thing you will notice is that the whole plot suffers from stomach acne. Or rather, a bunch of little use that is not really connected and does not go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with her grandmother and her younger brother and sister. Their garden was collected by a metallic land and finally a scientist named Hue. Despite the title of the film, Mickey claims the meteor and "storyline" can not actually do anything in a form or with a meteor. From here, various other characters and uses are introduced. But as I said earlier, they really do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Pete (Mike Myers) was introduced and started playing the role, when the beautiful family goes from the film to the dark thriller. Mickey blames her for the death of her parents, even though we never said why and what happened. Hughes has a romance problem because his girlfriend can not overcome his cosmic consciousness. And the past about the abdominal drug started catching up with him, and temporarily grasping his own girlfriend and other casts in a mix, when a shadowed character started trying to kill him. It seems to be the main plot, until you realize that it does not play halfway through the film, everything else feels like uninterrupted filers. Hughes girls' problems, Mickey's bad behavior, meteors ... What should they do on earth? Much more <br /> <br /> <br /> So 'Plot' gets confused and half of it is meaningless. But a nice throw of characters can save it, right? Keyword: Good. The majority of characters are horribly extraordinary people, in which you want to die terribly. At least, I know I want to. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a bad move once you see him once. She is one of the youngest kids I've seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. He talked to Hugh (an adult) about the car, harassment and trash, when he did not find his way, then tried to burn his house and tried to put a knife to the pit. If you think of his way home on such a child fisherman Unfortunately, one of the worst things in this movie is that Mikey never came to her. I'm not sure at any moment supposed to be sympathetic to his character, because he's always a nasty little brat He is the ringlader for his brothers and sisters, so they took predictably and ended the backseat and he followed some of the following. Surprisingly, they have lagged so far that I can not remember their names. They may not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is mostly uninhabited alcoholic. He seems to be just as nasty as Mikey, and he likes to give the people glares out of his house and chill their vintage bottles and do not fool themselves when they glares. Very ridiculous when considering that you are supposed to take care of three children when His problems with alcohol have never been corrected, although he may have caused the film to collapse from time to time. Hugh is one of the few favorite characters of this movie, but it's only because it's the majority of the characters in the punching bag and it takes their mess apart to give it back. The kids treated him severely but he always came back and tried to learn them and did something beautiful with them. He has received a taxi driver, who is a personal scientist who takes every aspect of his life as a scientist, when he goes to his cosmic lingo or tries to leave him many times in the film or prove that he is not exactly the same wavelength The rest of the character (grateful). <br /> <br /> Then there are Mike Moms as Pitt. Pete, despite being the only firm motive and plot of the film, it is very unused and does not play any role until the second half. It is unfortunate that Mayur has stuck for this dramatic role. Even the pit screen has got time, even half of them are hidden only by the dark alleys of the mothers and hidden in small corners. And although he was the only real point of this movie, when his plot line brought the movie closer, it is a weird, incomplete conclusion that, with a quick and strange explanation behind the head, all the letters laugh at a good note. This movie only makes you wonder if they only acted in movies. You're just watching. <br /> <br /> Peak Mix's role of playing the role of Peacock is the only thing. This discrete mess is enough without ridiculing others due to the highly unlikely character and untouched plot lines. No, sir, I do not like it at all.
