Written by, operated and played by Camp Bruce Campbell Champion. It's easy to say easy, it's a matter of shoes. Shooting in Bulgaria independently. I can honestly say for sure that the fool is not always funny. Campbell is a wealthy American businessman with a wealthy wife (Antoinette Byron) and trying to stop business dealings before being murdered. He hired a cabbie to run him around a strange little city; It is not known that his wife 'carrying' with the taxi driver. Campbell is being condemned at the moment; The cab was killed at the same place. A crazy scientist (Stacey Kitch) came forward with a test by inserting the cabbie brain into America's head. With huge pieces on his head, Campbell walks around the street on the road; All the time he is arguing with a weird voice of his size-sized head. Campbell makes his Robert's face shameless because he argues with himself. So, Bruce is doing what he is doing and there is no doubt that many of his fans will be happy. I suppose it was written as a straight comedy. Todd Raimi, Tamara Gorski, and Vladimir Shuva are shadow shades. See for this in the sci-fi channel.
