Warnings may be spoilers <br /> <br /> I spent this movie in Amazon at 5 rupees and I hope it will never spend it. I have not seen terrible special effects, or played sucks. I think Jack-0 is just a ridiculous giant and her dress could seem like something you could buy or own a Halloween shop. Acting is very dangerous, especially Shan Kelly, that means she has become so kind to her little line, "I feel like a pumpmanman". I mean the movie is so awful that only a few minutes of nudity were kept in them without closing the fewer people. I think the most ridiculous scenario when the women's sticks take a butter knife and electrocute. I mean, that looks so fake and I can buy dummy in any of the Halloween stores or myself. Well I would not recommend watching this cheesy movie because it will be time to get you back.
