This can be great. Voice-over is OK and fit one letter. Although a small problem; Character look, mostly supporter or guest characters look exactly the same. The same annoying appearance of every face with a small change like hack server or weight size. It's strange to see a big guest starring a voice that is coming out of a solitary form of characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Katie Griffin has a voice-over for this event and it looks very strange to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some problems, a family plot. The Simpsons did a great job where you can actually buy it in most of the letters. Here we get very weird divergence, some have some strange fantasy, and then we find it interesting, but for some reason delivery is a bit more. You can probably say that it is difficult for me to place a finger on what is wrong with this show because it is not much more than a clone of Simpsons or even "married with the children". <br /> <br /> If I should point out a finger what's completely wrong with this it's probably it to repeat. Peter Griffin is not really a brilliant character but is someone else. Lois should be called Lois Lame because it is one-dimensional type. Sheth Green is the best of such a decorating boy and it is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> So what else can I say? There is nothing wrong with this show, but for a long time you have to admit that Simpson has done a lot of work to do for almost two decades.
