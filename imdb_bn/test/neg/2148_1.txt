You know that you've got a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is fully performed in a cheap programmable synthesizer, without any tone or tone. It is hard to see how anyone can take it seriously, while filming it even worse, while giving a bad review. This image is way below 'bad'. <br /> <br /> The continuation of this movie is abusive. In the battle scenes we made a hero with two revolvers in his arms (wearing bluejies and undershirt); He doubled back, only now has two semi-automatic automatics in his hand; He turns on another corner and now has an automatic rifle in his hand; He chases down a hallway and suddenly comes out (wearing mental army fatigue jacket) with a shotgun; Later, he left the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for books - a car slams into a car at high speed; Flying flying in the car rushes into the blast - the bus gets cut off, which completely erupts from the same explosion? Descriptive continuity suffers from equally flexible feeling of continuity; Bad people really want to kill the hero - of course - but every time they beat him or else he brings him to a weak position, suddenly they decide that they want him to "see this!" is not it? A great moment for the movie is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; Then the bad guy decides that he will not leave before meeting with the two; And despite this, villains, heroes and their lawyers all know that whatever is going on, the hero wrote a note to the lawyer and later we saw other prisoners sending the note to the lawyer, although we never see the hero giving it to him. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to California's ATF offices, including his confidential computer file.) Well, but it's a stupid filmmaker - so how does the action scene? Not bad, surprisingly; Unfortunately they will be stalled from almost a dozen Hong Kong movies created about five or ten years ago. A shoot-out in a junkyard garage, in fact, the shotout that was stolen directly from the "hard boiled" shotout has been shot-out, so it is clear that John Wao has not sued for theft. Other Hong Kong movies in Hong Kong include "Prison Break", "Fire Island", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II, and III (Ur "Supercop"). I thought here as well a couple Sammo Hung clips recognized. In other words, performance scenes are only provoked by the amount of successful copies of action scenes from other movies. <br /> <br /> No one can do anything with one film until one shoots cheat and only need to do much to create any sense of visual stimulation. <br /> <br /> Very funny pictures for all the wrong reasons.
