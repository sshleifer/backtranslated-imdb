I was willing to tolerate something about a sci-fi movie, but this was almost helpless. Although some of the special effects are very quiet (Landscape), it is not a 'Battlefield', but odd odd mother / daughter relationship with science framework. Boro is a fun scene, compared to the Hong Kong Chopski film in the scene of acting (wood), framing and shooting (Kindergarten Film School) and "Hand to Two Hand". The plot line has been compressed and used to transfer the plot along with the devices (reports), with shaky visual shaking and a lot of dice pre-machines, the author with the author is not good idea. Instead of losing a bit here save your sci-fi love for anything else.
