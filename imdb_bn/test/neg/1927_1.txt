One of the most promising young talent instructions I see in this movie is one of the movies. Unfortunately, with this film, the showboys do not choose a path that is only well-worn, but free from a meaningful destination. This movie uses the book's every hackneyed technique, taps you to the shoulder and humbly asks if it can be of interest to you, so that it can give them a good start. Romance can be done well, and when it is left, the visitors will feel love depicted on the screen. I laughed at the psychological measure of this movie. Whisper To save time and money, I recommend, instead of viewing this movie, you have a syrup and a good food. It's about the same.
