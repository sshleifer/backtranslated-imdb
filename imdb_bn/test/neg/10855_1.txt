This is probably the worst and most frustrating film I ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film for the experience. It's not "Acting" God is awful and plots exist. <br /> <br /> Here's one of my one-year-old residence halls at <br /> <br /> 1) Unknown got off with a transvestite. 2) Best friends pair two girls - one big breasts and the other with the nickname "brick". 3) A couple that shag too loud 4) Boy girl who gets all the girls 5) Those people from Northern Ireland are very hard to understand. 6) McDonald's bed 7) Cook for one week every night 8) Students are annoying, some of my companions have died in hospital 9) The recalled joint started a fire. 10) Flood 11) The boy who wakes up on his floor and finds that every item of the furniture is taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can come in with this list in 5 minutes and in real life, I'm sure the script writer can do a few well, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named by a slipper song, Where is Brittop Soundtrack?
