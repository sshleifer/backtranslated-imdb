This movie came very close to being a good flick. To make the side more durable, one-piece to the next should be a bit smoother for progress. Especially: the need to escape the main character is not quite clear. He is trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life does not look bad, so he makes it more difficult to melt that he wants to give up his life so much. Also, it is not clear how much "love" is in "love" with Jennifer L. If the movie is reviewed more carefully in this story, it would have been great. On the other hand, for a indy flick, it's pretty good! Maybe if you have two drinks, to ruin the logical thinking, it will be more fun ... <br /> <br />
