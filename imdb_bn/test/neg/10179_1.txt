It is speculated that a report about UFO reports about a movie about journalists who are less or less tolerant of the whole subject or related to volcanoes and another Aussie, who is laughing at the UFO's silly smile <br /> <br /> This movie is actually a fraud, and actually a trap for explaining the Christian interpretation of Christian education and the UFO, which I have already heard. This is an advertising explanation that is invented by some modern theologians rather than the Bible, which can fit some and everything in their mythology. Unusual? It is real, just demon, unless it takes place in a Christian context, of course, it is God's. Simple, if it is not God, it's Satan's, stupid! So I think the 9th Symphony of Bithovan was not inspired by God, so it was written under the giant effect. Or the logic Lead ads will be excuse. <br /> <br /> We knew that the Bible does not tell about the life of other universe, so there is no one (there is a fragile version of the ignorance of advertising) and there is no one else. God has made the universe so magnificent so glorious that he shows our omnipresence. I think of Carl Sagan's comment that if God created such a huge universe and kept life on earth only, it would be a huge waste of space. <br /> <br /> What is UFO? They broke the Christian event, soon subject to democratic activity and concern ... I mean Rapture Before sadness, true Christians will disappear from the face of the world, causing public awareness, confusion, the car and the aircraft will crash ... whatever. Therefore, Satan is aware that he is sending his ghost mainly to create illusions of foreign spaceships and alien abductions which can be used to explain this irrelevant event. All parts of Satan's plan must surely be seen to look at God or to Jesus and to the falsehood of Anti-Crucifixion. <br /> <br /> The explanation of this ad is to identify religious mysteries by identifying a mystery with others, opposing the unknown, strange, and scientific method of interpreting as much as possible mysterious, by the first known, if not known only. <br /> <br /> Whenever it is an alien directly kidnapped for missing a child and kidnapping. Before I encourage the aliens, or miracles, or Satan or something else, the child has fled away, lost, or kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by kidnapping pidfiler, as you would like to see first in more thorough explanations. <br /> <br /> This kind of fraud or trap of fundamentalists is nothing new, young people are often attracted to a free rock concert, which can start with something innocent and suddenly cross the Christian music, then an advice and an altar call. Such an intelligent fantasy might be the devil's power. But maybe Christian belief may soon be due to his death, these people think that something goes wrong, a cheating or a joke or a scary strategy is acceptable to try to keep faith alive, as well as facing both serious secularism as well as serious conflicts. The challenge of religion like Islam is the fastest rising religion in the world, which can replace Christianity, because Islam is much more solid and united, and is significantly more deserving than Christian fundamentalism. Although it will provide little benefit to mankind, it will replace an intolerant thinking with others. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film ends with less than or less than a form of Pascal's competition. Only suspicious about everything is called Atheist Australian. Well, if you die after death and do not fall into the death, then nothing happens, do not worry ... but if you are wrong <br /> <br /> Basically, the statement means For going without an atheistic aspect or imagine the Christian, going for a lie or black and white sloppy. Even if atheists are wrong, Christianity will not be correct by default, or if Christianity is full of the horizons of his theology, materialistic atheists are by default in the right way. <br /> <br /> We all know that Native American spirituality can be the best description of the ultimate reality and we wanted to better treat all the world and its creatures. <br /> <br /> This movie should be stamped in the box: Caution: Religious campaigning and not informative or entertaining purpose.
