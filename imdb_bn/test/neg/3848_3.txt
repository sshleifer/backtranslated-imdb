There is only one $ 3 for your local video store, or any cost to rent movies, and the painful hour-and-here-here-film is a general plan. Go to a friend's house, talk to them to rent pests, check for the first 30 seconds or more and make some excuses to leave. The opening sequence is really fun, definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, 99% of other movies are awesome. Without the shower scene at the beginning it is one of the worst movies of all time.
