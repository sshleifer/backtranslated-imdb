The basic concept behind "Harrow Dungeon" is not bad at all. Acting, however, is bad. Light is bad Music is bad Torture scene is without emotion. There is not much there to recommend this film. You know what kind of movie you are for credits when it's called "special guest star" and a list of people you have never heard of. Can say good "Reham Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." Because you can not really identify a person in this film. One or two decent moments, mostly at the end and I think the main plot outline can be a real concept, but alone which is not enough to make you awaken this otherwise awakening.
