No matter what you've heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. Not worth investing more than two hours, strategic teenagers are looking at dancing, singing, learning and girls in the dressing room. <br /> <br /> Every clinic in this movie finds a delicious little house. Looking for a gay teenager to take. It was great that it was regarded as something more than a second plot point. There is a GETO baby who has a lot of attitude - what, am I surprised? And guess what? They all want to grow bigger, gain fame and find luck, and they all want to crawl on smoking their own mother's body. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, this picture is remembered for her music. But in reality, only moderate good song "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still very sugar from any real value. The two most popular songs are either, are not. The meaningless lungs are sinking through a perfect philosophy of "Fame" meaningless dance-in-street scenes. And "I can sing physical power" (understanding the name of Bubber?!?!?!?!?) Is just an unparalleled joke. <br /> <br /> Just because of bad acting, tasteless dialogue, and hack guides ("Ivita" is the director), only Michael Crescine's help in doing simple camera work. But cinematography alone can not carry a film, especially like it is irrelevant and unmatched.
