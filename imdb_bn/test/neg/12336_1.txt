We get to see who are good guys Union And those bad guys, who are a wealthy person to steal and steal his spoiled sons. The filmmakers force us to look good from evil. All characters hate bad boys so that seeing the film can help us as well as hate the bad people. This is the worst kind of movie - Manipulative and pillow. A policeman who is in good and bad centers the plot, and he stuck in this ugly movie. It's annoying and vain. The description by Star Kitch is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, attracted to the heels, does not like the guy and we do not like. It takes a long time to close the burr and tightens the title for itself; Then when it does not stop, it crashes after a minute. Annoying One of the worst movies ever made.
