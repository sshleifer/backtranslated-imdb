I'm completely on the line of this kind of story, but once the movie was fired, I honestly said with a loud voice, "I only paid Christian dollars for the budget of two dollars". What I like about this movie was only a descendant story, but it was widely executed. Awesome actors, awesome aspects and producers. <br /> <br /> Director and producer need to watch the clock before trying to close a movie in one room. There was absolutely nothing that worried you about the fact that you noticed that you were not in the same movie on the same movie. Awesome! The eyes of two main actresses were very easy and you can say that the director was counting on keeping your attention. But these two and their biology could speak with this, horrible behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not hire this. If you are not blind, then only a few stars can see it, if you only hear it.
