"Board Chairman" is a ridiculous stupid movie on top of the popular comic cow (also seen in 1-800-collection advertisements). He plays a surfing inventor who came on a flat tire. The top helped him and after few days he found the death of the man and gave his company comedians. Even if someone else was in the role of a cow, it was still bad. The joke (which is always disgusting throughout life) is terrible and should discard the idea of ​​a romantic "plot twist". Not at all !!!
