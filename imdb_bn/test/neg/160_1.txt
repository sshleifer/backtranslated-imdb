My God ... I have not seen such a terrible movie for a long time ... long time ... I saw last night and wanted to go after 20 minutes ... Somebody knightly tried such a tough, but she could not handle it. Shortly after that it stopped the pronunciation and could not fulfill the role of the career ... Siena Miller's acting took you to a point where you asked yourself Has started at: Has he ever read acting? There was no trial with the class playing class of love judging by love, but should be thought to be in the near future ... Both of them look really beautiful ... so they should focus on their career in the future. If they can act as an actress You can!
