I can not believe the number of people referring to Lead characters as 'cow cow' !! There is no such thing! There are cows and bulls and all male bulls of bovine species and there are uders !!!! There was even an actual calf but it was completely another kind of animal! My god makes it human ear on a cat, boobs on Superman, or Mickey Mouse with the blonde Shirley temple curls - even in animation it does not work! Providing human qualities to animals is not something new and expected, but actual bodies are actually intertwined for a family cartoon to be transformed into a converted person - how many people-editors, writers, producers, animators saw it and did not know anything good or did not know anything - it's Absolutely wonderful! I'm not a snip and I found animation - Simpson, Beves and Guthead, South Park, even the age of ice and all the other newcomers - Hedge was great - but this nuts - absolutely nuts - I could not accept that many people are unaware and I The film continued to put hope for a cause for uders - an explanation - someone came - and in the end they kept this stranger calf and half his stomach Ddara and they say, 'it's a boy, I nearly cried !!!! Please, the author / creator let us in the fun!
