It is one of the four top-notch films of the 1970s, by TV writer Lane Slate on the sensational murder of small towns. They show the characteristics of favorite TV personality as well as the police chief and playful characters, with the light-touch interests of the city. Others are: They only kill their master (James Garner, 1972); And The Girl in the Uncle Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Try to move among comfortable characters at a relaxed pace and at least say a mystery with some complicated twists or try to feel like a small town to explore it. At this stage, they have some entertainment (they often have some application that seems to be replaying themselves). But they refrain from colorful or humorous overall thin stories and conversations, sling passings, bland settings, flats or excessive letters and closed, compulsory attempts (often children or crude). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most serious about the stories, characters, pacing, and tone. Although ALLA is well-used to have their best supporting castes; Pale casts compared to Griffith Alda is the best director. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises and drama "Amazing". The killer's method is inventor. The voice is more intensely than Griffith, and the dialogue is more normal. Alda's film does not hurt the transplants in cities or hawk's big cities like smugglers, which are portrayed as a Hollywood script writer, which is not genuine (The worst criminal is 'Pipsecak' 'White'), we have been told, Chase to make a jeep up and stop with the trailer to serve as a temporary bank branch   টা করে, পুলিশ নৌকার জন্য ডক দূরে টেনে নিয়ে গিয়ে কৃষকের ট্রাক থেকে টমেটো চুরি করে তাদের জন্য কিছুই পান না, এবং "স্পিরি টি। বেবিলিস" এর প্রত্যাহারের স্লিপে $ 11 পূরণ করেছেন শুধুমাত্র টেলার দ্বারা আবিষ্কৃত)। Please do not miss out, Griffith movies ("Are you going for lunch?"?) "I'm going to the boat." "Will you take the boat to the lunch?" I'm not going to lunch "You're not going to take the boat to the lunch? ";" There is no fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here? "" Horse Mountain is illegal. "" Posted here also, you broke the law. "" Some Laws There is no fish in this lake. "" So why are you fishing here? "" I told you, it's illegal in Horse Mountain. ";" Call Lloyd, my name is Lloyd. "" OK, Lloyd ... "" Call me Lloyd, it's my name. My name is Lloyd. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" And reluctant, of course, is not a red hot law enforcer for claiming rival cities, as much as Slate's character admits, then, due to an abusive name recognition, the obvious obvious scene is delayed. His secretary, Lassar, gave a major direction to him ("I do not think so," he said!) An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot revolt, leads to the source of other gifts. <Br / > <br /> Worse, Barnes is more interested in defeating police-style military-style helmets for her help. (Fatal game too Proposal by the Slate military forces have some of) the uncertainly of a known goal by defending a late-killing permits. Barnes, his gun drawn, or take control trying to do, his car repeatedly a crime scene to escape the murderer by a repeatedly to stop it. Again, he was vulnerable, and almost killed in the climatic scene, which resulted from multiple errors in his part, which is partially corrected in part. The uncertain northeast accent that affects Alda does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> there are plot holes here. Why the killer strike after all these years? And it seems impossible to kill the first two without a trace. But there is nothing compared to them later - a couple together, shopkeepers at the store, sitting fully in their offices, deputies and unbelievably their dogs! <br /> <br /> <br /> Slate is all injected into the movie that is something offensive material. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. Then she tries to behave her rudely at every humiliation and humiliation and avoid her kids. Talking about this, and female doctor, a strange, middle-spirited pattern smack (Garner's movie is described as "lazy", where he and the deputy with a view of how the girl is on the back seat of a car, hurting a jolt in the street, in his car The man who had closed his body bite, Griffith's feature is the routine of ersatz rover, which Among the women, she shamefully tries to stop people from "supply closet"; a void locker - a room-type exchange with a deputy in the discussion about the death of a young car accident, "(Did you take her out?" "I took her away once.") Banker's name as "Barnes" is referred to as "swelling in places." He was "very tall" and "two A description of a female doctor's practice as a recurring table and a flashlight. "Fraud Ryan suggests" Growing some house ", and Gregith, an abusive theorem, which is followed by a female play, a deputy play, as a drupe add" sleeping Sleep "). Finally, the album of Alad is very, bleak-out, colorless, lifeless, and feeling. Just adds the Louise Lasser spark. At least some other movies had some souls, scenes and pleasant music; Griffith came out on the banks of the hill, onto the lakes and even in big cities. Do you feel like seeing the master or the empty grave more frustrating.
