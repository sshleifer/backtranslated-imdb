I will not waste your surprise by mentioning any strange plot lines, I would just say that this movie is suffering from poor animation, acting, obvious tag lines ?? This is some of his good qualities. If you are evicted on an isolated island and you get the only link to civilization, then the film is thrown to the fish. I can not tell you how sorry I saw this horrible ghastly movie. Unless it is said that this movie is not likely to be classified as a horror movie for general truth that the only real actor of the film is the ability of some actors to play. <br /> <br /> Take care.
