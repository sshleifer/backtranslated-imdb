Sincerely, people ... I was really ready to write the Razi Council and recommended this movie as a Razzi Champion for 2007 ... until I reached IMDb.com and its copyright date is not of 2006 and 2007. Understand, this movie could easily be a Razzie Champ. This movie sucked! How this wickedness was abandoned around the world to get the nomination of Razzie in 2006 was also beyond me, because it could easily compete, because it was very easy to compete for the 2006 Rage Championship. <br /> <br /> I hired this movie on my neighbor's neighbor's recommendation, who told me, "O my God, after watching this film, it's going to be a long, long time before I've ever stopped resting ! " I can not believe this movie is scary and horrific! Potential spoilers below, that you can not lose anything. <br /> <br /> All right, first of all ... Problems ... the rest stop yourself. Clearly this piece piece director does not know the first thing about women. That was the same level as one of the toilets movie trainings in the rest stop. I do not demand to know everything about women, but one thing I know is that in most cases women are completely clean and tasty / delicious. If you choose a vapor between the toilets and maybe some caught or jumped into the wood, then choose a woman to do squatting in wood. I know, because I went to camping with them before, and there is no problem squatting in their woods. So okay ... the main plot and the lies ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... he comes out of the rest stop, and his boyfriend finds reasons to drive No, not even him. His car He just got it. He starts crying his name, wondering where he is. Ummm ... hello? You're standing on wet mud ... for some tire tracks it ever happened to you? I mean, his car is gone ... it did not get up. And actually, who thinks me ... I was actually looking at her feet, and there was no footprint in the clay. How ... exactly that ... it happened? <br /> <br /> Third ... The Bible spreads parroted pictures to the mobile home family with the Fikk midget ... Wtf!!?!?!? ? They did not give any knowledge at all, and it seems strange because the director is strange. They did not understand everything and there was no place in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my God, this ... means, finally ... at the end of the film. Finally he saw the escape hatch on the roof inside the rest stop. I'm fine, "You ... fool ... Due ** J. You've stopped all this time for the rest ... and you just ... see ... now ... to avoid sealing the ceiling?" I mean ... it's just as they threw gasoline on the killer window and ready to light a match. So to avoid burning him, you have to get high ground, and ... oh, look! A perfect reason for him to get high ground! A turn jerk on the ceiling! Like it ... why did not he go before? In that situation, most people see that at that moment they got locked in that rest and got f ** k from Dodge. When they fled towards the end of the movie, then I said, "I have to have fun." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the deal with the people who faced him? Just disappearing? The rest of the girl will stop the rest? Fooled Police? When he ended his own Kumar's closet at the end? It has not been explained. Personally, when they did this, I thought to myself, "Oh, Christ on the cracker, this is his, he is a murderer. Wonderful, he has killed all the people, and I do not seem to be the author of these pictures, I am unable to mention IMDB.com. I blocked the specific French horror fix or in the end (to give the movie, that people could suck too many people) "But it was not. He is not a murderer, and full involvement with the dead person has never been explained. Oh, God's love, man, stay away from this movie! This movie sucked the ball, and I now got a serious bone to take with my neighbor. It's 2 for family $ 1 rack in a family video, but do not even think if it gives you free!
