This was quite bad. Pedestrian work or bad I did not think it really was really bad, it was not homophobic. If it was really amateur, you are 14 years old and find the first damn word and skin mags. <br /> <br /> The main love of this movie is to fall flat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One minute we see this boy catch a cheater, then we are in a gay club, then we are on a date. Somewhere outside the girl apparently likes comics, and then they sleep together. If Shakespeare thinks of this truly someone like producing an elementary school, then Hamlet was written by a gentle boy. <br /> <br /> Finally the last girl on some sort of revenge fantasy at the top by a damaged. Unnecessary and actually annoying. <br /> <br /> You still have to see it. Why <br /> <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the director's talk is sunny - what professional discussions about "bouncing" or "hooking up" with actresses? Dialogue sucked, relationship lack of chemistry. You have to be laughing at this scary jackass.
