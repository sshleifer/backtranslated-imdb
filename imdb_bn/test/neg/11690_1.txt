Remember that terrible war movies have your grandmother forced you to see your old VHS recorder 25 years or more? "The Fallen" is a bad execution of these movies! The story is terrible, the horror is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together create helpless nightmares. <br /> <br /> It's too slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while watching it but I could not do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie! That's bad! There are a lot of ten lines so I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Now press the Eject Button and you will not regret it!
