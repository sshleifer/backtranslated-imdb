This movie is awesome. Acting cheesy and funny Match action is annoying if you know something about rugby. Actually, there is more reality than the Power Rangers episode of this film. More than one pass in 'Action' and no shot is given on the shot line of a person or without ball, and the shot of the hand knows no harm. It's impossible to say. There is nothing to build scoring score that has exciting, skill and true rugby. As a matter of fact, it is trying to imitate a tradition, which they do not know, like the white street character that should be dropped from the film. The next time the rugby movie has been made, we can only hope that those who know the rugby make it.
