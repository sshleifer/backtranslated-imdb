This movie was played last month on Lifetime Movie Network and I decided to test it. I looked for the first 20 minutes and then stopped / c I'm sorry, but there is nothing other than the movie shadow of an intriguing plot with the movie plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is about to get a bicycle-driven child, accidentally off the road about a woman, get a leaf called it, and it is called only a hit and it is a 'monster' that is 'hit' (ultimately killing) Have a search. /> <br /> This is a movie about a rich neighborhood woman who has 2 small grade school children and an active, consolidating woman and still working on this film should be credible, not a cell phone owner. Sorry, but this is entirely BS especially when everyone seems to be there - then they found the girl on the street to call 911 - when our lead lady went to 911 number Payphone When the lead lady returns, the ambulance is already on the side of the girls and how horrible people die there and leave them. <br /> <br /> Just dump. Sorry, but I'm not sure that this woman is not a cellphone owner who is needed to make films work. Thanks, do not insult my intelligence movie. Maybe it was held in the 1970s or 1960s, but I would buy it, but it was obviously a present day film (1999) ..But wait, if he was a cell phone, there would not be any movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> The girl was in her home computer because she knew clearly about technology, because the children played games because all the movies were killed in her car on the cellphone, her resorts were made by the police. Another way to call a cell phone. Only after leaving out, they created a ridiculous plot.
