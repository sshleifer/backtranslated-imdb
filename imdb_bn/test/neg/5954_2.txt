This image got so much. Prehistoric society, courage, romance, true Brotherhood, violence, gender, religion; All are well illustrated .. Besides a word !!! And how sucks so bad? You need to review this image to review the source of humanity. If it is the origin of anthropology, then you deny Darwin's theory and hegelian synthesis together. You can not bear to see even this with your brain closed. And now you're thinking, "I've seen it." I warned you. You are not responsible for taking any duties for an hour to travel around this piece of art. Well, I warned you. This should be forgotten and burnt for ever.
