All the lousy jaws by my favorite beloved directors have been rip-off lousiest sadly created; Lamberto Bava (here under his old junior pseudonym). How do you go for this cheap European imitation, right? They only want their monster creatures to be big, sick and more threaty, but this is more often than the opposite effect. Bove's life is a huge sea-devil and it's just a shark! We're probably dealing with a great white jaw and appetite, with a prehistoric monster, but it has an octopus-like tentacles! To a couple of dolphins-loving oceans, to discover how this monster was able to survive for thousands of years and why she had just started the void of her assassination. The script of "Monster Shark" is not less in any sense, and most of the steps take place on the mainland. Shark itself is a strange humorous creation and Lamborghto Bava's is an intelligent decision that can show it indiscriminately and quickly in a flash. Above performance is above average and water photography is surprisingly clean and well-managed. The twists in the plot are predictable and you will probably be most striking in the most fun spot about characters. For example: count all the beer in the beer. Hogan gets all over the movie!
