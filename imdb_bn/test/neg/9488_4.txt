One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly the worst one. A red shirt falls for the female khan (for change - for a change in the name of the dead) and then came forward to betray Kirk and the enterprise, such as the characteristics of the unshakable character of the loyalty vessel. One kind of psychology has examined how it is used to test humans during such a fantastic spectacular starlet appointment. There is a similar absurdity lacking in "Anne's Week of Ai", when red shirts take men next to men because they fall in love! Same as SS (However, betrayal in this episode plays a small role in the overall plot.) It is very stupid because it again looks like a bunch of soft-headed, easily-affected emirates of Kirk crew, who - once they fall into love with the enemy - just some Able to do about me The return of McGivares to Kirk does not improve the miracle by any means. Lord McGivath and Lord Mactakoth ... <br /> Why did Khan know why he kept his back behind the regular door about his superior power? This is a few ST plots-devices that weaken Kirk's intelligence. Why did McKaye's knife knife against the throat? If Khan has such intelligent intelligence, then one of them tells him to be more impressive with his own path. And what's going on with the hobby in Latin? Montalban was supposed to provide a vocal coach. I've heard "Plainnee Playyeine!" At any moment in the background. Why would Kirk (or a ship captain) provide the unlimited use of the ship's library to someone with an enterprise technical details? Is an institution completely made of idiots in Starfleet? <br /> <br /> SS is a very cartoon, intelligent episode, so do not be surprised to love Trekki. It does not have many scientific material components, which most hate Trekis. It further strengthens that the ST franchise chose to revive this inferior role for the second film, just as the very frustrating trackbacks with the first film, which you had guessed - the idea - the average smallest Trekkie brain
