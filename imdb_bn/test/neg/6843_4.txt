The most fertile man in Ireland has turned around 24-year-old Ammon Manny and is still going virgin. She lives with her mother in Belfast. She is very shy about women. When he is motivated by a woman, everything has changed for Amon (as long as I can remember a neighbor). It can not defeat his virginity, but he has discovered that he has a power. Despite the protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. She told by the doctor that her very sperm count is there. His mother brings bright ideas that we can see almost green kids at the end of the film. She started helping women on both sides of Belfast to conceive. Firstly, with the help of his colleague, he runs a business voluntarily. Ireland's most fertile man has got his funny moments but he will have to bring good jokes and a good script. I did not think it gave me a TV sitcom instead of a movie. Chris Marshall does not shine as a different name but star on the silver screen. It's like someone you watched in such movies. Actually he was in love (I think he was very funny in it) .. Well, it was okay to see but could not help to stop periodically. ** Out of *****
