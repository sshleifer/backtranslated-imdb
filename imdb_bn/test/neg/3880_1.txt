Rs.30 / - I paid for the movie DVD rental and believe it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood directors think that being funny is funny? Well it is not well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Similarly, after stupid running. Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> <br /> All right, this title was, I had to run away from me. :) I've switched to Star movies and instead saw Home Alone 2, and had a good smile.
