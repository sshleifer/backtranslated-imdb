Sometimes when a film is panned by critics, it is only to see if it is actually as bad as the claim, in this case it was. I believe it was meant to be a sex comedy, but it was not sexy or funny, I think once I failed to travel to Johnny Vegas a road and that was it. <br /> <br /> Following the life of the film, all four of the potato suppliers for the living have a problem with their sex life; Dave has left his wife and is looking for an old flame that invited him to a threesome a few years ago, Ferre is living with his father-in-law, who thinks of him as sex objects, is a passion involved in strawberry jam in his encounters. And Jeremy claims to be a loving relationship, but actually pushing some poor women. <br /> <br /> Jokes' tones change from vain "I do not believe anyone can write it." Later, when they say to a small child that his father died in a car accident, when the boy asks for a punch When his mother is there, tell him, he is in the waist. The accuser of the accusation of blaming these lands on the authors' feet has probably made a bad choice to live in this film, but I do not think that their performance was all bad ... not that it was good. There is no nudity for a roughly silly movie about sex, and sex is never sex. <br /> <br /> I think this morgade will not recommend seeing it for any reason other than curiosity but it is being judged by other reviews to love or hate the film, I suspect it will be good with some beer and your partner .
