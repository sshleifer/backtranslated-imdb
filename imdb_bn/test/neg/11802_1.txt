Okay they tell you the truth. They do not list any screenliters or directors, but no one will prove to see this movie - for this you are not expecting. The conversation rarely sounds like natural natural conversation ... but sounds like scripts are not heard. (Possibly short script). It takes too much for me to try to ad-lib always. (About which they were always bad). Therefore, they knew that they were creating a 'movie', not only collecting actual natural footage. So I'm sure these people knew what was happening, they knew that there were certain marks that they were set up ... and they were just talking about all the advertising sciences nearby. <br /> <br /> ****************************************************************************** ***************** Every item, spot or thing that can be weird or fears d can use, stages sorcerers by these people. Let me remind you that laughingly listed folded things: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes of entry into the house, they launch a light switch - light spark and a chandelier fall around a man <br / > <br /> 2) When they discover cellar, they find an old medical bag with a bloody slaughter knife *. <br /> <br /> 3) They have a lighthouse to hear a word, so they slowly open the door - BAM - there is a cat and there is a jump right in the camera to cry. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they noticed that there is a hole in the wall, so let us hold our hand ... Wow, they pulled out a doll's doll wrapped in a mummy tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to Atik, oh, hello looks like 'heavy' here .... Boom - Fly across a chair room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no! The bug was that the girl had a roc in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Take out the WAZ board ... a foot on the open plan fell beside the board. It can not be such that people can prevent it? (They find a ghost named Charles) <br /> <br /> Wait! The chimney was that word ... CLINK - Oh my shackles out "I think he * kept people here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now wimpy girl is going to be brave looking chimney shafts. Oh, this is what she saw ... and looking at the chimneys, people are asking what it is. SWISH - It falls off directly to her. (The perfect camera shot) he just came in time. It had more chains. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we should separate and each of our 'clean up' cells - if these things can not happen one after the other with each other ... okay <br /> <br /> Chicken # 1: Wow, suddenly he is going to sleep ... but there is no laziness. <br /> <br /> Duaude # 1: Actually say to yourself, "Charles, so you are Charles ... it is not a figment you imagine because you can not be you Charles". Well guess, he knocked over and got dragged across the floor. Another lucky camera shot. Chak # 2: Listening to things ... Try to communicate ... and there is something that is standing there or getting annoying. <br /> <br /> # 2: She was in the attic, reached her hand through a hole in the floor and got a splinter .... I do not remember anymore. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude gets # 2, chick gets # 2. They are shouting chick and buddy # 1 ... they find them wrapped in a wall and strapped in a table. (*) They leave. Black cut The final text is treated for minor cuts, they tell us safely escaped. They had nightmares and insomnia since then, the next day it was a 911 call they were made with a name called "Charles". <br /> <br /> **************************************************************** **** ********* ********** <br /> <br /> When I first heard about making this movie, I could not wait. I think it's going to be real. Real, real - And with more professional, professional person type. I love this kind of idea, I really want to see hunting footage. Before the release of this movie I saw couples' reviews online. Both of them have claimed that it was fake and how stupid people were. Over time, I forgot the movie .... Then I realized that it was not released in the theater. So I went to the video directly to it, rented it ... found that each cruel review was completely true. It's too bad, I really wanted to be good at this. <br /> <br /> Random Thoughts: The cell, radio ... The recharge that I think does not seem like ... which I do not think would have lived there for a long time. Especially the house is actually known for being frightened ... I'm sure nobody will live there. But it looks so clean and clear ... and what is a cat doing? Property is not close to neighbors .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br /> <br /> <br /> Or if you've heard it long before and it energizes you. (Be disappointed if you expect a good movie or original movie) <br /> <br /> Random Thoughts: I believe the producer says "The footage you see is real." Well technically it is not real footage? Real footage of fake hauntings? Maybe his loop hole was there. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a star - strictly they told the story of Madame Laoli. A real New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best actor was the man who taught participants about ghost hunting equipment at the beginning. He was probably real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
