This was by the worst movie I've ever seen. And Alexander, the castle 2 and the new world compared to it. <br /> <br /> I will go back to Blockbuster and ask for my refund by compensation because it was really a sad experience. For the first ten minutes I was zooming in on my widescreen TV because the actor was out of the screen. I was not able to make such a bad film this day and age, I was not wrong. While typing this message, I thought about a good reason to buy this movie. There is a joke at Xmas. I blame Mrs right now that she has picked it, thanks baby. <br /> <br /> Be careful ... .. all round the real shock !!!!!!
