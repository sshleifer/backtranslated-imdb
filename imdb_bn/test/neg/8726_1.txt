I loved the David Lynch version because I was looking forward to watching this film. My first attempt at seeing this was when I fell asleep. Nothing is happening. The next night I tried to see the rest, let me sleep again! There is no incident in this movie which can keep any person's interests alive. When I tried it in fast forward, it was only exciting! The DVD came with a second disc, which contained bonus elements. Do not say, Don (2000) I had no problem going through torture to see more. Here are the low points: The acting was bad, the plot shifted slowly, the sets were looked cheap and the direction was unfortunate and the CGI visual effects were pillow. <br /> <br /> If you want to see pieces, save your money or rent the 1984 edition.
