The sender returned, a.k.a convicted, almost incomplete. One of the best things about this particular film is that I was not bothered. It is said that I did not see the same movie which could enjoy this movie as the success of a low-budget movie. Instead of writing a review and instead of knowing what to say and what it does and how it works. Not working, I only comment on anything works. This movie has a holes of plot that you can run through a half. Acting in the film is not very good, although it may be due to a script, which is so poorly said that it can be the ghost of George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional sets or clothing for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention some plot holes? At the end of the movie, you think how a good shotgun could be shot with a dark shotgun, why Keny Preston believes in Eden Quinn, why he would sleep at night before killing his client, how Eden Quinn could drive 400 miles in a short time, In the movie, why Eden quinn is not the fifth, instead of the nippes bunch. <br /> <br /> All that is said, this is definitely a B-Scene Mother, and that is a terrible one. Unfortunately, it is not good enough to be good. If you value your time, please serve as a public service message to avoid it.
