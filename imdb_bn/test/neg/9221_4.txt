This is a stupid movie with many singing and dancing. The average of acting, but some pages are preferred for writing. Budi Eppsen has a memorable performance, a small but extravagant performance of Gypsy Rose as a rich playwright's bitter wife. Completely unbelievable illustration of college life, which ended with a fantastic ice skating exhibition in Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to move forward quickly through the part of the movie
