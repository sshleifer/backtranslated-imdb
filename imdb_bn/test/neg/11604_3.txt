Alfred Hitchcock created this comedy in 1941, but it was not present in his heart. Carol Lomber and Robert Montgomeri, who discovered that they were never legally married and the film turned towards true love. It has a lot of fame and why it is easy to see. Joke is well known to the film but here they do not jail. And the lead is uncharismatic. Lamborghini's performance is Clip and Starkey and it's sad twice that he died just a year later. Robert Montgomery thinks he is in the ear of a seed and tried his catastrophic efforts to find silk purses without much success. The best actor comes from Gin Raymond as 'another man' (he has a pretty drunk scene). This is one of the few really bad hitc movie.
