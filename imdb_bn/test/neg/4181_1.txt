The first DH was not that great, but I did not really expect it to be. But this horror movie was out of criticism. I tried to look really bright and could give it a chance, but I could not find a really good thing about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just soooooo annoying. The story of the movie is not really bad. Actually, it's a bit original. But the cinema form is really quite bad as many people say. In my opinion, this one has the right with "Off Season", and "Dakulah 3000". I know many people really trash and puts down such kind of movies, but I can not really think of something else to say about it.
