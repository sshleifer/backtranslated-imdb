I saw this movie that I really started thinking but it eventually led me to despair. My problem with this movie was that the director was a bit weird and hard-working to make the original. There were many flashbacks and very bad "effects" that bothered me through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this movie, they could do a better job. This image was committed at the beginning, dragging in the middle and finally disappointing. In the film's controversial subject, curiosity and fundamentalism, it can not defeat Stanley Kubrick's progressiveness.
