A very non-Tom and Jerry short. Jerry describes this story, revolving around Tom and losing the cat to his rival chest. Good friend with Tom Jerry is irked here a bit. The cartoon is also presented in the cinemusic. Overall I found this tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressing. Instead of "Puss gets booted" on the DVD and I'd be happy. This experimental animated short Warner Brothers 2-DVD Spotlight collection set can be found at Disk 2. It's the last of the set and I hope Warner Brothers will soon like to release a second volume. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
