The only reason for the existence of FC De Kampioenen is its local popularity. It has surrounded the sitcom for 15 years (and still counting). <br /> <br /> It talks about an amateur football team with an emphasis on "amateur". Each storyline discusses the same thing: some misunderstandings that take the ridiculous (and expected) ratio to the end. <br /> <br /> The show has been going on for more than 15 years now, and the production has probably not decided to change a winning team. This means that the show has made minor changes over the years (some of the actors are replaced (rather than leaving each other in the show). Laughter has not changed in years, and it was old before it was first publicized. <br /> <br / > I think you have to be Flemish to get it, and more than 60 years old, enjoy such an old fashion TV show.
