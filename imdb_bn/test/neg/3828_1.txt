I can find words to describe how this piece of God offended me. American filmmakers are always going out of ways to portray Westerners as a bunch of chasing children, and worse, while trying to imitate the speech of the people, who think of Jamaican as curious? We are not all very dark, we do not carry masks for all work or protection, we do not go home and we do not practice vido !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, business people and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I am sick and tired and tired to see these pictures of Jamaican people as a group of streetfire cloths, who are sitting in a dry bath weed or winding shooting gun in the air (when we are not living in our plant houses). Yes, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weed is not valid on the island and the possibilities we can speak English better than you! The worst part is, it is not just anger and bitterness to me, the real answer to these questions is that most of the people traveling abroad have been asked for some time. Before you guess how you are in another country, read a book and even worse, decide to make a film about it. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Jamaica! Wherever we do everywhere, killing white people and beat our bongo drums ... The stories of the crypt formally ill me with the entire staff of this illness, especially the authors, who have worked.
