I'm not sure what it looks like but the film about the seductive Bigfoot is a curse. There is still a movie which deliberately does not look at the subject, and does not create any real mystery. The first movie titled "Legend of Bogi Crick" (1972) and "Saskatche" (1978) became a minority, but it was not very memorable. Both films were targeted by family-friendly audiences, and thus they actually stopped trying to become frightened. "Harry and the Hendersonas" (1987) was the first big budget movie to use Big Batter, it's a terrific creature of Rick Bucker. However, they have also chosen to target young viewers, but this time as a comedy (in 1995 as "Bigfoot"). I've waited long to deal with the issue as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "gaus" or "predator" When I saw it in my local video store, my dream came true. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen played the role of a millionaire in pursuit of the Pacific Northwest in hopes of finding one of her daughters, when she was on a small plane when the mountain crashed. The courtyard sounded attractive and sounded. The truth is that it is never made any real mystery. I'm not interested in any of the characters myself because they were very dual and rather soft. Even the always reliable Henriken seems to be on the phone in its performance. Every time she appears on screen she looks easy bored. There is no way to talk about the first hour of the film. For animals, where do I start? I rarely think that we see a cool monster walking around the woods, but instead we found this lip (yes, I said, "lip!") Here people have black black skin and animal patch. Take a cross between the moon and the wheel to "grab the land" and you'll get the idea. I do not assure you anything like artwork in the cover box. Sloppy editing and unintentional side adds more to the confusion, which was limited to sequences of more than half, and half of the film is used continuously by this long, gradually fade out (which is not served in any sense or service for any purpose). They even have the entire infra-red vision P.O.V. from animals of "predators". Steals, which seems very effective and very effective. Probably all of these prove that Hollywood should forget about trying to create Bigfoot films, since they are still working. So far, everyone has become scary as a "episode" of 3/10 episode
