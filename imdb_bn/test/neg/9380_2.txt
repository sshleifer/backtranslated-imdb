The only good thing about Persepolis is the German Expressionism-Style of Animation and an indication of history. This movie bothered me. It was a woman who was dissatisfied with her culture, who tried everything else and turned her roots back. Here he is again dissatisfied and finally resigned in the final post, he will not be there to support the situation of all other people in his country and now what they will do. It comes with no conclusion and leaves us with the feeling that this woman has no loyalty. If you think that he is broken into culture and it does not seem important enough and important to figure out what an important background is. He listens to many voices, and perhaps more than a world citizen will end up with his relationship with his local culture. The only thing I got from this movie was that angst.
