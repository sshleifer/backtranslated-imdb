We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes a cake. I saw a junior movie box that returned many times from my travels to the horror of the local video store and I was a little interested, it seems that the Texas Chenoso paid some tributes to the genocide, so I thought. I do not understand this. Wrong! Junior sucks with harsh, long, and commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it won my awards for the most creative use of bikini tops. To avoid !!
