According to my opinion, Quantin has just written and directed a good movie and it is a multi award winner, Paul Fiction. However, most movies, especially the latest, genuine real Turkey People still rate him and his staff today and I can not really see why. Many directors and writers now produce more entertainment in all aspects of their film. At this moment, I will not believe in a Tarantino film campaign. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing was very long and bad, but you felt it. Had fun, good, short and that's fun. Violence was nothing new (minus the last scene). Sometimes the dialog was very drawn. <br /> <br /> They will love this movie for some; And for others they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought the matter of the Nazis was finally in bed with the German film Der Untergang in 2004.
