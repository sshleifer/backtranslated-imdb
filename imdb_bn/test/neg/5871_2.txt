You're too late and only one of the movies you've got available if you're just a basic cable. It is hard to believe that this movie was made in '95, it seems like something in the late 80's. Fortunate young people face a proud ice cream in different home-related problems, who are on the mission of creating the best aroma: Swarm Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely tragic and scary and absolutely ridiculous, only ridiculously scary. Actually, the real thing about this movie is the terrible thing that these kids face at home. These children are not afraid of any escape from their silent colonies, walking around like a park in a nearby lonely park. The most ridiculous part of this film is probably a slim pre-teen with a mountain of padding under his baggy sweatshirts, so probably the "fat baby". I guess they were a) they did not discover / could not afford a fatty suit, b) Casting Director was very happy to have a baby star or c) We really believe that this baby is hungry and has a hugely distended stomach. <br /> <br /> So if you live up to 2 morning and ridicule your narcotics with friends, it is ridiculous and desperate to move forward and take a look. Personally, I'd rather sleep.
