John Knolls is the masterpiece of the modern works, a separate peace, a lot of fine one, and the shortest sound, love theme, hatred, jealously, denial and Afghanistan. The 1972 edition tried to deal with this style and what the book is about - a love story with flashing battle in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use exaggerated images in the story. When you read a novel what is your face - it's a love story, and yes it's justified, the story of gay love. In the novel and film version of 1972, there is sexual activity everywhere written and dialogue. These tensions were dropped in the 2004 showtime film version, and the actors played thirteen thirteen children of the twentieth century, which resulted in matureness in some softness or hesitation. The youth's innocence <br /> <br /> I do not like this remake for more reasons. The camel's camel that was broken was given the title given to the phoenice letters received from the draft board! Finny is not a character that requires a last name. John Nowels did that deliberately. <br /> <br /> Although I took the 1972 version, the role was sometimes a little amateur, so it tried to be sincere in the novel by shooting on the location of the Philips Exeter Academy. Devon was based on the ACADEMY; The author John Nolos was also present as a student. <br /> <br /> The director and producer took all the teenager Exeter students apart from Parker Stevenson, who was present at the Brooks School to play Paramount Film! Class laws by preppies compared to these Canadian college shots, adult actors, politically correct, played with Platonic versions. Do not try - Veto again on this sham. The 1927 version of the film was a separate peace on screen with John Heil and Parker Stevenson. Showtime 2004 film was not made for cable version.
