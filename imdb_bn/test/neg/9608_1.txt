It is really a shame that the IMDB does not vote for you. This is the most horrendous show ever in America in the north north of our most preferred neighbor north. Dad is a troglodyte and a neurotic hag. She is charming as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same hygiene standards. He is programmed with more neuroos than the entire cast of a wax museum mannequin view. Male and especially the title character if non-agency of deceptive children beyond male and belief. The boy is quite a mad, self-satisfied, arrogant and a serious contender for the vulgar male character in Disney, which is saying something. This show was clearly considered as anti-Brady bowl, but it was stopped like anti-Christ. And why photography is so dark?
