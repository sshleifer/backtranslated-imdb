"Graduation Day" slash film was released in May 1981, during the height of frenzy. Prior to that year, fans of "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Do not Don", "Friday 13th Part 2" and "Burning" and the Theaters Still "Halloween 2", "The Prowler", and "My Happy Birthday" I have seen all these movies, and it's much worse than most popular "Graduation Day" in 1981. <br /> <br /> The amount of "graduation day" is weak, low-budget exercise, bad performance, bad writing, uninterrupted characters, pointless view, unwanted nudity, delicious dialogue, and a test that does not work so well. And can forget about the classic 80's disco music playing throughout the film (The opening scene only competes by the music that plays during a Chase scene). But while renting a movie like a person, it should be aware that this story is in this movie. So why not "graduation day" is considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday 13th", "Elm Street a Nightmare", "My Blend Valentine", "Burning", or "Promised Night"? Why fans still want to look at these movies but ignore it without care? <br /> <br /> Pensing where slash films are to be successful across all other regions. There is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher, and "graduation day" at very slow pace. The worst part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; There are many non-letter characters available and those who do not allow the killings to be suspected or hunting. A lazy teacher, a forced principal, an intelligent secretary, a Dopi school security guard, an intelligent detective, an alcoholic step father, an innocent grandma, and still a mother of a previous victim is still sad. All of these characters may be a cause of murder or killing, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story still keeps an eye on them, and occasionally marks the characters for their character's flesh. But for what <br /> <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the fact that "the day of graduation" and his little fanboy are not surprised that people are more surprised to see death scenes. Fans "Wild Life" of "The Bloody Valentine", the death of the washing machine, "My Happy Birthday", became dead for flooding scenes such as the death of the 13th part of Friday 13th death. ", And" Halloween 2 "in the death of hot tub, and even" Madman "'s car hood." But in Graduation Day, there is something truly unique (although Chasey) respect for death. "Through a hunter jaguar, a fence torn to the right On the other hand, the sword jumped like their waves. The best death includes spikes under a landing mat. <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day "Try hard for a great and unique film, but there is a logical level and it is only a logical element. Possing that is not really the worst of all." And there is a little suspension, plus this is what fans are looking for (blood, pregnant, nudity, sex), and nostalgia) but "GRA Juiced Day "will never be remembered as one of the greatest slasher films ever made." It's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low budget - but it's a question of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. " /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. The general fearsome fans may be annoyed, and those who are not very interested in fear should definitely be cleaned. It's not the worst slash film ever made, but it's a long way to be the best way.
