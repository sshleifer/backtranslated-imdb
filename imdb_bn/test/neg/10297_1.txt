It will be the worst thriller I've ever seen in a long long time. Direction, acting, and adaptation of the story may be perhaps a good plot in meaningless financing. Within a few minutes of seeing the film was easy to find the whole plot and then there is a very clear formula before leaving any mysteries. I guess in the first few minutes and I hope I was wrong and I was not much for my frustration. <br /> <br /> This movie started with two FBI agents, who went to a remote town to investigate in a remote city. Three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a policeman resigned. Their surveillance cameras are interviewed individually and each day their account says. Everybody has something to hide about themselves and the day is revealed when they tell their accounts. This section is probably the gift of preservation and if this movie can be improved, it can be made. Spolar: The whole story ends in the FBI agents as the real killer and the girl is the only one left out and so unhurt them by the left. <br /> <br /> Why was they their first idea to kill them, if they interviewed three witnesses and could go to a bond interview with a young girl? How did they show the courage to be an FBI agent? (When you discover that the original FBI agents have died and their badges have been found on them)? How do they know how to set up and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps the idea is to develop their character for revelation. . Come, they are both ridiculous, stupid and not least sinners. The character of the young girl is also potentially wasted. There is no meaning in his action, and there is no relation between any of his meaningless relationships. She does not appear annoying, but rather is rather isolated which is not explained. <br /> <br /> Life horror movie.
