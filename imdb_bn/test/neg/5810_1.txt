It's hard to know what it's so hard and blue to just say about the little film. The story is predictable when not completely ridiculous. It is not all the "charitable gesture" matter that is presented here, absolutely no stiffness. Yes, the MGM "production price" was fantastic, and yes, Miss Lammer was very beautiful, but he and the great Spencer Tracy were not together "chemistry" together - and this is the only thing that made this parade of clips all effective ... it's my understanding The movie which received the worst reviews when released; Time passage did not improve it.
