4 realz boy my game iz crazy tite yo i can wait 2 get at ds show and roll up in d club n it's real 905 style cute model n bottle, boy! <br /> <br /> No, I'm just kidding. This is a sad show, created by, and to enjoy, sad men. Those who are so discouraged by the modern existence that they circle their frustration at the clubs, where they hope to touch their little ones and unwind their stereotype and even feel their self-speed self-verification even on girls. If only for one night, such as the Toronto Sausage party board their seats are slightly less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read some comments here that this event has been in conformity with the Canadian TV's American TV or anyone else. Well, it can not be shortened. It's good, yes! Come back to Canada, Canada - you finally broke the masked formula for grounding American content as "figures", "heart of change", "alimited" and "fifth wheel". See, here the hole in the original brain "completes the cam camera". Genius And there is a thin line between the thin camera like the frank cameradar and hidden cameras, there is nothing to hide each other in the hidden cameras, which compliment each other's "game" in the club. The human love for display here is so obvious that they should be renamed "the key of the steam bath". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To do so, you must register an IMDB account for the purpose (I guess I am here Guilty of working in the same way to do the opposite work.) My personal favorite is an enthusiastic critic who "awakens the United States", now it is clear that Canada's talent has the ability to produce American quality television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But why bother to produce online buzz? You can not really cancel, after all - you comedy network in Canada, baby! The public will ignore ignoring your show over the next year. In most of the original programming in the comedy network, along with the paradigm of mediatory interaction, you will be comfortable creator in all possible possibilities of the coastal coast.
