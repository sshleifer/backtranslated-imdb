I am in a movie club at my school and I see this silly movie by compelling me to sit. The story of the film is not frustrating, but the whole film is very uncomfortable. Acting was absolutely awesome. The children were overly whiny. A metal pole could do a better job. I was extremely disappointed to fall asleep, but because television was so loud, I was away from peace. Monkeys are not beautiful, nor are they fun The play is ridiculous. I can not remember when I saw an awesome movie. The story is weak, thin, anticipated, and completely fake. Adults try to be good actors, but they just do not seem to break through the stereotypes. To leave the girl seems to want to leave the picture to fall down a hill during the film, I do not blame her. Michael Ahsan will have to apologize publicly for this picture. Not only for me, but for everyone who is forced to sit through this horror movie. Actually, I apologize to you. Even if I do not have anything to do with this project, I apologize for this movie, because it means at least someone will. This image even exceeded the discomfort of the films of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls. I can say even so much that the collection of Hilary Duff's movie is even worse, but it's hindering it. Please do not just watch this movie, otherwise push you to write such a review about how bad this movie is. I'm so sorry
