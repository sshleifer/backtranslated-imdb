I saw an hour (against my will) in this movie and could not finish it. I would rate it as 0. Writing was bad, the plot was expected and which was too much. The most annoying part of this film is played by Melody Thomas Scott. None of this section has called for Snowden to appear, but he was driven in any scene that I saw (crazy) snake or someone who is going to find something extremely annoying or cruel. <br /> <br /> Two romances that made some serious developments in the couple's meeting were too much. <br /> <br /> I know better than watching a TV movie. There is absolutely nothing on Telly and this is the only choice, read a book.
