Perhaps the probably the worst movie I've ever seen in the song. The joke's direction is very poor, the dialogue seems to have been written by a 13-year-old child, plots (no plots?) Another "mystery" that is very hard to enter. Finally, this movie is nothing good. Everyone with a big bang and especially the Montreal Film Festival who presented this movie in the competition!
