The Evil the Men Do (1984) was one of the four non-canon films created in the 80's by Charlie Branson. Most of the Canon films have played Charlie, it was not fun or entertaining. Charlie is basically tortured and brutalizes for one and a half people. If you thought he was Mr Emotion before, you wait till this! <br /> <br /> In this case, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the public that anyone who is involved with the chalk or his people will have to pay a piper. This one is not fun It's not cheesy or campy, just cruel, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like it. I have no love for this photo. No recommendation because it is not worth it. Perhaps if they do not cut the hell. See with caution. <br /> <br /> Do not disturb.
