A rather light horror movie; If not for sex scenes, it could easily be a TV movie. Plot holes (for example: a 18th-century land was burned from the top floor of the house on the ground and 200 years later the new building was installed?), The cardboard acting, the characters acted, any act larger than the shoe size It will not ... <br /> <br /> It has got a few fun moments, but overall it is a sub-parameter film that is written by Roy Scha Dar was able to get in because he was due bills. You could provide a few smiles, which you are looking for in a highly suturistic, anticipated film, it may be worth watching. If not, this is not for you.
