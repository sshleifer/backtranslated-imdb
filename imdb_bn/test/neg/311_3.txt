We were excited to rent it after seeing some reviews and seeing it score so high here. Well, we got it and we could not believe what we saw. Originally it has been published in such a way that it was written by some difficult distorted old people, which could not help in the formation of sexual disappointments and fantasies into an Enamy film which is really a lack of plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... At one moment, he is a minor kid, next time he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all out of place sexual material. I do not have any problem with sexuality and dig a movie that has some good sexual power, but it is presented in a way that is unclear. Close up of a girl crotch (many times) in the nipple slip, white panties or a swimsuit. It was entirely from the place and it seems that the person who wrote it was trying to find some imagination through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we kept looking at each other and asked what it was ... along with wake up cartoon boobs and bad conversations. You want to see some cartoon characters of quiz and crotch ... this is for you. If you're looking for something outside, this movie was empty. Characters and dialogs were just irritating to the general. <br /> <br />
