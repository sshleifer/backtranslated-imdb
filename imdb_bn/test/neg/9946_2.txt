As Jennifer Denusciau said to Square Pegas, "Let me close the door." I must definitely vote on this movie in IMDB's worst movie list. <br /> <br /> Dennis has played Christopher Tito, who is going to California to get a guy from Chicago to open his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to establish a Barney of locals only a surfing community. But she works new like civilization (just trying to ride through her sexual scene). Visitors will also have to bear the rest of the local population. Duke (Semur Castle) that the volleyball expert is trying to act like a normal person, an unexpected drunken surfer who tries to deceive his girlfriend and that the person can survive in the car for the sixth month. <br /> <br /> California's Dreaming is just a big old mess. It starts like a seventeenth-century romp, is done with the music of the bad 70 (though this film is a shy year of 80 years). And Dennis Christopher comes off as the most worrying harmful, it lets the movie make it hard (keep your finger on the fastest button). Even if this film is supposed to be about the culture of the Surfer, surf scenes are almost complete junk It seems that people can not fall asleep in the surf competition. <br /> <br /> I think Tania Roberts is the only cool out of her role in Mitz Sitcumm "Show of the 70s." And Cassell was not bad, she was just a bad movie.
