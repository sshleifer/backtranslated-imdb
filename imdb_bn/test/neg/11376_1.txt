Comparing this movie by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can tell about it is that it tries to be like a Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The scripts are horrible, characters are one-dimensional, and the performance is higher than the quality of high-school plays (except for those of Marcia Gay Harden, which is the best thing to do). In addition, cinematography is not enough to express the beauty of Gaud√≠'s architecture or Barcelona's impressive fascinating curiosity. If you enjoy the comedy of painting Almodovar's film, rock and dark, Quikki, you will not find any of them here. Spend your money on something else other than this waste of celluloid.
