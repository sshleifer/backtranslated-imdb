This is a stupid movie. When I saw it in a movie theater, more than half of the audience went halfway through the audience. I stayed till the bitter end. To show steadiness? I caught it again on television and it was a lot of fun. There is no classic, or even continuously sunny but kinda family grew up on me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you're not good at anything and it's Tv Free at You could make worse
