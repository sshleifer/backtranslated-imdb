If I could give it a zero rate, then I'm coming from someone who likes time / exploitation films and Waters said overall I want to say that it is in vain. <br /> <br /> It's like this, nothing is done, nothing is foolish, a camouflage and a desire to prove its cleverness through the rebellion against social norms. <br /> <br /> It is completely amateur and amateur to both implement, it is not a point to the obsession of Netlandathal's intelligence, it is in vain, indecent obscenity. <br /> <br /> Some people said that the water was probably "shiny" on all bad news and gave this picture to others, but why? If I make a small film by taking a sh * t for a man in the bathroom for ten minutes, he will definitely get the same arrangement but why should I be proud or "circled"? <br /> <br /> If I was so intelligent that I would have to resort to such a thing then I could say, "O borrow this sensor and mainstream! I am so rebellious, sick and do whatever I want!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not be proud of the depths of the water, the fans of the water will not see it, its meaningless, that is, without any use. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even suitable for art, even under industry standards. <br /> <br /> To protect something that is deliberately designed as a culture intended for mainstream audiences to choose or protect this movie, this film is hot topic films. <br /> <br /> unnecessary and obsolete. A positive film claims it will be acknowledged as a rebellion.
