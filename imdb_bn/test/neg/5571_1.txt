How nice. So my boyfriend and I went to movie cinema to hire a movie. I liked the movie, I went in search of Michael Moore's 'Siko', and I've seen various horror movies. So I found out the worst of them (I would have to find out soon). It looked good on the cover and the back story seems fair enough. As a review it was an IMDb quote over the fact that it was a good way to prove that it would be a good way. So the next night, we kept the DVD player and from the first five minutes, we were so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely incompatible, from the past, bad times in the future, leave you ask a major 'WTF?' There is no consistent story about the plot - in addition to the vague signal in a local mythological story about murder, but it actually comes in the last twenty minutes to play in the film. The first hour is so good for you so: jump in random, confusing time; Unintentional plot; Do not those who are not parents; Bad acting; Bad dialogue; A boy changes the magical hair color; And a host of annoying characters for you! <br /> <br /> The movie is so slow that it is a comedy to actually sit there and watch the clock. I'd rather scrubbing the toilet, honesty. Do not bother with it.
