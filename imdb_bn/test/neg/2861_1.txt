It was very bad like the child's play movies. A lawyer tried to rescue a criminal, who was found guilty of killing his son from the death penalty. He fails Then the lawyer's daughter found a doll that the murderer was buried with his son and it was immediately connected. Then after several serious injuries, they secretly told the little girl to talk to the pupil that she did not hurt anyone. I asked myself this movie, 'Why am I seeing this cheesy?' Repeatedly The end is so bad that I went and saw the Disney cartoon version right after and sleeping in the light.
