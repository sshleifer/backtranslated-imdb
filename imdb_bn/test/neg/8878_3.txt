This is not just a complicated story. This is not a mystery, or you want to spend the time looking back again because you missed the underlying part of the dialogue. To claim the movie you will need to show it multiple times 'get it' may apply to many movies, but this is not one of them. Such films contain elements and are so involved that it is easy to miss an important part of the dialogue, or to subtly subtract those that you have abandoned. This does not apply to Goya's Scratch. The main error of this movie is an absence. It goes from one character to the next, and does not provide adequate materials at any point in the scene to allow observers to be involved. For that reason you will not connect any of the characters. You do not get points where you care about. Like the movie, the main actor has gone, it seems that it is going to free itself, or their actions are frustrating and you are not interested. A good example is to refuse to go too far for the help of detectives. His refusal to surrender to his surrender also mirrors the overall notation of his part. The only letter that you can feel for a moment is that they are ins, when their question is and then being tortured. After her rape by Lorenzo, there has been quite a lot of no focus on her character. On the invitation of Lenan's family, the scene of a centralized film surrounded the evening with the family, and his forefathers made an all-out effort to sign Lorenzo for the brutal confession and to bring his daughter back. Then again, some progress started, they left the movie. I have read many comments about how I did not know what the movie meant to be. I saw that it was largely successful without much of it. The playful scene of Lorenzo's return and the daughter of Inya, in Gia, did not seem to be anything more than being compressed. Without much of the story, they did not really have any effort to check that the troubled bars lived in reality. Because of the lack of material that does not implement anything other than its actions in Goa, it proves to be more self-centered than any other. For his industry, the film expressed his desire to test some of the paintings, but again broke the other opportunity to examine the responses of this work instead of work. To make things better, the film did not have any adjustment, the material being covered in its covered historical environment was poor, and after the end, you have experienced what you saw as an attempt to engage with the audience; One thing is not to attract visitors properly at any stage. Switch from next to You can not see anything more like hoping to get better with this added test. Not enough time to waste. This is not the case of your absence on any subject, it will also prove that there is not enough material to make the film better. Ever made for the best film? I have not seen the best movie of today
