I do not know any idiotic Rock'n'roll clich√© used in this movie. Ouffcourz, the rock recorded life is only sexual medicines and parties and supermodel tones are trying to travel with you. Tell stupid young boys. The filmmakers began to read more than the Gonso's or the Little Crew story. I have seen closely the daily life of the normal rock band and there is nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough then your travel tour is traveling tourism. This means that you are mostly trying to sit on the bus and sleep. Just sleep Because you will be fresh, calm and clear in the evening. Live after you have little time to relieve the excitement of your stage. Then you have a little time to have fun. But this is not a luxury or a dream. Artist This image was empty. Stupid characters and stupid dialogs. The end of the movie was fun - the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yes, what a moral Real 90s
