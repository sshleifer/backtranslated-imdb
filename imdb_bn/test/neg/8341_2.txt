I saw the trailer of this movie before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it has hung up my hunger. Volcano was quite spectacular and promises were fulfilled. But what a damp squib. Corny is not a word for script, and characteristic features are often laughable. The stupid girl is believed to be out of faith only 13 - 4. But then scientists, fireman and peripheral characters do not offer any more offers. This movie is just ahead of Cruise II and Twister, but only those 2 films are frustrating. This has some reasonable effects, but overall its 10 out 1. Do not waste your time
