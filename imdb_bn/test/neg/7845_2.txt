This movie was terrible. A cruel actor at John Wayne The main woman who played the role of "Moure" did a good job, and Oen's unbeknownst, one dimensional, for her role of acting did her best to make the scene believable. Seriously, when you were supposed to talk to him in sleep, you see him? Ridiculous And his character became such a terrible person in the second half of the movie and did nothing to do anything for his behavior and still apologized to everyone, including his pure nemesis as a 'sorry'. The story was completely impossible. We believed that two elderly people, both of them succeeded in severing a job in both respectful areas and risking the lives of innocent men because they disliked each other? Most of you can randomly select a scene, and perhaps it will shock you in disbelief, whoever paid for the making of this film. This is very bad because I saw only the other Wayne film was Shutst and Rio Bravo, which was both a great movie. Do not bother watching this one if you are not paying.
