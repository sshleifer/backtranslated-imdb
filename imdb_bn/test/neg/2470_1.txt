Http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html According to this article, an actor in the film Karin Lau was forced to release the film for free. Shortly before the film was created, he was caught in infamous abduction and later his painting was published in a newspaper, which was later closed and his publisher was sent to jail. The actress denied that she was assaulted, but there was a blank movie on the net, alleging that she was shown victim of gang rape. (The Hong Kong Press, out of reverence for him, has denied the report in most cases, but Google will introduce some articles about it.)
