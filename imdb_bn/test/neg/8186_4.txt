If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch are not such talented actors, perhaps this film will be worse than that. The stories of two mentally ill people, who fall in love and have children, find an interesting and good value for them. Nevertheless, with the progress of the story from the negative side, the plot continues to grow and music preferences are more intense, so in the end I see myself weeping when I want to scream the director.
