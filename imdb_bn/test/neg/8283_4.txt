An interesting slash film with multiple suspects. <br /> <br /> Her swimwear (Dennis Cheshire) usually involves the girl, as her swimwear change into fearful suspects - someone in them is doing a deed, a passing grade (Linnea Quigley), expected breast can be a very Unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will not be in the summer Olympics, and get a disgusting secret. <br /> <br /> It all comes in a crushing end. No, there's more. This guy will not die? I do not plan Anne (Patch McAngen) to go home. <br /> <br /> If you like Teen Slashar films, can you be distorted, even if all actresses are over 18 years old?
