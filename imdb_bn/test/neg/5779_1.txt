Yesterday saw this one in a sneak preview and it was awesome. After the feat I thought: "This would probably be pretty good with this cast." Do not turn all that way. Predictable story of hair, easily painted characters (except maybe a little Miss Lara) and the last one can predict within 10 minutes. And worst of all, it's a small theme (psychic) ​​touching a lower level and mostly ruthless jokes without any touch. The only person who is most sympathetic to the image of the person with disabilities is awake. What kind of message is this? And this movie does not end up thinking, it basically comes down: "I love you, you do not work as a prix." <br /> <br /> To add it: Great cast that has been terribly signed up for a terrible flick.
