I'm usually a glutton for poor movies, but stunk this thing. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The terrible effects and very few comics, what was the point of making this movie? There is no talking and no acting to speak. <br /> <br /> I can only manage 45 minutes of the drop in the mood of the movie, and it is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Is this something positive to say about the drivel? The cover art was right, I'm sure the movie was over, even I could not make it. <br /> <br /> The mice were unstable and their lines were continually blown up, they had a lack of intensity and they just went through the paces for their paycheque. The actor was bad.
