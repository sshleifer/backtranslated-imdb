A drug that looks like a soap opera has gone to the Goth about a drug to send a fantasy world where hideous horror films hide strange creatures. There are some good imagery in the film, but its original mix and no one can go anywhere. The voice from a letter of bad is unclear announcement. It seems like this is a more serious, more meaningful film, but I do not think it is useless to try to sell money even in a serious or meaningful field to sell it. There is no big deal to say, people talk, they look at drugs ... they talk more. It's not as bad as dull and dull. Due to the dull here and the reason you want to avoid this.
