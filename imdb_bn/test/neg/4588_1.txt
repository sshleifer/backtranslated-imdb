Hockey does not come near capture even in the real hockey scene of this cruel movie which I have to play and play called "speed". In a story that is imaginable, anticipated and stupid, it destroys your senses in every scene of some 80 songs and you have a "young balloon". Oh, as Canon French Canadian, yes, whatever. Dunlop in the gym, Braden and Hanson at any time ... one in ten.
