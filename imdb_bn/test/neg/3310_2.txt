Great music, but these people are not pathic ?! TruePie piece of trippie sequence, and it made me sad. The director draws the wrong side of Jetset's life and gives it a wing like a genuine nest. The culture of this time leads man to do this, it seems to me that it was not a discovery, but only disappointment. I tried, really tried to like this picture, but these people are not on my page. Yes, the world will look beautiful, leave for a while, but I always plan to return. Drugs are not the cause of these characters, it is their shameful attitude ?? These guys passionately poison their venom. They make their lives cheaper and ultimately reduce their life span. Romance is so dark? <br /> <br /> Cheers: Attractive views. Wonderful soundtrack by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Cavits: Date. Medicines Depressed Completely unlikely characters; They are not children of flowers. <br /> <br /> Just for jokes, as most of the packages hate Pink Floyd Connection. (The rare floyd tracks were never heard before, such as FM was not.) <br /> <br /> Ratings: Two stars.
