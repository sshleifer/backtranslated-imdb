If not for climax, I probably want to give this film a blank, of which there is no snake on a train, rather a snake train. After hearing about the snake on a plane in production, it was probably cooked more than it was on beer night (it was actually released to meet the release of the film). The trick is probably not to lose those who will find out this; I do not think there will be such souls who will consider things like serious action-thriller efforts (unless there is no miracle level beyond reasonable thought). This is a Mayan curse which has become an enemy by his family to leave with a woman and soon gets sick and certainly green peppercorn cough with snake. The train started on the train under the Los Angeles and its bees, and is quickly identified to the snake serpent in the train - the productive woman considers herself a snake. <br /> <br /> If there is more information about the movie then I will not have enough time in the day. For the standard factor it can be said that it almost exists. Students with short budgets have short films. Maybe it was an intelligent countdown from the end of the filmmaker, many copies sold for the joke factor would be sold, which they would reinstate their budget for the first weekend. Because seeing the sets (trains themselves randomly change between scenes!), Actors (if you can call them as just another actor - with a very thin hair that hits a woman, throughout the film - which benefits from the flick produced), FX (Beside the existence, the effects of Snake Sapons on a plan seem like Star Wars), and the actual CGI snakes <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Good work in favor of good taste with good taste. It is said to be 100% disposable, such as the B-movie Tire-Glass Lollipop.
