This movie is painful. This is probably the best way to describe. It's 93 minutes of your life that you will not be able to get back. Well, it's actually more than 86 minutes, because no one wants to sit with credit on this harmful level of dog ointments. Immediately you can tell from the movie "Martial Combat" producer, because of the disappointing and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains a few ridiculous usable moments this movie can give you. The rest are completely unintentional and annoying characters, "Freedeen Prince, Junior School of Acting" emerges all of the involved acting abilities (including customs lamber) and existent instructions. Did I leave something? Of course I did. Let's not forget the suicide-inspiration script, it's the only (??) fun conversation Oh, yes, and we talked about how we cursed the original poem with this sad and vain future / medieval translation. Costume and weapons (I was seeing that there were huge giant pizza cutters?!?) Just plain fool, the best way that I can describe them. And the last criminal on the night is always awful CGI. When do filmmakers learn that CGI sucks? Will we see the amazing effect used in the 80's? Probably never, but such movies and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" want us to bring them back. Off, new Freddy Prince, avoid this movie like the junior movie. Again, Freddy Pr√≠nge, likes junior films, and you're fit for this terrible excuse to make a film again.
