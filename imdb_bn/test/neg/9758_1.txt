I saw this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly shutting down around my head. The performance was stifling horribly, and it was acting worse. The brightest piece to play in the whole film was the man who played Princess-in-the-to-coffin. Finally when I finally felt nothing without relief. I hope that this film is going to be some real tragedy, and later some of the deep mental conspiracy. Around it stupid, no beginning, no climax, no end, just getting out of the street and making plastic bags worse. Let's get real here. This is a terrible movie.
