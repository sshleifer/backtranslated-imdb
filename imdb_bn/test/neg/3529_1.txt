Hi Y'all, <br /> <br /> I bought this from DVD to England. You see, I have one of those multi-region players. I would love to get a cool movie to show my friends. Well, Amy-Joe Johnson is surprised, he's just in the movie. Although he's on the cover though. It's really hard to imagine how this movie was made in the first place. Probably someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... it's about vampires residing in the beach
