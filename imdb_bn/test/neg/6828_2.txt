"How many people know about this?" ... "Come on!" I wonder at least some new dialogues can not be made? The movie is a real poor copy of the original. During the half-sleigh he probably did this movie by Bruce Willis. Looking at Richard Gere's face, I saw cold blooded teeth when they came to the port ... oh my God! Afraid of hell from me It is not clear to me why he killed Major Koslova and his partner. Another thing I did not understand was that the car forced (What was it on the earth?). <br /> <br /> The film's plot is Hello and Climax lazy. Another interesting fact is that Russian was killed in the club. I saw the scene when I smiled my chair. Also, what was the thing about the gay guy .. what was the purpose of this. I think the movie was made to understand very easily. You must think of what the director thinks. Lol <br /> <br /> The best view was on the pillars of Richard Gere's two fast moving trains. If someone does not contact with the pillar, then someone must loose his head.
