I saw the DVD in a shop near my home and since I added "Chess Horror Movie / Alien Fleiscus", I wonder how good it was. Even there are references to two rewards in the cover (I do not remember what I won), so I thought "Hey, that might be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to check out some reviews for IMDB. Here, people say that the movie was confiscated because it was bad, or people said movie movie was a wonderful movie Bla, Bla. I played DVD, I read any review, I was not thinking openly and did not want to expect anything. <br /> <br /> Man ... I do not want to be critical, but the film was really bad ... okay, I'm going to give some pointer to what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1- Acting / Dialogues: Acting was so confusing ... Sometimes the actors did a decent job, but in the scene I could spot any effort from them! The dialog was also the worst ... I think it was probably the most disliked in the whole movie. The characters seem to speak ... close. Not just bad, it's far from the actual story of the film. The female character of the character, though well distributed, became annoying and annoying in a short time ... but the most ridiculous thing was "comic" or "infected" ... I could not even comment that one, just say that it Was ridiculous and took away from the whole mood of the picture; 2-visuals: The most powerful aspect of the movie ... If you forget the terrible FX and light flashes, they are used to imitate the explosion or imitate what they were supposed to do. Actually "camera in car" was quite calm, but they did not use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They have gone from cheap sound and video FX and three "infected" characters. The movie becomes boring in many scenes .... 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... No problem arises in this movie, how poorly edited it is. The animals are being simulated at the "Alien Dialog" from the computer ... Ah <br /> <br /> So what I liked in movies ... (Spoolers) The only thing that I really liked and it was really terrible where There were two scenes where the car is still there and you are clearly walking in a place. At first I was really thinking that it was watching me, but when the character realized that the "images" coming to her had its own reflection, I was surprised! Nice unclear idea works well! Apart from that ... I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend anyone on this ... even "do not come together" because you can not laugh at it too. <br /> <br /> I give it a hard 2. Just some technical achievements have worked here ... out of ... yes ... nothing
