I do not understand what was the big hype about this film. All horror sites say that this movie has all the requirements of 'Old American Slash' Flickr, which will fulfill your needs. Although it was like an old American slicker Flick, my needs were still not satisfied. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie is that we are now in the 1980s, not in the 1980s. Must have lived in the past 100's past and past. Horror movies have changed so much that the old films are now impressive and unrealistic. Though they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic blood thirsty cow that offers recent movies. <br /> <br /> Hasht Chasey, Unreal, and Down-Right Horror. If we wanted to see an old American slash, I would go back to the 13th series, Nightmare of the Elm Street series, or the Halloween series. Of course, the film is better than some horror movies of the liberation war, but it is the worst. Jokes are not funny and the actors are horrific. <br /> <br /> I will be away from this movie personally and will never come back.
