I guess it's out of the DVD in the public domain. First of all, it is an emotional promotional film that has been shown to a wartime Australian audience, so it will not be considered a serious reinstatement. In Australia, the first half of the 3/4 has very dry ingredients, I think many American war films, where the recruitment meets, oh people have been for a long time. We get Africa and Tobruk, quite bad, low budget stuff. The war on DVD copies I saw was apparently almost completely black. If you see it, be ready to proceed fast, because I suspect you can accept it after a few minutes. I enjoyed the title "Battle of El Alamean" Also Richard Burton's African Theater wars Flickr "The Result Rits" was good, this film was simply a real time piece and must remain in that time, do not keep up well today (I doubt it is highly regarded then again). I'm talking about my American opponent's war flight, so personally do not accept Australia (I love Australia, there I was twice!).
