One of the most cruel movies in film history. Wait, I'll take it back - this movie can not be included in a section about "movies"; It belongs to the category of "waste", turds, or similar sections. Curious, it's even _about_ two trash. The film is a light criminal comedy, "Men at Work", which has played the role of Aventave (Shane) brothers since 1990. Assign and impossible plot line, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slopsticks, serialization errors and high rates will not be seen again, no name actor will ever meet again, all at a pretty bad movie anyway (its original, I mean). This is a kind of movie that can be good for one thing: You can see it almost 200 times, learn each line and repeat it with your * nasty * friends in the same way as a camp. Place your tenth grade as the biggest darkest. <br /> <br /> To make matters even worse, I am actually submitting an IMDB quarterly entry (with this bad review) to the IMDB web page of the movie, if only I saw a silly punk music joke (booth About the statue of Surfer). I'm so confused why my support * should be lost * which looks like supporting triangle notes, when I really want to do what I want to do is blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he has already done his job.) Thank you, Dude! ) I'm very happy I * waste * only time, not real money. In that case, can I have at least a tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could make two or three good films, as well as they kept the bikini clad bikini in the background, as well as beating cars, and beat the extraordinary additional (Hechenman) in the Hat-Matt cases. I'll mention Emilio's writing credits, but it will expand to call this playlet "write" - it's more like a cartoon-scrolled cartoon ideas. And Charlie Shane, if you want to read it, I am. Of course, you should have been made part of your career, where you did not grow up suddenly, Hooker-loving Hollywood Brat. (Oops! I'm sorry, I guess some parts of your life have not ended yet, be good soon, you're a "half-human", a promising talent, so * got lost? Oh, again that word is there.)
