It is a Emperor's new clothes situation Someone would say, "This is a fun and original, not a movie (etc., etc.), it's a bad movie, do not waste your money." The film is shy, and people shamefully disastrous trailer trash They are all very realistic themselves only. They do not have any lines, they do not work. American Dream is not to create cruel non-quality films or any other fake and quality; It achieves some of the quality and, therefore, the success. Depressed people (This can not be made in Hollywood, what is it?) Will try to ban any kind of quality in this movie for praising a movie made in Hollywood. It's worse than "Ed Woods", a film other than a filmmaker's value. These pictures should not have been made, and you will not see "American Movie".
