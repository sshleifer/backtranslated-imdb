I was delighted to see TCMT for JC Loverence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plathite, I was watching TCMT for love ... This film was astonishing Anne Harding, Frank Morgan's extraordinary performance, but others have played a furce film then more surprisingly immediately next Film Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot watch is painful and you do not understand why his wife adores him. After watching the film, I found out that it was based on the stage play, where the 1992 film was based on this book. The original film also seemed like it was a snippet of a big piece and felt incomplete. Too bad it was such a down-down.
