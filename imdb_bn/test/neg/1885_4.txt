Though inevitably linked to the 1970s, the concept of "exploitation-movie" was often old-fashioned as a movie. Moreover, Universal Studios effectively develops the word with their long running giant cycle Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Each original classic created at least a series of trends, and after a while they even thought of creating genuine giant stewing! The "House of Frankenstein" was released a year earlier, and was also operated by Earl C.Keyton, in a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiastic activities, but it is very unexpected for me to recommend "House of Dracula". The plot is very annoying 'coincidental' circumstances, forced twists and dialogues and many? Mostly ?? A very brief running time of expanding the monster's personality like they deserve. Onslow Stevens will not get the top billing but the most finalist role as the eye is challenged for the Cure Dracula (Caradine) healing from his incomplete thirsty blood and while completing the moon when Lawrence Talbot is sick, fix a disease to correct a hairy Wolf Man. During the night walk in some caves, they also chose the remnant of Frankenstein's giant residue and the good doctors finally turned out to be Gelil / Hyde due to bad blood infection. The last invitation to the dirty party is a female Hanback (though not the note's draft). If you see something that is seeing literally staffed movies with virtual icons, it is very wrong, but the only character of the whole film that can confuse you is that of a common villager named Segfred. The actual monsters are dull and their once-imagined background is completely eliminated. Counting Dracula is an impressive romanticist, Talbot creates an unfortunate and scary old martyr and Franklin ?? Well, its share of plot is not even significant. This universal film has a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography, especially compared to all other efforts, and a sudden disaster in mountainous weather.
