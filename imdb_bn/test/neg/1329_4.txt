With its technical flash, the 1993 film "Stalinad" is very disappointing. Before watching this, I read the non-fiction accounts of the Stalinadrade campaign and saw lots of documentary footage and photographs of actual war and its participants. I do not think a film can actually be successful in illustrating theoretical struggle and tragedy, but I still want to see how the recent recent German film production will be. Although this film has some good elements, overall it is a failure. The worst side to me is that it has enough anarchranimus, and some very closed and cluttered components, among the most discussed among some conflict between the German server and the Soviet woman. Also a film containing some ideological elements that contain very distorted ideas, including chains of a German Chaplain, some excessive class-war messages and "good" versus "bad" German problem-solving screenplay. Certainly there were all the people of the German armed forces of World War II who were able to maintain some modesty throughout the war and others who did very bad, but attempts at film attempts to show this discrimination were very simple and childish. I mean "stalinadrate" credit in the sense that it simply does not represent German soldiers in the direct giant quality, which is now stereotype of many people, but this film has its own stereotype, as it is very well-more than the decade of 1990s and more than the 1940s. There are two completely evil infantemen and Rear-Effilon officers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some recent images such as "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private" Ryan "are often praised for their" authenticity "by describing war graphic scenes, but these same movies were 1940's Depictions of values ​​and values ​​of soldiers and civilians are deeply defective and distorted. The main and minor letters of "Stalinadrade" and "SPR" are those of the Second World War. Of course, the lack of spontaneous barbarity of regular people during the course of time. Of course, soldiers throughout history were infamous for their continuously annoying and occasional exploitation, but self-absorbed, conversational and sensitive characters in these two movies are something else, and today we are much more than this world. Traditional in the 1940s, although many people deny the war between the 40s and 50s of this day Most of the "Battlefield" films like previous films, like patriotic messages that represent patriotic messages, are more accurate in their imagery, and they often succeed individually to show the horrific effects of the war. <br /> <br /> A good work of "Stalingrad" is a war between the German infant and the Soviet tanks, which is reasonable, such as the act of catching a lot of fright and confusion in the war. <br /> <br /> "Stalinager" does a poor job in showing the general face of the frontline soldier. This part can be difficult to find thin, sticky-stacked extras in our scrambled and well-organized United States and today's Western Europe. Also, most of the German soldiers in the movie do not wear their uniforms and tools properly, and even in the years of German defeat, German professional does not show professional effects on the weahmat. If you want to get a better view of how genuine German soldiers want to see, I recommend the following documentaries which contain the footage of the Stalinadread campaign: "World War," "Wars of the Century" and "Russian War". There are also many helpful photos of Paul Carroll's "Photos for Operation Barbarossa", Jeffrey Junk "Stalinad" and Paul Carroll's "Stalinad" books. Books written about the battles of Antony Beaver and William Craig are also recommended, and the next is particularly good about ordinary soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> The relatively recent movie in my opinion that during World War II, people's visions and characters are described as "Stalinad" and "Savings Private Private", and the general feeling, complexity, and intensity of war, "Dere UnterGong "(" The Downfall ") and" Talvisota "(" Winter War "). Although the events of cover in Western Front compared to earlier "A Bridge to Fear" and "The Longest Day", they are also very close to excellent war movies and real accounts. Some of the next two films have more popularity in recent films, but they compensate for that lack of authenticity and other strengths.
