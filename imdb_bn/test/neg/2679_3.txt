Man, '90's really was an awesome decade for the movie. Movies lack a good style and the story often lacks. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry into the series of long six Halloween is certainly a bad one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dr. Loomis was present in it just because of it. It was a real shame that it was the role of Donald Pleasence's last film. It's a beautiful and her last role in the Hollywood movie, but she's better suited to better. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of real danger in the film, and its character Michael Maera does not just come as a threat or a horror. Perhaps it is already very much in love with the movie, because very soon He is again his normal stuff but without too much class or originality. In addition, the efforts of the previous Mayan era are not really effective, because it does not explain very well. It is clear that this script went through several re-writing - and most probably during filming. Most scenes have been re-shot or added even after the first cut turned away to be fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is often made and ready for TV. For this reason there are some real good gore deficiencies. It's really nice to watch as a scary movie, and basically lacking everything to see the real one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
