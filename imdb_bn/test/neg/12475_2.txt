A film by Almodovar- My spine sends a tingle every time. The printed capital of opening the latest feature of Spanish autocracy promptly encouraged the memory of transgenic monoxide, gentle necrophilicus, transsexuals, of the salicylus nan? And after a beautiful opening montage, the camera wandered in an air-covered graveyard crashed in the fork of the fork in the fork, I thought that Pedro gave me the wrong spell again. <br /> <br /> Once I had my nostalgia residence, its place was very little. A director who looks forward to humanity's loyalty to the killings and rapists, he does very bad to find a mental depth or respect for his women. Penelope Cruz Ramunda, a head cleric whose daughter is complicated by the accidental murder of the offending husband of her daughter Thankfully, he lives in Escondido, Spain where your friends will gladly help the body to settle for a circular motion of cocktails. Add melted pots to the inside of the rimundara soil and provide other rowdy, warm heartwarming mother tongues. "Volvo" means literally returning to the original meaning and re-use of Pedro's old material. The sub-plot of cruelty seems to be constituted as "banned". Instead of commenting on or changing the subject with pedophilia treatment of bad education, it feels compulsive and unbelievable about the image of the puppy in the movie. I call Almodovar his next picture of Salir (going on).
