Jacqueline Hyder personal Jackie Heide (co-producer Gabriela Hall) started as a normal daytime telemarketing, until his boss (Robert Donovan) set him on fire for his personal call. The lawyer told him that his grandfather (Malcolm Bennet) had recently died and left him his palace and fortune (why was not this happening to me ever? Sigh). Jackie became very excited and warmed himself in his home, Jackie secretly blurted over the secret room in the night to find the thermostat, where his grandfather pushed his invented red bright formula, which changed the person's face. Zakie Jackie finally settled in the charming Jacqueline (Bleth Metz) next to the worm, but Jackie's better appearance began to control the arrogance ... <br /> <br /> Written, co-produced and run by Kenofsky, I thought that Jacqueline Hayd was completely full fork from the finish and finish and it is simple and straightforward. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hider is inspired by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The General of the Strange Case of Jails and Mr. Hide'. Frankly, if Mr Stevenson could see what he was doing in his story here, his grave was going on. Initially I think Jacqueline Hayd has been called a horror film, IMDB lists it as such, but there is no other danger except to how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hayd is more soft-core than any other and is very much template with it, why sit and see this soft compared to soft porn strap when you see the right hard-core stuff that actually supplies the product? Why, that question I asked here. It does not even look very good, in addition to being much more soft, it is both absolute, annoying and significant among the sex scenes and far away. The title of the most intelligent aspect of this movie was quite clever, if any other film used the title of the last century Jacklin Haide (1998) and it seems to be very dirty by judging by the summary of the IMDB Plot. The junk is better than this piece. One of these movies is to see yourself to see how bad you are, but you hope you never get the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Kenefsky is probably working in a low budget but it is not an excuse. On this day, the picture in the digital camcorder looks cheaper, and some examples of CGI appear to be from the Nintendo games, probably the worst 'twisted' The worst morph effect seen and is pretty good for it. Jackie's breasts laugh at the scene growing through the more serious CGI. This is another matter, the film itself takes very seriously. It gets worse, it is very much expected and made for a poor film, but maybe the conversation was deliberately funny with some dirty pornographic takings, but the film could be more fun, so this is not the case. Forget about any terrible horror, violence or gore because ultimately there is no different from the bleak diaphysis of wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Typically the type of film in Jacqueline Hyde, photography flat hand held point - & amp; - a suitable low quality to match the variety of shoots, music, production designs and special effects scripts. The acting was horrific, seriously worse than this. <br /> <br /> My opinion is to load an understanding of Jacqueline Hayde, I can think that this is not a positive thing about the turgid film. A true movie lover trying to find a worthless rental price will find it almost impossible, to avoid it clearly.
