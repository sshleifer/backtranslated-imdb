It was probably a production of very low budget, but the throw was good, the fundamental foundation promised and more could be done, but the script was not so big - the plot is incompatible and it seems almost random <br /> <br /> , A girl's father gets crushed by a gangster, and after that she becomes a robber, and wants to take revenge on his death, and then it is about the public Turn to protect you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> panic but it is really lazy and kind.
