A woman of love with a husband (she suicidal) decided that there would be a child to save her child. She is in a reproductive clinic - like a lover - so both know how artificial fertilization works; However, instead of using thousands of people around the world ($ 5 barkster), they are involved in cottas. We believe that although immigrants fall in love with their mother's womb, they do not suggest explicit alternatives to sexual relations. Moreover, although it is a business arrangement, yet with the sperm donor for the first time, he throws all his clothes, as if it is a temptation. Thereafter, not notice when her husband is missing $ 30,000 from her bank account. Does all this seem to demand even more Hollywood suspension of Hollywood fares and even more uncertainty? All fetched on counting away
