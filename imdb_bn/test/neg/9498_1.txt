Without shiny looks, this show was a little recommend to it. The writing was patronized and convoluted. The characters without exception were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters come out of the worst ... spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul's ambition moves around slip dresses and stylists and tries to bag a man. This aspect of the event is even more enthusiastic, because the series made two women! For most parts, acting was dull and ridiculous, attacking each scene at the same level played a dimensional character. This does not completely blame the actor. They used to spend more time developing characters and storylines, adding a small injection of style and humor, MVP may have been a hit. What we have left is a little bit more unusual than unpleasant.
