One of those movies where you will beat the first one, and who will survive to the end. There was just something about the movie that made me out of the zone. I think because I looked back and thinking "Look at the tree still ... ... still looking at the water". Poor character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I was voted for the cross. I believe that a crock will try to hit the boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat, I believe that it is really unlikely. It seems very well-timed during the interval ('all know all to see'). It also seems very unrealistic to treat it when attacking crack. It will not allow the killer device and the row to flee twice in the day, especially when water attacks.
