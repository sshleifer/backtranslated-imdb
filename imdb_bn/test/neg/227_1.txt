I saw this because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friends hate it but are certainly preferred at the movie. This is the first time I have strongly disagreed with Ebert for many years. There is not a single thing to suggest this picture. Willis is good, as always, as always. But the story is frustrating, unbelievable, no real story, no action, no interesting movie sequence, no surprise, and the worst thing is that a child star is a completely annoying slog, which is inevitable for not being a parent, fat slob for a child. Stay away from all the ways and leave your child - unless you want to punish him. There is no excuse for such cruel instructions or writing and the filmmakers will enjoy one after another.
