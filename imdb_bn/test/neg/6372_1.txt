I've got Iron Man Comics in the early 70's and always loved the character who is the average clean-cut and far away from many and different enemies. Iron Mann was an animated series tinatirao less effort, and the second part of the original and has the character justice. So I'm somewhat optimistic that this new version will be good. The boy was wrong! The DVD industry represents a very confusing and non-film image. Well off the fist, there is little to do ... is to draw in art and animation, and text and dialogue generally good, although with notable exceptions. Character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well-played. Now for the worse ... Unfortunately the author decided to completely travel with both Iron Man's source and especially Mandarin. On this, they decided to do everything in Iory Man and his opponents in CGI. Bad CGI It makes them stand out as bad as live actors in their cartoons. The work of CGI is often taken at repetitive and glaring shortcut. Cixi overwhelming wars, as well as Cixi and do not mix well with this line that adds animation. The film was really good, they actually liked to draw all the characters. Another problem is for Iron Man in a traditional red and gold suit for a war! And its even big war until the end. It throws down all these movies and it never increases. <br /> <br /> ************ speaker (or warning) * <br /> <br /> You can follow the film of *********** An interesting unusual stop motion of the welding and gear starts with ordering order. Then we are presented in the process of restoring what appears like a Chinese temple, and an idol of the iconic Jupiter, which identifies the devotees as a worshiper. Things go oddly, impeded the progress of restoring the temple. James Rhodes, Tony Stark's long-standing friendship It seems that despite the opposition of a party that is planning to raise the temple from the earth, it will bring a terrible disaster to the temple. Rhodes is caught in a raid. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed about the problem and personally supervises the project and rescues his friend while in the background. Tony comes only to attack his Armored Accord and fly the pieces. After Tony, the prisoner of the heart and the rebels woke up severely wounded. He is saved only by Roads and a Scientist for faster action. Finally Stark gray iron armor to create a prototype and could make a good turn, but after some loss of life. Together with the rebels, he met a distraught girl named Lee Mei and two fell in love. The temple was raised and the four basic people (CGA All) is displayed and you can proceed to start collecting the hidden ring. Stark and Rodney came back home with problems but failed to stop them successfully with basic elements. First used aquatic armor, then used more classic red and gold armor, and finally everything returned to the temple and Stark returned to the rich gray belt. There is a final showdown that can be done in Final Fung Foam (also called CGI) and there is a need to show Mandirin a host body here for a run. It leads to a hazardous final war that is less than that of Mandarin and can not be seen in the last 5 minutes of the film. Wong ... <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are an Iron Man fan, you probably will not enjoy this enjoyment. And even non-fans can not miss the movie in some areas.
