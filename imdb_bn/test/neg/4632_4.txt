For decades, history and experience have shown us that intellectuals are working on the most painful and obsolete things to talk about sex, but in 1986 it was not quite clear. Originally, the idea of ​​this film is that the unreasonable drive to find these characters comfortable, sex, and enjoyment of sexual activity is really unhealthy motives which makes them so helpless themselves - they hide themselves from their sexual relationships. This drive has been associated with the collapse of the "American Empire", as it has been released in an early interview in the film. <br /> <br /> So the concept is that the more disgusting person talks about sex, and the word that is supposed to be expressed as how they hate it. Arcand is running the drives and mobility with the least things in the camera, such as disconnecting the characters of the single-frame, revealing their extreme loneliness and quickly overcoming them, which shows how much they are fighting each other. The contract is in place. And to give credit to Arkansas, it stands to stand the intellectual life which is very beautiful, standing with other intellectuals, even everyone knows that staying standing means to stand alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and actions are unsexy and kind kind. I think this movie is more than an aspect of its time, which is more than the ending time, which makes it dated. It is also the perfect type of mental buffing in dialogues and references to people like Susan Santag, which makes art-house movies so popular with public entertainment. After all, I'll accept it anyway - it's basically a place in the right people of the letters - it's not really interesting or important to those who are not those characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
