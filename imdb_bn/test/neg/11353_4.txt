"María" really disappointed me. I can not think of it as a bad film, but the development is very comfortable and incredible to express any emotion. Dr. Fermin has shown some extravagant behavior outside of emotion that is not really born from there. I mean, he has no conversation with María ?? Maybe once? Also, María never appeared as a real character, more than the film's stereotype, which was needed in the film ... (or was there another title needed?). Best acting came from a role that was not important for the story, Mary, a sub-intelligent, but humble drunk. Of course, the scenes, cultural points of the Canary Islands and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film was a documentary (its original purpose was not) and most importantly, it was as small as a tough drama.
