I'm a big fan of "anti-mam" with Rosalind Russell. She was the perfect actress to actually play that character. <br /> <br /> I heard "Angela Lansbury" was very good on stage with the Magazine but it is difficult to imagine someone named Rosalin Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was an extraordinary curiosity that her trick bit was able to save her performance in this movie, where I think she made a real mistake, she should have danced her voice of the song - these songs sang at a fast speed And the strong voices really changed completely. <br /> <br /> I saw the stage revival in Washington DC and I think Christine was very good like Barranzie MaM, Harry Harris - Fraser's nasty chain smoker agent - played sheep and he was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Both of these events will be casting well for a TV movie. Perhaps if the production becomes Broadway, then they will consider filming it. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy will be as good as Woolman Agnes.
