You see some movies and you said, "Well, that does not make sense." And you really do not mean it. You just say things were too complex or a little nonsensical. <br /> <br /> "bread and circus" does not understand any sense. And I mean this. And it's not that it's surreal because. From the beginning, it is clear that it has a weak pretense splatters special effects. There are no scripts. There is no plot. There are no stories of any kind. One incident does not lead later - this is the fundamental issue of bad writing. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are tons of movies that fall in that section. They want to show you gore, they give you gore. Why talk about it? <br /> <br /> In this case, "bread and circus" I expected. OK, there are some real elements. Vaginas, on the ground - people crawling them out. Earth, space, two legs on either side. Pictures are such a wonderful, fun, weird, crazy But the movie does not do anything with them. <br /> <br /> Once the stuff is done, the movie ends, and it is all very dissatisfied. I was skeptical to fly the script fly. very bad. If there were any stories, it would have been made for a lot of entertainment films. <br /> <br /> This image is like a beautiful beautiful car, which you want to like yourself. Then you lift up the hood and there is no engine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
