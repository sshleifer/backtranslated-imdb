Bela Lugosi is a real enigma. In the early 1930's, he was at the top of the world after being in Dracula. Yet, over and over again, he made cruel judgments about his career. Probably he was a bad agent, perhaps using his drinks and drugs was a part of it or perhaps he was just crazy. However, he has ruined his reputation by being one of the most progressive female films (such as Rawten) from the big budget flicks (like Nanteca) and at the studio's most gradually grade-jade flicks. Interestingly enough, even though he agreed to do this terrible movie, he actually canceled the role that Frankinstein went to Boris Karloff later! For this movie, it's a very stupid, horror-produced WWII movie featuring a fool plot and fatal editing. Logosi spends most of the movie's killings - not a bad thing. But in the end, we got to know that he himself was a plastic plastic surgeon and the American people he killed were actually Japanese! This fun part is a flashback time. Before you change the American opinion, Japanese men talk to a group of Luigi people. When the camera scans them, men are definitely Asian. However, in all other non-close-up shots, they are all looking very western - with many bush head !! They were not watching anything like Japanese men. I suspect the plots must be re-entered and it may possibly be for the wrong error. Or, it can only be a ruthless production standard and editing. In fact, at the beginning of the film, they show city street scenes and all cars (about 1942) old model T. Ford - probably from stock footage !!! The bottom line is that the film is bad but very dull. Plan 9 is different from external spaces, there is difficulty in stagnating stagnation - just have to sleep on it.
