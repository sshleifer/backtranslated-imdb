Chaplin was a silent comedian, but in the first talk he heard many voices in public, many silent era stars. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice was not only suitable for his silent character, which made him rich and famous. His film career was not restored when the sound came to the film. Most of the reviews of Chaplin's Lifestyle and Politics I have seen, Chaplin's curiosity did not help him for his popularity while watching Chaplin's political commentary in popularity with the average viewer for entertaining Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin's prize and knighthood I will be excluded from his "contribution" to humanity. At the same time, The Great Dictator was a demonstration of Stalin's cruel dictatorship, and both the dictators signed the agreement on behalf of both the dictators of Poland invasion. Start an effort to save WWII Poland. Nazi was defeated in 6 years, but Poland has disappeared as a sovereign country. This image was made and Hollywood was investigated by the federal government. Joe Stalin was included in this rebellion in Chaplin, perhaps besides the Italian dictator, politicians were less critical of his politics. Nazi crossed the time and number of Soviet misuse of Jews and disbelievers. <br /> <br /> Only judged as a movie, many gags were very relevant to young people, who knew there was no Gobbel, Goring or Mussolini. A classic piece of art must stand test during. Classic Greek Tragedy, Mona Lisa and Beethoven 9th enjoyed the centuries after their creation because they are timeless. Movies based on recent political commentary or currently popular social opinions generally do not cross the generation they create. But those who address common issues for all generations will probably live forever and get a higher ratings from me. <br /> <br /> Must be blamed for what I judge as Chaplin, Writer, Director and Chief Actor <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> If Chaplin thought America was so aggressive, why did not he return home? Nazi war with blood and money with Great Britain. What contributes to the fight against European dictators in Switzerland? Switzerland is like a country club that likes and loves its members based on race and class and is very much concerned about people who can not join clubs.
