It is difficult to say what is the purpose of this film? A "children's ITV" characterizes the characterization and style smacks beyond an Australian soap, yet issues, nudity, and language an ancestral audience targets it. <br /> <br /> Justin is a philosopher about losing his virginity, and annoying to anyone for 18 years. From the 18th February onwards, "Ferry Bullet" is a complete wrap-off for conversation-to-camera from on-screen graphics. <br /> <br> His silent friend Tea brings him to a computer fair where an explosion in the use of virtual reality machines makes him a human. Or, in fact, a male change known as the Jack-created ego. Do not look like me; I just showed it in the way it related. After this <br /> <br /> this photo is gently fun for a short time; In all the drama-school mugging, Rupert Pantry-Jones brings a real comic touch to the role of her woman-Jack's woman's body. Jack has some interesting scenes with his new body and some new feelings; You never see before, but you will be interesting to anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Justin and Jake meet, and ridiculous antics (I want) a virtual machine that wants to kidnap Jack, to have sex with him, or to test him, or something. However, it is just an excuse to fill in additional half-hours with some explosion and carriage; For such cheaper movies, explosions often come randomly and mean money in all the wrong places. Finally, the heroine realized that she could not love herself, instead of hitting the arrogant, and losing her virginity ended at the end of a night's stand (probably meant it would end in a happy 90's. Is). But only after removing his glasses and keeping some hair gel and leather jacket; God forbids he actually has sex with someone _looks_ like a nerd. Of course, it's a bit offset - among these PC movies that you love and say to yourself, and each one on its own, especially, it is responsive to a movie that is "Confirm!" Who shouted. You, and the virgin and nerds with the attorney they deserve deserve <br /> <br /> Characterization is simply terrible; Nerd has a jock, he has very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tension, music accompanying Vampi), too nerdy (computer, thick glasses, social obstacles, virginity, full room of any leather jacket), he has a jock. Well, you get the picture. You can get away with such a characteristic of a wide comedy, but "virtual sex" is not very funny. It is only partially amusing, and enthusiasm among others. Justin (Laura Fraser's acting) looks pretty as a woman to bother me, but she manages it. <br /> <br /> Do not fool by the title; Nothing about the film is extreme, and how we look at new communication technologies and how it changes relationships. (Unless you actually think your playstation can leak and change your sex) <br /> <br />
