After enjoying Quaniskatasi and Pauquatasi, I started looking at this third part of the Quarterly Quarter and saw how it was taken from any direction. There is rarely a movie that has failed to live visually with predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent "civil war" in the form of sports, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks worldwide opportunities and even advanced themes of predecessors. War chaos, but the targets of war are also targeted and this film has little structure and vague goal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In addition, with the help of some symbolic images of the last century war, it can be wisely avoided. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The way of life Perhaps this imperfection reflects the ongoing "war of terror". While representing "Sport as War", the prominent team logo ensures that the United States is represented as a winner. So it missed the opportunity to portray several sports around the world and show the unity of humanity as a war of civilization. <br /> <br /> In addition to the newsletter, the footage seems to have been shot in the budget in New York's borders and "the war-like life" is not recognized in the rest of the world. The face gallery (candle) only supports the existence of important people outside of the United States. The makers have missed the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Philip Glass is far more than scores (with the possible exception of Kayanasakatsa) and can be best described as not "unreasonable" or arrogant images, not adding or detracting.
