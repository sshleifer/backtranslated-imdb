These pictures are cringingly bad. You can say that all actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly awful movie. There are obvious budget limitations but the film can be so good with a bit more thought and attention. For example: Mickey goes to the first mortal and check out the scene and talking to his friend's pathologist when the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab. You can actually see the body of a dead body! What, they can not rent a half modest extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute view?
