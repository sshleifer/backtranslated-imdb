From the title, the tag-line, the plot summary in DVD, etc. ..., I hope at least a little epic, historical fiction and romance agree to thrill you; For example, what they did at the end of the Secretary-General, and I think they did a fantastic job. Maybe I had too much value for this movie and it did not give a fair chance. But the scenes were not exactly right (how could they not bring anything more beautiful when they could work with such landscapes?), There was no chemistry of two lovers and the plot was considered right that it was drafted to be twelve years old In minutes - and not very fantastic. Novevel-France is a erotic story set in a fabled historical era. But the history of Novaval-France is very rarely a party note, and the story of love is extraordinary and dramatically failing to care for the audience for the lovers' fate. Surprisingly, only the best part of the film comes from something completely unexpected and unused: the relationship between Marie-loop, heroine and her children (a natural, accepted). Only if they focus on her family and forget about the story of love, but it was a better movie. Marie-Lope's parents should have given more screen time and character development, Britain's politics should have continued with more than three-minute scenes, which should only have been in relation to any relation with rest, that the scarce badie should have been improved or removed completely (why Vincent PÃ©rez, Team Roth or Jason Isaac, do you use such bad things?) Overall bad work .
