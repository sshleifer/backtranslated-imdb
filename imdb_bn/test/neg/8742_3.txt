Directed by Dean Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz (Andy McDowell) is struggling with a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed inventor husband Sid (John Turrorn) lacks a lack of emotion. Unhappy with the situation of the new home, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) has decided that he would like to stay with his two stupid sisters, Danny (Michael Richards) and Mellew (Lou Cutell) until he gets better. Steven seems happy and even interested in the habit of his strange uncle's house; He even wanted to change his name to French. At the beginning of the 60s, this drama is a little abstract ... change Johnny. MacDowell is not being fan, UNSTRUNG Heroes guarantees my attitude; Although I've enjoyed the film and it's not total waste.
