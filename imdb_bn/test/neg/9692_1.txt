I could not believe what I saw ... (Once) Brilliant actors are appearing in this terrible effort that should never be done. Plot terrific and appauling conversation (at first I thought it was a spoof), and played abysmal. Everything about it grew from a bad, cheap set to phone backdrop, a bunch of images grew. Respected filmmakers struggle to achieve their views, yet in the absence of this, the suppressive effort of the mini-series is made for our television, in the presence of the 3 Oscars winners. I can only assume everyone involved in hitting the writer and the director and this worthless T.V. I was forced to star in the trash (probably in a gunfight).
