A young man named Danny escapes from home and meets with a drifter called Baix, who agrees to tag Denny and make money for him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Karei - a shy, naive girl works for her father's diner. Beyond began to see Career but he plans to go very soon (because he's a drifter, he's not good!) Meanwhile, the city's cripple, Jesse (played by Jack Elam, as described perfectly), showed up in Diner and was upset. Danny is unknowingly left and right (why he is loaded with money?) For him about a hundred dollars!), Which is constantly pursuing Bikes (Danny in Flickr and there are many strange overturns in the show). Finally, Bux and Danny decided to leave the city, but the issue was frustrating due to the Jesse Crip. <br /> <br /> My review of my movie: A terrible, dated "Troubled Youth" flick in the '50s <br /> <br /> My review of the version of the MST 3 version: I want to say that it is about MST3 One of the best episodes. Riffing on the dead, all the time. Except for some disappointment, this film is a simple element for Joel and Bates, especially Danny's constant screw-up, which Beyonc√© saved from him. Host segments are also very good, especially with 'Train Song' segment. Hopefully, Raheen will release this episode on home video one day.
