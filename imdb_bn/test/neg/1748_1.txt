I was so annoyed by this picture that I had to write something about it, so please laugh me. <br /> <br /> its only release, outside of some good acting, it does not go on page 107 minutes. Even that length is about 30 minutes long. Comparable compared to the darker darkness compared to <br /> <br />, but I can not see it. They are just two different movies The nearest 'Swindold' comes in an existing film, 'The Sting,' was created in 1973. It is generously sorry from this fantastic George Ray Hill's 'entertainment' (sorry, steals) which was just right. I enjoyed it because it does not pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are many red deer in Swindled, which I thought I was in fish tank. It's very confusing, but it's just a lot of problems. The main is: If you create a movie where everyone is all lying, where everyone is worried, we do not have 'anchor' to keep us on the ground. The unavoidable result is a mockery of a very dirty second from other copper flickers. <br /> <br /> Everyone in this movie is comforting and objectionable. Of course, a basic 101-class film will tell us that some of the audience will have to take care of it. We can not 'care' for anyone here: they all swines It may have worked as a rakish comedy, but it ended up from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this picture, then read more. Big 'spinner' is coming. Sorry, but I have to do it. <br /> <br /> so much of the murder of the fake blood and so much that it does not suppress betrayal - it destroys it. The end is absolutely ridiculous - 'assassination' at a crowded airport, which is not really 'murder'? And the 'murderer' is bloody, standing alone, pushing himself, dragging the copper blood piece with booty? Police and police are always in custody, does anyone interfere? If he thinks we want to buy it, then the manager has to have a lot of cosons. In the 1940s, Norris B-movies made it even better. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of European flickr, but this ensures that Scolke does not always come from Hollywood. As far as 'Swindold' is concerned, my verdict is with a famous line from Spot-Mizpayne producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew all about this: 'Include me'.
