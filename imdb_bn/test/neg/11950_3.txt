Go to the video store and get to the original. I do not understand why Hollywood needs to take a perfect foreign movie and rebuild it. Most of the "Martha" or "Bella Martha" cast well. From the beginning with the heroine Martin Gadek, who has done more than the more popular Catherine, Jeta Jones, Italian kitchens and nephews were suddenly deprived of her mother and were forced to stay with a aunt, or suitable for the childhood. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of German origin. They just exchange actors. However, they also changed the story because it was very difficult and not believable to implement a father for a little girl in America's context. <br /> <br /> I was thinking. Perhaps the father could be Puerto Rican, or Cuban, or Mexican. Well, you have many "guest staff" in the US. But I suspect that none of them showed the Italian father on the shoulders as the responsibility. Therefore, the American movie leaves the part but cooks Italian. And change this whole story. The original "Martha" is actually removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her nephew to a full newborn in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> American American "Martha" is soft and so the movie is not sweet and near the edge of the German movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> We present in the American version of today's world than the Witred-down version. And in the American version the entire opera music was very annoying. I basically liked Italian songs and bought CDs. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hollywood admitted that "Most Martha" was a great movie. Perhaps distribution companies kept it in another theater or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so good. This reminds me of another remix. "We Dance" is my favorite of the original Japanese version and completely forgotten in the American version.
