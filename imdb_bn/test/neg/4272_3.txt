I do not always try hard to criticize what I do not like, but after seeing this short series I was very disappointed that my irritation could not help. On the one hand, it is true that the series was faithful to the novel, and of course, I found it very beautiful, but on the other hand, weird cast, poor performance, especially the key characters? Like the fun price, the impression of the stage game, the dramatic way I played makes the bother to start from the end. I am convinced that with this budget, even if it was low, it could be a little good and fruitful. Seeing this series depends on you, but personally I do not recommend spending your time in recognition of this disappointment.
