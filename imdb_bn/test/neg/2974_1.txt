Everywhere to football fans - stay away from this movie. It was so Buddhist! Lang acting, lam script, lame football and no instructions! I was hired this movie during my acting in Asia and was scared that it is considered a good singapore film. It was just dishonest and thoroughly boring. Thousands of rich, thrilling stories in Asia. Why write a bad story on top and stereotypical Singapore?
