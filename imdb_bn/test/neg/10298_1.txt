I do not know what today's filmmakers expect, but after watching the movie for 68 years .. (Well, I have not seen many movies for the first 9-10 years, so watching 58 years of film) I hope for entertainment, not tears of tears, violence (Every other word) and an attack in the stupid scene of violence that is not considered for any other purpose, but the division of blood and the parts of the body are being buried. Surveillance is one of the films that have no imagination, if there is a little bit of talent, then meet together in the scene and the unreasonable feature of a scene and it's going to last for long. Anyone that ever would think it would be an appropriate movie, when Hollywood rubbish is nothing more than that that is beyond me. Like the experience of the war, I looked after the violence, the blood and the cow, in many forms, and like the movies we were, the soldiers could become violent like a movie, but it freed the price. There should be no writing power, no instructional training, no experience in film editing, and a complete lack of communication with the reality, that the surveillance should be monitored by the people. A stupid movie by two serial killers like FBI agents, a scene to kill some stupid foul mouth police etc. A high-cost garbage that just likes a donkey ...
