Easily do it, Mensychic's mind is the worst, unexpected show in Comedy Central and probably all the time .... I love Comedy Central and watch many shows and movies there, but every time the introduction goes to some good comedy for this show, I can not find enough fast enough. <br /> <br /> The use of Mensia says, raising racial jokes in poor efforts to become controversial, will refer to ethnicity which he said in the audience that they 'liked it', so all the nations like it and Even according to my extension. . Give me a break in Meniaia, I do not know whether they are trees, or you go to a black guy and after your ridiculous joke, he's got five tallest, does not mean that he thinks you're funny, it just means you put him on the spot and What is he going to do, you smack on the TV? He thinks his joke is a deep, meaningful, and provocative idea that is apparent in his ad, but when you actually see the show, what he says is about 100% in general sense. He claimed that only smart people get some jokes, but he is not saying that he does not have to be smart enough to be a monkey, he said, maybe you have to finish third class Carlos. The person is saying that he thinks of others, but I think that if you find out that if someone thinks of him, then they all feel ridiculous that it was not funny and that's why they did not say it. In the first place <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See all the episodes, and if you have seen 1 episode, complete it with you because you Watched everyone. Why Comedy Central Keeps Renew This awesome show is well along with me. If you are looking good comedy, see elsewhere, because you will find here very little.
