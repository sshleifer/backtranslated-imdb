For a series inspired by Calcutta, it is ironic that the first attempt of a vampire episode to maintain square on its ass. 3 always bothers me and - like the horrible Han Keller sounds like at risk - I am often surprised that if I lose the point. The story looks like a jigsaw that does not match the box, and as a result you try to match the ocean's sky and spend a comfortable evening with fire. This incomplete feeling does not matter how often you go back to the episode and you do not pay any attention. I know that this review puts me at risk of being dragged to Whitby, the teen smokers who drink my blood, when they hear Boston, but I'm willing to risk it. I have always been a Verubilian myself.
