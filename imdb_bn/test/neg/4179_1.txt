If you want to spend money to rent this money, buy a piece of ice and dissolve it. That's more entertaining than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill bills, shame on you. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to watch this movie plot, go to a chicken field, bring two annoying little girls that you can find, for a few hours, the girls shout as much as possible shouting and shouting. Then send me the couple you have spent. <br /> <br /> I first enjoyed Dark Harvest, after watching Seagel, I'm going to sleep myself.
