This was not really a lot of Harold Lloyd; Not one of his funnier attempts. Of course, I never see bratty kids as something sunny. Harold and his wife Miledred Davies, mostly in the story, made the children of two young children in her youth. A child who is constantly crying and another four-year-old terrorist who does everything but breaks the house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, half the time it is afraid of a pet dog couple, but overall, that segment has fun with some beautiful scenes, I have another Lloyd short, "Hunted Spooks" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not save the whole image, which I probably will not see again. Lloyd did a lot of good things to waste this 25 minutes again. It's not just that fun.
