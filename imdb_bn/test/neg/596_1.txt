Your hatred behind, is designed for a particular purpose mind, the author / director who walks on foot or blurred the viewpoint on those who dance with the devil. Sadly, the makers made so much of their point of view that they fully accepted their power by feeding their viewpoint to the audience. That's how his message was presented reminds me of what I heard about the Spanish search! Avoid avoiding one of the real Christians, like this plague, fear tactics do not work when sending such messages. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the election of Muslim terrorists was ethnic and wrong.

Its foundation was good, the story provided a great range for its message, but due to the implementation of these ideas it was reduced that the message was very difficult to separate from the message. <br /> <br /> You'll want to get better with this message, better than switching off your old "ghost" DVD with Mr. Swayze. At least that movie does not try to push yourself down your throat. Or if you like a good Christian movie with a strong message then try "end of spray"
