I have read and enjoyed many of the books of James Le Burke's Robicocos. When I used to read 'In the Electric Miss With the Confederate Dead', Tommy Lee was leading the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I stopped it for about twenty minutes left, and no one wants to see a shot or beat. Do not make me wrong, I do not think of blood and cattle - I love 'Untouchable' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps I already saw 'birth' and 'wat just hoped'. I know that books on the chest violent, lyricist, and especially in 'Electric Miss' can be like a Kajun dump, which he wrote, complete with things that are not completely explained. A book, that's fine. In a film, that's confusing. Many of the previous critics are the enthusiastic supporters of Dave Rosakox, which has better understood that they liked the movie. Or they are Bernard Tevenney or both supporters. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I feel that it was such a waste of their pupils - they gave good performance in a film that does not hold together. Now, I say, hoping to see only the United States DVDs and the cutting of the towers will make a huge difference. Plus beside: The soundtrack was astonishing. The scene was right in the place of the Robococos, just as I imagined the store in the store. Mary Steinberg was as good as Bootsi, like Walter Brax, like Batista. If you read the book, then you know why a person is even an angry person at the beginning of the movie and then begins to envy people with different instruments. Overall, I want to print more of the 'Electric Miss and Confederate Dead', and have exposed the broader parts of Robacqua's method, with Elrod's gift and his bond Dave and explain to Dave General. Then I do not feel that what happened when I closed it last night?
