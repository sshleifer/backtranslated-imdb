Everyone liked them for their "worst movie." Some Gigli or Battlefield want to pick the world. Classic choices like some 9 out of the 9 out of the space. From the age of 14 I said, this is my baby, it is problem 2, and 9 years later, I feel like this. This is not "the worst one", it's not just an expression. It's the real bad movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> How much can you farting, pooping, peeing, and puking in a movie? I do not need to see the dogs to take a dump that goes up to my dog! Why is this so difficult for me to swallow? I have nothing against bathroom or rough humor. Hack, I like American Pie Movies. It's a bad idea in an extra 90 minutes, but this is done with the true tiping point kids! The little kids call each other's sexual names (IMDB does not even allow me to post that word here, but here it is coming out of the 8-year-old age.) Think of it pain! The other just makes the whole thing think dirtier. The longest line in the film: "I guess I have to go to more people's offices." <br /> <br /> There are no other pictures: Pebbles, dynamat sticks, toilet explosions in the lemon, the little boy drawing pictures of his or her relationship with his father and making a project beside the house, and a little girl is having fun with the laboratories? However, when my little girl is on her carnival journey, my favorite moment is: "I'll blow," she opened her mouth, and showing a fake dried shoot straight to a perfect 90 degree angle, her open face. ! The scene was more realistic in the pond of the horror movie 2. <br /> <br /> I think Gilbert Gottfried is the only release element in the film. You get the impression that he did not even have a script, but he had normal self. It looks very sad when she works stupidly by throwing a pizzas on her. <br /> <br /> Do you know? I had to go to the bathroom thinking about this movie. Goodbye!
