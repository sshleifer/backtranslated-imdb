You just can not touch NRFPTP! The new crop is just awful. The joke is not funny. Some of the Troop I want to stop watching all TV together. Lorne - you gave your creation go down to the toilet. Guests are sometimes better, the band is mostly garbage. The weekend update, when Seth will laugh to the audience to know ... Seth will get the right reception in Baghdad Cafe though ... Make sure that Andy goes with her ... The show has around 10 jokes and they just keep rehashing over over. Even the sections that are not even fun certainly. Humiliation has become the name of the game, but they could not fix it too. Just offensive I was very disappointed with what happened to Shoke, but now I know it's safe to go out on Saturday night!
