When I borrowed this movie, I was not expecting high-quality performance, but it was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was so incredibly bad that you can not easily go to this movie you tried. There is nothing that does not seem like kids like "Oh no! My father disappeared!" Or "I wonder what this is?" The same monotone that one might announce to the traffic advisor with the radio. There are some good actors, but they are lost in small parts. <br /> <br /> The story is good, although it would be fairly easy to guess, because there are not many actual plot changes. Lots of holes, too much. For example, the father is invisible, and the inventor refers to which part is needed to make him visible again. So the boy goes and stole the part from an electronics store. It is seen in the comedy section, but most comedy in this movie was fairly stupid, as the invisible father picked up his clothes in an invisible way. And then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking around covered her head almost at all times. First interesting, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because it can be seen, and it's a movie that is fun in their own way ... just like the nominated lesson of the line.
