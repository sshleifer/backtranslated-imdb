Dionie Warwick's fascinating idea is the voice of the song for this movie-adaptation of Jacqueline Susan's greatest book (A La "The Valley of the Dals"). Although it's really bad that the stupid patty Duke does not have to spike the story. "Love Machine" is continuously dull. Even the ultimate rebellion (with the Academy Award as a war criminal!) Can not save it. Diane Canon makes his heavy pancake make-up and painful fall (though his little, limestone looks drunk in a beauty scene), a block of wood led by John Philippe Leap, as gay expression, shameful in gay mode, David Heimens photographer And where is Robin Stone walking? Is he traveling out the waterfront to take some sailors? After Canon deflated his manhood, it would be a safe bet. In that case, "love machine - the final episode" may be more interesting interesting. This is definitely better than yawn-inducing snooze-opera. * **** to 1/2
