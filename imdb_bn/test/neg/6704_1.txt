First and foremost, I am a gay person, yet I do not live in the so-called "community", and the songs that are themed are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are shit. Like this. I can give this a zero I have. (I did not understand all the positive comments, until they made this image by them) I actually stopped it in the 24-minute mark when the so-called straight "Anthony" kissed Adam out of the restaurant for no reason. How does the boy steal from the thief if the boy does not live in the city? Wire transfer? Actor was Hornundus! Word editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they sit and live on their lunch. Every time the camera changes the switch between two so-called actors, as the microphone does not have a filter) or Allah is not banned, buy this movie. Horrible terrible horror and just a stupid story.
