This is the biggest example of the theory I think when Hollywood comes out of good sense, they create terrible sigs and destroy the first one. Now do not get me wrong, I absolutely love Beastmaster; I even loved one of the fantastic three-thirds, but this movie fell. I hate to see a huge fantasy / swords and magic movie pan and I see this classic bestseller like a great seagull. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? After all, the whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dara and his evil elder brother Archana (who was not the first movie in the movie Hahaha Ahahah) has overcome our world through a simple dimensional time portal portal. Yes, the Earth can be just like parallel parallel flat sea level. Although with the first movie you think the movie has happened in the past, but through it you have shown that it is completely completely all over the world ... it is just one of the many things I hate about. Consequence It does not work with "Masters of the universe" and it certainly does not work here! This will take place in the movie like this and will have their own timetable and their usual surroundings. For Christ, what's next? New York Hercules ... ER, oh ... for example! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> So, it goes up to Dar, its ferrets, its eagle, and its tiger (this time is not sprayed a spray) and to save the world ... But with the way they have a The young, quiet, and Senator's girl was caught in this whole world and showed her around the door around El, taking her to her BMW for pleasure, and pinching her here and there in rigorous situations. Helps to get J. How convenient is the right? And saying convenient, I find it is conveniently convenient and easy to secure and extremely secure in the military base sticky and get away with a theft, extremely destructive nuclear weapons ... easy half US army and L.A.P.D. After him ... easily, even waaaaay for an evil barbaric magician from another world. There are many plot holes here where I do not know where to start; At the end of the photo, why go to the Alcon L.L. Zoo ?! There is no reason to go there completely; And it will not be like the last place that you will be tempted by your greatest enemy, which only have the power to manage the living beings? <br /> <br /> And you do not like such movies, the police have been portrayed as a total rebel and even half a dozen policemen are shooting a man, can not they still kill him? This photo belongs to the police "Police Academy" series! They are useful in the movie just like reading glasses for the dark! Even the title of the movie does not give any idea: "Bustmaster 2: Portal of Time" ... they really did not have the "time" portal because this movie was not set in the future of DARARAR, so it is set in a parallel world along with us in the Astral plane They do not actually go through time, as well as the only dimensional world in them; So no real time-travel is involved! This movie seems funny and it's not due to humor, because it's too bad ... and it's pushing towards despair. Acting, dialogue, plot, character, and finishing all are pleasing to it so hungry. What else can I expect from the man who brought us "swimming returns" (another bad series)? Sadly, here is the wonderful direction of Don Kocchelli and the first serious feeling! Avoid this dirty piece of garbage, such as boobunic plague and stick, which is the first and probably the third if T.V. There is no good in it.
