Boring, cliched and expected. There was only Brighton's position for the original bit gangsters. It is definitely "lock stock etc .." Hannah was preferred at "Sliding Dorses". I did not sympathize with her character in "Circus" and could not afford to tell what happened to her or her girlfriend. Although this movie was so beautiful and predictable, there is no real surprise. I was so unpopular that I did not even know why this movie was named "Circus" ....... Bouring ....... Don is looking for this great top.
