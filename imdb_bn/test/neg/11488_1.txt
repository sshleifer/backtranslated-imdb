I want to say something about this movie. I saw comments in Russia how beautiful and Russian's views have been great. Hey, it's not Russia, but more certain capital of Bulgaria, Sofia. So Russia is not my country. In movies - well in Bulgarian, except maybe Gray Zone - all the American director's films are definitely a terrible one word. It's embarrassing that Patrick Soze will play in such low budget movies. Most actors are Bulgarian but in reality there is no plot twist in this film. There is no power in it, which I can say - the weak and annoying movie is nothing more. Hey people think that Russia is not real reality, it is Bulgaria.
