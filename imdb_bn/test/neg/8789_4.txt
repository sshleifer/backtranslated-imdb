In the mid-1990s, the animation director-director Don Bluth's career was at its lowest point in all time. Prior to this, Bluth made popular popular animated films, "The Land Land Time" (1988) "The Secret of NIMH" (1982), and "Un American Tile" (1986), in today's days. But in 1994, with "Thamhalina", its pictures were reduced in quality and popularity, and the 1995 box office bomb "The Pebble and the Penguin" is a film that does not attract audience members. Parents and children under the age of seven. Well, members of the modern audience can understand that I can take pleasure from these rather blue-animated features. <br /> <br /> The story is weird. The film is a weak-stretched, stammering and whip-penguin star (voice by Martin Short), who enjoys a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower (female Anne Golden Voice) on her head. Like coming into the real life, the penguins present their roles with a rope as a ring alternative. But when Hubbi moved away from the present, he teamed with a flying dream (James Bellushi) with a flying dream and took time to return to Antartica before it was too late. The reason why they may be too late is one of the many moving elements of this weak story, which they will be weak even though they are there. <br /> <br /> Why are these animated children's musical instruments so quick? Do not work for anyone older than six or seven years of age. It does not have any of the qualities needed for a good animated feature. Number one, the film looks bad due to the poor drawing style. This movie animation is very fantastic (even as far as animated films go); It is dark, depressing, no shaking in colors, and above it, the design of the film and its elements are ridiculous and humorous. For example, take the penguin who stars in the film. With only a few background exceptions, every single penguin shows absolutely nothing like a bird. Hubei, for example, looks strangely funny about the whip, the glossy, the big eyes, and the clothes he worn wherever he goes. In his hands such as "Flippers" he saw Chris Farley as a penguin suit. The result: he is a ugly, poorly painted cartoon character. But the most illogical and miraculously designed character is the evil Penguin, Drake, who does not see anything like a penguin. He is a muscle-man wearing a penguin mask. Compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger, his chest is broad and leopard's seal and the killer is bigger than Tiimer's teeth, which acts as a movie hunter. Basically, he is a bi-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a cave-shaped cave, he wears a cape, smiles a lot, and gets mad when people laugh with him. Result: Who care? And what's worse, and worse, it's an animated musical instrument and it's not a single notable or memorable song found anywhere in the running time. The opening song was harmless ?? Not memorable, but ruthless. But after that, the songs became silent and slow, and especially one that screamed me all the way. At this moment the moment the viewer can press fast forward button for it, the moment is <br /> <br /> I felt "The Pebble and the Penguin" was saved for a very short time only when Hubei and Rockpacker Penguin Raco were trapped in leopard seals and killer Vell's jaws, who thankfully did not give any conversation and instead of cartoon characters. Used to behave as animals. But in this case, for this reason, I can not really recommend this movie to children. This is because. Film Exhibition Killer Whale Penguin is a natural hunter. My concern is that children familiar with "Free Willie" (1993) may be offended or frustrated by seeing the sea's favorite lover depicted as a bloody drunk. The leopard seal was a good competitor and its fun is as fun as how his jaws appear larger than a rattlesnake and how to smile when he smiles. But the point really, this moment with the hunters ?? And there are only a few ?? The only interesting moments are. And they are not too attractive, you remember. <br /> <br /> Below, I can not recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My suggestion: If you have children around that page, rent it for them. They can enjoy it
