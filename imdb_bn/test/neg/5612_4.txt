Roger Haur helps with a film that basically can find young people and find himself clearly, so it needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of promise at the beginning that a film that could be turned into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's very bad because I got really hooked at the beginning. Then, like the soundtrack at the beginning, it became somewhat cool and curious. <br /> <br /> It makes great fun with many fun and interesting characters. I'm sure enough will be enough for a lot of people. The problem is all imaginable and empty, which is, maliciously, considered to be the original discovery of the character's self-realization. The film itself is not (it is not a self-conscious film), but the character is supposed to recognize its own life and it is empty and empty.
