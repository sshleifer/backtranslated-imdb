There are many 'bad' movies. Tune up to 5 channels per night and you can try to threaten only one filmmaker or the other. Possible films that gave me more pain - I was more busy - writing, acting, direction, cinematography and the movie Inbetweeners' bases are really true true attempts, and all costs will be avoided. The only laugh, it throws me behind the DVD scene, in which the director of the film Darwin Fisher explained how it was his script that attracted the "talent" in the project! <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - Britain's Edward D. Wood Junior replies!
