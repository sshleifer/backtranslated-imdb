I really wanted to choose this movie, and this was not the reason for it, but I thought that the reason for enjoying the movies and moving around professors will be strong. The cinematography was good, but without it the other way around the chef, everything else was very low. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine were very annoying in this movie, though Abigail Breslill appears to be somewhat boring in her movie, though she plays a very playful role where she is stupid. It's a little bit of cooking, but it was a big disappointment for me if the food was not really a big part of the movie. There were some good possibilities for this picture, cast was cool but there was little to work with them. I loved romantic comedy in a good light heart but this was just soft. And longer than it should be felt longer than it should be. This is not a terrible movie, you will not miss anything without seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
