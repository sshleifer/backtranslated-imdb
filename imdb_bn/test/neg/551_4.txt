In 1984, it was a great addition to The Carate Kid, although it was more than a poor person's Rocky. Hello, Producer Jerry Weinstrobe realized that it was good to leave the story where it was finished and firmly convinced Ralph McQueo and Pat Murrti to make extra efforts to start the film firmly. Part III was less free in the franchise, but someone might have thought that the series still had some potential. There is probably no explanation for the existence of the next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Next? Yep, Macchio has gone (at least he was smart enough to finally stop), and his replacement Hillary Swin (!), Playing a boring teenager (and what?), Julie Pierce. Now, there are problems with the girl's family. He gets hurt in school. The school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). Although it is active, one of his students is actually a nice man and Julie is reading for him. This, of course, gets her in big trouble before. He is lucky for him, now he is living with his grandfather's old friend Mia (Murita), who knows to return to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> These considerations are up to seven clich√©s, and this is a generic plot summary - imagine what the scenery should look like! Towards the end of the next karate kidney urine line and set-up tired, flat and soft marathon. Sonak, thanks, Boy Dow Cree and Million Dollar Baby liked this disaster, but why did Morita take it back? He received the Oscar nomination for the first film, and he was quite enjoyable in the cecilia, but could not say anything for him - even the "Wax, Mom of Off" Gag's revival was still born. As Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Cov and Thomas Ian Griffith in the third, but it is rarely stretched. <br /> <br /> So, what is this picture really terrible? It's not like that. There is a sequence directed to achieve a peculiar beauty, but when the best bits of the whole movie are dancing to a group of Asian monks for the first time in their life, it does not qualify as a recommendation.
