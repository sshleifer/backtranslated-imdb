I'll distribute it with a clear review of the actual error. They have a lot of names. A very short list is what they will get right. 1. The name of the new name 2. It's Ark with animals. <br /> <br /> Take a "bible" rental (1966) if you want a more accurate image of Noah's ark and destruction for Sodom. It describes the story of creation by trying to sacrifice his son Isaac to Abraham through Abraham. This is a good movie, and it may be that the "Ark of Noah" (1999) led you to look for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I could not wait to see the whole movie. From reading other comments, I can see that even atheists are also fairly wrong. As a Christian, it was helpless to me. Probably the worst movie ever made. This movie does not have any real point, except perhaps displaying their sub-atomic computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it the complete waste? Maybe not God can do evil in good works. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that for all things God works together for their love, to whom they are called. <br /> <br /> 50 says, [20] But for you, you think evil against me; But Allah loves it, so that in such a way, one can save the living. <br /> <br /> In the second example Joseph's brothers wanted to kill him, but God turned their wickedness into a very good one. She can do the same with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so surprised to see the lack of Bible foundations, perhaps they broke the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To know about Lot and Sodom, before God destroys Sodom and Gomrah, they will have to go all the way up to Genesis 19. After that, they read about half of Genesis, so they might want to end. The next book is Exodus, which was based on the movie "Ten Commandments" (and more accurately). If they look at that movie, the journey becomes easy. So now they have read at least two complete books of the Bible, because they saw a kind-hearted film about Noah's Ark. I'm sure it's actually happened to someone there. <br /> <br /> God works in a mysterious way.
