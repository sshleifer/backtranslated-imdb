I can not believe some of the comments here in reviews. The film must of course be very incredible to date and the very special effect from our comfortable perspective on CGG age. But even for this permission, Helen of Troy is so bad that it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Scripting is very awful, just horror, no characterization. As a result, you enjoy Hardbew and Andrews ashamed because they provide the most ridiculous shallow tritoswawlp lines. The authors seem to think that there is a need to explain almost everything in a terrible law and order that does not allow the audience to decide for something about it. In the beginning of the film, historical background has been mentioned as never heard of ancient Greece; I know they will consider the American audience, but of course, we definitely say twice to make the action really frightening. <br /> <br /> I can not really believe this comment on the movie as a great epic film. Even for relatively primitive cinematography and relative sensitivity to today's audience, this film is really frustrating.
