Very bad movie with very good moments or quality <br /> <br /> It starts with pregnant Linda Blair, who may be a monster or a pitchfork, she goes to a hallway to escape. Not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. The pregnancy that he has conveyed vary widely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and an annoying and potentially distraught boy who thought that her son traveled to a deserted hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most annoying little boys in their movies! David Haselhoff and his German-speaking comrade girlfriend on the island (you know how Germans love Haslehoff to know). He's taking pictures, and he's translating a secret German book about the document, I think. <br /> <br /> Traveling on the island is also an old couple who bought it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. He was obviously a architect, and Linda Blair and the older couple's children. I think they all traveled on the island together, but it seemed like a lind and the boy was different from the rest of them (probably they were shooting separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems obvious, obviously outgoing, but it does not use any great effect. Bad makeup and a black camouflage present an old woman boy and occasionally keep talking in Germany, which, after all, he records in the record tape recorder. <br /> <br /> People start to die in their dreams. , Or sucked in to hell or something. There is nothing right in this Gore scene, but not enough for the film to recommend. Although the copy I saw has been told that it is not covered in the cover of the box, the death of a character whose body appears to have actually exploded in the burst. The scene shows the response shots of most characters, because we are not seeing ourselves. The Christist scene is one where a face-to-face mouthpiece encounters a face-to-face injuries. She looked especially nasty. A ridiculous and painful bad scene that has emerged Linda Blair If I want to throw him in a horror movie, they will do something original about his role, and let him release Exorcist behind him (without the yearly dire convention). <br /> <br /> The strange, essentially Italian, tradition of claiming a series that is not related to it, it is AHA La Casa 4 and Gothhouse II. In other words, it is a continuation of Cass3 - Gosthaus, La (1988) - it's not (this is a better movie than this one). La Cassa 1 and the two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again not related to Withery and La Kasa (and much better than that). A Kasa 5, LA (1990) AKA House 5, which is the fake La Casa series and series house: House (1986) House 2: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989), AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How does the show show fit there? It does not really claim to be a seagull, so the real series entry must be abandoned due to low (or more) confusion. Kinky, The Horror Show also is the AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 also the AKA Horse House 2. Does your head still hit?
