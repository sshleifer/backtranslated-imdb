The film is a fairly stylish look for IndiGo, really low-budget, but the movies I'm going to do are not the same. I found a companion, sympathetic they all seem totally damned. What they try ends badly, it is very hopeless for me. Read Puffy Chairs as a Black Comedy Review ... Comedy? Brother Rite behaved like a pastor from an institution. When Josh had talked to his friend about his friend, friend friend Emily, he did not play with the whole deck and indicated in Rethhe. However Josh works for Rite "marriage" and a woman arrives only a few hours before Rite. There were some interesting performances by some characters facing the streets. But the most important thing for me is that people are leaving the movie ... and I saw it in free screening.
