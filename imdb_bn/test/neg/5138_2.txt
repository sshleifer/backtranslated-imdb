It is a forgotten pilot why Nostradamus is really important for the plot of this film, but Rob Aastes can be a Nostradamus for some reason, and those who travel around the time with the medieval beggars traveling around the gun and fighting people and setting fire to fire. Oh yes, there is also a sexy FBI agent who can be a PISC and trying to convince Rob before everything is too late. Very bad they can not predict a good plot. Yawn <br /> <br />
