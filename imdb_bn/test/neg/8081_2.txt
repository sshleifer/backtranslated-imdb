That's what this movie is about. Good God to suck this movie special effects. It is difficult to suck more than the plot of this film, but special effects can lead to it's closure. Try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is a plot. In Duluth, MN, there are four punk-ass teenage hikers in the vicinity of a forest. One of them stupid ass and tried a humorous jump and broke his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but the helicopter is frustrated with them. Then five have realized that the forest is a fire, which we see some people supply a lot of gas in the jungle. All they show us boots, and they show scenes after these boys walking walking around the visible dipping gas and running fire. Meanwhile, thirteen tried to flee from the fire, only the boot man was driven to advance them (when they were running fast in the forest with dirt bikes!), They drove around the area, dumped the gas and started more fire. He did this several times, and the paramedics finally caught him and started him in the fire. I will not spoil the end, but the stability of this man will shout you, "What is bloody? !!" On screen. However, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only turn is through a mine filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I'm not going to end up trying to describe it, because it's ridiculous, and if you do not see it, then enjoy it more. Because you do not do that, you probably can not expect what might happen. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: Adjustment <br /> <br /> What is the need to adjust the adjustments too much? Apparently so. I can not count the number of broken organs in this movie (they break arms and legs while crashing their bikes). I think each character has at least one organ, and multiple breaks. They are then tall around the scene until the end, and then forget that they are supposed to break broken. There is a scene where three of their legs begin to dance and start dancing. But then their hordes suddenly come back when their plot is needed. <br /> <br /> Finally, CGI If there is a hell, then it will show a fire in this film. What they have done for the fire of the forest, the CGI fire is the dirt stone. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the fires, and more than two feet of trees from the road are obsolete. And then they zoomed out and the whole forest appeared engulfed in flames. It's hard to describe in words that seem ridiculous, but I assure you that laughing is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best-so-good. There are some programs where it falls in the painful-bad section, but in most cases it is on the line and laughs in discreetly. I can not wait to see the unreleased movies of this nature which are these four packages.
