This movie was recommended to many people, and after reading all the positive comments on this site, I went ahead and closed eBay a copy of the film. The film is an average and slightly hammy, especially from the family of Cancellation, when the jupiter is torn on Wednesday and looks at twelve bodies, it seems to be a sequence when talking to the camera. One of those performances is that where you just played and felt bad for that poor actor. I saw that some of his worst edits are proof, his "lecture" is cutting a horrible jump right in the middle. Although there are a few wonderful moments, and sometimes the music works well ... but this film is not uncommon as a whole, and I do not know why people think Wes Kraveen is a director. So far, he did not show me anything that I believe is believable, the only thing that developed with Crayvenes films, was his production budget.
