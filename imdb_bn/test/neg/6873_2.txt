Here is another movie that is totally stupid and with the incompatible lead characters, we are supposed to make them the route? I do not There is no value in this film. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays a car salesman "Joey O'Brien." There is no class of people, every moral feeling is affected and one person thinks he can talk to him in any way. To know William's ability to speak, he was good for this role. Women in her life are also very clever. None of them is much better than them. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins also lives in the same way that the movie starts when he is fully loaded with explosives, the car dealers crash in and out of the showroom. People, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as usual for her, plays a boring and ridiculous character. I assume this two actors of this nut case role come easily. Yes, I wonder why <br /> <br /> This movie is shouting so loud that it will give you headache. Combine those two screams with the nervous voices of Fran Dresher and you really have a boring over-the-top cast. It's like listening to the rock on a blackboard for an hour and a half. This comedy? No, this is lam. <br /> <br /> In fact, only a few dozen reviews have been posted for Robin Williams's film, which tells you something here. This is a lot of tears from his best movie.
