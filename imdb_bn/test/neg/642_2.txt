Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've bothered with. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the mid-70s the effects had become moderate, but today it is frustrating by the criteria. Instead of using a clear model they can not take a shot of a real train? <br /> <br /> The acting is not extraordinary but in reality the dialogue is the worst part. It gouges its way into your mind "You do not die on me now." If you ever manage to suspend long suspense to be absorbed in a movie, you will quickly come back with an alien, model train, or a closed conversation. The only reason I'm not giving this movie "1" is that it is not so poorly rated that some poor suckers can see it for the underlying pleasure of this really bad movie.
