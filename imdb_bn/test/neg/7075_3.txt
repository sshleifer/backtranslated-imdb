I've seen this movie, and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know what I can expect, but it was very nice to see that the movie was on its way soon. The idea was quite original and the acting was nice. In particular, Jenny Dewan is an exciting / evil copper <br /> <br /> <br /> The most difficult thing to do in the scary movies is a good finish. But the movie failed. For a change, a last scene in a hospital, where suddenly all employees were gone. At first you looked around doctors and nurses, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> does not cry for any help, running behind a copper, fleeing to the roof (not even a smart move ...) and a closed end is of course open. <br /> <br /> No .... The movie is a great start, the main part was nice to watch, but they really ended up using all the clich√©s from the worst bad films. Jeffrey Reddick has failed in my eyes with this movie, some of the genuine movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> For me, I like movies which makes me wonder.
