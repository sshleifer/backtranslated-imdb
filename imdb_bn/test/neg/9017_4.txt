After an astronaut got killed in space, he was brought back to a military base. Inside inner embryo was discovered - he hosted for what could be a terrible alien attack! This film director said. Bernard L. Comes to us from Kovalsky, who operated "Attack of Giant Lakes" (see separate review) but could be known for his work on "Colombo". Executive producer Roger was gradually known as a better film producer than that ... especially in the 1960's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is Chess and weakly built. What comes out as attractive is the weak effect, not the actual film itself. One view shows off one of the alien embryo and it presenting an embarrassing cartoon. Even until 1958. And then when an adult alien appears ... then you will be wondering why he is wearing shoes. Or if you are really real, then you would be surprised to see why you saw an alien case in other movies. <br /> <br /> You will never see its worst science fiction movie. And you will pay some credit to it almost - overtaking a military base concept predicted both "Things" and "Alien" for several years in the alien host. I do not know that these films were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. However, when filming, flops and drinks are only great for heckling. I did not see the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but it sure is an insulting film.
