I classified it as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If ever there was a movie I would like my enemies, it will be. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the songs of these characters just completely put faith in it. <br /> <br /> These reasons are combined to make this a very annoying movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother came out of the movie in 15 minutes. I think this annoying and slow * movie must have some interesting interesting twist and is quite frustrating if there is no exciting thing. <br /> <br /> I decided to send a bill for the loss of my two hours in a short time to the filmmaker.
