This is not the worst movie I ever seen. I did not seem to want to erase my eyes forcing my eyes to see the galaxy. It's not just good. The joke is almost funny, but short fall. All of them Come close to the few gag is to beat down by repeating over them. Production standard, good, existence The sound is bad, the light is bad, ... It just seems to be made cheaply; So much so Dialogues ... well, often missing it - many painful silences; They all are standing right around, and somebody seems to have said something. The film does not hesitate with what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was created as a comedy - as it was developed after the start of the shoot. It looks like someone's photo was gathered before nighttime gathering, and if they kept it for two weeks then it would have been better. <br /> <br /> and I can make it easier. I thought "Mom and Dad save the world" was a hoot. I like "Pluto nash". "Mystery man" is one of my favorite movies. "Transmitted attackers" are better near a classic This turkey is not just about it. "Space truckers" were more credible. <br /> <br /> Avery screenbars, may be very fun, try very hard. His part calls for a straight, and he plays it leaning towards the sitcom. Dorothy Stratenne is right in her role, but not particularly significant. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, "My watch is always slow." The line was funny. I will give all the codes to this movie which it can get, it needs it. <br /> <br /> Space car models are not bad, but some of them are not used effectively. Space view is vague. No sweeping pass, no close-up fly-by-the-fly, they do not have the appropriate action scenes when docked. (Infiniti crashes very curious at one stage.) Flight dynamics are terrible; Bad than what you have seen, they are not shocking, smooth. The initial war is stilted and static; Although two ships have shown that they can drive in their shameless fashion, they make trade (gradually) shots more securely, like the memorable attitude of the 16th century sea war, which is not exciting. <br /> </ br> Alien - imagine if there were all the canteen scenes in Star Wars. Can not get that much rubber mask rather fast? Some eyes are used as eyesight which works well for the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Please, if you try to see the galaxy, you can fall asleep. (I was busy with something else and missed the last ten minutes, and it seemed like it was not replayable. If it is not "sucked", I do not know what.) Sadly, a lot of potential, and this is easily a good movie may be. It's easy to rebuild and has a decent film. <br /> <br /> Madkaugh
