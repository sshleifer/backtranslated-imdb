Oh man, this movie was bad hungry. Bad appearance, terrible story ... List of good things is small from the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes it is supposed to be a comedy and everything but everything tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The film does not start as a mostly comedy, but it does not have much of an adventure movie with its fun stuff. You can specifically say that by acting it was serious, it was a serious and non-comical way, except for the exceptionally top two top order exceptions. I think that they first tried to create a true and serious adventure science-fantasy film, perhaps a franchise, but soon it began to notice how bad it was and easily decided to insert more and more overdone comic sequences. . The film seems to be another comedy and prevents it from becoming a completely destructive world. <br /> <br /> This movie is a peculiar attempt to mix adventure Sashblocking Pirates with serious science-fictional steps. The movie "Star Wars" was clearly inspired by the movies and its success. The film is not ashamed to even copy the whole sequence even in the story progression, sets, letters, and robots exhibit duplicity. They obviously tried to hide it in the spoofing sequences but I did not fall for it. So despite the original concepts, the film is not even its own original. You can say that this movie is a poor person's "spacel", and even in addition to being completely fooled. <br /> <br /> Some of the video games have special effects (some sequences even literally) the movie looks bad, terrible looking clothing (metal coat and outer space sword?). The word is even ridiculous at times They shot some sequences without sound and then forgot to add the necessary word after the product afterwards. Mixing really bad. They repeatedly tried to conceal it by pulling the word and pulling Bruce Bretron's musical score. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It seems to be the movie's story almost unclear and badly written, almost completely unused main plot. It does not really help to flush the movie. Lots of things are not explained and some are even dropped after some. The film begins as a 'pirate' movie, which is constantly searching and stealing water, because it is rarely and it is the only planet in the remaining residual galaxies (yes, right!). However, this plot line is soon discarded, especially in the middle of the film, where the film seems completely different with different motivations. It's like a weird and bad, shameless sequence without just one click. It keeps the letter very shallow and careless. <br /> <br /> Sorry that actors like John Carradine, Angelica Houghton and still young and unknown Ron Perlman were associated with this devastating film. <Br> <br /> I have admitted that I liked a few moments, especially the last time when they were real and fun with time-warp, but really, this film was not enough to save. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie just like the camp. <br /> <br /> 2/10
