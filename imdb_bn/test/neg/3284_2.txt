I heard the first canned hesse track in the first few seconds of listening, but I gave it a chance. When you know that someone who provides a line that is just a little ridiculous and you hear the sudden smile hit the track that it is an event called for the body, "yes, it's fun, go ahead and laugh". <Br> <br /> Wig. I could not stand this show as expressing myself. I can not speak for everyone - after some people the IDIOTIC shows the choice "stacked" (which I want to vomit). I can imagine that those who prefer "stacked" can also like this drill. Some people still get rid of the old "pull my finger" to get a kick. To me, this show is just confused - and almost as original. <br /> <br /> Themes are old and tired Jokes were lam and hackneynid. We have seen the characters everywhere before - and you can imagine anyway. <br /> <br /> So if you like words or neighbors who say "drag my fingers" You might actually like this show. Otherwise ... pass it by. It's stupid - and not a tricky or original way. No show is sometimes old and tired in its premiere.
