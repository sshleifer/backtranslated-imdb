This will be one of the worst movies of my life. I can not believe in people actually) Write script like this b) There is a budget for making a movie c) It can actually be successful. The sound can not even describe how awesome this film is. I enjoy my fair share of teen movies, but this does not even come to be funny. In fact, it was the only reason that it was very dangerous. I could probably count one (maybe two) parts in the picture where I was able to even get a chocolate (without smiles about how bad it was) <br /> <br /> This is the biggest mistake I ever made. One day I saw the movie, and I was amazed at how awesome I was still. To avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
