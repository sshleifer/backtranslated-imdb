What garbage, actually there is no part II? If this movie really ends, then everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie is not close to a film like the outbreak, which was actually a fairly decent film. This movie ran in hopes of getting some simple dollars. I think the movie looks bad, but I never thought it would be bad. There was no way to apply this film to the American people's fear! If you have not seen this movie, do not bother. The movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. I really hope the production of this movie was just a few weeks. stay away! Do not be fooled by fraud!
