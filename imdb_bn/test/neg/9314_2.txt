Apart from what was shot with television cameras, what could be said of this independent effort and which did not have the frustration or budget constraints, it does not make observations of this variation on Romero's theme any easier. I constantly reminded that I saw someone in school at school, the best of the best derivatives is the cheapest. <br /> <br /> The author / director George Kosululinsky (who has appeared in the film) did some interesting things with the stock footage, but more about his editing style than his style, which makes you face-to-face close-ups with TV cameras That holds me thinking that I am watching public access television instead of the real, honest-love movie. <<br /> <br /> The copy and paste of the stories are bits and pieces from various sources, the previously mentioned Romero Dead Trilogy, The Road Warrior (a "future" stock footage that excavates past) and Blair Witch project <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br (OK, in this case "man" clone, but it does not make any changes. Menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031, and people who cloned the first stranger years ago, especially the diet Agata malfunction has been started in the region. Of course, when the clones become worse, then the first taste of human flesh (or, in this case, the human flesh cloning). It is not safe outside the home, it is not safe to stay outside. It's just a matter of time before meat eating ghouls consume our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I do not love Romero, but I do not think there is a new area covered in this film. The live death night completes the Blatter Wit project shot with television cameras. Especially frustrating that the DVD cover appears to be shot short time with 8 mm film. If the story is not equally cheap then it was not a problem with me. This movie provides a poor vision of the future where technology has improved where people are cloning possible. Clone our favorite movies?
