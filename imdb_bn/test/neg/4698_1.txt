I like half life I still fan it It was awesome, intelligent and challenging. I did not give any news that it was the best FPS Maybe I'm a very hardcore semi-life fan but the so-called half-life is not half-life. <br /> <br /> I have a question: Is this half-life next chapter? Probably the creators - Valve - so thinks but I do not. Where is the intelligent enemy? Where's the terrible environment? Somewhere. I believe they wanted to separate Half Life (instead of another research station story), but they did not just create a different thing, they created something which could work in half-life, for example earthquake fate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can expect it to use it as a weapon - it will turn the planned FPS gameplay vertically. The truth is, you can not use gravity-gun as the actual weapon. Why? Because what you can do is throw the box and barrels that do not do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can be about 3 shots. If you want to throw an enemy in an explosion barrel, it may explode on your own "hand". Gravity-gun does not work as a weapon. The best use is to solve some material-puzzles. I said valve why? The truth is that you will end up with your annoying, planned FPS weapon (except the last level) weapons do not make the original half-life classic. If the gravity-gun will always be in the last stages - a real weapon- I would appreciate what Valve was doing. But this is not It's frustrating. <br /> <br /> So if you want half-life you are searching in the wrong place. Perhaps you will enjoy it, but I will repeat: it is not half life and even its faithful continuity. This is the greatest disappointment of all time. Valves have shown they can make very terrible games. They have managed that.
