A good ol 'son is almost required to have a vague likelihood of the moon with moonshine, car riding, a story which is "plot" and at least one very beautiful country girl, short shorts and a lower top. Beautiful girl here (wearing designer jeans dress) - but the Redneck Precession stopped there. Jimmy Dean is a natural but a powerful guy as a sheriff's spokesman, as former Sheriff, he comes up short in the way. Big Big is big, but he is not convinced with his "bad" part of moniker. Jack Alam is always a hug, and Bo Hopkins is playing the same part for decades; Ned Betty plays a small role in his role ... but there is no story. It smells like an episode of Hit of the Night, more than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily expected feeling. Perhaps the most serious problem in this movie is the Thierry Daniels theme song. You know one; It was made famous by Jimmy Dean.
