Compared to the ocean ocean compared to the 2001 ocean, compared to the sea, did anyone else see similar things? <br /> <br /> - They all came back twelve times, and Jet-Jones was added; <br /> <br /> - Twelve was the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve were the same producers; <br /> <br /> - 12 people were the same production designers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve was the same music director. <br /> - Twice was the same film editor. <br /> <br /> Does anyone see things changing instead of being established in the "ocean" franchise? <br /> <br /> - Twelve budgets were worth 25 million dollars (30%); <br /> <br /> - 11 got good reviews, but twelve were mostly panded; <br /> <br /> - $ 450 million in 11 thousand dollars <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> Of course, a director's medium. I almost forgot.
