This is a children-television series that is simultaneously with Mary-Suyay, moderately and skeptical. I could not bring my soul to sit through the 3 episodes of Zo101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn's spares could work to save her life! What message brought kids to this show? If you are not perfect like Joe, you are ineligible * Rolse * * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then the Chase is basically like a boyfriend, which Joe compels to walk. Yet all other characters seem to be neutral to prevent Joao from being expelled. I'm sorry but the characterization in this show = very unrealistic.
