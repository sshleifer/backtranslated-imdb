Cartoon such special effects, awesome acting and dialogue, and dry plot! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to Blockbuster a horror movie that we could have fun, but it was too much. This movie is a holiday with a woman and her son on the islands of Bahamas. The only woman who will be a doctor / virologist will fall in the same manner. There is a strange wound in his arm, and he immediately knows that it is an infectious virus. The story begins to show romance quickly among two teenagers (this girl says, "I know it's fast, but it feels good." ????) However, the entire island is infected with this virus and the CDC is brought. We are told that in three months if the virus is not treated and it spreads to the United States and kills millions of people, it will be. This information does not stop leaving the CDC to protect the island itself. Thankfully, this awesome virus is found during the healing time, and the whole island is preserved. To celebrate the death of loved ones, there is a harmful group of people on the island where everyone is dancing, having fun, and forgetting about the terrible epidemic that happened.
