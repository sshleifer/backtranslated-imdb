It's fairly common for scientific-channels: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We got some alien sock dolls open on a train, and iron diamond phillips did its best with what they did to showcase their performance. And save the day. Everyone else is absolutely dispensable; The former wife who first goes through Lou's time-honored clich√© of disliked, of course, then finally comes to love him again. A quarrelsome State Senator who has reached early and a close proximity to a much-guarded security guard. Then there is an echo-terrorist who does not have any reason for this movie, except about 3% more than us running. He spent the middle part of the film hiding in a box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteor that starts flying through the air, behind which the fireplace is about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this film, if you exceed your vehicle's post speed limit then atmospheric friction can explode in the fire. Then it is coming horizontally, the land on a car hood. I think sort of like a velcro ball landing a velcro floor. It really does not damage the car too much, just hends up a little bit up After iron gets into a helicopter and is chasing after the train. Although the train started in just two minutes, it seems pretty good to catch. CGI is so bad that the helicopter is big as flying mountains. Then it flies beside a mountain - this effect should be seen to be believed. It seems that they took a gasoline and threw it against the wall, then the flame on the helicopter made the effect higher. About 10 times too big. Helicopter can not drag on time, no surprise, it carries five tons nitro glycerin. Then the echo-terrorist finally blows himself up, but instead of blasting from all sides, like most explosions, he exploded on top like a bomb, visible in the air. Then there is a complete agreement with not being able to stop the train, because it lets the little aliens stop, but it seems that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train, so why it will be kept in their train. No idea <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those types of chefs are kind of. Usually these movies contain at least one or two things about them that can sit through them; There is probably a sexy girl, some T & A, or a character that actually has some personality, or something mysterious or good, something. I really do not see any of that here.
