Yes A real stinker I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "mental" movie. This makes every effort the film will not be able to understand. I was aware that I had been a stinger for the first 20 minutes. I wanted to look somewhat valuable, and most importantly, I paid for this movie. The wait was intolerable. After watching the movie, I talked to my friends and learned that in this intellectual environment (they are called themselves under this title) this "film" was recognized as a wonderful composition. Yes, a nice composition, but in stinkers section. I think that a movie has to be self-explanatory. This photo is exactly the opposite. Keep yourself away from this thing which is called "movie" Instead of paying for this "event" burn your money. Rate: 10 out 1
