Put the film down and slowly away. The acting rival is a high school play, the plot is treadworn, and production values ​​are slightly higher than the community theater. The cave is so ridiculous that it becomes a ridiculous one. Rooms roam, dead steps, dogs are used for wolves, men's shot points are empty. 45 caliber pistols are capable of running snowmobile, blouse buttons and antuton without bothering people and riding bicycles ... This is a Baiyuddadad film. When I saw the average rating I almost passed. There are no accounts for the taste. BTW, there is no nudity.
