Well, I'm 26 years old so I campaigned 80's through all the action heroes, and Chuck Norris Sigal, Van Dam and other boys, as well as my childhood heroes, fought with the bad boy, shot multiple pink shoots. Round Only;) I saw this movie ad a few days ago on TV - Chuck Norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. Oops! 'I definitely saw that movie!', I said. And indeed it was. Just a lot worse. All movies are very hard to see - some religious ideas, funny junky-like monsters, who serve Satan, all concepts of a plot of a forgotten community, which represent the entire humanity - is a burden for Christian fundamentalists. Wet dreams <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, even in movies, , Chuck Norris is playing an angel, where does Satan live, who works under the supervision of a little town ?! The whole plot is so straightforward and annoying, it does not mention its fascination (yes, it's not stupid, we're talking in silin ... just like a child's joke), I create a terrible movie, so far as I think big is dedicated to many Catholic churches, Because the young spectators laugh at almost every scene. Technically it is wrong, FX is worse than what you saw in the 90s in the TV series, this plot seems too stupid, actors can easily be exchanged on the cardboard stand, as long as I've heard that the music is not mentioned, playing a baby toy piano. I have seen so many movies, even the worst (from the list below IMDB) such as 'Space Mutiny' or 'Manos - Hands of Fate', but believe that I can not compare to this ridiculous, terrible, awesome actor. Movies which are some of my students in the fantastic movie of my mind than regular production. Avoid it. Avoid at all costs. There is nothing to laugh here. Chuck Norris officially finished his film career.
