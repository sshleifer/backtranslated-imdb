QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, anyone on the line will not be let loose or just stop working ... so the contract has been made on his life. After throwing a big party (Jennifer Jason Leigh, which I assume that sometimes doing anything other than TV movies or directly in a low-budget video-to-trash) is never visible. Our "hero" gives him a pass ... offers his big money for a "quickie" ... although he needs his money down, he needs money ... but having overnight in the air ... even after killing his father Being harassed by an excessive boy is believed to have been sent for. Disgust The story continues only ... You can see each "turn" and "turn" a mile away. Strange soundtracks by some group called "Tiger Lily" will drive away most people ... but I think there was a kind of quiet track at the end. Or was I just excited because I used to say that the movie is almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... What happened to you?
