I can not qualify as a "film" legally. The plot was so intense, the dialogue was so shallow, and the lines were so terrible that I could not believe that someone actually wrote the line, "Holy Shaw! It is a wonderful composition" and then it's actually a producer. I remember this image forever, for one, still dumbfounded and marked the degeneracy of intelligence in America - that is, and of course "crossroads," of course.
