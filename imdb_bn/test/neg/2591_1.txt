I am generally quite tolerant of movies, and it is very easy to entertain, but this movie was terribly frustrating. <br /> <br /> I saw the film William Zabaca (Karate Kid Bad Boy) on the cover) and during this movie I can see that this is the only reason. <br /> <br /> This picture is a great waste of actor talent. The song, and the sound horribly strong - I could not believe in a movie made in the 90's! <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie unless you are interested in actors.
