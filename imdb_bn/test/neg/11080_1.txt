Sometimes you ignore a short word in your movie that says "Stay away from this movie". We all have to pay more attention to that little voice This could be my worst movie that I could never sit down, or it might be the best reason to remember the quick-forward button on your DVD player. "The Caveman" is a fast-cheap-dark-clustrophobic spellbanker-unknown harmful "The Cave" and "Clan", which is clearly made up of the current bunch of fast cave, like $ 1.99, similar to the same movie a few years ago. There was rash, which used ocean-going ships instead of caves, all scary boats / submarines-many dark-classes Trophobic adventure-unknown men ... same old in the same age. "The Cave" is really "The Blair Witch Project", which is lost in the world just below this time and is not lost on this. Throw a flashlight with a failed battery, wear it for the monster Hanging on their necks, and wearing the stupid "twist" climax Whoever says, I hear you listen to me, your head is a little, I am your friend, I want you a happy life, stay away from this movie.
