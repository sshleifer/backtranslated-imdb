Zambia movie hot, I love. Can not get enough. Without explaining why I would have purchased this capiber film, I just love zombies. Surprised, this is not really a zombie movie; I can handle in a low budget, it just bothered me to be unexpected. <br /> <br /> A group of horror-films hold a warehouse / lab / who-knows-what can protect from outside fire storms. Panic, gusto, low light, and (finally) zombie events happened. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the filmmakers, because it is clear that they really thought that they kept something good; A serious, scary horror film. It's not too far, it's a boring mess on wood acting, Chess FX, poor lighting, excessive dialogue, and editing. <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes take time to get the letters ever to sit and start thinking about what is happening. It gets worse after 20 minutes and they are still trying to determine what is going on. All these are tied to non-acting and bad conversations. <br /> <br /> Finally somebody is connected (not by a zombie) and hope light before lounging around the characters rolling just before a touch (only the one that generated emotions) sucks this around. I am also saying, I too. <br /> <br /> Finally, the jokes are mixed, but no one cares much. I think some blood and thorns have passed, but I was too busy to credit to roll the notice. And when the screen finally turns black, I feel more cynical than the 'cube' inspired ending with the foolish. <br /> <br /> I give credit for very hard work, even if it tragically fails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / 10
