It is really sad that a film is really awkward and tries to find out who it is. However, this is a terrific film. Gene Hackman ruins his most famous, and rebuilt role, "Gene Hackman" during the re-run (and a suspect, a lot of dollars). Otherwise, television actors have got the opportunity to become a movie star and have successfully opposed the temptation. Patrick Soze has a small section and he has expressed his gratitude to others, for which he will be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a result of someone else's review and I felt that another view was merited. You can not agree with my review but at least, you have been warned.
