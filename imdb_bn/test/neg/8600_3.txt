Oh, sex is the life of a potato man, what stupid monster has created you? This is a movie that you see, smoothen the runtime, and then when you mention it to others, you can not talk but laugh. But Potato Male Sex Livies is a funny movie and it is not that when you are inspired to laugh while talking or thinking, this movie is very strange; There is no shame in trying to smile so much humiliating and laughing at sex and sex life, which you can not only help, but can face your face. Remember that the head drowns following the smirk; As the result of the head and the fingers and thumb of both the fingers in both the sides of the head, you surround them in order to try to remember the trash slowly. <br /> <br /> But what is this picture, it's trash; It's a very brave and shameless trash but nothing less than a trash. Anyone who came with this idea kept it on paper and then tried to make it spread around the industry, it must be very brave or very frustrating. This is a movie that is somehow strange about 'me' but it is a strange thing, in no circumstance, there is no decisive statement. From the idea that European movies are mostly artistic and its stories are flawed and open-ended, and the themes give priority to most other things. Potato Men's Sex Live, the same condition and technically the same curiosity is repeated repeatedly and it is in the theorem: 'Sex is a very, very interesting thing.' These ideas may be more suitable for American movies, so it is no surprise that the movie starts to feel a little bit while watching. <br /> <br /> The movie starts and ends in a similar way, creating a feeling of a round journey; There has been absolutely a round trip that has gone somewhere and absolutely nothing. Three blocks are not sitting around the table. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to the frankly and hateful stories, situations or situations everyone can remember. It is a strange thing that whenever a man is somewhat nasty, other miserstances, but there is a similar dirty story that creates conflicts with this person crossing the line and none of which they do not. Men join Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Krook), two people with Toly (Coleman) whenever the film leaks some other nasty sexual jokes or breaks some extraordinary stories in the third party. They are appointed by Jeremy (Gattis), who has a deep problem and problem with a person, but the issues with which the study is rather more concerned with the exploitation of humor. <br /> <br /> What condition of potato male sex life? For three to four men's crisis and for the film's duration, we will take the role of cruel flying over the walls because we testify how bad they will play in almost a week. If the humor that surrounds Dave and Ferris is annoying and annoying, Jeremy's things are simply surprising. It all starts rather innocently and it appears that the woman he likes and who likes him at the same time, but when Jeremy walks only in a stalker, when the jaws fall. The character of Jeremiah is used and presented in such a way that unexpected love and walking normally only shows 'funny'. Jeremy sat in her apartment while listening to classical songs in her apartment and writing a letter of abuse to Roth (Davis), which made her mind stronger in relation to Hannibal Lecter in 2001, written by Hanib's letter to her letter. But at the moment we tell him completely liars for any sympathy, later, it reveals the true source of their relationship. Suddenly, we were tempted to feel a mad feeling for him as an audience and for the first time he did what he did for any reason, he only feels curious and unexpected. <br /> <br /> In Jeremy's letter he wrote a little or a different, "There is no artistic vision?" Just a big mess. "I hate it when they contain words spoken by characters. Potato men's sex life does not seek special interest in a person's mentality or idol or why they need to go around sexual intercourse as much as possible, it's just ridiculously unfunny Peel over jokes and situations using them as a front, take group sex and open it to someone Instead of exploring how to run it for cheating, it makes a great joke (tickets in numbers!); Sadomasochism than getting into a fan's psychology, the film hanging from a basement ceiling and he warns everyone of 'upcoming salt and vinegar' as climaxes. Ferris fades his face into hatred and the camera fades too much without fuss in the next scene. This is a relief that the film will not have any excuses abroad Kadera to be found. It is part of British culture, the British mentality, I pray that we will be limited to the coast, and accordingly will be ignored.
