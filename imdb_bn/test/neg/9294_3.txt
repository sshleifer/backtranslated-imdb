A very sensitive issue - when the girl leaves her as a child at the age of 15 and who goes to visit her, her disregard continues, she is raped by her mother's lover, she becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth to show this condition. It took too long for truckers to transport the children. (Attractive, this baby's asthma - you do not see him crying - once without me - feeder, the diaper has changed during the whole truck transport pedestal.) I like to see more interconnection, more focus, this girl was not small - it should stand in court immediately . <br /> <br /> And it was a true event! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I rent this from the library. Only later did I find it was made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Oh!
