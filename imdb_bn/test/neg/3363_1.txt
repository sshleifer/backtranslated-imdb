Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Why? 1) beyond authoritative ridiculous 2) disrespectful things do not even go to the foot! 3) Anti-fridge (first film) after it is completely submerged 4) Get it ... it travels all the way to the tropical island across the sea of ​​salt water, which was the first to take revenge on Safe Water. Movies. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I'm still drunk enough to see "Mink Dead Man", so like this writing, Jack Frost 2 sometimes keeps the difference between a stupid "horror" movie. Even beyond the predicament of its predecessor (if you can believe that!).
