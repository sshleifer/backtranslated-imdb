The problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile the film within 2 hours in 6 hours. The results are clear. It seems very stressed, unclear and very easy to think. <br /> <br /> The only plus pass starts. This is why and how well the Hercules is born. The rest of the movie was just ... It could be a great movie such as LOTR if it is not forced in just 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The actress is not very confident. All right is not bad But most of them are. Special effects were stupid and made ten years ago (though the first giant is quite good), I give it 4 in ten for the reasons mentioned above.
