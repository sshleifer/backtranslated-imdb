I happened to catch this movie on TV late in the night. I saw the opening credit and this looks good. Well I was very wrong. Although it was not very bad (it was some fun and flexible moments) it had no feeling of getting together. <br /> <br /> As soon as her husband surrendered to her, she started very well with Kathy Betterscher. His singer idol was murdered. But Cathy has played so well before these unhappy women - think of fried green tomatoes. The problem was not Cathy, it was a place that was unknown to the whole script. It was the authors wondering what we would do next. This script is very surprised. <br /> <br /> Some people who posted a comment on this movie wondered why it did not get a cinematic release. I think the main reason to avoid disappointment and critics have killed it. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the little girl that played Maudi was stunning and stole the movie, without mentioning how beautiful she was.
