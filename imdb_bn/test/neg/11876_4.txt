After publishing an international gang of weapon traders in Bucharest, Agent Sonny Griffith (Wesley Snipps) is appointed to protect Roman Nadia Cumminsky (Silvia Caloca) of Romanian Mafia an accountant. However, the CIA is broken by safe cell criminals, and Sonni can understand that the information agency has leaked from inside. Alone, only his friend Michael Sheppard (William Hope) believes that Sony fights for survival and protection from the city. <br /> <br /> In the career of Wesley Snipps breathing. I just saw this glimpse, and this is another disappointing movie of this actor, whose career is currently similar to Steven Segel's one. The film has involved a lot of explosions, shots and car charging in a horror story and awesome acting. First, Afro-American Wesley Snipes had been behind by the police in Bucharest, but they never found black American people. I was not in Romania, but I believe there are not many Afro-Americans in this country. His character does not like to bathe in the same clothes for a long time. There is no chemistry between Sony and Sexy Silvia Kaloka, but she is freely sexually, loves her and shares her fate with him. Nadia plays the boy, the boy is horrific. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O detonador" ("The Detonator")
