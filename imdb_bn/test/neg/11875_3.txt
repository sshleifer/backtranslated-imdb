Contrary to some reviews written here, I did not hate this movie. This is a movie that can be much better than this. Not the Oscar stuff, but it's a lot better than that. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was good and through the line. Imagine, this movie was badly written. AND TERRIBLY DIRECTED AND PRODUCTION. I mean, how irrelevant Flashback can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the order of open order? It seems that the producer (SA) has seen American beauty several times and thought that I would use it in an action movie! I was not playing badly in the movie. Wesley Snipes did a creditable job, he ran afoul just some bad aspects. And once the film hits the production room, things get worse. The main actress, I think, was the same problem. There was some doubt in the other acting, yes, but it was a low budget flick. Again, I would say it is the job of selecting the director and correcting it. <br /> <br /> As a complete recommendation I agree with the first review that I can not see this movie. Or maybe it's great to see if you're a movie student and want to see what to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and appreciate it.
