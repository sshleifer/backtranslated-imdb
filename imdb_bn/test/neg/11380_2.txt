First of all, I personally worship the Demons and Demon 2, although I saw them in Russia, it was difficult to find good horror in Russian without distributing a good official movie, and it is an irreversible part of my childhood. Then I did not hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw his ghost son. Well, that's not good! Why was the leading character, at least we did not know at least like him, accidentally in the middle of the empty street? Why do African employees say so stupid and stupid things about human spirit? Why is the plot so primitive? We have not seen enough ghosts to produce movies for 100 years? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us so far. It's insulting.
