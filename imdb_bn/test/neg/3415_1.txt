This movie will not take time to keep the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudicoff and Lisa Howard love two monsters hunter, but they are total opposition. He is aspiring and organized, when he is kept behind and burst completely scatter. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the bad guys are chasing Jersey Bellini (character of Dudikoff). It's bad dogfood impressions, ridiculous war scenery doors and Tony Curtis I have seen that the most impressive looking people are sitting! The end is mostly ... The incredible scene I've seen in a movie for quite some time. I believe the terminator, even the matrix, is more likely to be true than this end! This movie just reacts to the Sighta. The script is completely ridiculous. Yet, green pieces were given to create this piece of piece and were left unexpectedly released to the public. I have seen this movie with a lot of people who betrayed everyone. None of the group could say anything good about the movie, it was over.
