This is a candidate for the worst movie I've ever seen. Such as "the silence of the lamb" wanted to be like that, but before that there is no style or intelligence. Make-up is wonderful, the performance is good, but the story continues for years, and the murders are so horrific that they are more annoying than entertainment.
