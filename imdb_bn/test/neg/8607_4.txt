Potato men's sex life is about the sex life of several men involved in the supply of potatoes. So there is no surprise there. It's actually, much more than what you can expect from the title: That is, it's a playful comedy involving sex and potato men. Sometimes the film works. It is a painful, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some of the most unimportant and average men in different kinds of problems with women. Where the film does not work clearly and why it fails at the box office, that is, curly, uncomfortable parts are probably too shady and uncomfortable. Instead of postponing a person's view of a person masturbating on another person from the roof of his wife while loving his wife, I think most of us are very weirdly scared and we wonder how Andy Humphrey is thinking. Well, maybe we see that he is clearly thinking about everything.
