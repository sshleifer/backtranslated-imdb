OK! A science-fire / horror / verb B-hybrid directed by Jim Wintersk and in the final scenes, we have seen a cyborg which is a default metal head that is closed by more than one person! Like any Winroski-flick, he drops in the whole bunch of crazy ideas and mistresses which can not reach anywhere in most places. But "Storm Trupper" is a kind of two-movie-price-pricing. On one hand, we got the part of the drama / thriller (as the film opens) with his carol owl, his incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband is killed (a plot that does not come anywhere). And on the other side, we got the 'Cyborg run away' section of the remix, "living dead of night" -style. Carroll and the cyborg are trying to break into the house and break the special OPs / Monsters Hunter's horse. Not saying there is not this flick with great. Zach Galgine ("Grailines" -famples) is particularly painful, and Corrie Feldman (a small supporting role) is completely lost in this movie. Wynorski even rips off a movie of his own, I'm 99% sure to use some stock footage in his previous film "976 EVIL II" (scene with explosive truck and motorcycle). Yes, it's not very good and it's a lot of fun. This is strictly for Wynorski-fans only. And I'm one of them, if you already know.
