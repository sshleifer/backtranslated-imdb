Very interesting to be very interesting, to be very attractive and to be very interesting to be photographed silently is a fascinating idea destroyed by making MR really a really bad movie. A Russ Russell film thinks of the movie's rescheduling day in its worst times or by amateur people, M.R. Lonely has some papers script (a script, you see) and feel good idea about a free holiday somewhere, but ultimately we have a widescreen film that seems to have been made by the students whose parents told them what they did It's all a brilliant creation. Or did I get the right to film producer? MR Lonely is trying to waste resources, (Goud!) Quirky and deliberately closing the killer. It is boring and ungrateful to the end .. and pointless. What is a commune going to Scotland? What is a stupid idea about Hollywood illusion about this film. Perhaps the Qur'an wanted to resurrect Allah's Messenger ... good fruits Allah. There are some sub-plots like the residue of Fitzgerald, including Oh and Winzer Herzeg, not a single plane. Add Slo-mo Drifting and Ventilation Music Add all the nasty and annoying, James Fox who thinks he can be seen as brave (PERFORMANCE) and the result is the Amphitamin Fantasie alphabet soup in the widescreen. It was fun in the film but the result on screen is a mess. Imagine the food poisonous American PI band camp.
