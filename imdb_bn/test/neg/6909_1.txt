My boyfriend and I heard on the radio that the film decided to see that it was a good film, even with "cars" there too. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was scared. Initially, the cow, which was to be a woman, was male voice. Then I realized they're really supposed to say. I put aside transvestite cows and tried to see the movie with an open mind, but it was so funny that I could not help but suppress my head. Probably almost ten times I've checked once to see my phone. The plot was not honest, if not predictable, but it took a long time to reach its point. I was having trouble sitting through it, and I'm 19 years old. The children of the theater really stood up and headed towards the bottom. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the movie is that the beverage reference was loaded, it is not mentioned that the cows / shrubs were actually hot and steal a car, then drank and were running, the boy entered the house to push him from the bed (he Although it was deserved), then escaped from the police, whose photo authors look like terrible people. This is not the kind of thing I want my kids to be exposed to. There are many ways in the real world, if my child drinks and runs cars and drives the police backwards, I'll put 10pm bad news in front of them. The kids are supposed to escape from the reality of the movie, not a turn in laugh. What happened to the good lasting used in good morality and child cinema proud? That's why Disney's old movies, such as Beauty and the Beast, Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid etc. are classic. If you want to see a great cartoon with the same plot as your kids basically "Bernard", then hire "Lion King". You can get a great story without being overwhelming drinks and driving and Grand Theft Auto Reference. The writer of "Bernard" was apparently trying to keep up the great trend of creating a child movie, which could also enjoy a parent, but they did it in a very bad taste. I will never take my kids to see it, and I recommend you save money and see something else.
