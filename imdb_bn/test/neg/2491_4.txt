This movie is a definitive 5. I finally caught it on HBO the other night. While coming out of the theater, it seemed to me that it would never hit because Americans did not want movies about history, especially movies that were more than ideas. I do not know why FMBB did a good job, but now, to the end, I have seen it, I can add some of my own observations. <br /> <br /> First, Diet Schletz has been fined between Star Trek and A-Team, he has been stopped as the lead of this movie. I kept hoping to shout like John Lovitz, "I ACT-ING!" He was speaking vocabulary and vowel so that he could be very ACT-OR, at a stage where he was curiously emphasized in different words and phrases. Second, I enjoyed the fascinating positioning of Paul Newman's character, since, every time, these cats (the scientist) tried to escape with their goal. <br /> <br /> Third, there was some discussion about the moral implications of creating a bomb, and whether the United States should use it. Perhaps it is not enough, or deeply considered as. Finally, it seemed a terrible thing to throw for a dramatic effect. I do not know how many incidents of this movie are true for life, but in their chain there was a test bomb slip or lab accident (and consequently, a scientist killed) due to a fabulous coffee cup. Expand the boundaries of credibility. Perhaps the material, or events that were similar, really happened, but different scenes seem to have been fully associated with the dramatic effect, which reduces the full tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. It should actually be read more about the actual events to know whether the above or just the most was right.
