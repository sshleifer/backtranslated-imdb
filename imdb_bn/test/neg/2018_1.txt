Dracula 3000 satirical movie is impressive. To get to go, I thought I was pretty nasty something. What can be expected with a Cast Line of Caspar Van Deeven, Erica Elianak, Kulio and Tini Lister? Well, let's just say that the expectations have torn ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I think this review will run for ages, so we're going to keep this simple. Vampires are not even called Dracula. The space crew carries the coffin from the carpathian sector of the transistor system. In his bigger view, Kulio speaks of the most horrible things in the history of the film. Every year, 3000 people wear bad clothes by today's standards, they do not have much more than their modern wheelchairs and they are equipped with neon lights that appear to be stolen from roller rink. <br /> <br /> It's all closed ... end. Sweet loving God It does not deserve to be destroyed. It must be Sen to believe. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie "1" and I hope I can give it a blank ... but I'm forced to force you to see it. What is this crazyness?
