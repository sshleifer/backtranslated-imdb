***** SPINNER ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awesome. This woman cheated her employers from the beginning and then self-interest income separately. Finally, you see him doing his job outside the business that he had learned from his "student" father. Governess does not really seem to teach something to the child because I keep students in quote. He thinks he hates him and can not stand near him. I apologized for the little girl, who just preferred to go, was absent, realized that he would say something to attract attention, but the audience would not have to sympathize with the little girl, the viewer was supposed to hate his student and hijack his employer. To be sympathetic with pride and deceit. I just could not do it. This was not the story of a spontaneous woman, but it was a window in a mind that used to use every opportunity without any other thought outside of her family. I can not tolerate seriousness! This was a really awesome movie. I just gave one dollar to rent, but it was too much!
