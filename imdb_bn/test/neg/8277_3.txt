This movie was mere, slow, plodding torture. Not to be a fan of Slashar films, and to choose the classic horror, I can not be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy this as a primary entry in the slasher section. I really like 90 minutes to see this back. The only reason to see it is 1) A young Vana White (pre-cuticle pre-wheel) whose screen is about 3 minutes. 2) Early roles as Queen Victoria's Queen Linna Quigley (with nudity) and EJ Peaker's school secretary of legendary beauty, who added humor and sexual appeal. Otherwise, Fellini creates a look of a band of 80's, which is interesting, when it drags along a very long path. Just like a movie ... I had to check how long I had left and could not wait for a "good" in the film.
