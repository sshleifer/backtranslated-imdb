I saw this movie a few years ago, and people do not want to go golf again. I mean ninja definitely have no respect for the game of golf or its development. And I'm not talking about "hunting" stuff like forging a scorecard No, based on what I saw here, they cruelly killed police clubs and golfers on the basis of a similarly holy country club. Judge Smiles will be spinning in his grave. And are they repentant for sin? No, based on what I saw here, a killer usually responded by Nenja to take the female body of a buxom female telephone repair and seek revenge. After hearing this morality this morally reprehensible and do not need to say, I just stopped golfing and stopped talking on the telephone, but decided to stop eating homeless food.
