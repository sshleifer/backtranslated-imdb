I saw 40 minutes and could not bear it any longer? Television stopped and I returned for some light reading "Lobotomy at the beginning". <br /> <br /> It was difficult to say which aspect of this project was most dissatisfied - the conversation is completely by sound bite or number of plays. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine the time of the play being played. Lord Nelson and slavery had references, but Admood was the only actor in the Clark-to-be played by Black Ritson who could live in the early 19th century. Other bright-looking things made of fancy clothes in the 21st Century make-up and dresses were more suitable - Pure-blonde Fanny, Billy Piper's least credible character. <br /> <br /> The UK's commercial television probably makes a good story of bosoms, lip lips and deep meaningful beauty. Luckily Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to know the story of Mansfield Park, then buy the 1983 Mini Series DVD.
