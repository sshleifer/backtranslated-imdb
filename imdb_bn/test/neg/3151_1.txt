Barney and friends probably have seen the worst kids that I have ever seen. It does not teach kids anything, the songs are dry, it is not educational and the letters are only slightly excited. I do not agree with those who hate shock. Frankly, I've seen more negative than this for a positive review for this show. 75% reviews are negative and some really mature people have. There are no educational standards or age-appropriate educational material in this show. The reasons for why I dislike this shot are due to violent plots, Chess dialogs, horrific special effects, and unreal story lines. Besides, it says that you are sad if you eat junk food and your stranger is your friend. Yale researcher Doreith and Jerome Cigar did not say that a "prisakul should be televised", saying. They are not what they are talking about. I would not recommend anyone Barney For some reason why children keep on crying or junk addiction, because this show is toxic to the children everywhere. For people (parents / kids) who really want to find the precocative meters, go to Nick Jr. and "super why!" See. Instead. It was much better than this Turkish and five TVs, once it was nervous to keep it in "roots of milk" but with gratitude closed it. I highly recommend everyone to keep away from this show. Parents, I advise you to keep your kids away from this show as much as possible. They thank you later. <br /> <br /> Button Line: Do not waste your precious time with this stupid show. It is Utter Garbage. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid like plugs! Thanks for reading <br /> <br />
