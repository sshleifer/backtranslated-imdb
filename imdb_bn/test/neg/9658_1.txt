This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation that I can think of for better reviews obtained from some of the here is that they were written by the cast people. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandson (6-13 years old) can not bear to see it. As far as I know, this movie did not create it in the theater and for good reason. It seems as if some people were eating a beer and said, "Hey, make a movie, who wants to stay in it?" It's that bad. In addition to Lou Peri, who was in a small part of the film, I did not recognize another actor. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case. I like Sandlot (I) and generally I like stupid and stupid movies, but this movie does not have a single release quality. The people who wrote it, there is no short story about what their children are thinking, talking or acting, and the movie is a fun funny line and a confusing mess of fools jokes. I rarely write negative reviews but the worst movie I ever seen from the Man of the Best Friend and it is definitely one of the ten bad films of my life. If you rent it, remember that I warn you. Indeed, some people have actually marked the film as a bad comment about their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerated.
