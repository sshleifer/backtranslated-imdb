I hope this picture went full. I was thinking of being so capable and ridiculous actor under Sir Ben's leadership that it was going to be a little treat. <br /> <br /> How do I think the credits appear in my eyes? I have cleared this picture in 93 minutes of my life which is clearly the DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and it will probably be easy to list them; 1. No joke, I'm not particularly difficult to please at least or fewer curiosity - but no one smiles on this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Bain mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk? 3. There is no effort to start a relationship between such a love interest. 2 people randomly bumping into each other in the streets will be rapport immediately. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talents that are merged are completely destroyed. Names will not be fooled by the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold ass-hit man, he drowned more people than wasting Gandhi's time (on one side Diad's Diary Looks A Vague Look) I hope that it slowly starts to slowly but slowly but slowly No life - and justice - in this, Frank pulling out his 9 and starting with tea and finishing with the full nic Pay off - sorry it was bad.
