This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still trying to get over it was bad. This is not great because it's connected to the gardard name. There is absolutely no idea that we have seen a tremendous long shot of traffic jams, which are not surprising, unbelievable or sort of. If this long shot of traffic jam continues, you probably feel like creating more pastry sandwiches rather than seeing it. An inferred story, silly, stupid characters piece. What are we supposed to take from this message? It offers nothing and offers no purpose. These ruthless, dust chain-smokers are proud of the arrogance shown to the French people, and they roam around and roam around and then passed as industrial.
