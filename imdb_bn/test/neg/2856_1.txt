.... you get a stupid excuse to play rip off a kids! People, what they thought? First they mess with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make a shit like this. Ferry Tail Walk! Good to be honest, I saw it as a kid, and it got me a little bit scared, because I was of the opinion that Pinocio would not do it, Wah Wah wa. But I grew up and tried to play the baby's play rip, a fairy tale about miracles, a lam tile from the crypt episode, or at least one, it was a fool that was stupid and it was a lot of intrigue, and I still do not understand how It has come to life. Was it an evil Geppetto job? Then, after some bad deeds, did he become the real son of America who was most wanted? Personally, I think an evil Gappatto sounds better, he has created an army of wood killers and started a criminal wave, funny. But this horror, horror, horror, horror, horrible! Awful, terrifying! Stinky like a shoe, and terrible! IT was blurred! If you want killer dolls, standing for slaughtered dolls, especially the children's play, instead, no strings attached. Or if you want to make an image of a fairy tale upside down, see Leprechtoon, or see if you like Pinocchi, see the animated version of Dissaton, or see live version instead of Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
