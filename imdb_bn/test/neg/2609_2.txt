As a kid, I never realized why anyone would see this very painful show. It was quite stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to get the fatal accidents (they were annoying). <br /> <br /> Now, about 40 years later, there is a new attitude about me cartoon. Although I still had complete shit in it, the American version of this show is only about me. Because I was reading a book about anime and I saw that the events we saw were different from being shown mainly in Japan. You see, the soldiers thought to syndicate the series that it was very violent so they cut it off the episodes. It's bad enough, but what they did was out of the belief - they actually cut off the episodes, and to create a show that split them together, there was nothing like the values! For example, one episode can be part of episode 3, 6, 18 and 27 episodes! As a result, I do not know whether the actual show is actually bad - it can be great. But who can we consider to see all these Americanised mess?
