I saw this out of curiosity. I enjoyed the Stargate SG1 and saw many other TV shows and movies which have been the main characters. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much, so I was surprised by the surprise and amazed. <br /> <br /> Life is impossible to perform, and scripts are bad. <br /> <br /> Zero Review is bad film that is based on film or martial arts (which includes many cast members in the whole film, despite having no martial arts training in particular)) Training makes the incredible plot even less credible . The same weapon (carried by Michael Shanks), when fired by a mountain, it is a cause of extreme damage, but when the cane creates a shot inside the wall, creating small fireworks without damaging the harmful structure - all right, I found at Stint SG1 at Michael Starks SG1 that the stuffgate weapon creates a surface on the main character, or one of the walls of the castle wall T-hole blasts), but still ... a bad CGI snake 'devils' can eat as a dog, eating a trusted person does not behave just like him. <br /> <br /> The basic foundation of an Amazonian warrior on a distant planet is good. Matricultural societies have always been formed based on the lack of understanding that men are required for the promotion of species - for example, Pix, which did not illustrate the role of men in the sex-breeding process until the ninth century - at any time, the power balance was removed from women. They carry technical weapons and show some knowledge of science - especially medicine, so the idea that a matrilineal society can exist with this level of scientific knowledge, is based on the original dream's wet dream. Of course, some of the science radio science produced in this movie show that the author did not know anything about it (besides some keywords he has heard in other movies). Even so, it can be better - for example, in 1965, like 'She', which shows the mother tongue, with a certain respect, a lot more reliably, even after 45 years, it shows stupidity in this urinary tract. 'To beat some women around the armor, to walk aggressively and to expose their lines like a kid looking for a nightclub war ("Come! I will!" Style), it seems like the complexity of a matriarchal culture <br /> <br /> Cultural references are so easy - 'Mother Mother's All Hill' mostly sums it all up. Even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variations. <br /> <br /> There is nothing cute, thought-provoking, interesting, exciting, exciting, or entertaining about this movie. Soundtrack same quality <br /> <br /> I can only assume that some of the highly received charity positive reviews of this movie have come from Fan Shank's fans who have to put finger on anything they are involved in. Do not be fooled. Less budgets are not the reasons for the failure of a movie - Cheap B movies can be bright. This is not one of them and there is no reason to bring this movie on itself.
