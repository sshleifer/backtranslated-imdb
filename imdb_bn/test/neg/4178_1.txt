If you are looking for a summer-like injury, Dark Harvest 2 might be your ticket. The production values ​​of this movie are extremely high (it has been edited with Sony H & O, and edited using Ivy), especially sound effects - they make direct words from the "Spooky Halloween Sound" CD! Scarecrow from the cover, though he does not appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance, terribly realistic! From the beginning to the end, you will see a man that he searches for his girls, to kill, to mood! At the end of the movie, you will see, well ... you will see for yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say here is 1000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be a "good-natured 2" fun camp but it's not. I screamed after watching this movie, because I realized I spent money on it (and I spent 4 dollars to rent it). I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and knew what was still happening.
