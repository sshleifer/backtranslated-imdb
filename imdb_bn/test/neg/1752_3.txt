Some movies are not for everyone. The exact description of Egmaar Bergman's film, Scamman (Shame). At the age of 18, I still think you can call a small size ADD and good, I look for movies to entertain. Shame was a film with a very interesting determination, while trying to express the impact of war on the general public, it was very rare for me to accomplish this. I did not know whether it was subtitles, black and white filming, length of film, or two hours of my research, but I did not enjoy it. I understand that this seems to be very important in a great film and film history, but I think my teacher has been instructed that everyone likes or dislikes it. I just wish to end it all in many side plots. Maybe the translation has lost something, but I felt that the infinite little shot was closed, which never reached the conclusion. You will not have to fill the characters and see them again, or why they were really involved in the movie. My overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth watching, but it's just to make your own opinion. If you do not like it or do not like it, it should be respected to the point that it is trying to publish.
