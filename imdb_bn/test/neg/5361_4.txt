The event had to be removed and traditionally relied heavily on wonderful cuts (when it came back from commercial, the term was something like "astonishing" mouse), it is a pure rip off of Ghost Hunters and it is "out of them", and unfortunately fails. Also, what's with the manager log thing? Track this star? It only destroys the novelty of this show, which quickly closes. The only reason to see it is that the pure climate wants to laugh at nature. They do not find anything, and probably probably will not be. Funly enough, what they always point to some things that "hunting" thing and guess ?! This is the radio station of the local radio station which is red in the light!
