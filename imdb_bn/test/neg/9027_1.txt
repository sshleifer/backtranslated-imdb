Vicente Aranda has created a terrible historical movie. It shows the poor wealth of the Spanish movie. In the movie, a scandalous script junkie just seems to be Niffmanius, facing Felip, only worried about sex ... but there is no sexual relationship with her. Begins with a technical wrong wedding ring that shows Casey Isabellel - did anyone notice? -. Then, as the voice of the documentary, actor and actress, the film sometimes comes to the laugh-junior council when he keeps track of the order when he wants to be isolated; When the castle is nearly broken at the age of the movie they recently created, the crowd is just "four" people, the lights are bad ... relatively French movies with Amelie Pollin ... talk about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
