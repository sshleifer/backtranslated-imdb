Debra Wingner's 1987 "Black Widow" is a lot better. <br /> <br /> This is like a fur version, and Jane Kemu generally performs well. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen too bad. Just playing his normal role as a boring rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Probably both are Dr. Quinn wanted to get us excited. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> grab a copy of "black widow"
