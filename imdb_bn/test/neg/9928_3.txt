... you can easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the purpose? The details of murder are used, but do not explain. I guess I got too much in the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There are no threads to follow. If I used to work properly, the film would have been for a long time, but at least it would have been worth it for me. <br /> <br /> Casting is very good, I love Wilson, weaker Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not saying. But I'm really willing to have a little more focus on they're less obvious. <br /> <br />
