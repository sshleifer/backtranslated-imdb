This was something I was looking forward to seeing. Both Ultimate Avenger movies exceeded my expectations and Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters because I thought that this same production team could really do some great things with Iron Man's single title. But the final film was dissatisfied. I'm not hoping to spend most of the movie to pay tribute to Iron Man's gray armor. The red and gold armor are probably seen together for ten or so minutes. Not a major complaint but from the ads and boxes I expected. But the bad thing was that monsters and iron man armor for story, acting and cell-sadded CGI animations, which were not believable. It did not mix well with cell animation. Even it seems to stick on himself and become lifeless. The stress of Tony Stark's character, as it seems incredibly slow, is so obliging and unconvincing. I wanted to watch this movie because I love Iron Man but after strengthening myself through the film, I am surprised that they could bring something good like Ultimate Avengers movies.
