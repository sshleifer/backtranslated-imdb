The terrible, annoying Junkie Siegel is a little better than the only awesome movie in the world. It is made up of a group of soldiers in search of a specific type of blood going to a zombie patient college campus, which can help in the treatment of infection. These soldiers kill your common lamb and none of them is drawn (or at least not very interesting) so that you do not feel sad in your belly hole when you are disposed. This movie usually pierces people and blood separators. It even has the same munching on guts. It's not something for zombie genre to just give memories. And, the climax of the story is rather anti-climatic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people in a Jummy army will be able to sink and will not be able to get a bit (because they seem to be the main star that always shows the ability to escape) and others seem easy to read easily. The only motivation for the film is not to show people a bit or nothing. Just visit a Romero film watch for permanent effect.
