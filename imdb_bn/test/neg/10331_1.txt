Big Hollywood starlet Sandra Bullock's acting debut in the future is remarkable, this ridiculous activity is so much in the hole that anyone can easily suspect harmful misery. The story is noticeable and very badly thought. Manufacturing cheese cheese stink Indeed, the total deterioration of the production price may be good ... At least the movie might look like this. ADR is ridiculously bad and presently available in the film. Controversial about whether any conversation track has been used in the actual shoot. <br /> <br /> In most cases, there are several exceptions, though there are some exceptions. However, performance in the exceptions is that the directors provide poor direction and sometimes make them completely cruel to the character. (That is, going out of passive to get the eyes out of the character is bad direction.) Also, the constant "impact of the sound of the arms" (magazines being loaded, the slide being the cock etc.) is completely overloaded and, sync with the full screen action. This sticky "Bad Guy" voice distortion for the main villain (mainly because you know he is a villain in this film), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situation goes beyond the quality of the movie "suspension of unbelief" and become straightforward ridiculous. A lead character spends a good portion of the film tied on a chair before deciding to use his shiny pieces to free himself. So, my question is ... Why did not he hurry, and why did he do butterfly knife? He was not searching? Right This 90-minute package is one of the few examples of wildly ridiculous situations in any way. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> If this is never available on DVD for the next success of Sandra Bullock. But it is there, so my only advice is clear. Actually your IQ may be damaged to see this image.
