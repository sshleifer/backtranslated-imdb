First of all, I should say that I saw the '39 version at least 100 times; Learn all the conversations, and read the game '36, which is separate from '39 'and has its own gold naggut. This version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery. You have not seen TV advertising expensive campaigns for this. According to the Entertainment Weekend, Bening hates the voice of the original and how women spend each other full of war. Whats up ?? That was the intention of the booth. It's a chic, dramatic throat, adultery, and well-heated Manhattan socialist pick-up in a set. This new version was created that there was no purpose to honor the main source material of the crowd. They curiously chose it, half view here, and half of the scenes from the first version. Bate Miller (which works only in a few scenes and in a broad, grinning style, the old countess works) There is no reference in this version. He said "Buck," which is the original element - then he did not mention it again. This movie is so neutral that I'm not going to analyze over, but here are some of the things that I think are incredible:> Mary Henes is proud of her house staff: "I can cram nails out of a board!" Right Great writing Norma Shearer could read a line and earned an Oscar nomination, right? > A compromise Silvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Benning found what he got, and the film just dried up. Claire Booth used Syllya to cross the game with a comic engine. As portrayed neatly by Rosalind Russell, she is still classical and quoted that a senseless, stupid woman rattled off those small, ridiculous, unreasonable reams of dialogue. He was not above the pouting of Paulette Gordard's heel. 2008 filmmakers wanted to kill this character Kill him, they kill the movie.
