This movie finds out everything. Well, depending on what you're looking for ... it could be 10 or 1 on the scale. This movie is in its own league .. I do not think any film that might be closer to it. I'm not sure how the director intended to create it .. a thriller or a comedy. If he thinks he is making a thriller, his fate is a stroke, which has created one of the best Bowievidades of all time. You have to believe it. A Matrix + Terminator + Rolling on one of the other movies, with a storyline with Hindi films of the 1980s, a mehdhadhari nag (a mythological snake that can become a human) <br /> <br /> This is an ideal film, If you sit together with a bunch of friends with alcohol, plan to laugh in the movie! I'm not sure whether it will pay 1 or 10. I decided to give it 1 on a currency flipping!
