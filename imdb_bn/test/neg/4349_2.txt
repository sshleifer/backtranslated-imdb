I and my brother are very big Asian film fans, so when this movie was hidden in a shop, I bought the DVD because it was very committed and I could not wait to see it. So I saw this photo with my brother and I must say, at the beginning it was very committed. Both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I guess that was all that. There are some interesting fights, but it is not an action movie, it is claimed. Instead of playing it at the very top with a love movie ... love clich√©, even Shakespeare will vomit this title. Sorry for my language. By the way: Characters being sorted out of the street and given 100? <br /> <br /> Well, I and my brother finally saw it because we thought it could be better. But, hack, it's not. This movie has challenged the # 1 on "Me and my brothers" # that any bad movie ever seen ", just follow" Fantasy Mission Force "- see also.
