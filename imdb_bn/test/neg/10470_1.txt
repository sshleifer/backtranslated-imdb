Sister Eater Alabama is set in a small desert town where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing a huge resort building. One night, three of his workers relay (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rye) are digging the grounds in the desert when they see Tomhawk as the ax, unfortunately, they come along with an ancient Native American monster bone eater and kill them. . Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Buxlettner) is soon breathing his throat because his support has been stopped, Sheriff Yance has to deal with the harmful monster of the bone because it kills any person .... <br /> <br /> You know That I consider myself a horror and a big fan of science, I certainly do not think that my opinion is more than anyone else Ulyabana (IMDb, like many here, ...) If, when I say Be Be Be Be Be Be Be Be Be big site fee, channel kriyaracara feature, and it's something I never saw fierce competition against the strong. There are two names as a horror and a science-fan fan that when a film is involved, the sheds below my backbone send them to the expectation of how bad they are, these names are not Jesus's talents, 'Frank', who does not have anything to do with sister Eater and Jim Wynnsky who conducted the disaster of the bitter eater. Actually sister Eater is so bad that Winnerski was hiding under Bob Robertson's name, when a bad director named Vinrsky is hiding behind the pseudonym, you know that the film might be bad. Where do I start? Sister Eater The worst movie I have seen this year, and this is untrue, the story is horrifying, the script has been lost (at one point, Sheriff Evans told Shiehf Evans to meet him at the hospital but later he met there, doing wonderful work and saying, 'You are here What are you doing? 'At one point, Sheriff Evans wins the claim that we are in the 20th century and that ancient Native American Even though we are now in the twentieth century, a part of a woman said in the story of Flashback that three people awoke in the bone eater and killed them, but since it killed three, how did it know to others that it could be a legend? ?) And sometimes it's a little bit embarrassing. The character is a terrific clich√©s, small city sheriff, who keeps the day, her personal personal involvement involving the daughter, and an old wise man for the local Americans, a young hot head who hates the 'white man' and a young woman Storm Cloud and Black Hawk Who is the voice of someone between the two names? The picture is annoying like hell, nothing is happening, the story is horrific, it is a logic of intrigue and laptop filling, set pieces terrible, no terrible or secret or mystery or mystery and bone meal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> A selection of bones stuck together in a motorcycle that has jumped into a big trap near a terrible CGI truck, causing a bone hole A is going to leak on one side. Whenever a bone eater needs to reach some speed, he comes out of a big horse sand and dust and runs it! Basically this is actually quite a good idea but it looks terrible and even the soundtracks have soundtracks of Chess Cowboy music! Sheriff Evans cuts his own hands (why?) And sheds blood, but it does not have a drop of blood, but in addition to which there is no drop of blood, whenever a person dies by eating bones, they usually disappear, dust clouds, annoying The frantic climate is being heard in Sheriff Evans and bone fraternity, Sheriff Yance has been made a horse with tribal war paint from her face, even though bone voters carry her dust horse and it is not right to describe them as one of the competing joshing contests. <br /> <br /> With the estimated budget of about $ 700,000, the bitter bricks are depicted in a beautiful, forgotten and flat way, the style here has no meaning. Most of the film takes place on the bright sunglasses and if you look at it in a beautiful television, the desert scene is quite beautiful on the occasion. Here some of the most experienced 'known' actors have really diminished, Boxlitner plays the same role as the same theme, but many good 'Animal Characteristics' Snapehead Terra (2004), William Cat will obviously keep his name up to any cuff, former Star Trek Man Walter Koining Be truly frustrated to agree with appearing inside. <br /> <br /> You can not say anything else about the bone brasseru really "breathtaking properties" The worst movie that appeared on the Sci-Fi channel is saying something else, is not it?
