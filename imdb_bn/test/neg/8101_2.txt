I probably have to blame myself? But I'm sure that the hell is going to be the much-awaited and secretive WWII conspiracy, nazi plastic surgeon and revenge by the title of the title "Black Dragon". This image is a dull failure with a unique framework. The real plot (which is basically rather impressive and curious) becomes clear only when an interpretation is made at the end, but the problem is that you have been taking care a long time ago. We see how badly American entrepreneurs of Lugosi enters the society and kill them one after the other. The story is OK before WWII and ?? Especially after the last witness? It must be a court of great potential, so it is shameful that it is not more accurately described. But one great dialogue that I can not prevent fate! Men per woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So can I kill you ?? This is the only way you will leave this place!" This is the only highlight of an overall very annoying movie. What is lugosi beautiful? Usually ?? But its wonderful performance alone is worth buying this film. If you are interested in seeing other disgusting performances with her (in other fantastic art exhibitions), see "Invisible Ghost", "The Corps Varnishes", "White Zombie" and of course the 1931 Dracula version.
