When time and movies were more children, it was known as "women pictures" and later "dog spots". The plot is just soap opera for women and only those types of appeals will be made. The only appeal for most boys is if they want to see a very thin-faced Mary Tyler Moore in the litrards. (If you are of a certain age like me, it might be enough to look for a look.) Whether or not MTM gave her one of the standard numbers which she gave from the early 70s when she accepted it in the heart that she was America's sweetheart. Christine Lothy gives an unpleasant and unpleasant performance that seems to be the real part of her person and probably appeals to such people. (Sorry, but it seems to be true.) Ted Danson is very young as the MMM's husband and usually does not give a little unclear appeal until his acting partner softens it. And it does not happen here. Alan Barnes wrote and directed and probably got it through because he had worked with Mary before, wrote it as a project, and at the moment he made the juice. It seems to be any other purpose.
