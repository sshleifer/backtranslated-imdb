SUCKS THIS PHOTO !! Looks like they liked to place the scene together at random. Good gore, but a little conspiracy. Sally complains about everything until she is fooled. I figured that I had PMS It sure feels that way. Dubbing this movie is horrible. One scene is talking to women and a few seconds before we hear some audio. I knew at that moment that my doubts were correct that it was not from the United States. I tried to follow along but lost almost half the way through it and even found it very difficult to believe in horror movies. Some good characters, but not many. Do not waste a time at all.
