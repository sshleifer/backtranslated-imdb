I really tried, but this movie just did not work for me. The action scenes were absolute, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were stereotypical to be even fun. Pam graye tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even its notable talent can prevent a disaster. Even by the quality of this weak style, this film is quite bad.
