Here Homer Simpson's IQ range is a fool that guarantees entertainment. It is a clear shot in every superhero superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it does not end; It gets increasingly bad until the slapstick trollop by trucker is split into a kindergarten ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in the plot, you will see only the Spiderman under some heavy narcotic effects. Do you get Dragonfly Man ?? A boy surprised, next to the girl, suddenly inherited some super-powers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is waking up in the morning and expected to brush teeth, but not 'take the word for me! For kids, this is somewhat ridiculous; For adults it's a great movie to drop off for kids.
