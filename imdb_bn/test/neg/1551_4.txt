Cartoon of the 1940s, probably due to the Black Beauty Gaga, probably banned the Duffy black guy as a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story is held in a bookstore where characters come to life every evening of the book. So we, among others, have Ugly Duck (Daffy) and Wallstreet's wolf. After wandering Duffy with a wolf (so heading), they wander back. <br /> <br /> This little cartoon has a chase, nowadays there is no real application. If you are a real fan of Looney Tunes, then just have fun ... I <br /> <br /> 4/10.
