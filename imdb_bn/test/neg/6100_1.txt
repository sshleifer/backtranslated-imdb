This short subject was in the 1942 film "Watts the Matador?", In The Stage's Regarding it, the boys' Mexico and their bullfighting trips. Although the original shortcut of the peak era of Stogus was created, it is not memorable and I believe it is one of the more medieval movies with Kelly Howard. By establishing it, I believe that the "Shiff Bulfighter" is just painful, just like Joe Besar with all the shorts. Bee and Larry never wanted to hire Bessar, because for her chic, Stugge's violent comedy, almost feminine character was completely wrong. Nadir has been shown to Mouri and Larry for his 16th movie team, and shameful to see the shorts. This brief was released in 1959 and was part of the Han Song of Colombia. Maybe Bessar was a nice guy, but he was wrong as a third stog. <br /> <br /> I will not review any other basera shorts because I'm doing the same poorly negative reviews. Do yourself a big favor and do not watch this. Instead, try to catch "sweet pie and pie" or "hui poloie".
