This is a film that really makes me cringe. In 1951, MGM and Lonnie Tones made their best cartoons - with amazing animations, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, by the end of the 40's, a new style of animation began to appear (i.e. "Crusader Rebeat on TV" series) - Animation with very simple artwork to save money. Unfortunately, Colombian photo cynical ploy work !! Many people have taken them instead of hating public hatred (as they should have), and the Oscars (AMPAS) actually rewarded the film for the best animated short-legality of a poor product. Unfortunately, between the dollar and the senses of Hollywood, it soon begins to enter legitimate studio products - which means rather nasty cartoons. Later, it became worse as well as violent animations and backgrounds, and the story was almost intolerable for adult viewing. Classic cartoon cleverness and style gone. And for this tragedy, I blame a little bit, Gerald McKing-Boing - the granddaughter of the cheap cartoon. The story is not bad, but the animation is a horrific event and "Boing-bing" is painful for kids to hear.
