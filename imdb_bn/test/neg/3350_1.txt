For my 21st birthday, I received a copy of this picture, which he clearly lifted from an extracted video bin for 99 gigabytes. <br /> <br /> I would not be so frustrated if watching a movie - it was tiring, Adam West was lost (literally) and, in the background, I could not remember one thing about it. My lack of enjoyment increased so much that the second rolling the credit, we broke the cassette and hung the tape around the living room. For just good measurements, we set the cover fire.
