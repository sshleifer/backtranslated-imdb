<br /> <br /> At first it should be known that this image is "very crying" based on video games, it is a real good game (2004). The second you will know that this is the regisseur great uwe boll of this flick. This is a man who accepts video games (drowning block, bloody, mail etc) and produces movies from them (very awful thing ....) <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw the ball's "King's Swords: A Dark Side Siege Tail". There was such a terrible mistake in this movie (like 3 scenes at the same time, 2 at the same time, night and night .......... <br /> <br /> So let's "cry bitterly". If you hope to work quietly, forget it, really cheaper strategies and a plastic helicopter is far from real action.If you expect a cool story, forget it. Orienting by the story swap stories, this movie is a smiley. Movietic It makes fun, but no better. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie for free, so do not make mistakes and do not pay for this trash. One of my favorite flicks for the bottom 100 !!! !
