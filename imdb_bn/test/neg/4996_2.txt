Do not be confused. This is not a zombie movie. Take it from a person who loves zombie films and who pays them all: good, and terrible Yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it is basically an arts-Persian exercise in existential fear, which is a long way to say it boring. If you have worked hard all day long and want to spend a few hours, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Due to depression" has special effects, moderate acting and continuous dialogue. These are all understood in an indie, low-budget movie, and as long as I am able to forgive a entertaining story to tell a movie. Unfortunately, there are very few stories in "survival". Moreover, acting is not funny, not existent All actors seem to be studying Buster Keaton School facing the woods. Will they be killed to show some emotions? (And not, yelling is not equal with emoting). Actually there was a character that had some Pizas first closed. Accepted, there was another character who briefly interested me. He watched and played Kyle McLachlan running Norman Bates channel, but it's too late. <br /> <br /> Picture makers forgot a small detail: The film is a visual medium. That means that to see what is visible for the viewer, stirred in your view. And those artistic jump cuts and close ups may look great at that time, but what they did was making the film Zardari and confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in simple, clean fashion - see George Romero's lower-budget "Living Dead of Night" how it works wildly. And I know these people had a small budget, but if you can not hire the equipment and technicians to actually listen to the conversation, just go ahead and make a silent movie (then the button ketan wood face can actually work). <br /> <br /> I'll say for this picture: Junkies were weird. Most zombies are like movies where all uninterrupted ones are shown their isolated glory, better, zombies are just shuffling here, people facing bloody faces. It actually works to make them more like us, and therefore, scarier. That's why I gave 2 big pictures instead of this image 1. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems to be ready and it is shameful that they have failed so much. If they can just refrain from super-fiction editing but buy some extra light kids, refute the conversation and actually bring a real story that will go somewhere, it seems they have the talent to do something good. <Br /> <br /> Trust me: Do not waste your time on "The Rise of Starvation".
