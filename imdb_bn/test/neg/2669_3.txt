Generally I will not go to the problem of commenting in a horror movie in Siegel, because it is usually assumed that they are BAD, and if you see their good disrespect they may enjoy having fun and ridicule. However, the ongoing Halloween Saga came close to gumbing everything up the core of this chapter. In the first movie, Dr. Loomis said (I can add very loudly), that Michael Mayrse was evil, and tried to explain why (I could add a bad thing to it). In my opinion, he was just a blood hungry freak when he was a lot scarier. The whole Goth / Worship was unnecessary and a great effort to cast a new curve in the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, anticipated movie that was not scary and was not bad enough to be fun.
