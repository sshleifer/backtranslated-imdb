For me a bit too much Mediterrenean machismo Throwing romantic scene was beautiful, beautiful to look at all. The sky was beautiful with the sky's sky and water. It was not my belief that only such a deceiver could attract many beautiful, weak women, not just his building. Only the Mediterranean I guess Of course I'm familiar with the world. Macho men were really unnecessary, and I can believe it is that the female characters could have something with them for so long. Classplaces, cinematography, directing etc. were placed to provide a class B film, central effort to showcase beautiful open-female nipples. It was neatly beautiful for some time but it can not survive a very middle film.
