Cheylyadder Massas (2003) <br /> <br /> Played: Timmy Sheffield, Charity Ramar, Irin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, Jigi Errena, April Fools, Nikki Fritz, Tylor Tyler, Brad Beck, Samar Williams, Brink Stevens, Melissa Brasel. <br /> <br /> The plot: With a team of cheerleaders, their trainers and three people, they suddenly break their van and they take shelter. A nearby cabin Soon, they are drinking, sex, and each other is brutally murdered by an invisible killer. <br /> <br /> Well: some smiles, amazing assassination of the killer, a Brink Stevens Cameo, used as Slamber Party Mascus Flashback from my favorite scene. Bad: I was excited for this movie, I liked the slaughter party of three Slumas because they were very funny, and I expect a lot of such "Sorority House genocide with scammer tones / slovers tones", but it Just sucked! They "we are cheesy but proud" thing overdid it and basically soft-core porn, but with a good k-do it. <br /> **
