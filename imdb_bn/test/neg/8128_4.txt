Sebastian Cabot wants to buy all the land because there is a rich jolt that has oil - although local people are aware of oil. Black with the help of an evil gunfighter, they kill and terror everyone. When a son of a murderer comes, then he refuses to go down and stands up to this army of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. When I saw Terror in Texas Town, I felt that I had seen this movie a long time and probably want to see it again. Because along with some novels (such as Sterling Heiden uses Harpoon on the bad guys), this is a plot that is very familiar. Again, we got a rich man who is trying to find all the farmers to control all the land. And, to do so, he came forcibly guns to sell or kill people. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in the movie, but it was not possible to recommend except for the time being, except for the poor.
