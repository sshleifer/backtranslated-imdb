I saw this picture in New York's New Festival. It was the worst movie so far. It is not entirely unwanted full frontal nudity and a sensual-screwed script and instructions that do not agree with the reconstruction of 'Morris' and it decides to have a neat lobut flick, 'why would someone destroy the whole cast?' '. It fills the vacuum with lack of satire and sensitivity, so when the movie turns away from you, you want to remove your face and look for your heart for what is going on in the film. I wanted to edit the film again to the director and editor because there are more stories that might otherwise be exempt from the unpleasant experience.
