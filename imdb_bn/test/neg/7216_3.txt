The original Road House is not a award-winning film. But it's always one of the greatest guilty pleasures. It was hard to make a sql that should not have been. There is no need for a big budget, big names bigger, and spectacular visual effects. Even the story does not have to be original. It was necessary to have a good time vibe, and had some great fist fights. I do not mean matrix-style "wire-fu", just some good dancer bar room brawls. Many of them. There are several decent fights in the film, but none of them is memorable, and focus is more on the gun game. Also, the way it is related to the real movie is ridiculous, abusive boundaries. Johnathan starred Shake Shann Tanner, an incognito DAE agent who is good with his hands and feet. But the kicker here ... He is Patrick Swayze's character Dalton Son !!!! Ball what Let's see, the original Road House was built in 1989. So in 2006, Delton could be her son (even 30) at the end of 20 years ... well you get this idea. They live with their leopard drama (Will Patan), when her father "travels a lot closer", it gives an impressive explanation. Please. That itself warranted almost off this movie. But I have no hesitation. Schaech completely out of its material. Sure, he can throw a few kicks, but nothing is going on as an actor. Plus, he is referring to the movie as "beautiful boy" by bad boys. I've not closely scrutinized the men, but I do not think this guy is looking very good. She looks sick His face is very thin, and his scary eyes look like he is going any moment. I have never heard of him before, but I think he has to quit acting and go back to his day. Jake Busey plays the local drug runner's Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at the Starships Trupper and even made a deadly villain on Hit 2. But here, he just grabbed the scenes in the mental street mode. Even his "threat" conversation is worth answering. We are supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket. but why? What does she do? Because he wants to buy a bar from Patan? Ellen Hallman has a Token Girlfriend role. A woman with a secret. It's hard to think that mystery is 2 + 2 as hard as possible. He will be a former army soldier who is a local primary school teacher. What does that mean? This means that she can cry for most movies, when she is ready to wipe the head while flying the lungs. Oh well, at least he's hot. Actually the fight between her and Wild Bill's daughter is the best movie. It's fast, brutal, and entertaining. Which led me towards my next problem with the movie ... fights As I told Shaatch how to throw a punch. The same thing can not be said for anyone facing the movie. Clearly the movie will be all down to the left side of the movie. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. She does not possess a movie fight tension skills. Soowz may be a trained dancer, but his skill in sports allows him to snatch a dancer. He faced opponents of several rivals and went to a murderer (literally). No one here. Few exceptions are forced, badly staged and routine to fight. A 2X4 imposing patches on concrete sounds, and there are also several parts where the word fist does not fit. It's shameful. Even the original sound / redneck music is not there. Jeff Hille was a band in the Road House, which was a bit popular at that time. In this film a singer named John Autor, whose music is cruel, and his performance is even worse. He gave a line in the movie, probably there were fans who were inserted to fade. That is, or someone owed him a favor. My final complaint about the film is going to be the only movie ... consistency. The sequence of movies is shot out, and then it's all pieces editor's work together. Anyone good at this movie editor will pay a little bit. There are issues with small things, where people do not see the same aspect while shots change, re-used footage at the end of the film. In the beginning, we are familiar with Bar, the Black Pelican. You see the band, bouncer, and people dance when the camera moves through the bar. At the end of the movie, when the bad boys are defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, our hero's insert shots sit in his daughter's bar. The problem is, the footage of the bar people is the same footage from the beginning of the movie !!! I'm not joking with you. The same people standing in the same place after the same dress (or dance) are the same people. Want to know the fun part? You see bouncers in the shot put before you in the movie. Do yourself good, unless you go outside and do not see this movie until someone feels punching. This movie will be angry enough to do.
