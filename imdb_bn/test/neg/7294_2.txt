I will not say much about this film, because there is nothing to say, because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing in this movie is the return of our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire". There are several bad issues about this movie that it has terrible characters, in which the horror comedy, the horrific animation and James Arnold Taylor are the extraordinary, one and only Michael J. Fox, trying to copy as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all the characters have changed in something they have never been and sometimes should not, the lowest edge of the animation has deteriorated, and finally, why was someone who did a wonderful voice for Obi? "Clone War" - Van Kuney Michael J. Want to copy fox? I have an answer to this. Because they were the same person who forced Eddie Morphy to copy at Mulan 2. Yes, sorry, it's true. <br /> <br />.
