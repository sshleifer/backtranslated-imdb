If I hear men say, "This madness!" Once I will be barfed. The image is a big clich√©, with the "nail ankle under your heel" with the net. This film does not have a release quality of a man; Remind me about Soviet-era films with firmly based political message. I could not understand why there was attraction in leadership, or I could wait till the end.
