What exactly can happen to the cattle animals when very enthusiastic people meet together with a small amount of money, some filmmaking knowledge, ambitions of ambiguous actors, and a lot of determination, despite what can happen, despite the necessary knowledge and skills. After school special looking a poor poor looking (worse, a nostalgic is not the best way). So if I want to pass it almost free for family and friends then this quality means the quality of movie / student film. Thankfully, I found it a discount bin anywhere. Of course, there may be some kind of market for such things, but it seems like a market which is only present by default because there are so many poor B movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said First, I'll recommend that they look at the special feature of the disc. Encourage film workers, see their hard work, joy, and very high opinion of their own products. Then watch the movie. In some frames, you expect to be wrong. Disturbed, I went through the whole thing and obviously the director and filmmaker tried, but they did not know enough about what they were doing. They knew enough to be fun, but with long skill, without the necessary expertise, it explains: they knew enough to be dangerous. It's like a bad nickelodon film (I guess it's more modest adapted as a). A couple of actors are okay, and the cold stoner looking couple with tattoos (real or fake tattoos I do not know) was probably the best and most natural and I hope she makes it. But in spite of bad movies, bad script, and so the guiding principles, their natural acting talent is happening. If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to improve their character, successfully proving the camera strategy and negotiation policies for his crew better, and if the script was actually working instead of a week or more writing, very lazy documentary) Then maybe it could be more of a film. Instead, it is a film that has the feeling of some potentiality and it has a few moments (more than the style of the film), but eventually the end of each frame is shown. If you want to see what a devious low-budget horror movie can actually see, see the fantas or even the laserblast. If you want a glorious home movie (no joke), get the seeds of Bog.
