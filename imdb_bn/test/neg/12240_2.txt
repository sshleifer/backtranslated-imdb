Comebacks are a fool of inspirational sports movies, and just let me say - it's not a good one. Tom Brady (director) Perhaps it is Hilarious (The Gridiron gang, Ingeninable and even the Longest Yard from Miracle and Doszal-yes Dazzle!) And tusses in some erotic humor, which sounds like a cheerful sport movie! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, thinking you were writing it a week. I found that if a director likes the section then the movie will be good. Obviously, Brady does not like the genre that he is spoofing. This movie is not worthy to see a rubbish trash, so do not see it!
