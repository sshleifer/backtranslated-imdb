Where do I start? The story was so bad, it was written in a high school film club! I'm sorry for the actors that were acting so wooden! An actor reminds me of what a deer will look like when staring in even a car's headlights! This is the constant look of another actor constipation! But the dialogue was cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero is telling his prisoners - all submissions are in the gun - if you put a female prisoner in the prison you will die. After a moment, powerful trucks, built like a truck, and the only female prisoner go to it. When this brave gangster's voice holds the air of violating this violator, he quietly walks the guard, when the machine guns are trained him and break the neck of this monster in a split-second, a tooth pick! Then he comes back to the line, when all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but basically screaming over him! <br /> <br /> I can go and go! This movie is a camp jewel; And if you have any sense of humor, it will make you laugh and make sure that your eyes will press!
