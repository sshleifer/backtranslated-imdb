It can not be the worst movie ever made, but it's absolutely annoying. Why is it fired mostly in the dark, and most of the Vincent Gallo walked away from the camera, or looking? Because he really does not want to show his face to agree in this film. I liked his initial stuff, but in the persuasion of "Brown Bani" and then entered this drill, beat him down a vault of my book. And Val Kilmer? I actually want to send him a sympathy card. This "door" ??? Actually I saw this movie casting, and do not show the film until the film is more than half. Just a sad movie.
