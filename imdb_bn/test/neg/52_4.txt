Conrad Rodzeph (Ferry Maine), a hammy culture icon, died of cardiovascular disease (both an insulting assistant and a TV commercial director before settling down, both of them insulted him with a quarrel). Some of the pictures are removed by his students from his grave (they "want to invite him drown" .. they are a great fan). These kids (including a young Jeffrey combs) do not expect that Redzoff will be revived on those who have removed him from their place of rest. <br /> <br /> In the violent acts, Ramzan brings out a person's tongue, burns a woman in a fire, raises a casket, which shocks a woman, humiliates a colleague, and makes someone else coffin alive. A strange soundtrack and a painful fog covered around Radzoff's hateful activities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film seems to be so much more than that. The film is not really poor and we do not see too much violence because the film is often very dark. Occasionally, Radzoff is a humiliating presence, but at other times he only sees real stupidity.
