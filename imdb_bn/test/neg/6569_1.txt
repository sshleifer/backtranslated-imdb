Star Trek directed by Leonard Niamey III, which was not half bad. Perhaps William Shatner thought how Nimo could do this. After seeing this picture, he could have reversed the decision. <br /> <br /> The worst series in the Star Trek V series. Acting from all involved and bad and bad thoughts of Shatna and Nimo, and when seen in real life it seems old, special effects have special effects when the Spark jet pack kicks have to be retrieved from jet packs. Down from a mountain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take care about any of these movies and OHUR does not mention that the beaten dancers to confuse male guards. She looked like she was taking part in an aged competition. They are meant to make her look sexy. They were wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The only place for this photo is good garbage. The worst one in the series.
