When I first saw this series, I think the characters were charming and funny, especially Lorelai and Rory were some intelligent, intelligent and intelligent conversation-oriented. After seeing it for some time, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters slowly express themselves as self-centered self-emotional feminists, who regard them as a scourge of pride, among them the worst insults exist. For example, Rory did not talk to her mother for a few months when Lorelai did not consult her on her disrespectful marriage, Laurie wanted Luke to take some time to adjust her new life situation. These people are shallow, they see themselves as the center of the universe, where everyone should behave according to their strict rules and if they do not, then they will be angry against them forever. They do not want to see other people's problems and do not want to consider the smallest act as a serious crime. Most characters seem to lack the ability to behave in a raised way. They think that they have to do whatever they want and others will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> This series is character based, so when the main characters are so unlike it becomes impossible to see the show. I still have to leave the series, but I doubt if I would ever end up watching them. I will hold anyone who thinks and mourns with his greatest suspicion - they are as horrible as Lorelie et al.
