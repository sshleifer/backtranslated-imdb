Well, the episode I saw was the oldest "Gastin au Girl", why people are referring to her husband (Mr Gasthinu, who was a famous American football player). She agrees that she is not only blowing the burger, she has married anyone else, and therefore she has a camera. <br /> <br /> She gave a surprising reason for why people should pay attention to her: "I work really hard on my reality TV show". Then he said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm not a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what their meaning was to appeal to this series was removed, it must be for anyone other than digging gold. There is no role model because the two do not spend anything, but it tells you about rich people that they have no money problem.
