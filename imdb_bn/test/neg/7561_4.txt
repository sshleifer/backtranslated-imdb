A good movie can be made to illustrate the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and work well for filmmaking, especially for giving children some ideas of trouble, but overall it is less like a movie and less like a documentary. Woody Harrison is very good but the rest of the cast performed well without being extra extra. The children of Bosnia should look to get a fair idea of ​​what to fight. If anyone wants a great and gripping movie, welcome ...... will be a disappointment.
