I saw "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lie if I say that it remembers in detail; I think most obviously this irritation has made me excited and the feeling of total loss of valuable money and time, my time and money are invested not only for watching movies, but also the director. Remember, "Fuckland" is an Argentine critic, our presentation (I'm also an Argentine) who takes credit for a little bit of people and boasts even proud, ridiculous triumph and we think that we are the best thing God (who is an Argentina) made. I'm not going to argue that. This is probably a big part of the population (which I use unused, by the way) a true statement. And even if this was not true, it's not my point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Think about a good (even a middle) movie. Many of the hidden cameras are meaningless. The director likes to show with a silly version of old warfare and his own ones. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie presents a dog certificate before opening headlines, then its policies later deny it (for example, along with the director of credit, including the pride of another mark?). <br /> <br /> I'm not as a film Argentine, but as an audience. I felt felt. "Fuckland" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
