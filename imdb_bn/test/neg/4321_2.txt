I can not believe I'm actually sitting through this whole movie. The jacket makes good because a friend rents it. In its defense, the jacket was right; There was an inferior spectral room that someone slept overnight. From the jacket, it seemed similar to Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining". It can not be much better than the truth. <br /> <br /> You can enjoy it if you are a fan of minimum and / or supernatural movies. If you are looking for a great horror movie, or a few thrill, then take Jason v Freddy the fourth rental - you have a lot of good night.
