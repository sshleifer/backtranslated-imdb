My only reason for watching this little Irish movie was that Mike Myers played a normal, dramatic character. Well, she and her performance were pretty good, but unfortunately, maybe I can say about this picture that this is the only good thing. Initially, the film follows the life of twelve-year-old orphan Mikiyya, who lives with her grandson and her brother and sister with a little bit of granny. Despite some strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while it became clear that Pitts Meter is rarely suitable for younger audiences. And the worst is that it is a drama with a very dramatic and even completely impossible plot. An overwhelming story line turns into another and there is not much idea in the events on screen. I think when a life drama is required of a meteor or something more ridiculous than the spiritual content that looks like a really bad sign Character is not much better than a story. Despite all its problems, young Mickey is not the character of the character in any way, but it was obvious that we would take care of him and even feel deep sympathy for him. It does not work. The same thing with other characters. They are just as ridiculous as the story of the title character (though he was not the original character) as only a bright spot. At the end of the film, I was still firmly optimistic that there is something behind the inability and absurdity. Unfortunately, if the author of the story is such a motive (and I'm sure it was) even hidden under this weird script and virtually fickle. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3 out of 10 For those of you who are interested in watching Mike Mayer as an actor, Pitt can see the meter, but most of the rest of the audience will be disappointed.
