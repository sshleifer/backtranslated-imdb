Awesome script, which was clearly directed ... no one? Marines can not stop the monster with a gun, but the 15-year-old daughter faces it again, and it closes again. It is supposed to be a luxurious liner, but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. It seems they have rented high school for summer, and set out the chair and staff to sort the set. In the last shot, they dragged from the water and into the boat, and after less than 3 seconds, they sank almost two miles away from the ship. How can these films be made? I guess this could be a film these days. Aaron James, NYC
