Most Lorraine Michaels films seem to be unsuccessful because they are simply incremental versions of skits that only make people laugh at the 5 minute segment. "Tommy Boy" is a character from "SNL" - a big fat lover (their opinion) the cave, which does not know anything. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets extraordinary helpless public role. He has added a boring overweight slab, and they suffer a tragic misery when they travel cross country to save Daddy business. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, plots for the conspirators are really defective. In the entire courtyard - the father dies and the rich fool has to save the family's beige - you can only return to any movie. Like any SNL style film, it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; One reason to see a fat guy and a slim guy to be "funny" together. <br /> <br />, the biggest "impact" of the movie 1987 comedy classic "Planes, trains and automobiles". That movie is great because the plot is old and not recycled. It's basic, yes - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving is stuck with a slab. But it's real, stupid. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situation is much more realistic. "Tommy Boy" pure crystals and its ridiculous situations weaken the character - we do not feel anything for them, and we are not concerned about what is happening on the screen. "PTA" went on in an uncomfortable and completely believable and related - "Tommy Boy" was simply irrational, a common deer-in-headlite suddenly joked into a crash as a collision with a dead deer. Not really dead, then awake and destroy their car. <br /> <br /> The whole beaten car is completely stolen from the "PTA" and how much stuff Steve Martin / John really liked in this movie. Candy film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Spad has rarely been given, working as the most grateful character of the movie. <br /> <br /> Dan Icured is broken as Evil Buddy, who is planning to destroy Daddy's business. The last is a joke, and not a "rate-rate funny" way. One more like "Oh God they are serious?!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, it's cool But I can not access it, and I do not even understand the content that I see as "debt" - not just "PT and A" - without a credit.
