Another film to punish us for enjoying "Paul Fiction" <br /> <br /> If you see people die in a machine gun fire for one and a half hours, then perhaps the bill will fit. The first episode of "Ioan Flux", where the title character literally slogans the soldiers in front of thousands of seemingly face-to-face slogans, will be really for it. No, this is not a cute movie. Actually, it works out for a bunch of young people and is an excuse to shoot people. Sometimes a complete view goes by, and only that happens, you guess it! Nobody gets the shot. Or, things spice up, twenty people are shot. First, they are sitting there, in the next minute, they are sitting there. Yahoo! Rough Plot: A young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, drink it?), recruits a prostitute (Spiritual Julie Delpie), communicates with some old French friends, including AIDS, They plan and try to heist a bank. Of course, the movie convention says that a bank robbery does not stop the W / OA hit in the film, and this hat is about three-quarters of the current time (without the wit, patience or humanity of Sydney Lumeet "it's like a dog day afternoon"). At the time of the bank, something went wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS, his wage went to several times. No spoilers here, but from these characters you are at such a psychic distance that is enough to say that it will care for you life and who eventually dies care. <br /> <br /> There are some say it is stylish. Perhaps it is, but it's anotherbody's style, it is trapped by a movie which has already been completed and the "Killing Joe" convention. Nothing like the director (Roger Everi, "Paul Fiction" Oscar's Oscar-winning Oscars) really does something real, stylish, scary, or insulting. Until you consider that any film clash happened within a bank, such a large body was not counted, there is nothing else to distinguish it from the public.
