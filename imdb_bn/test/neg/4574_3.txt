The year can still go up to three weeks, but until a horrible Turkey is seen before, the mind-pacific year's competition can be the winner of my lousiest movie. Badly executed is an interesting idea. And, in that case, played badly. Demi Moore is very good by shaking her lips and smoking cigarettes, but what does she do? And why so much cigarette Ligit and mother or one of the other bad boys of Nicotine earned some of his illegal investments. It's confusing, stupid and moved to the enormous past of an earthy earthform. I have given it a 3. Have a 2! <br /> <br />
