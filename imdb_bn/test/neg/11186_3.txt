All right, this is a part of the making of historical film which is an abusive, ridiculous man and banned. I'll give it, so I gave it 3 instead of 1. It may be much earlier than before, but now certainly there are ways to follow it. I love Salvador's big fan and I love Yu Chien Andalou. That was briefly captivating with another creative scene after another. The L'oz d'Or was too long and lazy - the only part of creating a spontaneous film that only produces a full-length movie of the infinite Chien Andalou (and offers shameful brides) names and fame, although they did not have anything to do with it). The annoying non-action isolated by the long stretch of "Blaze Scenes" a total junk without a few (too) few shots. A waste of time and money. Both my thumbs down, way down. It will not see me again and look back.
