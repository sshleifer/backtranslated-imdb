Alas! Horrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, what I've mentioned terrible? You can say this movie is not available through the DVD cover, but unfortunately it was not in my case. And when I saw it, I just wanted to disturb the person because they used my money. I must take it again, but I can also tell you about it when it comes to my memory, I definitely want to forget it. This film is not too awesome to say. This is terrible dangerous. Probably the worst movie. The act was so terribly disgusting, as well as the deaths were so tall and predictable. I did not laugh at how bad this movie was, and what kind of scared me. Do not see this movie, if you see this movie page, it is a shame for you, and I am very kind to you if you see this movie page, because you think it will be DECENT. Last word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
