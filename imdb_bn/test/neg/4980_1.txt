I was browsing movies with needs and saw free underdog and it was just 82 minutes so I decided to watch it. I did not have much hope but it's going to get worse than I expected. Everything about the movie was worthy of cringe. The dialogue was tortured with many terrible puns. The joke was also terrible. I was suffering through this trash when I found myself yelling and flipping my television screen. It hit very well its target audience but I do not see anyone else can enjoy this film. Everything terrible about this image made me very angry and almost crying. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable thing about this movie was able to see it 1/10/10. I want you to avoid all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for kids but there is nothing worthwhile about it.
