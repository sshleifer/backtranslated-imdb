This film lacks credibility due to two reasons. One, a mayor of a major city, and New York certainly serves as the main head of it. A borough in his town will allow him to live in such a ferocious place; Especially for the voters who can tell about the security of his future job. All victims of the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or protective. At 62 years of age, I did not see any movie which represented the lack of respect for authority like this film. Even "run away from New York", which was fictional, in front of, as they told you that it was a science fiction, did not adopt so much hateful violence. In this film, most elderly people are victims and still have guns but were reluctant to use them. Also, in this film and I did not see the previous two, it is more legally than "Escape". Secondly, as far as my research shows, the gang does not cooperate with the film to make them. On one side they work in their area and take gang members away from another gang and they die. Yet when the heroes started shooting local gang bangers, the next gang was welcomed open arms. Gang members outside are always seen as outside and are closed. We believe that when our weapons are used against our gang, then other gangs should be in it. Why the outside gangs help? I believe that more than one gang has come from outside to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and wanted permission to attack the role of fellow prisoner Braunjan? It was not a great movie and I could go, but I did not.
