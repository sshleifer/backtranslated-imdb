This 1950's madness is so bad that it is strange fun. Tom Convey painter. Illustrated Gerard, a scientist who made use of Voodoo as a demon. Her poor wife, played by Mary Allen Kaye, is being held captive by her Waqo husband, who has no time for him, but if she leaves him, then threatens to kill him. As well as Marla came as a greedy prejudice of the English, who already killed a man to find treasure in the forest. His innocuous boyfriend, illustrated by Lance Fuller, along with Safari. They hire the "Touch" Connors, as a guide (after rename the Mike Connors of the honor reputation). English is a terrible actress, but hey, cast someone else gets the Academy Award winning performance. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can not type the name in addition to cracking, I mean, ... ...) the only half of the bunch has given good performance and it's saying a lot. The giant is only seen to be short, and at least to the least guessable. I would say the movie is "very bad, it's almost good" in the film section. Rainy night is better when there is nothing in the tube.
