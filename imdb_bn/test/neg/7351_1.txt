I agree with the user "Special AgentFixmunder" that this episode is awful - positively the worst of the whole show. Now I am not interested in many episodes of the series, but this biscuit! It was unreasonable and irrational. Finally, I'm sorry, but it hates me more than any other episode. <br /> <br /> I mean, boys think that they mean well but the end was so annoying that they think that whales are on the moon and credit, we see it's dead. This could save the event if the reposchers could accept for what they did. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park can be very guilty of publicity and it's always nice to look unnecessary (like makeup warcraft). But this episode was wrong! Avoid all costs! Helen xxxxx
