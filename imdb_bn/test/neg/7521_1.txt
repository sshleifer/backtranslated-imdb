I was one of the many stupid people who paid for the money in the theater, although I paid 4 rupees for the price of Mattini (before 6 pm). <br /> <br /> The story of the remix was Hu-Hoom, CGI Marlocks Lum, Eli was not a roadside to imitate today's pads (or I think the dog was not very hot), killing the hero's modern girlfriend was quite cruel, Overall Sadly, Bad Rebuilding <br /> <br /> I'll monitor Rod Taylor, Vina, and Fat Burning Eyes any time in this junk. My statistics are that many of the critics of the rebuilding of these critics are not children, which is not good for the true value of taste or old classics, which are irrelevant by today's confused and endless youth <br /> <br /> When the 60th edition came out (I first saw it in the 70's for summer fun), it was very nice and still hanging up. You do not have plenty of CGI for a better movie. This shows a lot of fake. I could not quite say how bad the morlocks were and they ran as close to the kids as the video games went nearby. 10 out of 3 stars.
