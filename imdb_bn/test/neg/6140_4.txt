I had a special opportunity to see this strong game with Kathy Betts, led by Broadway. I saw another game in the decade of the 1970s, which had a psychological effect like this game. I was really looking forward to being made in the movie, but when I found out that Kathy Bates did not reiterate her role in the film, she was very disappointed - at that time she was not very well known at Broadway and the producers certainly wanted the star power and I wanted to throw Sissy Spaces instead . In the role of the leadership of the CC, he had a lot of jobs, but in no way did Cathy Betts measure it. I love Anne Bancroft but he seems too young for this role. The movie plot was true in the game. Anybody who thinks of suicide will have to understand the devastation of the people behind this film.
