After this rental, I did not expect to fly away. Actually, I knew it was going to be awesome. It's just how horrible it really was. It comes with the horrors of low budget. <br /> <br /> "A Snake Snake", Samuel L. Do not be confused with the "snake on a plane" with the snake summer snapper, which is a woman kept under a mayan curse that snakes inside her and suffers from it. The only hope of survival he lives across a snail border, so that he and his partner jumped on a train bound for Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe, it's awesome. Snakes were another problem. They thought that they were frustrating, but it seems that what you've got is a hazardous garden snake that does not attack and this annoying sound effect is really annoying. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, if not in Tom Savini's level, it was really good. <br /> <br /> Another thing, alone for the movie is made. I'm not going to talk about it here, so you have to rent it and see for yourself.
