This movie originally used spawning rape as one of its main comedic devices. Now I surrounded her in bed while she was raping her, but I can not really imagine how it has become a favorite and interesting thing. This film has not only ruined a wonderful cast and was consistently unclear, it is actually directed to be brutal and annoying and misogynistic. How many people it seems to find a sweet family flick is beyond me. "I'm sure that enjoying canning those fishes in the last night" is not a funny trick when you know that it is expected to force an unwanted virgin to commit sexual intercourse with which she will eventually learn to like it. Do not make fun of family closing a peeping Tom flicker. I saw this weird "comedy" half and baffled completely by this positive review to feel badly off.
