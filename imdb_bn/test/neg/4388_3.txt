Check out all positive user comments on this movie, then check to see how many times each user posts a comment. They post once. It seems that companies are probably paying for the services, which post IMDB's junk pro-movie comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful. The plot was stupid. The acting was poor. The joke was not even funny. The film contained minor nudity from what the porn actresses did, but it was not among any other characters. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes it was clear that the movie was not funny. There were some crystals here and there, but most of the humor was supposed to be talking behind each other and the rumor spread out. This is not even done well. Each joke is obvious and you came to see it. <br /> <br /> This film is fast-suited or better-looking. <br /> <br /> I am sorry to show this film and if I could charge the studio and the distributor 1.5 hours they stole from me.
