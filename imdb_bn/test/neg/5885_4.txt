This is technically a highly suitable movie. The camera work and direction is excellent and well played - especially fine played as Marquis by Daniel Auteuil. I really thought there was no problem with this aspect of this photo. Instead, I was a little distraught because Marcis was portrayed, because it did not seem to be all right and it seems to be a very revisionist scene in history. In fact, in recent years, Marquis has been transformed somewhat as a protector of independence with very insight, he was not really a fat drug addict. In a way, it is a reminiscent of the white wind in the virtual Larry Finch - where these men are promoted to the hero status. Even if you do not think that the distortion of Marcus was not bad at all (they were involved in rape and extreme violence), in this prison, his screenplay seems to be stupid in this film as a "sexual social worker". Instead of violent and selfish sad, he spent a lot of time warning a young virgin and gradually helped to discover his own significance. What a beautiful and kind man Actually, I think about this now, this performance reminds me of Mauriz Chavalier's GIGI (but without song) - an intelligent old man who loves women. I strongly suspect that real life Marcis de Said will recognize this character! <br /> <br /> This picture has a lot of nudity, but what it shows is very clear. Only a push their kids will see this as a very adult drama. It's very good and beautiful and entertaining - just those truthful ones. The director acknowledged that the movie that I watched the DVD was originally imagined in interviews with special features. So go ahead and see if you want to see the movie - it is not only historically very good to understand. In the 18th century, sexual freedom in France was well accepted because they were quite broad, so the film does not mean that it was a matter of sixty, despite the violence and rape (and still) the problem was.
