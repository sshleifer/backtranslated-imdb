A female friend invited me to see the theater. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we went out, and went to the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) all weird. <br /> <br /> I think, most of the episodes are dancing, "Ogg, Ogg." Very rarely was one of us or even memorable about the characters or the role of the story. It's just annoying annoying (and I believe, no excuse was enough to spend time with this particular friend) by dragging the point. <br /> <br /> Production quality was excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. Ralph Richardson and Andy McDowell seem to be suffering from a poorly written film. <br /> <br /> If you are in the second hour, it is good to see something. I have so much patience with my time. 10 out of 4
