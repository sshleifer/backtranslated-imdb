An insult to the name of the sea of ​​all these loving and ridiculous Critters. Why the authors feel the need to create intolerable movies to watch by all quality standards. Critters have ever been transformed into a killer child that is cute and adorable as deadly behavior. They are not horrific, horrible, some are not as spine-whimsy and fun as they are previously portrayed in movies. I used to love their porcupine shots but it is now hidden as it seems repetitive and annoying. And what to do with killing and eating I thought the movie was cool, but everything was wrong. Why the vogue should be evil and killed by what is known as Charlie. This movie is sick to me Assault! Assault! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
