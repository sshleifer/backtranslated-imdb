Ha ha If you do not meet your first "Dimension Film" for a real treat! Superior low budget / slasher movies are primarily known, "Bauful" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more in ultra-cheesy style. I missed the K-RA-FT label beside me. <br /> <br /> Consider the animations! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not bad for what happened in the 8th century. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horror movie. It's very funny. It really looks like a horror film in a comedy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have learned my lesson. I will look at the studio in the video, now much closer. <br /> <br /> There are five raided out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <> Wayne <br /> <br />
