I think the film Scamman directed by Engmer Bergman was very dry. It shows shameful things to survive during the war; But I think that it was not completely or concentrating. He did not fully enter the plots or depths of the characters' feelings or the reasons behind their actions. Instead of holding on to the film, I only got attention, two main characters, John and Eva. Most of the time during filming only surrounds two main characters or do their daily work and even do not have conversations. I understand that the reality of these people was shown, but there are other ways to show reality and it is entertaining. I think that Engmer Bergman has portrayed this film even more intensely.
