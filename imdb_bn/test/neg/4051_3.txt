The film is a day of a woman who is going mad. To show that he is mentally ill, he has written a lot and the narrator tells us that he is "going crazy" Alongside the path, he went out with a fat guy who could be the brother of troubled Wales, and later he took a title of a building on the only interesting moment of the film. <br /> <br /> A strange little film that is made very cheaply - and it looks sure. The film was shot without sound (probably using 8 mm or any other kind of cheap film) and then there were some sound effects and a strong description. Indeed, the description was the most hateful and strange hilarious, which I have ever heard of and it has been said in a stupid and final way that you have to believe. As a result of these cost-cutting actions, it is not frustrating that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​making such a film was quite real. Plus, it's very hard to do this through the whole movie.
