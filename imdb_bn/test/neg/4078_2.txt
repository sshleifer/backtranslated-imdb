This film is definitely with me in the worst of movies, probably my best 5 worst films. I once laughed and it was when: <br /> <br /> Ivan: "I'm making something" Ivan Secretary: "I hope this is a sailor's shop" <br /> <br /> It was the only time that I laughed this 'comedy', Bruce was horrible than the Almighty, which was a great Jim Carie fan ... that was not even awesome! <br /> <br /> This film did not have the humor to have God's power and there was more about family bonding. ID It is not only a family comedy, it is certainly not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> When you see birds' feet in someone's shirt, it does not get sunny, your beard does not grow instantaneously! <br /> <br /> I do not think the special effect is very good, the animals seemed to really feel like it was like showing a film that was not 'glueed together' correctly <br /> <br /> 2/10 film - Avoid!
