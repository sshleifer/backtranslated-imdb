The trees that form an ancient Mayan pyramid to kill those who come near. Yeah, it's weird, as long as everything goes crazy, the tourists do not find it. And in such a movie, I was just curious and trying to attack plants by machetes. However, a group of people from America's holidays go to the mountain with a few rounds of vacation and know about the location of other newborn German friends. When they reached there, the Mayans started shouting at them and hid them on the structure. And when there, the plants decided to take them out, the words of the cellphone, the people and the ancient Mayans imitate the dead. <br /> <br /> There was really nothing scary about the movie and even entertaining. Even the weird last flute can not save this piece. I keep looking for something really good to happen, but nothing happens. Well good "F"
