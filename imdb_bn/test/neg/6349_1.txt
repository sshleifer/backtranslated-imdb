Last night, I got annoyed and agreed to watch a movie called 'Out Cold' which I once bought a lot cheaper movies from VideoStore. Looks like a good old action movie, so I was taking out chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the worst person I ever seen. He must be excellent as well as good people, but he is just a pussy! It does not fit perfectly with a boxer, which has 28 and starts working for a pump to earn some extra money. Even the nice guys may still be cool Well, his first fight came when he was working for this war. Each punch was definitely missed and that is even more annoying because the sound effect is not synchronized with punches. Then the entire cast is completely ruthless and you have enough reason to leave the film. I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.
