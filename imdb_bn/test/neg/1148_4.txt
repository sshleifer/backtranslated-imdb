Arthur Miller is always known as one of America's great dramas such as "Sales of the Salesman" and "Crusible". His less known plays "Focus" were brought to the silver screen. However, what a great playwright Arthur Miller knows, I know, his original game was like a movie. WWII is a non-Jewish mistake for Jews by anti-Brooke anti-Semitic neighbors as William H. Movies with Emily and the source came in. Do not make me wrong: acting is okay, and I think people behind this movie are probably trying to create a point about racism, but the movie does not work. Messi, Laura Darn and David Pamma can not only create an effective story with the ingredients here.
