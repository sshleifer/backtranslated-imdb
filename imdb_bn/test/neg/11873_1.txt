Starting off, I'm easily happy. I'm not a real critic, and the movies that can be scary by the critics, friends, family, and newspapers can also be fun to see me. <br /> <br /> This is not so. <br /> <br /> I got this after the newest Wesley film in my DVD store since the snippet. I loved snipes, but this one was down. <br /> <br /> The bad story, bad actor, continuity glitches, crappy sound, depressing position, a camouflaged cool, movie I was really forced to finish myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Young director / low budget "bad kind, where you can ignore something wrong because you feel sympathetic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
