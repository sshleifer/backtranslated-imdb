Is it a game FMV or a movie? In all the truth, I saw this choice from "Preferred-low-ness". It is a very big waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that HK Movies are going to the opposite direction in the world. <br /> <br /> Try more efforts and want to see something in our money and see us for something, rather than see us. <br /> <br /> Something resembling a low resolution game of 90 looks like the graphics are so awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Asia Asia looks so bad compared to the big guns in Hollywood <br /> <br /> <br />! They have big budget and good actors. But we have the oldest history, myths and myths, the best technicians in the world, and perhaps the biggest computer graphic talent center! So what went wrong too? Have you used so many old companies that are working with you for many movies? Stop wasting our time and money. That's why Hong Kong's movies are moving so fast. You did not claim to be Orient Hollywood? Do not guess.
