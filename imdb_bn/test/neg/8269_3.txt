Yesterday the TV commentator said on Saturday. I did not know any statement for a movie ... even though I can not take any notice to a TV broadcaster, I do not know. Incidentally, the announcer was speaking quarterly. <br /> <br /> This is a great, unfortunate movie that puts a bad taste in the mouth. I could not go with the horrific Burr-ming-gum accent of Hoskins. There are no benefits available in Midland any way. <br /> <br /> Unresolved Threads abundant ... and I would not normally feel it, but half of them have no ideas. And Hoskins said that he would take Felixia out of his B & B, even though he would never have told him where he was. Or his funeral that he had not clearly (and where he was in those days ???) If you ask me, then Bits of Business of Bits of Bits of Bits Offs. <br /> <br /> This is the thriller without the thriller. It's full of pretentious bits of business. It is sad ... <br /> <br /> I did not like it. Think it was rubbish Do not recommend it. 'Said Naf.
