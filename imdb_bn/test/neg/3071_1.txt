Those who can read this comment may think we might have a great movie in the hands. I am Portuguese and I am not ashamed that this film has become the blockbuster of Portugal. It really can not call this movie Direction and "Mais-n-scene" are basic (even Ron Howard works well!); The script is bad and pretentious (a really bad tarantino); Cast TVs, models and reality shows they have nothing to do about that acting. Of course, when you enter the movie, all of these TV shows will be seen by fans. I am surprised that those who comment on the IMDB here say that this movie is a wonderful composition. I thought that this site is only for people who like real movies and understand a bit. All movies from PortGal Blockbuster always use the same elements and are always awkward. If you think this movie is reasonable, please do not tell your love movies and movies.
