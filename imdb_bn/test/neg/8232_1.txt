This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther, who wore metal holes, bites the man on the neck, and shines like a chicken without the flick of arms. He thinks he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> Strange right word? Well, to me, the more wicked and the weird person, the better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They mention that he has made some teeth in prison which he used to bite people on his neck. She clucks like a chicken and she's like a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I was a patient like this, I have no way to release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luthar head attacked the supermarket and an old lady on a bench and walked away. Then, she sneaks into the seat behind a woman's car and she drives all the way home to her. <br /> <br /> While at home, Luther's relationship with the woman in bed. When the daughter's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend came home, Luther hid. <br /> <br /> After a film comes to the police gate and asks about the mother. You can clearly see that the girl is crying and crying out of her mind, but the officer asks if everything is okay. He answered everything fine. The officer finally gets his car and leaves. If I see a woman constantly crying and frightening, but at least I want to get inside the house to investigate. <br /> <br /> The end is also stupid. In the cougar, the woman excited Luther from the blaze, so she burst and flung her hand around. He finally shot him and finally sat there after a while. <br /> <br /> then the credit roll. <br /> <br /> I've never seen these Stupidest movies! Nothing happened at the woman's house! <br /> <br /> I sometimes like campi films but it really bothers me. <br /> <br /> I can give this picture 1 star out of 10 stars. Good idea, bad direction!
