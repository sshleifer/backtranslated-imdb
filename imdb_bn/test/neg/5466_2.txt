Of course, I like some indie movies. Many, in fact, actually. I do not always understand them, and okay. All of them did not understand the burden, especially mainly those like me-flowing people. I'm probably seeing my ignorance, but I'm still wondering why the 'Revelation book' is called. I love the last stories of the world and could see the same thing as the end of the world, and this movie is achieved through it. I'm not talking about the subject; Perhaps all other torture / obscenity I saw were subdued. It's just incredibly slow story, about one hour and 15 minutes of material stretched for about two hours. (Major spoilers advocate) Hetero-man dancer gets abducted, seduced and raped, or 12 days in this case, by three hooded women, from Sunday. After her liberation war, her somewhat annoying dancer / girlfriend was just phishing (excluding glass drop) after which she missed more: her or cigarette was originally sent for abduction. Still a state of reasonable shocks, he refuses to speak, and he goes to work without a hug as nothing happened and he takes a good necessary shower. Problem. As soon as he is tormented through the flashback, oh, "attack," he is equally stimulated. Imagine, I was not bound as a plaything and used, but I really would be "moody." Oh, I forgot, and how does he try this crime? She can try as much as possible and make a spot of birthdays or sleep with many women as criminals can make tats. I see where they are going? A gang rape demon from Male Pov. Fine, twist Anyway, you can not feel for this guy. Lifetime DNS / Cancer Trainer was better acting, saving grace only. But he could not save the picture.
