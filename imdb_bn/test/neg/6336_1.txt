This movie is Michael J. Fox continues to be the lowest level of respect for all-time respected careers. When I hired this movie I was horrified and saw only half of the movie and was not restored by the previous tenant. Not a good sign! Fox is a big child star who is now the agent for other show business kids. His character is confused that he still believes that everyone loves him for being a Mike. When he meets a talented child Angie Vega comes to his big break. Vega is not hateful and all enjoyable. Indeed, the only favorite character of the entire movie is the Brooklyn Actent Receptionist for the syndi lupar's agent. One of the movies that wants to stick me in a post - notes it in the box and warns others not to waste their time!
