When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be good, because it was my best actor of all time. Although he gives a sterling performance, it is fairly clear that he did not have the life to work in half the fingers of the rol. He is the only good thing, unless you blast and American dream-worker class trash (which is not me). <br /> <br /> I did not get it. How can this film get away with so much dirty? That little bit rescued the boy, that means, come on! You can not tell me that the man of the fire was rescued without any goggles (I know that it was blackened there and you can not see it for more than a few feet), and no breathing equipment (he will be suppressed after 2 minutes! ). This picture was just bad, okay? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
