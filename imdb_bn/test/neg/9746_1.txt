This film was very clearly selected as a pig in our pond from a local video store. It turned out to be quite a dry. Plot line - as it is odd, incompatible and predictable. The actors feel embarrassed to constantly face the weak lines written. The only fun moment of the whole movie is the danger of smoking and an unreasonable deployment of an airbag. The rest of the film was a lack of punch for my young girls (less than ten years old), my wife, my mother-in-law, even my cousin or dog. My suggestion, if you are tempted to survive this turkey, your money and your time are saved. Find something else ...
