It was the second year of the academy, but they are already politically voted - in this cracky clutter, Jane Iglesia's brilliant performance was to work with the Oscars prototype and the worst performance to win the statue - Mary Picford's cocuit. There was a work printed except for the existing print music or final editing, but where it is shown, Eagels stuns and captivates with its beguiling, strong performance. He is so confident in the witness stand that we know that he is lying with his teeth (we have seen him kill everyone), we are among the audience, like our judges in our innocent faith, before we suddenly catch ourselves. That's great job The film should be made available on the video so that it can enjoy this great performance again in the world. (One of Jane's silence archives print - Man, Woman and Sin - and its only other book, Jilausi, is "lost", the only document in it. Running to see it, the archives exhibited in NYC in the early 70's, the village voice is a complete Print page review, worship eagles performance)
