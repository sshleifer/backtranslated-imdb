Oh dear In most cases I saw a pretty bad picture. I mean, what is more about the old "woman inside the human body" story? It was full of cliche, for example, Nerd came from his own sequence, "boy" coming to him, etc. Nobody can guess because I'm not calling these spoilers !! The only thing for this was Laura Fraser, who gave average performance. And as the "dream" boy, that was the greatest piece of acting. Even the bad guys forgot. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
