View this image with viewers ... total 5! There was a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (then realized that Lakshya should go for). A common plot ... India vs Pakistan ... but not just cricket, like Kashmiri in your midst. An Indian Super Hero goes on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani insurgents involved in a mass drug smuggling rocket. I left the film halfway because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and in all places The songs were terrible, the film tried to conceal errors with its special effects, but unfortunately they were outdated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... if you can, avoid it, I have to be the worst movie. I've seen this year.
