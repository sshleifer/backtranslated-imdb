It has not been time for the movie to be silent since the transit date. This plot is a gangster falling for a socialism, who wants to help him on his fortune ventilation. Of course there are complications. The problem of this film for me is that it is not good. Performance seems so ridiculous as it is on top all with some mental scenes everywhere. Carol Lomber threw someone from her room and there was a late exchange where I was excited with delivery on my song. While the film is static, other times are a sign of the limitations of microphones. This is not a bad movie, it only comes to the real enjoyment of the film's technical limitations. Generally I'm sorry, but at the moment I could not go with the flow (the copy that I once saw was horrible). A shot is valuable in a forgiving temperament (and remember that Robert Armstrong did more than the King Kong's Carl Dunnham)
