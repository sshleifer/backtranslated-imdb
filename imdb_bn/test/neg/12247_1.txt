This picture would be a huge part of history if it was actually the actual film of Kennedy's assassination. There are so many mistakes in this movie for me. This is a film of Kennedy assassination, but most important information has changed. The scene is absent and, in most cases, the President's Limo sign is not visible after passing. Kennedy both proceeded to move four slowly to them in front of them. The next time you see some of the things that do not see this movie in Los Angeles, as well as the SS men in front of it, you'll see that Limo is not slow or slow, it is actually accelerating. This image is clearly a cover-up effort.
