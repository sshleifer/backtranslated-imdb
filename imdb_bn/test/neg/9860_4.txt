I was frustrated by this documentary. I think there was an idea about the second chess match between supercomputers designed by IBM computer experts to defeat another chess player in Grandmaster Gary Kaspovov and Deep Blue. Casparav was considered as the greatest chess player of all time. In 1979, the film brought us where Kaspova agreed to recover with a "deep blue" after being defeated 1 year ago. But instead of paying attention to the game, it gives more attention to what happens before and after. Game, but not too much. Most of the movies are located around the paronidic expression of Casparov, where the match was suppressed as part of some conspiracy theories, and it did well to lose the match. This movie has an interview that is not interesting in any way. They even chat with the match manager where the match was held. Who care? I got it too dry and slow. Eventually the film was dissatisfied. This is my opinion, of course. If you like Conspi Conspiracy theories, this movie might interest you. Not for cheaters or conspiracy theories, but for the people, this movie is probably worthless. I'm a chess fan, and I've just stuck it for it. I'm "Over Games: Caspost and" Machine "4/10
