... watching this vanity project does not waste your time. I have deleted my comment twice now, that is why I still can not understand, anyone other than the suspect was involved in "Gone", I'm not happy about what I want to say. So, I have lowered things right now with a quotation from my original comments that no person can be taken as personal attacks or as a paragraph commentary: <br /> <br /> "Gone" is a debris of train which gives new words to the words. Awesome, stilted conversation, a script that just fishes like fish outside the water, which will embarrass the theater community's most self-centered movie Theater Devas. Strike, Nastrich-Exploring close-up, terrible ADR work, pedestrian music, which fails to completely protect any mood or emotion, without following the visual effects, crashes terribly. Neutral freezes and fades, no art direction to speak --- litany of evil goes on and just ... I felt it really took me time to move fast faster through really ... staring at a wall that could have been better ... no Under circumstances, someone should be sorry about reading this topic as "movie", because they have "raptured" before making this mistake long before it ends. <br /> <br /> Close the case. Amen.
