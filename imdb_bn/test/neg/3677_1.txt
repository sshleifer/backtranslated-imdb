Wow, where do I start? I hired this movie because it saw something that has to be interested in watching. In this film, with a name similar to the actress Wallkiller, I thought how bad could it be? This is the worst movie I have seen with such a big name. I was frustrated why it slipped through the crack and I do not remember hearing anything about it when it comes out first. It started pretty well, and it makes the early sequence of Bourne identification a memorable one, but after the initial 30 minutes, it gets worse and it comes to WTF land. If you do not see it, then do yourself a favor and do not buy / rent unless you are a macroist or there is no search on any wall-killer movie. There are many more titles that are more worthy of your time. This movie (if you can call it) is a perfect waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
