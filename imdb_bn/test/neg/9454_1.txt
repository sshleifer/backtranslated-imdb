How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and can think very little about what it was ... <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 pound for the DVD, the old story "Put-a-New" On-the-box-and-some-fool-like-buying-it-syndrome I really think that the cast ran a lot closer, the use of cars was certainly above the budget and a vampire was involved. Then again, guess that you can learn from the title of this movie. <br /> <br /> The direct video is trickier or cheaper than the straight-Jack DVD. This item will be in the doorstep of the application in the rented shop, supermarket and charity shops until the sun's death. Only cockroaches will rule the earth but this garbage will still be nearby. God bless the duration of DVD age ....
