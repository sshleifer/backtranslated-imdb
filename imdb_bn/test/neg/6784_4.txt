Apparently beautiful with some fine music, this movie otherwise made a fairly trite TV quality for. Romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is not easily permausible. Of course, from the very beginning we knew that the heroine of our sincerity will become lighter, win over the locals and find true love, but it does not make it less harmful that the movie has to take a complete expected turn. There was a lot of promise in this film, which promised to make the promise unrealistic. Probably a blank blanket on a cold night freebie on a nice blanket, but I certainly will not pay rent or purchase recommendation. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though.
