People please! Do not bother with this weakly pointed joke. The direction was completely wrong from the beginning. What is the mental insanity of his mother and the history of common madness in the family? Why are these huge, excessive imposing addictions provoked as the full picture of anger and hatred? What is this shit? The author and the director probably did not do any research in history and the name of the notorious gene is more than cash. Making this movie has gained many freedoms with the truth of the fool, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a bright genie film Go back to the minor classic "Deranged" to see how Ed was really really. There is humor in the film, and according to history, Ed is portrayed as a more tragic, lonely little man. Where's the background story here? There are only weak setup shocks (which are not frustrating) that we've seen before and done better. Take the Texas Texas Ripoff to the worst Texas, and add this one to that list. Zero would not be accepted because it had to give ten out of one. I want my money back. If someone considers this movie to be 'stunning', it is probably a financial kickback to do this.
