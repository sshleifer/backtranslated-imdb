I was extremely disappointed with this one. After reading the Oscar Wilde's wonderful story, I hope to translate at least a little onto the magic screen. Well, no one was there. This version played like a condensed, dumbed down reader's digest movie. It just did not hurt, it was cheap and was written inappropriately. Major characters and plot points are changed or completely deleted. I try to bring a novel to the screen, especially in limited (TV) budgets, but appreciate this in a great way there is no excuse for mangling a great story. I thoroughly recommend reading the story of Wilde's Wilderness that exists under the most beautiful extrovert. But I can not recommend anyone to hire this travesty.
