A very good action thriller because it failed because of the same water failure like Steven Sigal's film because it is not a very good set piece. Steven Segal plays the same character as he played from above the law. In my opinion, Keane's Ivory Wayne's performance has been broken in such an average film and there is a better film. Bob Gunton's head is just as heavy. Brian Cox, the best actor in the whole film, is afraid of the killings. My favorite scene is the war scene with the Russian Mafia. The Glimera Man (1996) is one of the reasons for the look of the beautiful and vulnerable Nicikie Cox. It was very bad that there was no more scenes with him.
