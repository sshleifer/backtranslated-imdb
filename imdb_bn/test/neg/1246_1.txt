This is probably the worst movie I've seen the longest time. Independent or not, hard writing is a must. Ditto for instruction and acting I know this actor can work (I've seen sporanos and more ...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. Perhaps it's script, perhaps it's the director. Probably both a little ... Probably both a lot! Technically okay, just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that the makers of this movie's poker magazines are also there because I saw a very favorable review among the magazines. "Hey, we've made it, so it will be good, okay?" Very fast or fortunate. I know it requires a lot of hard work and money, very few are sold and distributed for making a movie, and for this I appreciate these people. But the final product, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> PS I won a free rental and chose this movie from Blockbuster. Tomorrow I'm going to get my money back.
