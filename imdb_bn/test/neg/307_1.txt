I did check it out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and were not impressed. <br /> <br /> I was commenting on the film production area being the only area in the film. In most cases, this image seems to be random and somewhat fantastic (although I do not compliment it) and simply silly. It seemed as if he had mixed the imagination of everyday life, which may seem confusing in some movies, but the imagination seems to only fall inappropriately opposite. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not the actor but the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted to return my money, but it was a film festival to be considered, which does not happen.
