<br /> <br /> I liked the Hollywood Action Blockbuster of some people in the 80's. They had icons like Arne and Sly but I think the action movie of the '90s has fallen into a new depth. The worst of these, I believe, was Armgadon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler, who has played a number of subtle independent features directed by masters such as Bervardo Bartoluky and Robert Allman, sadly decided to jump in commercial bandwagon. This movie has a special effect on Grand Special Effects and a little good dialogue or authentic melodrama new Hollywood aesthetic symbol. These days are the norms and I start wondering if the screening of the hygiene screenlitter is there. It seems that they easily employ hacks and committees to write scripts. The rest they leave the technology. Armadidon's grand, heartfelt human emotion is not a single part. It just feels empty and soft. I can think of the only good aspect of this movie and it involves Levi Tyler's father, who does not see any look in the film. Steven Tyler's band AroSmith has provided a theme song for the movie - a ballad that is really bright and at least intensifies when the end of the credit ends. <br /> <br /> If I like it, for Western civilization. Forecasting, cinematic movies. It stands for shamelessness, cunningness, and a fall in man's intelligence. I even like to see on the 13th Friday.
