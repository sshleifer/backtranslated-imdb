I have to be in a good mood to give this a shameful, anticipated, embarrassing film even a 3. What's wrong in this? Let us start with unwelcome sex, even though I accept the rotating style of boating, something I have not seen before (not experienced). And I think they saved a few rupees by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are inconsistencies. "Oakville Tribune" is thought to be in a green part of a city. (Hamilton Ontario ???) Yet in the rooftop scenes, it seems to be an industrial area where the smoke and fire of steel mills are lit. Also, inside the building --- Newsweem --- stairs --- seems much larger than the outside. Here is the spirit, then when our brutal journalist was finally fired, he returned to the building after a few hours. most probably. Finishing is also desperately predictable ... classic bite and switch caper which turns out to be bad guy good guy. But my main objection is that it is a money-making film with Canadian and Ontario tax credits, which is ashamed of establishing itself in Canada, but again proves that the Canadian film industry is crazy and has advantages. Movies in a country only need to do more than provide jobs. They should reflect the culture. American studios standing in New York are quite bad using Toronto. But Canadian producers (in this case, Can not Live Global), with the help of the federal and provincial government, it is shameful and angry. In a word ... BAH!
