<br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Tandrum pack (the first two "Problems" in one disc), and we decided to see the siggles because It was "funny" <br /> <br /> There were so many fun moments in this movie (vomiting scenes, which were needed to say.), Dog nippies were dog down after eating, and many others. The movie toilet is nothing but humor, but it is ridiculous. More than the funny moments, this film is a bit of a bizarre offer. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ritter bothers me from crap, because he seems to be reading that book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, movies for a rainy day ... but nothing else. Do not expect this one, Oscar object.
