What other people have said that you can not review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it exists on its own, but it will be 2 of 5 films, but it is a remake of 4-5 out of it. We have 5 movies, plus standard quality standards and we have to see whether those standards have reached. The film re-works, or as an app's planet, a re-imagination of the original, you will be able to see the movie on your right, only you can mention the original. Think of this, if someone takes the model 'Mona Lisa', publishes it differently and draws it out, but you can compare the framing, concept, etc. to the original, but if someone reproduces it for its position, you basically have to compare it completely. Will be. <br /> <br /> It says that this film can not be as good as unlucky as well as unlike it, it is basically one of the best movies made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was celebrated with Hitco, but actually he and her The Master's work has ended. <br /> <br /> The dosage aspects of this picture were Vins Von and Anna Heche. The relationship between Narendra and Marion was not really innocent, but there was no relation with Vaishasa, it was indeed innocent, Norman actually did not understand sexuality, he rarely contacted the outside world and when he saw the beautiful moron and his change, you feel that he This is partly due to the fascination because she does not really understand the sexual and her attraction, it is a humane sympathizer. Color makes almost a hero a hero, because you do not fully understand the world and continues to own it completely, and his mother was fighting with. Remix has become completely dynamic, I have to admit to the genetic leake, not my type, but she is very interesting and you can see that Anna Nea is really vague and so Norman finds her 'Marian attractive' if you add it, it is incredible Vince When looking at Von's Norman, you'll find a Norman who knows how to look at a nude woman. Ksaya waiting, for which you do not feel any sympathy, they destroy the nature of Norman innocent porno mags putting his room. It destroys a character that we like and feel sorry, it is rebuilt, 'This is a wonderful life' and the main character is a fungus, completely frustrating. <br /> <br /> I had problems with another character Ritter Wilson Caroline, Marian's colleague. When Pat Hitcock originally targeted 'My wedding ring', he responded to the smile, because he is completely fun, Rita says it seems right because there is no other reason why <br /> <br /> <br /> I I said, I would be very favorable, the original 'Psycho' was my favorite film all the time, the film was reusable, differently, then you can turn these characters on their heads Ena and it would be perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> The hit will be very dark in color and it will be reduced to black and white. It has made the film more atmospheric and scary in its own way, and it has given a beauty that can never be painted and it is a sad statement about how films are being sensitized, which is what people say is the fountain scenario, the color is more horrible. (NB before people think that 'he can not spell' Remember I'm from England and we're spelling it out) <br /> <br /> A remake should be fixed, rebuilt, it is a fraud, complete Copy and that's a very bad one. I could go to compare but there is no point, almost everything is superior. Viggo Martensen's performance like Sam Lumis was the only good, John Gavin was basically very flat (Hit called him "The Stiff" behind him) and made Martensen more believable in the less humorous performance. William H. Messi and Julian Moore are the only other actors, which originally kept them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a movie that should be labeled 'costly embarrassing failures' If you compare only to the original, or see if the original is unknown to you. But see also the original 'If the film was original or reusable, it got 3 out of 5, but 0.5 out of 5 (for Messi, Moore and Mortensen)
