I have now seen 3. I can not believe how bad the nawabakatasi is. Not comparable to others, but only its own competence, or lack. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that the average rating of this movie is more than 6 out of 10. I gave 8 of the first two movies to 10. They were excited and done pretty well. I gave this movie 1 rating. If 0 or negative numbers are available, I could have rated it instead. The total waste of time was watching this movie. I think it should be closed after the first 30 minutes, but then I think this is a very slow film. I think the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that it would not be better. <br /> <br /> It is very annoying to see and without a freedom fighter. Do not take my word for it, see it yourself. Do not forget to watch the first two movies before this one. If you see this first, I just do not want to see the first two, I can definitely say it, but they are definitely much better than "pieces of work". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < When your reminder is complete in this world and you are going to see this "movie" you can move to the 89-minute paragraph. If God is truly kind, he will be more liberal.
