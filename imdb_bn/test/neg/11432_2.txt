Filmmakers went out of their way only to find the following demographics: peace-loving, peaceful-looking between Palestinians, presence of Palestinians (especially the elderly women and children with children), which are uncomfortable fences due to safety, and the security that the Israelis Do not believe in the visit, his curse on the Palestinians Dd, and it is unnecessary to express sympathy with the impact of split and / or treat waste money. Oh yes, they support the visit of a member of the Israeli government, which they support, but they can portray him as inhumane and helpless, and ask him very important questions which are really statements (for example "the wall is bad environment ... it's all destroyed Is doing ") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have no problem (good, at most) in this picture. However, I can disagree with the people I interview, their opinions are enough for a documentary. However: there are at least two aspects of Israeli security visit, and despite the fact that a large population of Israel (and many others) support the construction of fences and believes that it is positively affecting, this "documentary" does not even represent one's opinion of the person. In an interview with Israeli Jews, they can even go so far as to claim that "all Israeli fences support" and thus insane, and yet refuse to interview such a "crazy" Israeli. Oh, and to get to the top of it, they set the voice for the film in interviews of some young Israeli children (except for the real rule - I was there) that laughing about their Arab neighbors laughing. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" film that explores a subject and presents complete information, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is an ongoing propaganda film that very clearly supports the only side support of a controversial, mentally and politically charged problem. It's not more than a documentary, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
