If I submit myself, then I will run away from the theater. The film is literally a horror of the word. Despite the pictures, deadly locale and interesting topics, the film has died. <br /> <br /> I was unfamiliar with this period of Greek history and was ready to enjoy a great movie. The filmmakers' hands are heavy. It is not enough by seeing a train; We must watch it from a distance, the car must be seen in our car, we have to see the smoke, we can see it slowly, and of course it has to be closed. The director's method is decatical. Similarly, the letters that he created never develop, they never change. They are so scary that we wonder, do they mean to everyone? Every girl Everyoldmusician? Does this metaphor have some points? This is the most entertaining movie I've seen for a long time.
