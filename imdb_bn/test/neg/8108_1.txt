No spoiler needs you to clean this up ... well, diverse film. Canada becomes part of the United States. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I had some hope of being part of the United States about the Canadian impact. Keep me quiet Go through this movie and you'll leave the land of Cloud Coco. Do not take care of the sketch for any letter in the opening premises (you trust me) with no other film left. Slings and arrows and due to the south will ever be in the most imagined series. But in this case, Paul Gross, I'm very sorry to say, there was no source of making a coherent film, and in this process many talented actors were lost. A real frustration
