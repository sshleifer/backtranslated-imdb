If there is a word, I can join this movie, its 'shame'. It should be embarrassing for everyone associated with the film, in fact it is seen in a theater. Everything - scripts, playlists, dialogs, song songs, direction - mourning, lousy <br /> <br /> This image was viewed when I was a child. It likes, mainly because it's a fantasy, a superhero-movie. In Hindi cinema it is a non-exploration trend. The effort deserves credit, but all that is there. It seems that Cincinno Kapoor is running very soon to make the movie. Do not understand the reasons for throwing foreigners as Hindi-speaking characters, who can not get sync rights (there is nothing to be said about dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. Even more edits. If someone follows the conversation closely, but can detect grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the meaning for purpose). There is nothing special about music. <br /> <br /> The biggest shame for the sensor board must be. There are some nip-slip scenes in the film, one of which is completely clear (so much that I can not think of a metaphor). The director missed them The edit team missed it. And the sensor board is very missed. There's a lot for any indecent-exposure-on screen policy. Officials may have fallen asleep while viewing pictures. <br /> <br /> Why not think Amitabh took the role? It could be because he was a good friend of Coppaw. But the role is rarely something for him. He could not follow it even further, playing a nice role behind Humayun and Agnapatha. Heroic view has a couple, really worth more. But otherwise, they are incredibly incredible (for example arrows .. It's probably better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor have an inspired performance, but their opportunities are limited. Amirush Puri is a fairy-tale villain's natural spirit in the role. (Now and then laughing laughing) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> could be much better.
