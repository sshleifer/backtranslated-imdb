When I was 8 years old and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my parents read in the TV directory that they showed Marx Brothers film "The Big Store" on Friday night and VCR set me to tape for me. When I woke up on Saturday - the TV Guide is not susceptible to a misprint - my father and I discovered the "human stories" were recorded instead. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least interesting of the Marx Brothers films, and despite this, it has stood as one of the best paintings of the century, compared to "the story of humanity". I can justify the error of the TV Guide, Marx Brothers - Grewocho, Chico and Harpo - both movies are present. Although "in the story of Mankind", they are divided into a series of related scenes. Groucho played Peter Minitweet, some people played with Chico Christopher Columbus, and played Harp Isaac Newton ????? Harper's scene lasted for almost a minute; Chico has only two or three lines; Grucho's view is at least fun, but terribly sensitized by today's standards. The rest of the movie is not mentioned in the mention. They trotted out some of the best actors of the day, and read their total rubbish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> A wonderful bite of physical comedies with Marker Brothers on roller scale and some of Virginia O'Brien's songs. I was really looking forward to seeing it.
