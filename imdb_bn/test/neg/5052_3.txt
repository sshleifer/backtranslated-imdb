You know, I'm really tired of all the generic music used in such movies (see Javrekar, boring behavior etc.). Here every genuine tension is undercut with some sugar pop-tuning, diluting immediate cryptic (and there are some). Why do they do it Certain soundtracks must be sold, but in this case, the mission is unfinished - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs. Miron has attacked her role with her role and happiness (add some cheesy wicks with kicks). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? There is no purpose in the story (they are so surprised that I can not use the "character" here), so I can not understand why three well-known actresses can be cast. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the last is so incredibly hackneyed and unlawful. Kids are free of Scott-free and nothing works as a result - all undergraduate graduates They are criminals, people! No consequence for their actions (kidnapping, assault, hijacking grade) - nothing. <br /> <br /> The little thing - the tigress story about her husband is true? What's with crossbow? Will the character of the virgin character surround its character in such a way? (Great Message, Boys.) Why did McCauer go home? How did Kate's academic generosity walk through the door at just the right moment? How do students or even teachers get home address? What is with jafri tambar ?? McKeenen tingale fire on what basis? She held hostage by bloody, rebellious and student, fer cripe's request! <br /> <br /> Well, well, I'm spending the way to think more about Mr Williamson's scripts, so I'll stop here. </ br> <br /> 3/10
