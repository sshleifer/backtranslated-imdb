I can not give less than a star, I have tried. At this point, I'm not sure if I'm halfway through or not, I actively pay attention to its dream. Or not Or maybe it was. I think viewers post a comment that does not include descriptions of "terrible" or "terrible" or "wants to swallow me a bullet", probably because it's an indie film. Do not listen to them, listen to me - there is no nudity in the movie, avoid it. I need ten lines to submit this warning, so I would say that the Goth girl described as "hot" is fatty. She has fat elephant legs.
