This film looked like finding out the deleted scenes from the high school film class test. It is made in no sense! It was well played, but I felt sorry for the letters only because they were present in this shield. Alien machine was made with Pentium I technology and there was no creativity, they were CRAB! The under-lights and just visible alien legs were Frisbees. Where was the tripped? The edit done by the editor, director / writer / producer / make-up artist / gripper lat has jumped all over, some scenes are repeated many times. It is mostly portrayed in Katrina's hurricane context. The next time Lat wants to make a movie, someone has to crush him. She made 11 films in 2005 alone! Writing, editing, directing or visual effects on other movies that are not included in the credits. If the others are like this snootload, then they are making fun of us. It was a spellbinding spill in Spielberg's film, and there was nothing else. I'm waiting for Lat's "Backflow Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hilk's Eyes".
