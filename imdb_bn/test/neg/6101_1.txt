And again, Columbia Pictures decided to create a "hash" using the original version of Curly and without any jugs or jokes! At the end of the jerk, Joe, when trapped around the calf, did not try much to listen carefully to the studio, if you listen carefully but you can stay here too "Koooo" Woo woo woo. Also, when Ma and Larry can "dirt down the dirt, they can get clogged", then it gets elevated from the main because you can actually see the elemental and Larry as a 15-year-old "magician". Oh why did all this allow you to happen? This is a burning question which is probably not answered, because I know so much, in real life, he was sensitive enough to criticize and had high standards for his work, as well as Larry, Coralie and Shampoos. Do not waste your time on this one.
