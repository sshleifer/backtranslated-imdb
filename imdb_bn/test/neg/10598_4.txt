I was actually looking forward to watching this movie. Commercial it is real cold and action packed look. And I heard that the character of Claire Dianes was arrested for the attack, so I thought that he would kick many asses and it would be calm. But nubuo !! They had very few steps and were all kind of character bland. Omar Apps is the only saving grace and even he did not help much in this movie.
