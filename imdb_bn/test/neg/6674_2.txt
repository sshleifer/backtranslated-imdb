All right, so maybe not bad, but I'm typing this review into public service, which will happen in the playful beginning of this telefilm, waiting for some plot development for two hours of life that will never happen. Come The main investigator has an intimate feeling, who is missing the disappearance of the marine officer (Guy) and some people with helpless detainees and the accused accused him as a debate. So what is the matter with this drama? Beats out of me I thought (or hoped) would be a sort of plot or new revelation, but no one was up to date. In short, I can not think of single reasons to sit and see this pointless TV movie based on the real story.
