I do not know what these people were thinking when creating this image. Any plot, very limited action, and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film ???? Instead of germinating everywhere around the planet, they should write scripts and spend some money on the actor. What was played, was lousy. This 90 minutes I will never be able to return to my life. The director has to pay the bills to rename this movie. Directors and writers for this picture .... Drop Now. There should be a tag in front of this image. What I can say about this movie is that the computer generation. Just like a generation. There should never be a signal in this movie .... ever.
