This is the biggest step in the Mill family that I am sure that most children will enjoy but actually they are not too big to see an adult movie. The principle of the film is that Balushi's cop character retires but dragged to a case that makes him a personal investigator. The plot of the film is so clear that the kids must end this before it ends. But as well as forgotten story about the progress of film arcs and sub-plots that seem to be. This is combined with a sub-plot where the title is pumped by the K-9 Balu≈üi. I'm afraid to live from one.
