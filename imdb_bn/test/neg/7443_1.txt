The violent series of Robocopa was driven by Irvin's cursor (sometimes not to say, Empire Strike Back) would not be as real as it is almost ridiculous, and it should be very meaningful, and NC-17 should have been rated, because of the scene involving children in the gun battle, People automatically kill a very young child with surgery and 12-year-old scenes are very special Just using dishonesty, even providing narcotics to the random people, shooting and shooting graphical. Police officers and swat officers are killed, firing on policemen, when many small and small children are present, and using strong groups to beat the entire group of children and the shop owner of the electronics store (who is very old). Steal and destroy lots of items. This image gives new meaning to the word "unexpected money", but the effect and verb sequence are incredibly unbelievable. Overall, there is a OK movie.
