This film was not only terrible but it was poor, but the acting was incredible and sometimes merciful. In real life people are not talking like this very unrealistic conversation and do not say any emotions or feelings in a monitor that often laughs continuously. Even the worst of the editing is bad terrible. The camera work was sloppy in clips and close-ups, even during the conversation. There is nothing positive about this movie and George Kates has to work on heavy machinery or anything else where he does not need to talk to other people because he does not know clearly. This movie has been nominated for the winners / awards, my God!
