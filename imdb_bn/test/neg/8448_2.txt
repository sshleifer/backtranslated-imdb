This is a film that just does not justify anything. These folks are going to track a: young girl wants to photograph the animals. I do not really have piranah, but I think the psychic hunter is a real piranah However, there are plenty of animals and there are plenty of driving. There are notable anti-gun talk, but we all know where it's going. In the end, lots of steps and rape are done. Someone must pay, and they do. It was nice to fill the matter with a few piranas. There were many monkeys. If you move fast through the dust part, you have a tight five minutes.
