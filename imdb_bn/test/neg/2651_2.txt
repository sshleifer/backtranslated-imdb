Harrison Ford plays the District Magistrate of the Police Department of Colombia, Van der Brocke. He tries to get bad guys, but does a very good job. When we meet him, he is trying to catch a corrupt officer. Kristin Scott plays a new Hampshire senator, Kay Chandler, trying to re-elect. He has lots of money for those running against a candidate. She wants the last thing about her husband's death. He is a politician- he can not be bogged down by feelings. <br /> <br /> This story is a slow and painful step. It will end when I am disappointed my watch every five minutes! Syndicate Palake's manager lost the story of details, he did not have to enter.

I wonder why I'm romantically involved even after watching the film. Does anyone else mourn? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its role is not necessarily comic relief, but that's what I wanted to see. Do yourself good, wait for it in the video if you want to see it.
