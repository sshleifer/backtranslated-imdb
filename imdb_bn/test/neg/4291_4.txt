Firstly, I must have played the role that played Wendell Corey was exceptional. Generally, the Kino is condemned to support the role, but here she helps carry this very cruel film. Without him and his character, the film got worse - rarely 2 or 3 meritorious. <br /> <br /> Why do you hate the rest of the picture so much? Well, one of my pet dogs behaves when "the characters are too stupid to live". You can not place the foundation on the basis of the original plot, unless your main characters are completely stupid (until the brain is used with permission). But this is exactly what this picture is about. Wendell Corey is a mad man who killed three innocent people and they know his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. So what do they do? Yes, they are really inadequate police protection and a plan that does not give any idea (people who are so far away with any marquisms and shotguns they probably will not stop this crazy). And if it is not bad enough, the marked woman goes far beyond her secret place and she can go to the appropriate place! Anyone stupid?!? Oraghghghar --- I am fascinated when the movies are so stupid characters. In fact, I converted myself to the Correa because I thought that the body deserves to die for their behavior! In addition to these clich√©d characters, there was also a bit player who faded. Sure, one might feel frustrated if your husband shoots, but in real life it is a rare event - people become very sick unless it is a medical reason. So, a real nightmare for people who are real-looking with the problems of the above character - there must be some movie silent films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He had the chance to be as bright as the actor - the very bad movie was so long that the concept of Core and the basic plot diminished. This is a movie that really can use a remake - but at this time without an idiomatic character.
