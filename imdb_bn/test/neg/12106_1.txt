I do not even know to start. I do not want it It did not behave like a story and was so injections in the film (pot chestnut, boy was gay?) It was advisable to kill, Linda Unka can have any possible reason for Penelope's explanation). It made a big mess on all the floors until it was slipped all the liquid on a table and closed the counter. <br /> <br /> Why Vanessa Redgrave Made a Five Second Camio? Why did Dyan Weveht use his bullet on the camp-funny bandway character? Why did Jane Barkin begin the story at the beginning? The list is endless. The movie was over and we were all looking at each other - for example - did you understand something like that? <br /> <br /> I say one thing if I kill my long lost father but I do not want to. The murderer will not be hugged. Another thing, if "Bob" breaks down with "Bob", what was the secret of the son's son on the keyboard? Bob must have sex with Bob in front of the boy? How did the kidnapper communicate so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review is confused then it was waste film, genius and time. <br /> <br /> I have never seen any of these bad films because it can be better, stronger and it must be made some kind of knowledge. No feeling Instead we have been tired of reading "Dive" (from a picture of 70 with a carnage) and reading boring words from a completely insane script. <br /> <br /> This passes people. Or perhaps I and everyone who left the review of this movie are too stupid to understand it - I'm French movie after all of it.
