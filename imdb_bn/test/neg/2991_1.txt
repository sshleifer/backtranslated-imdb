Do not blame me: I enjoy art-house movies, low budget flickr, character research and foreign movies. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this one - glassy pacing, the complete lack of plot, and the characters that you hate can not hate enough, but you can not tolerate enough to choose. <br /> <br /> I was about to show cut-room floor footage of a reality show - all the scenes which were considered very unusual, which were not included in the final cut, only the scenes were included. A camera does not create an interesting movie with my two friends while traveling around the house. <br /> <br /> Visionary must feel the viewer in such a way - the long stretch of the dialogue (about 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credit) can work (2001 comes), but for me, to do more for me Must be compulsory <br /> <br /> If you are watching an observer who can sit in a movie and be content with film analytics, it probably will work for you. However, if you are someone who likes to relax movies, stretches your mind, or chooses to entertain you, you should probably see elsewhere.
