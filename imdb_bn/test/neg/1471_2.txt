These pictures were appreciated by the ridiculous point. "American Movie" is an annoying documentary about an annoying person who will get you equal in almost every corner of America. It takes a long, hard look, that only everything has failed in the interest of making a movie independent movie. It was his failure for others other than his own selfish work or whether he was in the real industry, the film was probably an opportunity. There is an abundance of good stories called America. This one should be flushed and there are good reasons to be ashamed of many critics. Really two thumbs up!
