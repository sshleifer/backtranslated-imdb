In the line of love story of a innocent child, he has a distorted face and a shallow self-centered "valley girl" on the opposite side of the world who lives there, sharing a birth date with him and finding a great difference in both ends there life. What a great and worthy story line. But screenwriting and / or instruction in this story and / or editing is so poor that most of the story is to bring joy. Linda Hamilton's character is evil witch from mother's burden and comes back faster than bullets and for what purpose? Conflicts at a hat drop, conflict, conflict. Kate (California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mother and everyone, including the poor lady in the check-in counters at the airport, Len's adopted father, who is the most perfect, most thoughtful person alive and his wife and biological son's constant conflicts I really wanted to enjoy an impressive story, but only made me SMILE when all hatred and war ended. There were many vague or illogical incidents, which were not included in many stories. My wife and I looked at each other and asked myself, so much good cast and what a big story should be, so it can become so bad.
