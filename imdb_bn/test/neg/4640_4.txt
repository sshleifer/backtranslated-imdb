Another day - this movie will have to see another day to understand it. I enjoyed the experience of Shannon Doherty very well and I was very interesting to see Julian McMahon and Shenen appear together in the role played by the Stormdale. I can definitely achieve acting skills throughout the film, even the guidelines - but the plot ... what happened? I'm in a loss for the words because I'm still confused. I must remain loyal to actors who have done a really good job considering the madness of this plot. I would recommend you see it because despite the plot-madness I still will see over again.
