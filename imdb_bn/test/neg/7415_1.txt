I think this is my top ten bad films I've ever seen! There is like fade in every two minutes. If it is on TV, it will be previewed every 2-3 minutes. But I personally enjoyed seeing a scene: When a man is seen bathing in the hot water hole, and you do not see his whole body in a towel for about 10 seconds! It was the best scene in the whole film because you saw them in the Saskatchet but last 10 minutes when we saw her whole body. Plus, most of the deaths are screen and just shout or roar. And I was hoping to die in Saskatchet. But he will not shoot him and only 4 or 5 people have died in the whole film I hope 8 to 10 people die. Do not watch this movie. I give it an F-. Do not waste your time.
