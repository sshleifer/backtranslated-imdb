This is a joke, is not it? Lynch may not be produced as a TV show. What would he do if he was out of the money? Well, he got some dollars and got the pilot "done" and just messed up everything together and created this mess ... how can anyone see a failed pilot for a movie as an excellent movie? <br /> <br /> Is everyone guessing about deep meanings? Well, wake up, no one! What was the name of another TV series like Lynch? The same way there. Create a mystery and then come with nothing. I think link will repeat this concept until people realize that there is no cloth of emperor. <br /> <br /> There is a comedian named Harper's Kerarling in Germany. She dressed as an opera singer and performs some new "art songs". Singing complete fools like this: <br /> <br /> "Wolf sheep. The lamb. <br /> <br /> This is now classic. <br /> <br /> However, he later discussed with the audience. And they were talking seriously about the deep meaning of the wolf / sheep's long relationship. <br /> <br /> You are giving this rating a rating of 8.0 on IMDb.com, you can be one of them. <br /> <br /> So, let's say together: "Hurt!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
