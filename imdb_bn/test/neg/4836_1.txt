And it is only January, yet I confirm it! <br /> <br /> So far, I'm one of the worst Swedish films and among the most prominent Swedish films. It has been claimed as "the real" and it can probably be seen for people who have never seen an English speaking film, for us those who have come to the movie in the last 10 years can not help it but Mons Marlin and Bj√∂rn Stein are the most successful since last week. Sitting on a weekend through the film and trying to combine it together in a Swedish package. Can I just say the results ... may be poor. The first story is only weak to begin, even when it is not a bad story, still bad, it is the desire to get together in very bad stories - the first attempt to make the Swedish action La Matrix failed, and then it's a really bad moral story. And if you thought it might not be worse, but there would be just a "great thing" to show for Sweden, because of the bad way that Sweden can see Hollywood movies - which we can not even try. For example, the main plot is to try to describe the game of youth computer as absolutely nothing, or deeply prepared, for example, "Storm" is about an Internet side and suddenly it's the main character consciousness - I really do not think Stein or Maryllin three of the movie You can see a point with the quadrangle, just by showing poor extra effects Them For the actors, I'm asking Eric Arinson to do a great job, without that the whole film does not do the same thing, even harder. Storm DD tries to be a movie for personal development, she does not change her bit. Acting way Jonas Karlson, good to be honest I thought he was a fairly respected actor but had judged Storm ... he really would have to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scars. Eventually Eva Ross is in addition to both her character and her performance in critics. The only reason is that for the Archie Arsenon 1/10, the storm does not succeed and I can say, at least try it.
