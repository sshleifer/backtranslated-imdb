I did not see the same movie as the comment here. First of all, I think they could serialize Ghost Story if they were taking it to the film. The shredded version that came with them was awful. I felt the performance of mentality and the rest of the story was so outstanding that the performance of masters such as Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbank seemed to be Hammy. Although Alice was pretty fantastic as the crease EVA. Craig Wasson was a good actor but he was just as adequate as the protagonist. The decision to play Patricia Nilak and seal her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft did with that character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production value was dark and the pens were slow. A frustrating, pedestrian effort <br /> <br /> This book is one of the five greatest mysteries of the 20th Century / horror novel, IMHO. But the film was frustrating, although the crew had a great role to play.
