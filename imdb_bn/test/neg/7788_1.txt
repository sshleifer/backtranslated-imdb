To be honest, it's hard to do this film without your own vomiting. Thick animation does not help because it looks like the old video of the decade found in Morrison's 99 p. Still, it is better than a vague screenplay, which spends an extra amount of extra time like the problems of Bell's present day, with Straff's father's stuff and often with ruthless brutality - Choke - Two Anthropomic Mys. Spending elements of this malicious addendum may eat skin time, which you think will be important, such as Dickens's conversation and the main parts of its plot - the movie upgrades the game of 20 questions, for example, and may sometimes fail, the right order scene. Absolutely disappointing
