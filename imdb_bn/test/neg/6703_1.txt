Hi guys, this is my first review and I will choose the worst movie to review. Since I only watched 5 minutes but believe me you can not see the movie going anywhere. The act was frustrating, the camera work and the light seemed like it was shot and run by a 10-year old pack. There is no crime of 10 years. I could not take it anymore, I took off my strap, and took it from the DVD player, Adam DVD, the House and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you are like Colleen Fairylal fan, this movie might be your reason, because the character of the movie, Anthony, Colin Farel sees a look. But as far as it goes, he certainly will not have the ability to play the coil. I have given this movie a rating of 1 (horror) because there is no pardon in the drop down list cheers.
