This film has every clip of terrorism or plane crisis movie. However, it is not entirely inefficient, due to the good performance of Rowland, Lane and Smalwood (and probably NÃ¼rburg). <br /> <What surprisingly it is, but it is a computer animation that tries to pass as a live action scene. Boy, son of boy, SGI scene illustrated in 1984 in "The Last Starfighter" is better than those (illustrated after 17 years). Cheepnis feelings really send shivers down your spine. <br /> <br /> A teen, it can be a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
