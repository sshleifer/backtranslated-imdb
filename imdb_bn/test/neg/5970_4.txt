My mother and I went to see this picture because my brother was working in the US Peace Corps in the same set area. Through the Halfway Film, I decided that the claim that it did to fulfill it failed to measure, the title is disrespectful. The topic that talks about it can create an excellent documentary, but due to its poor execution, it kept me less educated about what I wanted to expect. I agree with Laura-Jane from Canada ("Strong message but attention.") I agree with this user that commenting on this movie-maker's narration-free style is opposite to Michael Moore, but I do not agree that it presents different perspectives and invites the viewer to make his decision. I agree with a user's comment that "the lesson is learned better when we can make decisions"; However, our decisions can not be anything else, but if we are weakly established, then we are presented with little relevant information to present them to them. <br /> <br /> The original points of the documentary seem to be 1st) African folks who live near Victoria Lake suffer very poor and widely. 2) Launch of the Victorian Parch introduced by Europeans, destroyed its ecosystem. 3) The neighboring communities of Lake Victoria are economically dependent on the economy. <br /> <br /> What I can say about this movie is that the efforts of average human beings in sub-Saharan Africa, unfortunately, are a contrast between films, and it is a universal, inevitable event, rather than a defective economic system to illustrate poverty. Tried. I like the ridiculousness of huge quantities of fish left in the face of famine. I congratulate the United Nations team engaged in this region to show how touching people were with the touch. Like most of the documentary "woman" in the title, this film fails to do a good job representing women's voice - the interviews in interviews are more than men. Maybe I thought maybe the film would be a second time to get some major points, but I failed to identify the role of the Victoria Lake virtual lake in SÃ¶pper and the relationship of Africans in relation to unjust conditions. To the lake. In addition, I could have been wrong, but it hurt me that Supar could improve his interview skills. He not only questions asked and he appears to be arbitrary in response, but he seems to have a real punch for making interviews awkward and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most compelling development of the film is the nail export is now working to import weapons and the actual economic losses on Tanzania are war, not fishing. Sadly, Saipar has stepped away from this idea completely (or at least interviewing the reporter with what he is saying about what he is saying about the surgery) and approached the "decision for himself" approach. <br /> <br /> Darwin's nightmare means that the first world exploitation of the Third World gives them "good living opportunities", but it does not work well. Describing whether the United States and Europe's arms manufacturing industry is responsible for most armed conflict worldwide, it did not do a good job. If it illustrates how people portray prostitution, it did not do a good job. If it is illuminated in the light of the UN's inability to run its mission, it did not do a good job. If it is understood that the small income Tanzanian earns from the nail, it is not worth the cost of tinkering people with nature to make a profitable product, it does not do a good job. If it is meant that Tanzania will be much better than the Europeans never came, it did not work well.
