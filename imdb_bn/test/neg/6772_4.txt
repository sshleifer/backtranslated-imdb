Danny is out of sorrow <br /> <br /> She makes the same mistake, and is no longer attractive to watch. At first I can think of myself as a addict. My heart went to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went on the line. Often he continues this behavior to continue the program, and at the same time has seriously endangered his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It is also difficult to express regret for the poor boy. I think he should see this show, then he might have a chance to protect his marriage. I do not understand how Gertenon is with him, and I am just wondering how much to show, and how much love. Danny, get a life - that's a new one! ... and me. Do not start from Gary. What's with him and his face? Its skin looks like it stretches to the highest. Even then, it does not seem to be something, yet he does not feel particularly neutral. I think, that too, he is going for his own financial gains and is not often for Gretchen or Danny's best interests. These folks are a few confused and remind me of a dog behind each of his dogs. Sorry, very sad. Drag together.
