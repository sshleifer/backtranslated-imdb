I saw this movie in the theater and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Ooliver becomes worse in the sequel, I'm the biggest intolerance that I can not empty. Junior was upset with his father because he did not go to school, which made his father Ben mad mad. Also Crazy Dance Passenger Operator is not justified by junior for letting him go for a ride. And as the serial killer of the London Demo Junior is terrible as terrible because he threatened to insult Jr. so I could not bear the movie. Even if the movie is re-released in the theater for an extended version, I will not see this movie, because this movie is not something I can not bear. Actually, it stinks!
