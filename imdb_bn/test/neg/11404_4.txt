The Dutch movie since 2002 has finally been good again. This movie is still part- and Dutch is a schoolboy example of bad times. <br /> <br /> The story is called useless in flashback style. All the 'current' sequences in France are completely unnecessary and do not add anything to stories, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find the need to say the story of a Croatian. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> It was not always clear what the movie is trying to do and what it is trying to say. The story of a young girl in love story of a young overcrowding boy, which may well be quite psychologically, seems to be good enough in paper and even Paul Varhawane's "Turk Fruit" shows some similarity, which is often compared to this movie before And its release time. However the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the true emotions, which is due to the unexpected performance from the actors. As it is said in the story, the film always keeps it from being interesting or engaging. I lost interest in this film for about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> While making this film, both Antony Camerling and Angela Shizif were encouraging both with great potential and ambition, but their careers. Now many are dry by. Angelina Shizoff seems to pay more attention to her family than her career (of course this is not a bad thing), when Anthony Camerling tried to start her career in Hollywood. She got nothing more than playing a little part of Renee Harleen's flop. I'm not surprised to be honest. This is not a bad actor and he must have found the right face, but in his English it is not fair enough, not good enough. Just listen to speaking in English at the beginning of this movie and you will understand what you mean. They are not really bad actors but for some reason it does not appear in this movie. It's probably due to poor dialogue. I still like Wife Van Erven Dorens. He has played a lot but his performance seems very normal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of saying bad and unwanted stories, it creates a bad film . <br /> <br /> 4/10
