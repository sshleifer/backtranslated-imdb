This is a familiar event, Mr Segal can not laugh, he can work, he can hit, smile, there is no real smile, and no real point of view of this confusing movie. We are Wesley McLaren, a weight more, who is a Western McLaren, who feels desperate for her haircut and her real daughter, Ayacco, was present as her office assistant. Story: Okay, Wesley survived another vacuum with her sweet girl Holly. After sitting and enjoying their red flower tea and omelet and other parts of the city, some weight militia leaders decided to spread the whole city to the air by spreading a virus that spread sick and died in two days, thinking that he died. She was an antidote. Problems, no antidote and whatever exists, hold the virus only for some time. The CIA is contacted and even they can not help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter is Holly. So he thinks he is victim of the victim's prey hunting. Wesley leads her daughter to catch up and takes her grandfather, who is a native Indian. Together with his sister law they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure, even if the soldiers are going to die even slowly and others will not get time remedies, others will also be in it. And to reduce this moment, Anne or Wesley is not infected by the virus ... Hmm. A weak battle scene. Awesome movie and the great need of all the ladder ladder master.
