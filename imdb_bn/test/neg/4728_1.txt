This is not true story. This is the most dark potential fiction received from events. It is committed to suicide, attracted to death, generally organized religion (and especially the Anglican Church), with absolutely unrealistic favor and generally giving a filmless, pointless outlook, which I think the filmmakers, who want to go away, their poverty and their hopes of despair . <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone would recommend this true presentation, however, many false advertisements. Do you like the real story? Rent 'Fairy Tale'. That's the real story. See if you can find any correspondence between the information presented in both cases. I found only one: Girls were pre-pubescent by creating original photographs.
