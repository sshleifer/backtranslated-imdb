Newyork's independent filmmaker Andy Millington ordered these little "treatments" as the Swine Todd legend version. Swini slits throats customers of her barbershop and her classmate Mrs. Lovett turns her into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well-known about the plot before watching this film travesty. Milligans, for my money, will actually be led by the worst managers of all times. Looks like Orson Wells compared to Ed Wood. This movie is so bad in so many ways. Let's take the instructions of MILIGAN to start. The film quality is grainy. Sound quality is grainy. Many scenes seem like Miligun is using Camcoder in the film. Credit "and directed by Andy Milligan. She wants to take credit for the roof showing after the scene of death? What is the score of selected extremist music for the film? Cut the film with a poor conversion after another one. The plot was created using the Little Logitz. The story is a little with Tod's real legend. The kill scene is not very dangerous but in any way. Hands, feet, and other supplements are cut off efficiently: Sticky! And take the breasts in its pie breasts. Yes, it's there. Does the pie maker know that a whole breast with nipple is filled with a complete pie crust? Later we have heard from our characters that they "have been careful to get caught" for more than 200 murders. Obviously they are not able to adopt a couple which is happening (sad was very tempting). Actors are not too horrible to be honest. Some even have talent glimmers, and all seem to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are compelled. Milligan has some issues related to seemingly sex. Plot strands have left untied. The late camera is almost unwatchable due to the end of the work. I could go and Did I like something about the film? Not much to be truthful According to low budget and limited genius, I have high level recognition for these films, but this movie has no real purpose other than being filthy and ill.
