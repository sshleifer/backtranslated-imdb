I never want to see this movie! <br /> <br /> It's not terribly bad, but I can not see my hero Stain Laurel so old and sick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> The plot is simple foolhardy only. Actors surrounded by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were really really bad and Larry and Hardy had fun in any of their previous movies! <br /> <br /> I do not warn you, the pictures will bother you for a long time!
