This movie was pure genius. John Waters Bright. It's ridiculous and I'm not sick to see it about 20 times before buying it a few months ago. The acting is great, although Ricki Lake may be good. And Johnny Depp spanking. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And to watch most of Johnny's movies, maybe it's my favorite. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
