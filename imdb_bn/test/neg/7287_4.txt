I am less and less excited about the continuation of Disney in movies. Yes, I understand that the budget is not the same for direct video of the video, but these movies do not even try. Hanback II and Tarzan and Jane are some examples. If anyone can see a preview of Stich-the Movie, you will see my point. But I digress, this movie reaffirms my point. The animation is soft, the lines of the story are similar to cartoons on Saturday morning, and the main voices are not all. I was very disappointed to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. Millo's voice was trying to sound like Fox, but it did not come near to succeed. <br /> <br /> If it says something, my kids do not sit in the entire movie of 10 and 6 years old.
