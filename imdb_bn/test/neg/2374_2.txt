I always said that there is nothing to lose the original form: Comics. I have proven again. It comes like the other films, the Estheric series, fails to be influenced. The creators of this movie do not find that the reasons for the success of other other comic-movie-movie (X-Men, Superman Atoll.) Are that they are all detached from the original version and more watchable to create it. Agreed, this film was disconnected, in that sense the film was a cross of two Ashiks books, namely. Asterix and Great Crossing and Asterix and Normans. Also, love interest was introduced for the main character of the Asthenics series (Aststerics and the preservation of secret surgeries). At the end of all this was a childish immature story. The fun part was very low and far away. Above all, the total waste of time and money is watching it, even in theaters, even at home.
