I love Juan Picker-Simon! He was my best favorite bad film director and throughout the career, he tried to successfully cash in every contemporary trend in helplessly awful and fantastic styles. After the big hit "Superman", JP made his own and sunny "Supersonic Man", he picked up the fierce slash-movie madness with insane "Pieces" and he really "The Return of It" ", Spielberg's SF-Blockbuster Unauthorized and lonely comedic series. "The Rift" is evidently in the movie "The Abyss" and "Deepstarter Six". Inspired by the Ridge, to start from the beginning, you can ridicule yourself by looking at all the stolen ideas and shameless rip-offs of these (and other) classics, when a completely new and innovative submarine near the Danquin Refuge disappears, Then send the second mission to U-boat designer Wieck Heis to investigate what happened to Seren Wein. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers a water cave where the government secretly examines the mutant sea creatures. The monsters are quite aggressive but there is danger of a government enemy among crew members ... "The Rift" is a forgotten movie, however Is it still cool ?? Although very dodgy ?? Giant model. Supporters of blood and holes will not complain, for example, shocking attacks are very dangerous and ruthless. Although acting is very wood, some cast names certainly can certainly do. It is advisable that you only enjoy clich√©s and gary effects in "The Rift" because if you start thinking about the screenplay you will not get it completely sensible.
