This night was going on for two nights during ITV 1. Dear Oh dear. Someone actually bought it with the power of Robert Carlos .. All right, I missed the start. But what I saw was so bad, no ... I was embarrassed for those of them. There was nothing based on the reality, I doubt that what is going on in this film will be progressing. Everything was poor about this movie. OK, CGI .. but no reality. Writing suddenly gave the last impression of a mountain hander ... I was not sorry. Yes, the formula. The last guess was not possible. I have seen that the military was above the top, with heroic things people could not have time to do their work, so did not it happen? It was worse than leaving your brain on the door. It was annoying .. someone else said .. yes, exactly .. Of course that happened ... no !! Credit and credit mentioning Canada. So it was a co-production, missed the third party concerned. .. I have to check back on this site. I'm generally not critical of this, but this bothered me.
