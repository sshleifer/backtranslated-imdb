The film is a series of films that require a certain step, cleverness, intelligence, and imagery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently expensive expensive visuals are the work of the director who has tried to be tricky and unfortunately failed due to a serious lack of cerebral power. The acting sub-parameter was just plain bad. The story was rescued by a true writer and director, but I suspect that such people could not touch it with the band's pole. <br /> <br /> In about 1/4 way, I found interesting matches with the scenes in Simone where Victor, frustrated to get rid of his actress, made the world's worst film. I want to check IMDB whether this film has had similar effects, and I am surprised. I would be tempted to give 2 out of 10 because it opened violent groups, but I will not do it. It's that bad.
