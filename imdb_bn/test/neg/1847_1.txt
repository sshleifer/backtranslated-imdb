It should be one of my worst movies that I've ever seen unfortunately. The general concept of a cosmic mass emission by striking the planet Earth with EM distortion is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that people could survive 155ÂºF? The act was so horrific that I was thinking that casting agents caught some people in Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. All the honesty I have seen in less wood than played from my ironing board. Sorry, but this image is poor, poor, poor.
