I can always say that I am enjoying a movie, how many times I have my legs, cross switches, a little flashing, etc. Low = good I went so many times throughout this film that I found my friend's strong tube of popcorn and a strong wooding practice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a number of disappointments: Number two: Chris Klein was in it: Chris Cleine's line of disappointment was the number three: Number four: Chris Klein played a Valedictorian Oh, the dummy gathered from the rich family! Even worse, he really tried to work, but Outdated In the increasingly spontaneous independent version of the Dimile film, you can hear your American Pies humping back. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible in almost every sense, while maintaining a humblely respected performance like Josh Hartnette's lead stooge boyfriend Josepper. Thankfully, he was trying to "moment" much more against all other characters  ে বিরত থাকেন। অবশ্যই, তিনি বিশ্রাম চেয়ে অনেক ভাল এবং তিনি আসলে এখানে কিছু সূক্ষ্ম দেখায়। আপনি যদি জোশ পছন্দ করেন বা এমন কিছু বাচ্চাকে কাস্ট করার কথা ভাবছেন যিনি কিছু জিনিস জানেন তবে তিনি আপনার লোক। <br/> <br /> Hartnet is a sharp actor, but there is no need for everyone else. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (bad for heartnote in this terrible movie) <br /> <br />
