The Mighty Ducks is nothing but a football knockout, the film proved to be boring in most respects. This was a time where parents ask you to take your younger siblings so that they do not have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters like it, but it is proven to be much more powerful than Metis Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia de Abo was hot and Steve Gutenberg was still in the job at that time.
