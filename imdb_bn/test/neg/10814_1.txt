The movie "The Cave" has been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was no plot, no storyline, and the light was terrible. In most cases, I did not understand the visibility because it was being highlighted by flashlight. The 'gray' space running throughout the film was annoying. The only scene that really came out is that it is considered bad simulation of the condition found in hell. All in all, watching movies was not really valuable. If the producers can not bring anything better than this, then they should find another job. The water scenes were particularly awkward, and the performers were seen occasionally by creating mostly bubbles and flashlights. In short, a really terrible movie with bad light, across exotic flashes.
