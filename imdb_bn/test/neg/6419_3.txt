Was a college acting class exercise film and released as a movie? For those who do not like horror films, a "horror" sub-opera's formulated poster and styled release will be able to tell, but yes, they saw a horror movie. It also features soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Do books fall around the library? Do you cry off the door? Then this flick is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When you were raped, was it easily ignored, because the rapist was a cold boy? This movie is not terrible but the filmmaker's perspective <br /> <br /> And then small twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen any horrific films before, who do not want to see anybody now and want to see another glimpse of those who plot against strange kids.
