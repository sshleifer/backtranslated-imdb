I keep watching it because it looks like the plot is going somewhere. When it went ambiguously there I was very frustrated. I'm going to tell you what happened to the next sentence. But maybe I will not. Maybe I'll just implying something will happen The authors lack any imagination. It's not even a "B" movie - it's made for a TV "B" movie
