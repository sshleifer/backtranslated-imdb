This picture is about a gap between the real world and the world of the dead. Mumbo-jumbo (i.e., if you install any program on the computer you will see dead people - if you want to run the videotape, you will die on RINGU). Frankly, most of them were silent and lost me. What I find interesting is that the dead live in their own separate existence - completely alone for eternity <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen huge numbers compared to most Americans. However, in recent years there has been a trend that has not been very well related to these horror movies. I know they are very popular - especially because they think that they are often rebuilt in the states. I saw both both RINGU as well as the ring, junior and grudge and were rather ambivalent in spite of their popularity. I really liked Japan from the only recent horror film - the reissue of the magnificent British movie, a scene at WET Afternoon. And what, I think, made different seasons? Well, as well as other films, Cairo, Gob and money were not spent on special effects or to scare the audience - instead, the story was emphasized. The following line is that these other films jumped to the horror of viewers as horrible as Halloween or Friday 13th American movies, and the plot was completely secondary (best). For me, I want the story - not as the main focus of cheap thrills or ghost pictures. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know that I am a minor, but I did not find it a very satisfactory film. Often, small things can happen that something that can ride a little bit - but the characters start crying and crying, and saying that "this is the greatest film of all time that you want to start vibrating well". Well, I think it's very hard to try and I hope to look at the end of the film in the next life and further progress - the tactics are not afraid.
