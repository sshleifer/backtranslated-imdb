I was 12 years old when I released this movie. The song was inspirational and it felt good to me, it was seen several times in the movie. I was actually a soundtrack album and played over the song. <br /> <br /> After 26 years ... I'm ashamed. I just saw my two daughters sitting there who enjoyed it much, but my angry elder big eyes hated it. It was directed very badly in many places and it was really directed by Lionel Jeffrey that I wanted to enjoy. The character animation was so rough still the background was quite good. I reminded the critics that it was a poor movie and was scared, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> Now it's an old film, which can be compared to yes, so I think it was good then. But for this it does not forgive for poor performance, direction and frustration. The voice of the original child actor's voice sounds very confusing. It did not quite get what they were trying to achieve at the time of its creation, it became a weak film.
