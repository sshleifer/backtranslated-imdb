Crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how a pompous and self-important film with a message is. Haggis tried very hard to highlight his point and got into almost every section of the film. It feels very much in love with its own feelings of social relevance and has a jackhammer all subtlety on the forehead. Definitely, race relations affect everyone and there is ambiguity in this, but the universe of the crash suggests that we are victims of our own perceptions of the nation. This is a tiring thread that repeats the advertising gutter and welcomes it in the first 30 minutes. I found out the results of the vague and forced letters and the film sputter forever and took away. In the top 50 movies on IMDB, this is a rule of the will of the people to try this image of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you want a real "crash" check out David Krenburg's one: dark, twisted and original. These photos are televised, tired, and play as masochistic.
