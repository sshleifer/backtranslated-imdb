Being a huge fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I am looking forward to being deceived by many honesthearted, realism and humorous other French beach romances. The same director, the same actress- what could be wrong? Unfortunately, Palin is a huge disappointment in La Plange. It is very slow and conversational that inserts insight into the dialog characters, it would be good, meaningful, or original. But it comes as a common soap opera between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous complaints. The only thing that protects this movie from complete disaster is the development of character with Polyline or "change of character" The source material is standard rent (sexual awakening during a beach beach holidays) but it may be a decent film, although the letters are quite interesting. Unfortunately that is not the case. Although there are other flaws in the rohohar season cycle, the next most of the films are definitely leagues on this one.
