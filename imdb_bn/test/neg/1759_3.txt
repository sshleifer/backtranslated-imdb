I think the first 90 minutes of this movie are very interesting, although some of its parts were ridiculous (such as the character of Philip Semu Hoffman). Last 60 minutes was boring and I started losing interest in this movie. The last hour was lasting forever. <br /> <br /> The picture is beautifully played and I can see why Renn received the Gelghiger Academy Award because her character was so interesting. The film is beautifully illustrated and the story is a passionate. However, I think the message is bad: these days of Hollywood are not surprising. In this story, "Inman" (Juda Law) evicted the Confederate army during the civil war. The reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He was discouraged with the war. (Can you imagine if soldiers who left the army in two world wars in the same boat?) <br /> <br /> Yet, these movies are perfectly acceptable in this film. So again, what is the Liberal film maker a wonderful thing to say about the US military ?? In order to add their left-wing slant, they represent resilators with a vigilant-like outfit running like cold blooded killers. Well, in the world of movies, as we know: it is portrayed as good as bad and bad ... and only Liberals will represent the desert heroes.
