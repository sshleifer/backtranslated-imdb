Generally for the movie reviewer, I try to be constructive and motivated, but there is only one word for this, namely, "Movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! Conversations, acting, special effects, intrigues, sets, and characters all feel as if they were made, well, my potted tree. For all that is good and right on this earth, do not see this! :)
