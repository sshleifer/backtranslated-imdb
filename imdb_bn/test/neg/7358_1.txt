If you see distraction, another intermediary ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just bad, very bad. Instead of living in Japan, we all are in Spain with English speakers. It is interesting that one shot from this movie does not look like Spain and is completely back to the studio. There is a place with oh and swing because there is no 5 minutes of swing footage with some of them, how wonderful is ahoha <br /> <br /> This is terrible in every way imaginable. Laminator does not help the subject of acting on mom and dad at all. Anna Pauquin is the only person who has provided good performance in the film but I hate Ana Panchin, so you can imagine my own personal hell to see this picture. <br /> <br /> There is a good moment in the film, when a villain Anna trying to explain the final plot of Anna Pauquin's character, and he can not understand what it is and ask a bunch of stupid questions and he "you IDIOT, you did not understand anything ! " Hah hah Well, I understand this picture is a piece of junk. 0 stars.
