Sometimes such a large cast of ugly people did not come together to create even the ugly movie. <br /> <br /> There are some huge and horrible hugs in the water on the Florida coast, which awakens some half-fat body behind them. Bull beer-based Bob thinks he's holding "The Bad Voices" of Tape Things. Bob's assistant, surprisingly unreasonable and painful skinny Stella decided that thin female male Peter, who can help with the help of an electrician, can help her to identify the mysterious creature. But anyone who breaks his nose far enough in the mysteries, he dies, kills Babu and strikes him with the bad people. What is the terrible secret behind Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> On the brutal issue of the ugly scientists, the unarmed police and doctor raising the number of dead bodies, Stella and Peter come out of the beach and those characters we do not care about are killed or processed. Sea killer, a strange combination of octopus, a shark and a big tooth pair, sometimes it does not seem to be a threat. Conspiracy behind the creation of the giant does not give any knowledge. Which of the characters is not particularly preferred, and which can be stopped immediately. It's a bad shot, badly doped, plots less mess. The whole thing is so fun and sweet, it makes me long for a hot bath. I've had a sushi plate scarier than this film. Avoid it until the MSST3 version is released.
