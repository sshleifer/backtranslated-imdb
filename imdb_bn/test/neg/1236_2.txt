Agustus and the call really did nothing? Why are they heroes they do not do anything else then get place after the death of bad boys? What was the point of this show? I was very disappointed. I hope to see more action, more stories, and the birth of Heros and Great Deeds. Instead I saw very little, it seems like Augustus and the call is just the side story on behalf of Indian Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that history is too close. They did little to show why they fought each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this movie was Jahan, who played Gus very nicely and was a great actor. A lot of good stories may have gone waste. It was sad and I did not see it that I wish.
