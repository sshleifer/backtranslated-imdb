Although big coins are not fans of the brothers, I am a supporter of their dark hilarity movie like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing'. I was less impressed by their other comic modes, Incognito camp (or Camp Goffi?) Unfortunately, 'O brother, where are you art?' Falls into the next section and is not as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'Hooper Proxy'. <br /> <br /> 'O Brother' is an inclusive series series, and not all that much humor or cleverness without basically a point. Most critics have mentioned, the film's plot is too loose ?? And, as far as I can say, quite deliberately ?? Based on ODC. His main character, Ulysses Everton McGill (George Clon√©e), returned home after returning home to his homeric named 'Adventure' and his 'Real' round to marry his wife Panie. Of course, we did not discover it after long after taking care of the character of Clony / Uleses. And Homer will have to do with the "Cool Hand Look" disciplined force, Ku Klux Clan joins a la "Indiana Jones" meeting, an embarrassed lawyer's vocabulary, blue-grass country music genius, an association with baby-looking nelson, a Clark Gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sunny character features and encounters? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, visitors to the small Scrabble comedy classics of Sturgers may be rewarded for accepting the title of socially conscious frustration film, which hopes to refuse Hollywood and comedy. And they may even be generously submissive by a few shot / rock scenes (eg to see the Hoping freight car and chain gang Shafle movie). But so what? Much of the moral superiority of Kun Bhai's art works does not seem to be associated with controversial artistic activities. They probably fall into the East School, but that does not seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. This is a tribute? If so, why is it? I like post-modern pop culture references and syllabus as the next person, but it is not contradictory, if not consistent, at least some of the tactically when it is very inferior ?? And not just an arbitrary concoction. <br /> <br /> This playplay is simply a stupid mess. Only consistent, and consistently delightful, material folk / sound music is soundtrack. There is not much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the film is probably the best thing to do. On the other hand, I'd recommend using soundtrack CD admission rates.
