Some people want to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek Shows, because it insists on the development and continuity of character and has more complex backgrounds and ongoing plots. This makes it more satisfying in some ways, but in many ways the show completely fails. <br /> <br /> The series starts as a soap opera at the space station, a non-inactive mistress about two full-length season of science fiction stories. Characters are a good bunch, and most actors are honest, but I think writers have tried very hard to "normalize" them. By "normal" they are actually "common and tiring". <br /> <br /> At the end of the second episode we get acquainted with the Dominican, who wanders for a while, finally starts a fight with a good boy. Season five The original "story" of this show is stressed, but it only takes a fraction of the whole series. We are still seeing lamas stand alone episodes, heroes are still trapped in strange planets for twenty-five minutes and there are very few comedy comedy featuring Greedy, Gupta Fareeni. Many episodes are only neutral, and some obsolete. <br /> <br /> Dominion, the main villains of the DS9 are dependent on the galatak dominance for these convenient reasons, since they just do not like anyone. The whole war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Influential pyrotechnic spaceships emerge from the three segments of the ocean, with many frequencies, but these are guided on a very straightforward route, such as two huge boats of super-advanced starships flying each other right and exploding. The author of DS 9 (gifted Ronald D. Moore, later with the "Blaster Galactica" reputation) has shown their solidarity with the war, but the heart is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The persistent story is very shiny and clearly clear to be gripping, and the characters do not develop in really interesting ways. Both "Babylon 5" and "Blaster Galactica" fulfilled the commitment made by DS9, and made everything better. For Star Trek, stay with the original and next generation.
