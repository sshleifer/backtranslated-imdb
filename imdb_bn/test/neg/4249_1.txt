I did not like to see DS9 compared to other Star Treks and even Enterprise, but I did not like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I only read the old news that Paramount had stolen the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but they did not choose to file a case that I do not know or care about, but as a star trek series, I see no other bad show than bare, I Speaking about the series when mentioning the DS9 will even condemn anyone. True, TNG, and Viagara are my favorites. I do not understand why everyone thinks DS 9 is great and I do not do it, but I know I know. The captain has a real rage problem and I hate people who are cold, but somewhere somewhere. And he thinks every episode.
