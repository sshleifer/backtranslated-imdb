The plot for Black Mama White Uncle, about two female prisoners roamed in a female prison in the Philippines. One black, and one white. These two women were thrown into prison. Palm Grey is Harry for the dance as a girl, Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in the narcotic women's prisons. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend carries her portions of her benefit, from her drug-beneficial activities. Lee is primarily interested in stopping the money from the fishermen's drug money, so that he can take a good life from the Philippines. Margaret Markov is the white woman of a special background, Karen Brent, who is a revolutionary.

Both of them have been wrist together in the wrist. They run away, they also fight each other, because they have different goals to follow. Naturally, they hate to be chained together. But they realize that they have to keep their differences apart, when they avoid capturing, they help each other to survive. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks like Big Bird Chevrolet, it has many cast two photos in it, as well as their location in the Philippines. Roger Krrmann has always had consistent stability of actors, which he used in all 70's movies. In addition to Palm Grey, Syd Hagg, Roberto Collins, Claudia Jennings, Batty Anne Reese and William Smith were among most actors, who were also on Crimson's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Big bird cage, black mama White Mama, to be palatable to be dependent on excessive intense violence. Palm Grayer shows his usual tough cock personality in this film, and his performance shows as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov has little influence in the revolutionary Karen's illustration. He seems to be just a fragile political guerilla, fragile and well-coiffed. Apart from Sid Hag, like the colorful Ruben, the rest cast is wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have a little entertainment value, unless the violence of violence is your thing. Pam Greyer and Siege Heig's only actors are eligible to watch this movie.
