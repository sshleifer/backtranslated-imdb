Actually, except for my age, I saw it for the first time after the first time I left the video (perhaps it was a beta tapes?) And I could drink it completely (probably) and probably some of me had wondered how wonderful this movie was! I thought it was cool and it would have to admit a pretty bad film. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and poor performance just makes it worse. It can be a poor effort to imagine more than a hundred people, "Manverix" (although I was surprised that it was actually published as the "Top Gun" at the same time (Aprox) and in reality it was not meant as a poor imitation.) But It's worth it for all - if I find it my observer and I have time. This is a movie you watch because it is very ridiculous and tries very hard to take it seriously. "Trailer Moment" with other Trafolta and Lily Tamlin - like another "superb" movie ... do not start me!
