When I voted for my "1" vote for this photo, I noticed that 75 of the 75 total votes cast 75 votes. This means that half of the people who voted for this movie really look terrible. I saw it at a film festival long ago and I was really unimpressed by it's poor execution. Cinematography is strangely, the word is bad, the story gets stuck on the cut and other movies and the act is horrific. This movie is basically a poor rip-off of three other films. This thought has never been published in the United States.
