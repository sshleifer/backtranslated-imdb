I expected this movie to be absolutely awful God. Like "what a dream can come" or "truman show" or something. Well they sold it to my local HMV for 3.99 pounds and it was on the cover of Juvani Ribiji, you know that you can not help but love him, and so my friends dared to buy it. And I was sure it's going to be a trash. Perhaps I can sit through this movie, because my standards have never been high.
