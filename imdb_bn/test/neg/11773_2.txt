I saw this at Sundance, and I do not understand why it won the direct prize. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. This is a type of movie that just praises the Film Festival Snowsbes, who think that many movies have to be the same as them. <br /> <br /> This year seems to be trying to make the Sun's jury aware. Underground, very low budget movie awards. That's all good and good, but this awful, dragging mess looks like a movie movie. Mini-DV shot a fierce look for an insane film due to a snow-covered gray winter shot. <br /> <br /> Some motifs (snakes) die without adding some stories. And make no sense as a symbol. <br /> <br /> Now, it was not bad at all. His role as a mother with sheep drugstore a drug problem is remarkable. He's going to the place, and he will be claiming it. His co-star Hugh Dillon also did a good job. Actually, there are many beautiful moments in this movie, but they do not fit very well together.
