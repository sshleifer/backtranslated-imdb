I do not understand people here The film is not something bad that some people say here is bad. It's okay without De Kok. The film problem is mainly the script. Characters are not trusted. Sex is okay, but psychology behind humans makes very little sense. The film does not look good, but what do you expect? The video was shot in the video for very little money. Of course it does not look like normal movies, duh! One thing I agree is that music is bad. Sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from '80. The film is not good, okay, but you have to pay some credit to draw it without any money.
