This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually sit in a van dam movie, because usually they laugh and do not need to worry too much. This one has no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> There is a distinct lack of plot, humor, acting, direction etc. <br /> <br /> I did not go out of the movie during the movie, though I have stopped here. <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs.
