Guy Pierce looks almost like Flin, and this duplication can claim this film only. Flin's autobiography, not to mention the close rehearsed character, is a speculative concept facing homosexuality, and movie claims that Flin's poor use of local labor is illegal. Director Franck Hauson did not make any memorable movie, and I found him irreverently available for his abusive career abuses. <br /> <br />
