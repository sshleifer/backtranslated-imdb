Well the names in the essence will tell you everything. Fred O'Neill Roy - The modern modern king of low budget, whether it is for TV or direct video (I doubt he is ready for the silver screen - Drive in B-Movie Double Features and All). <Br / <br /> <br /> Like the creator of religion (?) Like the classic, Hollywood Chess hookers and the dinosaur island .... <br /> <br /> I like these things. It's mostly entertaining (one obviously in Chess, Camp, and especially in a cheap way) and if he is one thing, then he is a pro-something that you can not tell for the sake of the movie. <br /> <br /> But here is one glance among its oevre weakens. Insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes are a matter of minutes to get your brain numb. You are real F.O.R. Is out for Goodness (or rather bad), for the above mentioned people and generally its content is seen in the 70's and 80's (I think he recently lost a bit of his side).
