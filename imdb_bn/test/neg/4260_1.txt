So far, the most kind of movie came with Indian cinema or any movie. It is completely a valve. It does not hold any water in the story line odes. To make such a shameful film, such a respected actor has become so humble that it is shameful. He lost a little respect forever. Instead of making many fools, they should retire and lose their self-esteem. I will not recommend this movie to any one. Besides, I would recommend that Amitabh will retire earlier. I wonder how IMDB has given some recommendations in this movie. Any movies that can be recommended can be so awesome. Similar movies like Devdas have done a serious injustice to a great movie like this movie. Its overall I could say shameless
