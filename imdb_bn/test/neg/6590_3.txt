Yes, it may not be historically correct (in fact, only 9 soldiers were killed in the 9th round), and yes, it is something that is wrong and overwhelming (machines machine guns or Afghanistan that never had that "history lesson" anyone wins - Educated Russian officials know much better than history - for example, take British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, this is not the million-dollar special effects of Hollywood-style, but it is the most powerful point to show the lives of the soldier, their relationship, and their feelings when best friends die in front of their eyes. In my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all things. <br /> <br /> Again, in the movie it has weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it seems to be one of the most powerful Russian movies for the past few years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
