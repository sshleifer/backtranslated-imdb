Ron Howard and his "editors" were just a work ... follow the book's instructions that are "rich", "mysterious", "running" and very cinematic in his way! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They changed everything and I understand everything! Is there something left in the "Angels and Demons" that has no right? <br /> <br /> I really love the book and it looks very difficult to treat it this way! <br /> <br /> I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown's "film". <br /> <br /> I have no patience to sit down and have correctly changed 1.000.000, it is in vain .......
