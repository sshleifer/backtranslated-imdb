After all, tell me that I do not deny the importance of the matter - quite the opposite. I was Polish and I was aware of the Catten genocide for a long time (in fact, two members of my family had died), so I was waiting for this photo. Unfortunately, I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is with the script, which includes many subpages and letters, none of which are properly upgraded. Characters are painfully one-dimensional; Their stories are intertwined, but lack the overall meaning. In my opinion Caste does not really have the opportunity to show their power. The exception is Andreas Chara, the photo is Zerji - the only interesting character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I watched it, if I could see the simple reasons For the sake of being removed - but actually I did not see the final execution scene and gave a strange idea of ​​each other's isolation. It works well and it is attractive to establish and provides a climatic ending, even though the executed officers gather together to think that the idea of ​​prayer to the Lord is somewhat remote. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think there may be some educational value for those who are not familiar with illustrated historical events, but in my opinion it fails as a film's work.
