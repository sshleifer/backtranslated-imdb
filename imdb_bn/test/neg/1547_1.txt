When I was 15, I bought this movie in a garage sale. Then I hated it and to see it again, I saw it again, it's worse now. You "zoom, zoom, zoom !!!" You can listen to the director and the cameraman in the background by pressing commands like this. No special effects, meat is a raw material that is supposed to be in the brain. It's absolutely unclear, and I basically had a kind of home movie or something I bought. But it was distributed elsewhere and it was just strange to know it by other weird people. Oh, I need 10 lines ... Well .... It might be an interesting topic to see a budget movie before the discovery of a digital camera. This sucks. Indeed, yes watch this to see if you can just sit through the worst. If you can make it through it, then you can do something through it.
