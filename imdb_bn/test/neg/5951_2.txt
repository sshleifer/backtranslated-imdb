I totally agree that reenactments might otherwise be a great show. I will admit that I saw 1 or 2 episodes in the last season and it was not clear by all being restored. But when I caught a recent episode, it suddenly jumped a long time to me and I immediately lost interest. Then I noticed the waiver at the beginning before an episode followed. Someone followed me enough to tell me, did they really "act" and used some more artificial means, or have I not noticed before. I'm usually quite good at sensing these things, but the recent episode is so obviously artificial I trip over it. Now I have no interest and it has been completely abandoned. It does all the scripts and plays if it does not have any real value. And at least recently, it seems to be scripting and acting very badly. The above comment says, who will do it if it works for all reconsideration. Without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "what happened to you once this guy" heresay. It is well to read a book information.
