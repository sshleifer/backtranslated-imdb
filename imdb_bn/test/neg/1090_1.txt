Bad / Good Threat ... This movie has become officially "worst made for TV movie" in my book. Without the proposal of a camp price, I can give it 1 and 10 for the camp. Tip: See with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you want to throw something on the screen! Dear friends who like Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City Day' ... This movie is awesome fun. Of course, among all these cast members, the lowest points ... In the true sense, the lines are distributed as they do not know how to control the smile! Daniel J. Truvanti is absolutely unfortunate. Each participating school participates; And the poor Joan van Arc, I believe that he only took this ruthless serious theater ... though he was credited as a producer. Her "mother" is stealing the jeans and bad plastic surgery scene. When this movie introduces a psychological challenge in the plot, then he crosses the fine line of social failure. This is a vague movie which is shown as {{damaging intention}} listed in Lifetime ... Does anybody have any pleasure?
