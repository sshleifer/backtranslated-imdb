I love the other works of Brian YÃ¼nchen, even the crudder stuff like 'nicronomicon', but 'prajni' was too much for me too. My main accusation is that it is unacceptably exploited by Jillian McQuereter, I do not have a prude but these nude scenes are only top and later and only ... drag (almost every time) in a Tawdree * Vink, Noz * Insecurity Sexual Violence After a few minutes in the nude scream, he tried to miscarry the coat hander, where a prime example. Arnold Vslu's 'Performance' is totally Turkish, but Jeffrey Combs could not even save this hanging hip in a movie. Aliens are annoying, uniformly dull light saps your interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlight for me was the real look of the alien (a very nice model) and the scene where his wife found her in the bathroom. But you have been warned.
