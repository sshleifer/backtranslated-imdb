I saw this movie, after the actual "Sparollos" seen a few times, hoping to end cold <br /> <br /> I could not begin to explain when I got the experience of anger and depression, the end is coming, and went on, and continued a happy ending to the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have any preference, please skip "Vanishing" and see Dutch original "Spurlos". Mystery is very well built up. You feel the frustration of Rex, in search of a search for what happened to her girlfriend Saskia, she entered a gas station and did not return to the car. The search takes him three years, and when he finally learns the truth about what happened in Saskia, contact him immediately, then he may agree to move Saskia away from the same thing. In the end your stupid leaf on your chair.
