Dick and Jane Herper (Jim Carey, Tia Leoni) Corporation Dick is found to be accused of corruption on the unemployment line and after trying to find a job, both of them get out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I was always a fan of Jim Carrie. After a while he made straight-com comedy. The last one was Bruce Mighty which was quite good. He has proved that he can do serious plays, but the comedy is its original element. Fun with Dick and Jane proved that he still did it. Although the picture was fun, it was frustrating. I would have it as it was not funny. Unlike most of the movie's career, it's valuable to watch once, it's not a good repetition value. Problems are part scripts. I was surprised that this script was weak because this same person was created by Pili Yard Old Virgin. Some curiosity just flatten and other times they seem to have tried very hard. If Jim Carey did not have it, then the film got worse. <br /> <br /> Tia Leoni, next to Jim Carr She is a right actress but she is not very funny. She did not match well with Curry and she seemed phoning in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. Supporters cast Alice Beldwin, Richard Jenkins, and Aaron Michael Jenkins. Modern Billy Harper plays and he actually gives a decent performance. They are not boring because they are mostly children. Alex Beldwin was right and Richard Jenkins tried very hard to be funny. To be honest, I favor a bit here. The film was fairly rough but I liked it because of Jim Carrie's performance. Jim Carey's fans have to enjoy it but it's about him. To the end, fun and fun with Dick and Jane are a great way to spend 90 minutes but it is not very memorable. Rating 6/10
