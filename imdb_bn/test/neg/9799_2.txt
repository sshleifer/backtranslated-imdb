Fly Fest starts at Miami Airport, the SS reporter Dan Carter (Harry Carwin, who is also credited as a production designer) to call his partner Ed KC (Phil Filin) ​​that he has returned from South America where he is investigating Karl Schuymann ( Doug Foster) and he came across a big story, but he still had an ants behind while talking on the phone At Shauman Dr. Ellen meets Frederick (Veronica Lake, executive producer) who has recently been released from an emotional institution, together they discuss their wrong plans. The news of Katter's death reached Casey and he himself decided to present the story and investigate some, in fact he got his buggy bugger about his secretary Wiganya Day (Marth Miskhan) to investigate and return only to him. Virginia KC says that there is someone from Christine (Heather Hughes) in their inner name, as Dr. Frederick hired his extra room for the nurse, Christian Schuymann and Dr. Frederick's breakthrough youth renewal test returned to human meat and especially the report related to the cultivable maggots. <br /> <br /> A beautiful poor movie on all accounts written, co-produced and managed by Brad F. Flynn Flush Feast. Firstly, Gryter and Thomas K.C. will begin with the script which was also responsible for cinematography (you think most of Cast and crew had multiple tasks), basically it is terrible. The character has a dimensional idiots and no personality, I did not like anyone in this picture. For the price of this, I like a number of ideas here, meat eating maggots, basement laboratories, stolen dead bodies from a hospital, and the unforgettable 'fat' ends, it's almost precious through the rest of the film for myself. Unfortunately, the dialogue is very badly written, harsh and irrelevant, it seems untrue, I mean, a scene where a nurse says that she "will not let us go home", that she is not talking about someone outside the garden. The meat eating maggots were not able to give any explanation because they were able to restore the youth, in fact, questioned about this matter at one point. Frederick claims that there is no way to explain to me at any point in time those who wrote this article! Even 68 minutes long flush feeds do not help to be very slow and slow, even poor editing scenes and shots to last longer, for example there is a scene where an ambulance drives out of the hospital. To the door, the man comes out, he walks behind the doors and opens etc. Do we really want to see every detail? Dr. Frederick enters a room and there is another sequence that holds some gloves, then he walks in the opposite room and puts another pair! I personally think that the grintar probably did not draw enough, so he expanded each view as much as possible to run out time. I like that woe end though, what I really do Technically Flash Development is a complete shit, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it was small, very small. In Frederick's laboratory, on one table, there are some plastic unemployed and test tubes, some ancient electronic medical equipment and there is a weird screen of funny color (do not ask). Cinematography is poor, music sucks and the whole film is W., very badly W. The absorption ingredients are frustrating, there are some harmful shots, but they do not actually do anything other than a little distraught, there is a brief scene where the body stops his legs and hangs the body and fingers hanging. Hook over The acting is horrific to all concerned, and the garbage dialogue which makes me really bad is bad. Help yourself and avoid flush feathers, yes one or two are funny moments and it is finished, at least speaking unique, but in most part it is a real amateur film that is painful to quickly see. I suspect most people will sit on it one by one, I can barely tolerate it but even I think it's about switching off. Definitely avoid one, you'll be happy and if you really see it, do not say that you have not been warned!
