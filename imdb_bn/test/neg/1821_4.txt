Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson have given a good performance with the speeches of South / New Orleans on this detective Flickr. It's valuable for their scene- and Rickman's scene with Hick Holbrook. These three actors think of the matter, whatever the mannage movie for us to entertain. The plot appears to be potential for the film, but the impression of the movie is overturned that it may not be closed and it may also be. It is cluttered by a rather reluctant subprime and that most uninteresting kidnappers really muddles things. The film is worth a scene - if Rickman, Thompson and Holbrooke do not have much more than recreational activities.
