Like Ishta, this picture is in the same league. Lots of spoiled talent Who let this bomb escape? When an example of a sigfried saying that should be made, in reference to an atom bomb, I said, "Please let it be this theater!" Do not waste your time. There is even a free rental price! Where did they get these rocks to fill the comment section on IMDB? I can not believe that anyone who saw the original series enjoyed this stinger. Steve Carroll is not a physical comedian. If they move "comedy" and it creates a direct action movie, it can be passed. What was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, fat jokes and references were tasteless. This film is the lowest universal majority and missed the opportunity to finish the scene, it seems that no one thought about them. Just awesome! Save your time, if not money and give this movie a pass!
