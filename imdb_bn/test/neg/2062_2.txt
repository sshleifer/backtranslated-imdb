I bought this DVD as part of the 50 "Historical Classic" set. This is rarely classic, and the plot was updated during its release, it is not historic. The actual title in the DVD is "unclear," and extraly titled "Personal life of Bikey Sharpe". Mirna Fay is not very convincing, although in her defense she is saddled with a scary script and trite dialogue. Many initial discussions, and especially made by small studios, demonstrate little efficiency by casting and crew. The fusion is quite stylish that wears a few gowns, but later the scene is overdone on its costume and make-up. A satisfaction is gained by Billy Bevan, who played one of his many sutures
