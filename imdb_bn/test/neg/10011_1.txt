A big disappointment for what's touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very scary. It would be nice to create a high profile role for a young woman who is not prostitute. <br /> <br /> We do not really learn anything about this character, except that it seems to be a disappointing alcoholic. We do not know why. Nicholas Cage turns an excellent performance as usual, but I think that this role and let me down this script. And how, after being able to run for the whole movie, can there be any erection in his death? Really terrible and I felt like a bath needs.
