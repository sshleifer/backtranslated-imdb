My opinion of this movie was the absolute trash of the full video part of this movie !!!! But the soundtrack used was a heavy heavy metal rock band music, I first recognized the music as a band called Fartrie and the album was "Just A Nightmare" and it was very good !! And I would like to see how the rest of the movie is out there, if I think I'll be back in the feed, then I can collect old movie and the movie movie without the noise. This is a very time-consuming hobby but very rewarding. I saw this album being sold in net net Germany Germany for every fifty dollars per dollar. Not bad bad?
