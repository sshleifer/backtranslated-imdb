Oh dear, oh dear! What did they think? Horror scripts, terrible acting. I do not even feel sorry for the actors ... they take them to their check bank and laugh happy <br /> <br /> Why the winding branch from the charging cross came to the bank? Why are vehicles going to Dhaka due to crossing tower bridge? Why is the city being empty because the tower is being crowded? How did Carlyle dive into a raging storm .... and survive? I could go ... and <br /> <br /> There is no emergency in the command room. They can wait for England to return to the pitch after the tea break at Lord's for Igar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Completely hateful!
