This film should be combined to create full-length feature films with three film-summaries (with it gradually dark hurdles and many shots on the road). Stickman! The first hour of this character is a re-hash of the first two AJCT movies released by the main character. The actual movie does not start until the thing is almost finished. I must say that the part of the bat is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As a robot, I thought a robot is a mechanical device that can not be human or not. The bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpus encased in a lead robot-body. Tom Servo made it as, "He is not that impressive; He does not even kneel!" That is, and it takes about one hour to robot throughout the room. But once he catches you out, watch out! Would he be cut off with a touch (driven by Radium? Pluh-ease!). <br /> <br /> It's a great movie when with Joel and Bots. Otherwise, you just have a glutton for abuse.
