I used to suspect Soul Plane and thought that it would actually be something of a comedic price. I'm not black, but it means I'm not grateful to the black comedy. I know that because I can enjoy watching Wines Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I saw crap film and I'm not easily expected. For Soul Plans, I do not even bother finishing it. They do not know whether they managed flat ground and I could not care less. I could not find anything fun to laugh at, but I used to laugh at their nuts on skateboarder YouTube videos, so that there are not many things to do. The men of the film were like a bunch of horny hanas in the mother tongue, whenever and wherever they could find "get something" And we wonder that all stereotypes do not seem invisible. In short: Soul Plane shows Harold and Kumar's series as The Godfather.
