I could not give this picture a star, it smiled and laughing laughing. Some conversations were just plain so that they could laugh at you !! How could someone actually speak like this? Bodyguard Major (Antonio Sabato Junior) flew on a 747 aircraft and Michael Peer's Huniner team was able to dig a drill filled with gasoline and blown a huge stone free of charge. The man said to pay homage to "Fantasy Island" to Lama, "Boss, flat !!" Michael Pere came to 747 views. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only satisfaction was the beautiful girls and even virgin women hijackers. Not to mention that the main hijacker Lake is worthy of death, which he did to become a joker! Just imagine escaping from a "crossbow" tied up by the shot. Hello <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just to laugh, they have to create a sequel to show us that How they spend the night in the middle of a section 3 hurricane in Neptune atle. Do I call Michael Perrera "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific"? Now that's an interesting movie !!
