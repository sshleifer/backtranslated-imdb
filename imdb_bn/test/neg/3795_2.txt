I was totally disgusted with this unnecessary series "The Poseidon Adventure Tourism" which I gave a great comment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is incredible from the GO word! I agree, why was there any other shelter boat and helicopter? The only survivors were rescued that just flew to Michael Kain and Sally Field's boat. Was that the only RESUUE CREW? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually poor and show looks cheap. I really hate genius waste from some good actors. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this image until Sally and Michael are caught as lovers. <br /> <br /> Gord
