If you give your life any way, shape or form, then you will pass yourself through courtesy and "Rocky" movie in this seemingly "DVD" rack. <br /> <br /> I know what you think, "I saw a preview and it looked great!" However, the buyer is careful, I fall into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced him to sit. Oh, how sorry I am for this decision. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < After the arrival, they are annoyed by the appearance of two jungle people, who wish their wishes are wonderful. As it is not bad enough, the Quarterly Group announces an unused way to grow larger plants as well as wildfires to consume them by a perfect route for their destination. I think it will not be more of a movie if they use reasonable decisions and they just wander around, but it's not like a movie. <br /> <br /> After some hikes, six (resorting to a friend was brought) placed on the debris, and once their doubts and history spread, their doubts spread. That is, the helpless tribal people, especially for no reason, come out of the armed jungle without any vengeance, shouting in unknown language. Since the brutal verbal attacks are calmly assured, patronage language - do not ask me - nevertheless, whatever the cast, does not try to do any good. Suddenly, members of the Sixth Street, Dimitri, were punished with archers from the mayan and all hell broke down. Ending a gun job and destroying the destruction of the deadly passengers rapidly. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was a plot for this movie, it ended here. The role takes most of 20 minutes and unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. On the ruins, now the harmful realizes that they are frustrated by the killer locals, and continue to make countless good decisions, one of them is using a dried rope to turn one of their members into a debris. Needless to mention, the adventure is severely hurt and is stuck in the ruins and two girl friends are trying to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is going on smoothly, except blood and beef, except when there is a real woman, when a tree gets torn inside it, and has cut the blood cysts and someone else's legs are cut off, the girl is the same The plate pierced him afterwards. <br /> <br> My only satisfaction in this movie is very interesting to watch Jonathan Tucker, playing Jeff McIntyre, taking enough time to become increasingly more blurred and distressed and it takes enough time to confirm that almost all Cast is a horrible, deadly Die It seems that this story has been destroyed, an ancient house of dangerous spirits with an evil, flesh-eating plant to destroy the temple. And unlucky visitors to eat. Unfortunately, I did not receive such an alert from the emotional enthusiasm of bloodshed and the only evil thing related to this movie that I was really scared by the script writer.
