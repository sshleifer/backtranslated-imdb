Last night I had to write a review for this movie and comment on some people trying to classify this photo's dissatisfaction). I would not fit that classification any that. Other classifications in the list 5) People do not like this movie because it was not good. I found the film and forced it My wife chose this for us because she is a huge Kidman fan and she likes Jude Locke too. <br /> <br /> While enforcing the law, it is a long suspension for me and a huge suspension of the suspension believing its southern pronunciation. I can not help but if they do not intentionally communicate their character, then we will not have to hear the tortured accent. <br /> <br /> As long as the film has taken it long to be interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then it ends. What was interesting, I do not know that this movie was directed by Minghaila. About 40 minutes in the movie, I asked my wife, "Is this not going to be another English patient?" It was absolutely. <br /> <br /> Until the battlefield. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the scene of the opening war, but I think the most descriptive word correctly described is simply "fool". It was forced, it was incredible, it was silly and it was stupid. (After the war I saw my wife and asked, was she just stupid?) With whom she shook her head with a loud voice. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the picture is the performance of Zeljager. The role was a bit of acting as a decent diverse comedy relief role, but it worked. From his speech pattern, his walk, his methods and esp. His little quips (my choice: "If you want to get a calf's ass for 3 feet, you have to talk to each other."), He was often able to create a cartoon character who did his job very well. <br /> <br /> I just do not like this movie and I have to think about this kind of thinking (who is an English patient in this regard). I doubt you could categorize them into one section: 1) Soap opera fans
