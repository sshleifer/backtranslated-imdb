The Scholes in the Closet takes the style of the father-son's son to a new level. This is not a movie that has no purpose. The plot is made in the first few minutes, no doubt, the characters have clich√©s and plot twists are trying to confuse and try to insult, just as you think everything is fine. Through the Halfway movie I could not stand at the speed of the snell and could start fast forwarding. The movie just finished as I expected. Linda Hamilton is always great and it seems like the complete lack of direction is more than the average of other actors. If you really believe that you want to see this vague disappointment, see it fast forward.
