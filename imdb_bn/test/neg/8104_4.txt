This picture is really a sorry excuse for making the film. Pacing was poor, the budget would have been disappointingly low and the act was cut-rate (that is, without Ll√∫Goshi). At this point the audio was also terrible at this time, it gave a lot of noise in the background, though I felt that a jet was shutting down for the film's entirety. If these things disturb you, do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you can get it, you will find that the idea behind this movie is very good. Japanese Japanese Surgeon (Bela Lugosi) turned some of Japanese Japanese agents into the ideology of American businessmen waiting for Japanese kidnapping and murder. After finishing his work, the Japanese betrayed him and threw him into prison. Later, he escaped and traveled to America to seek revenge by a series of highly publicized murders on his patients. Looks like Lagosi was the only great actress in this film, and to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgotten and stodgy. The leading actress became rather annoying and stereotyptical, when the police officer allocated in her case, it was a general, authoritarian and always the most influential man who was found in many films of this period. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that the camera work was totally uncertain, often taking the same exact angle during the same time and time of the same room. After a while, it determines the movement of the film gradually for dragging the film, which is less or nonexistent. <br /> <br /> My idea is an interesting, and with a good writer, director, script, tools, and actors it can be an excellent film. Sadly, these disadvantages now leave the film behind, and I can not recommend it to anybody, but most of the movie lovers are open.
