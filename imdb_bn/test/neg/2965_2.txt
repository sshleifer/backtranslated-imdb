Some strange work of fame This is not just a music made for the screen (mostly based on Broadway music), but it produces a TV series and Broadway musicals. Let me correct the sentence. The fame is not a musical. There are songs number in the music for the purpose of moving the plot or to show the characters' feelings. This song is not to sing; Actually, there is no use for it. People just sing randomly to fit with the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was devastating result) for those New York High School for Performing Arts Sent to the audience for this. They all have different reasons - such as. Acting, singing, etc. The quote-free drama is that these middle-aged people are teenagers in their four years of age. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school is supposed to be electoral. Finally, this is a free college, and they can not let everyone enter. How can some people go to college? Obviously these plays can take place in these different people. And until finally the film is not billed in the movie at the top, without any reason to feel uncomfortable? These unexpected people have many problems, but you can not feel bad for them because you do not know who they are! This relationship occurs between those whose names you do not know. And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the film, but you do not understand, because you do not know how they were in the first place. <br /> <br /> For the song, it pops randomly (and is supposed to be funny?) and nothing else. When the title song is sung, it plays in the middle of the street and you can tell everyone in the middle of the street in the street blower, before the dancer and off-bit dance. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, at least say. I will say more, but most of the movies have gone out of my head. Just do not see it. You're doing yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> R for the language.
