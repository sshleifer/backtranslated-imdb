Man (Gaston Modat) and Young Girl (Lia Lis) go through the film eaten by passion for each other. They are long to be together but their moments are constantly interrupted together. The picture is combined with the artwork and closes after an hour ......... the lovers find pleasure .... <br /> <br /> The picture starts with interesting footage but you are scorpions Soon to realize that it is a pretentious piece of all dirty. Occasionally it is made as a silent film with a conversation and it is played on a non stop soundtrack, which is so annoying at one point that you close the term and want to see it as a silent film. Continuous drum roll must be crazy to crazy movie viewers of course. There are some really fun moments, for example, when a person kicked the dog and when he hit the blind person. Unfortunately, this humor is carried out in the name of the industry so that it is merely unguarded. The film is shit.
