I am a SF buff in the other styles, and I especially like the movies with their "iPhone of Idea" prizes in the 60's and 70's that make the smart and favorite stories to keep on screen. In short, I fully agree with the review of the movie Scott-8686. I've heard about this picture, and as I mentioned earlier, with a touch of SF buff, 60f and 70s, "Twilight Zone" touch with a trend for SF stories, I've hoped for a lot and the effects of reviews of my expectations have increased with rankings, "This second best "From the 2001 Space ODC" of "Kubrick" What a fraud It was a simple, slow, half-baked, stupid film with "the journey to the sun far away", humorous amateur special effects (and remember that I liked movies of that era and despised CGI) and it could be fully more than 60 The SF disaster, such as "Marooned", that "Journey" reminded me a lot. The idea behind it is not bad, but the plot of a Twin Planet story on Earth, on which the same world has turned upside down, wants the direction of a master like Kubrick. The needle to tell Robert Parish is not something, so he distributed a boring and stupid film that looked like Matinee TV series that was felt and felt. There is no ability to waste your time, even if you are completely fond of this genre.
