I had a hard time sitting through this. Each single twist and turn are predictable. You are sitting there just waiting ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! Just as you predict the very beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes out. Read more. <br /> <br /> Writing smart? No. <br /> <br /> Porn torture? No, there is no nudity. Other torture This torture pornography is probably written by people of heavy drugs. Unfortunately there is no torture and no nudity (yes, there is no nudity) <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about this "thriller". The only good part of this movie is finished, but I'm not going to waste it. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 2/10. A 1/10 will be a terrific B-movie. This movie was well played.
