How do you make an entirely unexpected movie through a story from America's most famous writers? See this film and find out. Maybe I'm leaving the writer Carcass McCaller, but I was impressed by "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" and here's something I'm hoping for. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I found almost a lot of her got to get excited about almost any movie . Rod Steiger as a preacher? How insulting is that? Unexpected characters, one after the other. Well, maybe this book too, and I'm inappropriate for this movie. I did not know anything other than what I saw on the screen, and it is an unreleased film that I could never recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a person behind the other in the hinterland. There is nothing to recommend here, outside of some nice movies and there. It's amazing how anyone can sit in 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not even know how bad this guideline is. There is good news: this is the only movie directed by Simon Cowell.
