<br /> <br /> I said, I am going to be as much as I can about this picture (some people, including directors! when critics say their minds can be very upset), so <br /> <br /> A nice car accident and the first credit looks good and ... it's that; Other big bites. All acting dissatisfied, scripts of the script, special effects such as they are done by school children in cheap computer. All these pictures have serious bowling shoes tendencies. <br /> <br /> It's not too scary as a horror movie, and if it looks like a "thoughtful man" awful movie, but it succeeds at some level, I thought that the last of these films is a terrific long way away. This may actually be a malicious look in bad films and I'm not missing the point but I doubt it anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a complete car phone warehouse and I could not recommend it to anyone <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Its mam).
