Despite the amazing soundtracks and amazing rapport and amazing appearance of Woods, it is one of the tricky tricks where New York writers and / or directors try to show a place and throw themselves to the hero. Yes there are some other stuff in the movie which is very bad, but this is important. New York's independent filmmakers seem to be trending, "I do not need to be talented, I have a new youth!" OK, be fair, the movie has its moments. One person called Walkie Jack is why the flashback bit was pretty funny. The script is not a story or plot, it is a bunch of good scenes that do not clash with each other by combining the same letter. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that there is no objective character behind it. Uncle Sam is providing kidney medicines, why? Why is not Sam so quickly? After the scene with absolutely nothing to gain from the lead character lies then the scene closed his ass off. The guy falls in love with Flight Adventent, no one has any reason to fall in love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seeing this, watching bad mainstream movies. If you want to see how a good-looking heartfelt movie looks like, see the "Brother" "Cade In In The Head" is so fitting that people hate Indie movies because of their perfect example: most of them And a note of the director: Now and then the visitors are not excited to excite, amuse, illuminate or entertain. Boring does not make you a better film-maker than I am interested in.
