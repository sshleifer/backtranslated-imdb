Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's awesome. The acting is not very good. But there is something about it that you want to see more (sort of like a car break). The killers' eyes are funny than some of the ridiculous close-ups. If you are looking for a fear ... this is not a bust for you. It is very unclear and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was HOSTAGE title. It does not matter what you call it, it's still a poor choice for relaxation. It may be good for a MST3000 party or anything. Can you believe they use this headline like Sam's other son? If she does not have any absorption, then I will eat my hat. I remember when this was shot in Belmont, NC. Local personality is used as a lot of talent.
