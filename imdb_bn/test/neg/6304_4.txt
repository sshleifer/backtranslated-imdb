I liked all of the main actors involved in this pretty bizarre film. Terrence Stamp, Guy Pierce and Hugo Weaving proved everyone to be their best and most capable actors, but I could not enter it. I do not know because I do not understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not get my head around this movie. Worse than anything that the actors have created some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was the part of the point, I do not know. I could probably understand an insult, but I do not know what else to call them. I would say I bought the guys as actors (correct words?) But the story was not very good or was not very funny. I would say that I do not usually understand the designers who are dressed, although I noticed them when they were wrong or out of place, but I was very impressed with them. Very creative, not least interesting, but I do not think they can be. I do not know if I'm not seeing the audience and I do not see a performance performed by such a performer, but I do not know if I do not go to Ballet or Opera. If this is your type of movie, you probably like it, but if it does not skip it ... this is not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscars for the apparel and I would say so correctly. I must say that Ebert did not care much for this movie, though he loved it better than me.
