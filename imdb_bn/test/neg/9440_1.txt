... I can not believe that there are people here who recommend this movie ... This slow POS is not going anywhere. Oh yeah okay it goes somewhere, but you see that mile coming away from far Acting: Really really bad, maybe Bartender was right. Editing: BAD! I think the editor has been told that "we need at least 90 minutes", because all the scenes can be half-bent. Music: Starting from what I started it's my most shameful score. Who sings the last scene crying loud ?? Instructions: Oh my, IMNSHO sucks David Lynch, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. Leave this one out.
