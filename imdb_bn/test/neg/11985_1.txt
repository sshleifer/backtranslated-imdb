Obviously it was possible in more capable hands, but if the bowler's track record was given, it would be frustrating if there were no qualifications for this ball. <br /> <br /> The classic 5-minute animosity of the classic giant film, even the GI Joe type, the awesome one-fishing machine, distributed by the soldiers, also thinks that they are taken away from any other initiative in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> If you leave the movie right now you will work on your own. You've already passed all the highlights and saved yourself from the pain of sitting through the worst performances in recent history. <br /> <br /> Next, write the entire garbage genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first place. This style usually inspires romance and nudity intimacy to other humanity and otherwise sympathize with cardboard cutting characters - here it backfires all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and incredibly annoying. Where the imagination and imagination appear in the control of other classic budget controls - here just seems to have been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There is no feature of any freedom fighter - even this is not bad "almost good" is applicable. It's just bad, and bad way. <br /> <br /> The leading starred questions about how our hero will spend the night together and how to rate him. He gave him 2 out of 10. I can give the whole thing 1 (if possible, I'll go for 0). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this dribble, there are plenty <br /> <br /> Oh, finally, this movie does not have much to do with the popular game Far Cry (the best is it's lightly based on it) . <br /> <br /> Move along, awesome!
