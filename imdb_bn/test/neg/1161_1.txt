I did some research on Ed Zen, and I found some interesting topics. Ed Gian did not shout like this shock, and there was nothing like calm and loner. I would say that I did not finish this movie even though I did. I will cringe through all of us, Wisconsin, as we speak from Kentucy. You know funny, but it is so tragic in this movie because Wisconsin is not as hot as it looks like. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only a humiliation of Wisconsin as a Wisconsin man. , But it is proven as an insane, lonely man that a man is completely humiliated. He killed both of them and the film could not achieve that right. Ed that does not stop and get personal and terrified people, he shot two and only man, he killed. So, why does this movie lie and say "based on true stories"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this is it. I finished the sad movie so oh, and I want to laugh at the personal director. Make your homework while making a movie. I want to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who are not in Wisconsin) and there is no problem there! What was in hell, Revennes had more pine trees and snow, and it seemed to be shot in California. <br /> <br /> Well, those who do not know anything about ad gene, I want to give you a history of you. Ed Jane told to kill his family, but it has not been proven. He killed a Bertender, who was shot at times when he was nearly too close. He took the dead bartender home to his house. After 10 years, he shot Clerk in the shop, he tear the cash registers and the truck in the shop. He was caught due to the murder, his son came there and asked about the antifreeze. The day he killed him, he bought an antifreeze there, and who was the only antif ... he was the only proof that he had to start looking for his people all over the world. He looted the grave, really 56 looted the grave. He hated the man he dug and he made a pot; Lamp shades, couches, chairs, and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family that he was eating dinner together and when he was caught, he threw away all the meat he had given him, as if he was caught in the house. He was arrested and the police hid him for fear of what could happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book, the judge wrote to him. <br /> <br /> After the movie is over, after seeing the whole horror thing, I saw the panic view of the directors of how Wisconsin women are watching. I mean that this man was half the slab, who knows all of Wisconsin women have all the bonds. Please! The lack of work that this guy has done and I am very annoyed because of the lack of poor work to make this movie. I do not know who this guy is, and I think he's okay for something else, but he did a terrible thing with Ed Gene. <br /> <br /> <br /> After all this, I was very sad and I was lost in movie 3.99. The movie was completely untrue after the ending of <br /> <br />, the movie said just like me that the world plane and George Washington were not our first presidents. Come to the public, it's your history, and it's the history of Wisconsin. To finish this rant, if I make a movie and feel like a George Washington Brad Pitt (someone among you thinks that it is fine, it would not be true) and he was not a president and he was not. Anyway. You can not rewrite history.
