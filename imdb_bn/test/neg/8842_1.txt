I have seen all the good reviews about this film and I started thinking of myself ... am I going crazy? Do not I see beauty from a movie? I'm just stupid enough to understand the message trying to convince this movie? I do not know. Probably these disguises entered my head and ate all my brains. The film was not going anywhere ... I was sure it would be a fog, and of course ... it was! Nothing is exceptional ... even not the landscape (I'm hoping that being kept in the village of the hill, at least the natural scene will be beautiful .. but not). Just about a crazy teacher, and of course a lame story about his crazy students ... Now all the big, each of them .. With his own specific ideas And the boy had some ideas stupid .. like an incarnation story, for example. At one moment, I thought I was looking at the X files. Inside the ear in disguise. No .. This movie is worth the waste of time (unless I do not want money for tickets). The part I like is blue eyes "German" baby ... very good and acting convincing for his age ... left ... Nothing! I have read the previous review and I think the script writers and directors came up with the ideas when they were in both drugs. It feels good that many people have enjoyed this picture ... I think myself again .. I'm probably crazy. Suggestion .. Do not waste your time with this!
