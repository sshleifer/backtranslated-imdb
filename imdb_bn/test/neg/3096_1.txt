I'm not afraid of bad movies I like bad movies I enjoy cheating on the company of their friends. We're actually good at it, actually. Saying that, I tell you how much you hate this movie. <br /> <br /> To get started, it was understandable. Rob Looye attacks some people, they capture him but he escapes out of this big all-sized shot. The singer who thinks we have died, not only did he do so, until many of them work and look the same. Cue Bert Reynolds come and singer questions. He has seen that he has stepped down from the set of Walker, Texas Ranger in this movie and is often confused. Then Rob Lowe died, not only ... and the worst thing is that there is not enough dialogue or activity in which killing people or trying to funnize this movie! And do not even start me on the random chihuahua. Then the eastern power structure of Eastern Europe was thought to have been separated. We do not know where we were, all the expressions were obviously "Eastern Europeans" and were Burt Reynolds and Rob Loay in the first place? I wanted to tell the people that blockbuster which I thought about this movie, and get my money back, but since I've earned it in particular (only $ .99) I decided against it. However, I want to know, how the director got greatness to create this great movie, and when they are signed, what do they think of 'stars' ???
