First off I will give 4 out of 10 runs out of this movie! It was nothing more than a wannabe film. I too felt down watching this movie. Based on this real story I would have more drama and more information that I led the people. Instead, I have broken the law and took medicine for more than an hour by showing the middle class. <br /> <br /> It is ambitious like football, but there is no real story and no good ending. After watching the film, I was surprised, "What was this picture?" If you like movies with a real story and a lot of drugs and swear, it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of public and gangster movies but this movie has not been alive for promotion. I can see that the author is trying to take the image but it could not reach its destination. One of the worst British movies I have ever seen. If the movie is more than just a story, it would be a great movie.
