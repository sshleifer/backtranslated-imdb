Total shit <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was very excited to see the only film version of Mansfield Park. I suffer from the first four episodes, but when it comes to the resolution of Henry and Fanni, it closes. Whoever employs Sylvester Le Tougel lady, she must be blind and deaf because I'm the worst actress in my life. The whole thing is bad, bad, bad. I do not know. Jane Austen does not seem to be respected to pay tributes to those who write for the screen.
