This movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole. Make a weak groove A Peg is so cheap it can not be produced in a sweatshop assembly line in Chinatown in Mexico. In fact, when you try to put a hole in the hole for which it is clearly designed, it will not break into the scented sticks like drops fruit, disgusting pieces, and not washed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Such a movie may be the result of some accidents in nature; Somewhere there is some strange entity that runs on the corner corner of the dank office and it grows up till it grows up. Only science will be interested in such a thing; Anyone who does not lean toward learning will come out of this world. <br /> <br /> What comes down to it: If you want to enjoy Violin record, Racism, or Coke Zero for the first year, it might just be your birthday.
