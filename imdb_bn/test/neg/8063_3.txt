I bought this thing used in a video game shop's "Clearance Bin". I wished that some observers wanted to get that guilty feeling very dense watch; I wanted the value of the shock. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a "forbidden film". I was very frustrated <br /> <br /> Cannibal Farx does not work, because it is so camping and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show you "shocking" stabs, chips, slicing - you just see it later. (They show hooking a breast in detail). Special effects are OK.
