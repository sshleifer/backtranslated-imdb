After watching Avalon (which was only suitable for the very nice Digital FX), and most of the anime films written by Oishee, with Jean-Roh (which is pretty), I decided that Ozir's movie trilogy box set should be examined. Regarding the Red Spectacles and Stre Cookie, I'll comment here. And I tell you, it's one of the biggest waste I've spent some time doing. I first saw stray dogs and then red-hued. I can say with sadness that these movies are probably the most annoying movie I've seen. For every 10 minutes you see some steps in the characters, who are equipped with "Panzer Kop" decorations for just a few quick scenes. During the rest of the time, you will see some interesting scenes filled with boring dialogue with some interesting locations. I do not really understand the motivation behind these two films. I like the idea behind Wolf Brigade teams and the plot, but the films go far away from their favorites. I do not recommend watching these movies, and of course, I do not enjoy the money as well, do not buy the box box. Oh, and if you think what I'm thinking about the third movie of the set, Talking Head, I could not get myself to see myself before seeing the box set from my DVD collection after emptying the $ 20 box. If you want a great Japanese live action, check out the return, or see the Aakhi The Killer or the Ziram series.
