When I really saw two of the best movie critics called 'Smiley Danga', I was ready to see. But the movie has become frustrating. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to keep your movie enhancing your brain but you will not only be able to ignore errors and flaws. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was a total folly. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked terrible. (She is 49 years old and she is more than twice her age 24) 3. Salman's comedy for less acting and more. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good but the speed of the movie prevents them. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes have been deliberately trickled by funny creators, and 6. Poor and flawed stories. <br /> <br /> But there are several plus- 1. Govinda Great personal performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> 3 Katrina Kaif Shows and progresses with each film. <br /> <br /> 4. Rajpal Yadav's Don Sequence Although less practical but ridiculous <br /> <br /> so 4 good points, 6 bad ones .. It gets 4/10.
