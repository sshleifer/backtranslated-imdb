Tom is sliced ​​into a delicious Jerry Sandwich when the victim swoops down a huge bird and flies off with her snack. Tom is not very happy with his sari being stolen from under his nose, Tom is determined to save his Mossie Morsel. <br /> <br /> Tell me as much as I love Tom and Jeri, this is a fascinating thing: the story is rather old; It introduces the peripheral character to a badly conceived lack of charm; And it's old 'dress up as a cartoon character' flogs the dress. <br /> <br /> According to my opinion, 'Flirty Birdie' rival 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' are so weak Tom and Jerry Caper for the title.
