I just tolerated this film to satisfy my curiosity. It will be one of the worst films I ever surrounded through. I'm surprised that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. Acting horror, scripts are non-existent and the characters are so expected and hollow. For a fun movie I can not even think of snickering even once and fail to see how it can be defined as a comedy. Make yourself a favor and stay away from these drops and check out more deserving options that will give you much more pleasure. Check out movies like Holidays or 27 Dresses, these movies will provide a more satisfying movie experience. I sincerely hope more educated film directors will cast negatively for this film, it truly qualifies for the eligibility of biblical qualifications that other film buffs can build based on their verdict. Let people all become anxious and truly reflect on those who are involved in this movie who created it - a very medium picture that can be forgotten very quickly.
