This show shows depth in the UK TV pre-waterway drama that has been damaged. These soft scripts, medium-acting, poor plots, through horror dialogue, were forced to see a DVD of an old ER episode for an excellent hospital drama. <br /> <br /> No actors in this show think that you can actually work! <br /> <br /> If you want low quality, soap opera style TV is easy to absorb, this is the show for you. Personally I prefer something with more meat on the bones. Sadly, with all other UK license providers, I am financing this race.
