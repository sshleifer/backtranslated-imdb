While accepting the truth conversation on the big screen the allowance will be made in a modicum. But if you draw a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what actually happened - then why call it Buggy and believe the audience that it was half the true story? The Godfather Trilogy processes many real characters and events, once in America once it does, but they do not claim to tell the true story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In real life, he had to argue with Lancashire for going to Nevada. Beni Monte Carlo had thought of the idea of ​​fools, and he did not like to continue his life as a youth in L.A. until the concept was warmed up. But obviously he was the hero of the film, so naturally he had the idea. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ben used to use Count Duffrao to get closer to Mussolini because he was Hitler's companion and killed everyone in Hitler gas chambers. Obviously we want to like Beni, so the screenlists make this fool. In real life, at that time nobody knew about the gas chamber, at least not all were interested in politics. In fact, he used the connection of the council and he visited Mussolini, but did not kill him, but wanted to sell him explosive. While living in Italy, he also met with Goebels and Govering. <br /> <br /> The entire Greenberg cemetery was stupid. Greenberg did not turn the stub kabutara, he did not take shelter in Beni, Beni did not kill him (who was near Albert Tanbenbaum) ... at least his name is OK. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very romantic to return to Virginia Beni, he offered the money he had stolen. The film can tell us so far by the text panel that after the assassination of Beni, he returned the money to Laneske. Let me just say, revisionism just does not get such cruelty. <br /> <br /> This list is not in any way - Beni's family is not living in LA, dealing with Beni drainer. The storyline of Conselo (an unfavorable corporate type), Lansky (a loving Teddy Bear), was adapted from Adonis, Beni (an elderly old lassa who could not reach the age of 12 if she went to regular movies who "go crazy", and what's more, who look good No or have Benny Siegel's charisma) and much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Worse than Harlem, NY. But respect is the cause where honor: it is an achievement itself.
