The movie can be so light that it can still be running but they are less. It was a great story line, it could be just as well not executed as well. During his sleeping scene, the strange "hallucinations" did not give any sense and they were not clearly needed, they did not have any effect or they could not understand or borrow what could happen or happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> The character of Zone Hedar was OK but could be expanded on more. He played in the crappy part given at his best. The character was funny, but again, it can summarize what might happen. <br /> <br /> Miller's character was perfect and his performance was spot. <br /> <br /> While closing, the writing was horrible and not often much, no ideas were made and its hallucinations were not fit with the movie. With good scripting and directing, this movie can compete with the National Lampon Vacation in a matter of fun, bad things to a person traveling across America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was only a second "flush". If I had seen it in the theater, then I wanted to refund my money and boycotted the film. <br /> <br /> The only work that this image has done was one and a half hours of my life. It has led to the worst of the film's appearance, because the film was frustrating. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
