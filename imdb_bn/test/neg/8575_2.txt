I usually do not like to comment about acting in a movie, because it is a thing that is an agenda against a movie. In this picture, I will make an exception. This photo is almost all below average acting. I mean half the film, I wonder how the producers and / or directors could not work around to get around how to cut around a ensemble. Although the production value was good, the poorly written story was incorporated on the bad performance of the actors, and the end to the film was a half-hearted effort, which became quite confusing. All the Spanish horror films are frustrating?
