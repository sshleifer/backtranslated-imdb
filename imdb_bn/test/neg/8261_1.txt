Rue Paul plays a secret agent named Starbutt. He used to fight with another drag queen agent to fight Anaka Manna (Cadis Cayne) of corruption and restore her abducted nephew ... or something like that. Seriously - the problem I was focusing on the plot! The film is directed by someone with severe ADD - the camera quickly cuts off the ostop that makes it impossible to focus on anything. The conversation is strangely occasionally and you are missing it when you hear it! Actually, except Ru Paul, it is quite fine that surpasses an embarrassing degree. The film is also a hateful bathroom humor which is not only rebellious and even remote fun. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, I was sick and I was no longer standing. I'm sitting somewhere but my limit is exceeded! People are comparing John Waters' initial work. I disagree. Waters work is sick but good - this is just sick. To avoid.
