I used to like Takshi Mikey films so far, but I found this quite frustrating. I bought it, but I will not do it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on an AdD Video, which has only two episodes. First, a murderer kidnaps a woman, cuts her upper part to uncover the brain, plants her curly soil and gives flowers to her brain. You can tell from that DVD box. In the movie, the top TV is digitally divided by TV static. If you have not seen the dvd box, the viewers will not know what people were looking at, then a young police created a small model of the body. Surprisingly, there is a flash frame after the woman's head and it is not sensed. Without this, I'm not really sure what's going on. Get some female phone calls, and cavorts around a sketch animated character when it happens. An animated character also sometimes appears on the TV screen. <br /> <br /> Pregnant women have been found open in the second phase and their children are missing. Again, a policeman produces a body similar to a corpse, which is again useful to censor the actual body. Naturally, the film is born, but surprisingly the baby and the number is also sensor! According to the DVD box, sensor versions were not kept when it was originally created. Perhaps if they were, they knew they were going to be censored, probably they did not bother to show anything ...? Not sure <br /> <br /> <br /> If I would like to hear the next episode then maybe I'll find them. For example, I would not be bothered.
