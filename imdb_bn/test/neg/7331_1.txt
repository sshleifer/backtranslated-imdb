Very simply, they are not all syndicated episodes and original non-unedited NBC episodes. This is not the first full season, all editions are edited according to 21:00 for syndication, which means jokes are cut, an extra commercial fading is included, all the hearts of Harvey Karamen are not here ... very badly done! I'm waiting for the series .... booooooooooooooooo! If you really die for the uncle's fan, do not buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and we are unhappy why send a comment to this classic sitcom !
