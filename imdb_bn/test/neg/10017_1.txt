The New York family ended up getting around to get a television set, which almost destroyed the marriage of David Niven to Mikey Guinea. The bedroom comedy that ventures very rarely in the bedroom (and whatever happens to anything sexy) Ginny has an enormous range as an actress - she turns, she turns off. The only compensation for the film is the Baptista Paty Duc, pre-"Maracell Worker", a helpful performance as the daughter of Niven. He is joyful; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * ****
