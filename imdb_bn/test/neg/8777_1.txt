I guess it was not entirely the fault of the manufacturer of the film. The film is known as Clayton Moore (who played the role in the 1950s and Lone Ranger grew up with our elderly), to be indefinitely decisive. He could not wear the public masks. Now remember, the poor man was not making so much money, and was not going to take anything away from this picture, but the whole thing seems to be ... invalid. <br /> <br> Other than the other picture (other leading The voice of the person was so awful that he was so awful) in 1981 Westerners were not so hip. John Wayne died and we were just under his control, based on the American massacre of Western nations, how a great generous criminal tour was going on for a decade. (That's and the whole section of the blazing Saddles sent! The scene of Campfire is enough.) The Hollywood fiction was then COOL because Hollywood shied away from the West. <br /> <br /> A scene that underscored it when after the rescue was drunk President Grant (and seriously I gave Grant permission to stay with the bad guys. The country got better!) asked Grant Tant, what would be his reward? Honor your treaties with the people ". Yeah, okay, that's going to happen!
