This film is going down in the history of bad movie which I have ever seen. It was not even a bad B movie ... I would rate it as a z. The special effects were ridiculous ... even if you could call their special effects. I think before the critics hit the nail on the head ... it was the box, which sold the film, when the cover art was great and the summaries were provocative (which I hired both), it was not only wasted time, but money as well. I was not long long. I took it back to the store and switched it for another movie, I think my local video store closed it because they complained about this terrible movie. My 6 year old is a good work film / it can work on script writing!
