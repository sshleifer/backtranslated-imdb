I have not seen this movie for several years, the last time I was drunk after the 5 pints of my local Witherson tenants, even then I was pretty awful. The movie is quite awesome compared to other buyers, the first two were pretty good, 3 had fork, but the mile was even better. This story took place 53 years after Crete 3, Charlie found out the hunter hunter outside of the previous films, with some space miner, M, the crew of the man, found a pond float in the exterior and took it to the board. Charlie once cracked open the left critter egg in the galaxy which is brought with him from Earth and we then have critters on the space ship, a obvious 'alien' stopper and many terrible FX and you quite a lot have this movie in a short time. The only good thing when we are re-known as UG (or we are going to believe) is now a villain and wants to save critters instead of destroying them
