I have seen a lot of TV for years. Too much, when I see a new show that looks like repeats of old shows, I'll be humiliated. Thankfully, I'm not very sensitive because all the "hot properties" work updates the cast of "Design Women" (which means they have sex workers) and instead of putting them in New York City in Georgia. <br /> <br /> Jokes is more TV-14-ish, but it does not make the shot even better. The only thing that proved this show is that Nicole Sullivan was so good that she could create a show like "Mother Mother the Car". Her trick talent reminds one of a modern day Lucie Ball - only funnier. Unfortunately, the rest of the casts are sticky and sexy that may be good for some brainless soap, but they are not just funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
