If you are sitting in the dark, literally and metaphorically, it's a movie for you in the ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The actor, the resource and the audience wasted time. Finally waste the space. Do not be tempted by the resume. There is no other substance beyond. The film is a lack of originality that you can expect from style; Plot, character, development, denouement Casts can probably take heart from the knowledge that their efforts in this example will be completely forgotten and given time, their career might probably improve. <br /> <br /> Absolute trip.
