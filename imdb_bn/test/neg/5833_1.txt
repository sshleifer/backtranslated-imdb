It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was about a female prisoner transferred to mankind and tried to save, but what actually happened was that the prisoner was actually kept in a space ship with a nymphomanias lesbian commander. All the stories were about having sex again. There was no need for this footage - just to create a soft porn movie. Of course, the movie is about two minutes for heroin. I do not know what to do with the actual plot of this movie - except I want to get people to see it. I gave it 1 out of 10 because there was no other rating. Do not waste your money or time - it's nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a teenager for a young teenager and a movie to see. Through this movie the animal showed more than half the way and with Sneeve Waver, the film looked like Alien. Poor excuse for entertainment
