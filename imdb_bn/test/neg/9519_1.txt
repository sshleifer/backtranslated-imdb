What can I say about this film, it is actually one of the worst gay themed movies, which can come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hell, money is needed. There are stories to be there, that is a rambling mess that lets you loose interest very quickly. It is supposed based on real-life events. Well, I can say one thing, it's the insult of real life characters. DVD is out of the UK at this time. It is available in the split screen format, which can make the whole screen version worse. Gay movies can be much better than this, and we deserve more.
