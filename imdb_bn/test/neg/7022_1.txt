Lusil Ball was a strong power in the 1950s and 1960s, but he still made the film at a time, especially the long, long trailer and the events of life. Although his television career was strong, his movie career seemed to have diminished in the early 1970's - but the ball was determined to return to a big screen for the last time, and the project he had selected was the 1966 musical ma'am. In many cases the role seems to create a trail: Based on the popular novel, two different Broadway plays were raised; Mam Dennis is a painful, barbarous unmarried woman who "succes" her orphaned nephew Patrick - and he The wild tour of the possibilities of life, jumping from one curiosity to another. The song, which features songs such as "Open non new window" and "Aiff Haque Walked with My My Life Today", was among Jerry Harman's best work. Supporter cast, which included Robert Preston and BA Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; The fanfare was fantastic on the opening night; The film was a disaster. Critics were frustrated and the audience sat in the slab-jawad. <br /> <br /> No matter what Lucy fans can say, MAME is a Fiasco, so much so that it is difficult to know. It is poorly directed, poorly portrayed, performed badly, and there is a lacey ball on everybody, unable to dance, unable to sing, and Maxworks greens like dummy, although incredibly bad dance photography roams around it. But the disaster is making her alone; Supporting cast rent is no good. Bella Arthur and Jane Kanele filled with Charles and Agnes Gusch revived the role of their stage; The former stage, the next is frustrating. Robert Preston is able to sing with a smile, but he is quite happy about himself and somehow very happy about it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Everyone loves Lucie, but only at least the critical fan Lucy can love MAME; When I do not say that you want to close your eyes is bad enough, you can do your will. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> The GFT, Amazon Reviewer
