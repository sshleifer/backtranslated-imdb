Well, I hope I hear the mistake of this movie because I'm a big fan of Roger Dodota and did not really want to see him slip; But unfortunately, this gaolo-styled miracle load of nonsense just as I believe it will be - and it's pretty awesome! This film does not work, because filmmakers try to mix and suppress the supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very compulsive and stupid. Moreover, this plot does not give much knowledge and you need to ask yourself "what do you mean" throughout the film. The plot became terrorist by a young woman living in an apartment block and a telephone. The best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately there are mostly good points. The death scene is a boxer, which is something minor; But all of which are incredibly stupid, some that stick to find that honor especially to get killed by coins. Overall, I really can not recommend this to anyone; There is no possibility to influence non-Doodoto fans, and the dodote fans can find the film's depression. Avoid!
