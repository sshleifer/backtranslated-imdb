I saw Hugelbery at Broadway and it liked a great deal. I did not know what happened with the film version, because it was awesome. Perhaps there are some inconsistent conversations on the stage that work on the stage. However, I could not end this film. At the top of the acting. Only Kevin Spacy is together, and he thinks he's in a bad movie and can not wait to get out.
