Enjoyed some of us, director Arnold Lubbitz, for his intimate shiny and satiric sunny touch, it was rather wet while picking up the object. Lewisch is not disappeared - on the contrary, perhaps he was ahead of his time according to a visual story - nevertheless most of the projects he was (or were allocated) were not the landmark of the comedy. Fans want their label. A screen-adaptation of the Lajlo Bus-Fake drama "Birthday", with "Heaven Can Wet", Lionsch has fallen asleep in the sleep during sleep - and an animated plot, a colorless star and a neat flashback - the structure stymies. At the beginning of the century, a wicked man "fell asleep in pursuit of it", which presented information about his life in front of Hell's gateway. Ameche ... evil? That was one of the number of problems. The promising opening sequence (set in the head of the lobby) shows the fastest way to radioactivity and supporter cast for a little help. * **** to 1/2
