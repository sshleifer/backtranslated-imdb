I just wanted to see the first hour of this movie because I thought it was uninterrupted TV trash and gifted waste. Levi Tyler plays a glorious beauty, but his acting skills are not yet advanced enough to give any real kick parts. When he gradually threw a bartender into a criminal life, the real concern about any of the letters is difficult to feel. Even John Goodman has provided his weak comic lines in the absence of pan-ache, as if a person misses a joke, the intelligent humor will gradually fall. The finishing is supposed to be good, but starter and leave me with no appetite to find the main course.
