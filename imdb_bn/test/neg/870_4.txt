Every great romantic comedy requires the conflict between the plot, expectations and debt of the plot ideas in romantic Lead. These stories fall flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least none who does not interfere with the last joining of two main characters, and so suspension is flat, no beginning, and there really is no attraction. <br /> <br /> The friendship between chemistry Richard Cerr and Diane Lane is the best, During the filming, I hope they want to play more laboratory and see any growing passion about the weather. <br /> <br /> Although I am a fan of both actors, I believe that the cast was closed - or perhaps the side was closed and it affected their distribution. Writing was very weak, which affected performance; Of course, this script can use some help from some of the Harlequin authors, who truly experience the romance heat. <br /> <br /> This movie may be valuable for viewing at noon on Sunday, but after the cheap shelf <br /> <br /> (sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
