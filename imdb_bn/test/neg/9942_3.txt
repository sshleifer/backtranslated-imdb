This is one of the many US efforts to rebuild an old classic British TV show, which is more famous than this. You have no record of what I have seen or even acknowledged that you know that 50 of the TV 50's "Secret Agent Man" was originally called "Secret Agent Man", Patrick McGohon (The Prison, Bravewirt, Ice Station Zebra, The Phantom, Etc.) A man who first torn from James Bond, but he stopped it because McGough was a very devout man and James Bond is not against the values ​​of the bed and considered violent measures. <br /> <br> This show is made in black and white, and it is very sad for those who do not see it, you are missing many. Mr. McGoughn was named in the role of "Secret Agent Man" and he became very popular after the end of the show, although sometimes known as the intrigued and controversial TV series "The Prisoner". The character that he played in "prison" was abducted and not transferred to an island where he did not know where he was or who was responsible for him abducting. Did he know that his prisoner wanted to know the reasons for resignation from the British Secret Service and not the population name on this island, but the number of the Patricks character was given that "6" was justified that the character of his prison was in the case of the real secrets agent man The same character was, but McGoughman himself debated. <br /> <br /> There are unknown popular theme songs that the original secret agent Man Spond. It was written by Popeye 50s and 60s pop musician and I read what I read so that this version of this show came up. You're so wrong about that. It was Johnny and it came from the original TV series so help me set up the information directly. Those who complained about being well-heard with England, among those who were originally known as "Danger Man" and were re-detained in "The Secret Agent Man" in the United States. When it was first promoted. <br /> <br /> This current shot does not have to do anything with the original, such a major character is not in the DRAW, and I think they did all this to make this version their version. "Secret Agent Man" But it uses the replay of the original theme song so you can tell that this show is actually a poorly renewed version of the original series, though restored.
