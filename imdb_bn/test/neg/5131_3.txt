This movie was probably the best objective. In the end, there is a sacrifice to someone named Kelly, who as a visitor, I could only find myself in a situation that illustrates the film. Probably he liked "wrong". The dedication that love and suicide is the only release quality. <br /> <br /> The movie became intolerable from the surplus sequence. Once the audience is already annoyed in the film about five minutes, it will be reduced later ... which was it. I know the movie was low budget and the camera shot was really good ... Unfortunately, everything else was awesome. Acting, plot, sound quality, photo quality ... acting I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Except awesome. Actors are trying to act like acting. The only way I can describe it. I have seen, I actually painted the script on my mind stage. Which movement was not natural and the characters' responses were not suitable for each other. Briefly: Time off is in the way. The whole movie was closed during the time. I'm not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I think there should be some way to spend time ... unless they explain that there is not too much about graduation, I think the first movie segment is divided by a week ... a month passed. <br /> <br /> Everybody said it is really shameful. This movie might have been really strong with a little tweaking. We are going to feel something at all moments of the film, but the setup is a clear reason (which is a bad thing). The moving scene is completely flat. For example, when Kaye's brother holds the cap on his head and we put it on it, we should feel appreciated for him, feel the integrity and protection of his brother's love ... because it does not come in such a way. There are many other such scenes (for example: all the scenes of war) and they take away what they do from the movie. All these things keep together, love and suicide come as close as a long, sugar, low budget commercial.
