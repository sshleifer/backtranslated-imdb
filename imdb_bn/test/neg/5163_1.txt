What was the goal here ... I started to look at it but then realized that I had no goal ... bad acting ... there is no work and no stories ... I'm hearing David Beckham's $ at the time of surfing Read the web about the US $ 250 million Galaxy Nexus contract. Take this rent, do not take this in vain, I saw so many movies below that I realized that going to get it was going to shit. <br /> <br /> The film of war should be correct and if possible it seems like some artistic merit and actually Christian melodrama ... this film pales compared to that I've seen before. I certainly say this film will be really frustrating.
