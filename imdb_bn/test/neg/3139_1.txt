This image will be one of the most annoying film ever made. What I like is the use of Argentine-Esquier lamps in most cases. The music is terrible and the speed is so slow that you can see it at 2x speed and even it may slow down. The story does not exist. It does not even have any flashy scenes. <br /> <br /> This is classified as a horrible (at least on this site), but not so. It is a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of human nature. If you are in this type of thing and can stand slowly, see this, but I would suggest some Japanese (such as Ichi The Killer). It seems that this movie was never in the theater. The audience is doing joint suicide by the huge amounts generated by this film. This 80 minute length has been well spent to dry the paint. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 because there is no 0 in the pool-down menu.
