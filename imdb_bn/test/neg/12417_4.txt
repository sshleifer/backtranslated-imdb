40 years ago "Wild Rebels" was probably a fun second movie on a drive of the movie Triple feature. It is not very good age, but it is not meant to be good age; It can be definitely disposable, forgettable fun from its beginnings. The level at which it is taken, is a good example of Bike Flickr. <br /> <br /> Some elements help to differentiate it with some similar movies at the same time. 'Hero', 'Rod Tillman' (Steve Alimo) comes as something impossible as 'Averman' - He is not particularly bold, tough, talented or handsome (although he won the fight with half-hearted gang members, and the girl gang member At the end of the film, his fellow gang member likes to help him). The soundtrack is quite well done, it's a nice 'venters' style bus / drum ruff, which keeps moving and sacks and brass charts that make up some of the pap things quite a bit. And although the script is quite shallow, all the actors live firmly in their cardboard letters and the fair amount of energy. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of helpless technical gafts: The terrible 'day and night' scenes occur on Thursday, in the deep winds, tires take place to swim, instead of police shirts, the flames are falsely trapped, a bank sign for the manufacture of fake tape in the ceiling tile, Lugger, which sounds like Winchester 30-06, shotgun explosions cut off people 100 yards away, a detective with a bicker on the second floor Revolvers issue with the landing of an inch with a disorder of the victims. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " (!) Is inside, police road blockades do not block roads, police apparently did not listen to docking, and police detectives apparently never heard of bugs or their secret people being <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But to plot with the plot, Cameraman knows what he is doing, Most of the scenes are good for pensing, and there are some nice ones, one liner and one dialer exchange. Keep that power level up. (My favorites: "Man, you're hating personal stock (i.e., Linda)!" So, do not find this or anything, but if you have a copy of the MST version you should see some good, shallow fun Very good from "Five Hard Hard" or "Hellcats" or even 'Girl in Gold Boot' (more than three MST covered counter culture movies).
