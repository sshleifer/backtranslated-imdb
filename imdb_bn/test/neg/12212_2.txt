James Marsh's King King is a movie that deceives me. I can not mean what it meant for. This is a story about a young man named Gal Garcia Baralal, who is a young man named after Navy's job for 3 years, and then goes in search of his biological father and behaves insulting him and his family. It's really rather sick all. Elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister, Maleri (Pelle James). It is impossible to identify anyone in this movie in Central England. The missionary father and enthusiastic happy Christian church; I could not figure out what the film meant to ridicule them for their stupid beliefs. Or target a happy family and we think it is illogical. Or is it just saying that some people have lost and only the hell is destroyed? It is shallow We all know bad things happen; Why is it interesting to learn the bit, why this movie only shows violence freely, which never reveals without thinking. "King" is such a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about respect; Warrior code; The idea of ​​terrible changes; Indian-origin killings of terrorists etc. Respect is a very diverse concept. But this image adds nothing to the idea. However, Paul Proceeders did more than recommend his small role. The DVD projector shows the green shade of all the films and the only way to repair it was to send it to Belgium. He did this through Christmas. I think that the postman and the repairers and Paul went far beyond the responsibility and our award was a disrespectful film. But could you see it differently?
