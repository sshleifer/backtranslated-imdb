Given the incredible reviews of this film I really had some exceptional hopes. It is certainly a good start with a delicate and sharp dialogue, and a fine throw in place. Robert Altman-style series interwoven reel to viewers with some compelling views in a series. I sadly seized the entertainment between the second half of the film, it was broken like a pack of cards. I am amazed by the fact that I am deeply disappointed and amazed about a series of sunny events and right-messages. Paul Haggis conflicts with the issue of L.A., and it seems that this movie alone is a new level of interest. Many academy voters live in LA and have experienced some racial discrimination, this film is sure to affect them. That means that the best pictures will go to Oscars race cinemas or gay movies. Let's hope this is the next, because Brokeback Mountain is a spontaneous masterpiece that is worthy of recognition.
