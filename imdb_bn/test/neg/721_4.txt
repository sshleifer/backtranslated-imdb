This DVD was given to the director of the DVD I was working with, in which I played an actor playing Prospero. To know about my style, I do not expect anything similar to the interpretation of a "classical" text. <br /> <br /> What I found is sometimes interesting, sometimes stimulating, but often annoying and tedious. Like most experimental songs, I have found that in such films, building blocks of strong film making are made, even if they can not find the most useful form in a consistent format. <br /> <br /> We have a Caliban that are more than threatened, and those are not afraid Miranda (which is strange, because we know that she tried to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinicolo are more annoying than fun. A weird young prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylish posting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not that it's a bad movie, but an experimental one. It can take a huge risk, but it is not meant for art and film students to understand it and likewise for any person with Tempest's own interest.
