One of the interesting things happened to me while watching "Moscow": On the one hand, the deaf-mute and the director, we can not understand why he is doing what he is doing (Mancin's ..., the body) through his image. On the other hand, at least the English version is heavily dubbed. So I wish myself that there is less talk at the same time! This picture is stupid (funny how this man has access to every cemetery and mortuary in his city) and in Lorid (where we will be in our nonchatable lesbian scene in 70 seconds of exploiters?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (Oh, how sweet!) ... Miss it. (*)
