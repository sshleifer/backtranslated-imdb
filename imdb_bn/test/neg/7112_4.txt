Low rental, low-cost, police thrillers, which are portable by a fairly different bit, excellent chemistry between two leads and especially James Rimer's satisfaction turn, by a maternal, and psychological (and, naturally, integral) villain. Obviously a low-quality picture, both apparently and dramatically, instead resigned rather than burt, but is not unwanted. (**)
