There is something about a movie that gives me body bodybuilders every time in front of the screen. <br /> <br /> I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Access: Iron Eagle Third", "Renain Huq" and even the TV movie "Hot Physical", which is a big name for sports. They were tolerant in their own way (mostly, because they showed Rachel McClelich. ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I went "Nixis III: Pre-Harder", which featured it on the basis of Sui Price, Debi Mugley, Sharon Brunu and Ursul Sarsov. Female love, always will be, but after this I am very happy I miss the first two "sample" flicks. <br /> <br /> Well, the first one, anyway. Most footage here is raised physically (and assault and scream, I guess) from "sample second". Indeed, anyone who looked at the offer provided here looked a little entertaining. <br /> <br /> But the price and the company's flex and pos, they do not get the chance to do something else (say, ACT!). Actually, this whole film is an exercise (get it? Ha ha ha ...) in the story-telling, flawed characters and in the making of open-ended films (as well as in the story-line of filming). <br /> <br /> Nothing can be done, even if it does not, still there will be problems - such as small parts for women larger than women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Price, Mugli, Bruneu and Sarcev entered their body, so the "crafts" work itself did not work. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
