Actually frustrating the hayst movie, I'm really going through a cool cool cat and mouse stuff film and some cats and mouse stuff is expected to continue, but it was simply stupid. And it's basically all good scenes of trailer, if you've seen its trailer, you basically saw the whole movie because it's just expected. So basically this plot is about some of the armored truck company employees who try to steal $ 42 million, until the number of conscience increases. I will be good in movies with the cast of the famous actor, but I was wrong. I did not necessarily mean a bad film but it was not that good or had any depth. This is most definitely the best fare, it is not really worth seeing in theaters. Hustle <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
