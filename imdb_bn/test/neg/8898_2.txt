Although I rarely agree with FilmConnique, I say that this film is not awful, but I do not care so much ... and it's going to be all right ... its moment ... three or four who snicker me ... But most of the time I was sitting and wondering why? Why does this character work? Even the hot shot characters have worn more and have gone ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Netherland-Film, see the bookstalk. There it was more than the random ethnicity, which was walking near each other in Swedish tandra ... <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed ...
