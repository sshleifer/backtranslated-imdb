Q: How does the film make two different titles like "Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> The picture is so bad that filmmakers can not decide on any title !!!! <br /> <br /> This picture is a secret place for martial arts, death isher-vendetas, melody, romance and other clich film tricks. The story focuses on a warning group known as The Librarians, under the leadership of Agent Simon (William Forciythe). The group is hot in search of an overwhelming, multilingual, insects, called Marcos (Andrew Divph), who hold women and host them in the law-unheard urban world in South Florida. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds appeared as a cameo in this film, and his view is completely executive. Burt delivers a long monologue of the weird drill I've ever heard. It may be an attempt by Bart in an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is to counter the "The Godfather" Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This picture is also displayed by Erica Elenic, who surrounds the inner circle of Marcos's wicked world. Arina's character entered into a coalition with Simon. Librarian and Erica will have a strong strike force against the temple, which is delivered directly from your editing room to your Cable TV box.
