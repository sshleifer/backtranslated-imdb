It's really one of the most awesome movies of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the shoes string budget shot was particularly painful. Plane Nine will be the worst day for night shots from outdoor spaces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br that is awesome? And I like the extra moggys used, I think they are less cheap. Although it seems a bit obvious that some Tuna was carefully hiding in the camera. <br /> <br /> This picture is so dangerous, it should have a public health alert. There was a row in my local video store when I took it back, people wanted their money back. I'm not joking with you!
