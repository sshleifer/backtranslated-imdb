Although I sat and saw the whole thing, I would definitely say it was not good. It was everywhere, how large sections of information were developed and even some bits were wrong. If you do not know anything about Michael, you do not understand anything. To make a bit of bit you need to rely on your current knowledge. Acting was a little dramatic, something like Flex Alexander Michael did not see anything like that for me and in the end he literally grea Seeing Sai, who portrayed Michael as a bit na√Øve but very positive, gentle and loving, though he has still become stupid for a while. If you want to see the life story of MJ, "See an American Dream" "It's a lot better, but it will land within the" bad "era. I have no doubt that they will finally make a big budget film in the life story of MJ, Michael you rock ;-) !!!!
