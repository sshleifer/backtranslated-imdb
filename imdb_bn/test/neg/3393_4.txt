Why this film has become very short of its feasibility (I do not read too much, so I do not care what the novel was like). 1. I think Brendan Fraussier copied his Enkino guy from Tarzan in Lambert. It was tough, and his Tarzan call was a bit more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screwed up with the story. Perhaps the book goes as well, but as long as I can remember that Tarzan's first words were "My Tarzan, You Jane". Jen is the first person to encounter tarzan. In the version of Wessimullar, I liked a little more than the little midget pygmims, but the bow and arrow were a little sticky. 3. Tarzan is primarily a love story. I'm sorry, but the love interest enters the picture within an hour. That's the best qualification for a helpful role. Helpful role and lead not to each other, not enough screen time, sorry. Only Andy McDowell's moody condition (mostly his strong southern pronunciation can not be masked) Tarzan and Jane's chemistry scale were 0. It is not believed that they love each other, so that Belgian dishes stop the voice. , Quite frankly, stupid When Tarzan wants to see Jen for the first time in the Janel, if he wishes, he feels the feeling he never felt before. Jane finds humanity in her, and she finds her untamed side. This chemistry that compels Tarzan's story. The desire of Lord Greystone's death to keep his land complete and that boy is not going to do it for him. Even a good face lift can not help this movie. It needs huge internal reconstruction. Oh, and maybe we can shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not show the quality of the sound at the sound level. Final verdict, 4 out of 10 Sorry, tin-man, and if you want to see the real role, leave Lambert and check out Leonardo DiCaprio.
