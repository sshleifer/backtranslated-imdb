OK, to get started, this movie was not like the book. I read the book at the age of 13 and even then it became my darling. When I'm waiting to come out of a different book, I'm going to fill that book. I have 3 copies for God. However, I knew that something like this book is not going to happen but let's go! They could do a little better than this. I wanted to see American Wayuuuf in Paris or London, if I saw them, then they understood it seriously. They took a perfectly good story and it's been rolling around a copy of a story that has been said repeatedly and quite a bit tired of seeing it. I'm the best part of the whole F ***** G (sorry) story ends with Gabriel. She does not die. What was that about? And he's old in this movie. Gabriel is only 24 not 44. ** It is supposed to be. Awww And Austrade who came with ** the idea of ​​Austrade being the number of Vivian's aunt. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww Anyway yes that my little rant seriously fell ** close. Hope this help.
