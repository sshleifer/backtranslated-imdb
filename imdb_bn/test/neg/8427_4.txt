I went to show this picture on Greek television last night, because this movie is playing due to the upcoming Olympic Games coming through my city. This is an American film, it's like I would pay more attention to the story of American athletes. Ready for it. But what I saw ..., much more! I mean, when there is a movie title ("the first Olympics: Athens 1896"), even the origins of America may be, but you do not expect it to be so promising and anticipated. At the same time, unknown athletes and efforts of other countries American sportspersons have all the gifts of nature (energy, consciousness, kindness, kindness, arrogance ...), against their "sin-athlete" games, who seem to be even impossible ... express their thoughts or feelings. The film should be the record of the American music all the time in its time. This is the best in Messalomania! It also uses imaginary phenomena that the Greek race, such as Greek citizens, ridicule Greek nation with the serving of foreign marathon athletes, so that domestic helpers conquer the nation. Many for the souls of the Olympics. <br /> <br /> Think about it. And in a movie whose title is a bad sign in a movie that does not satisfy me, according to what I have seen, I can not give more than 4 out of 10 (actually being quite generous).
