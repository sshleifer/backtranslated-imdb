"Most of the pictures I made could probably work 50 years ago, and it's just that there are a lot of my old-fashioned value." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Although this image is a loose affair of "a Guy named Joe", it is "Life and death" and "Wings of Desire" There are also plenty of loans taken from <br /> <br /> 2. It was the second attempt at Freiburg's Frank Caper. <br /> <br /> Spielberg has often said that he wants to create "Frank Cappa Cinematic" in his veins of "It's a wonderful life" and "Mrs. Smith goes to Washington." Judging by the recent effort of restoring his role in "Harvey", it seems that Spielberg still retains the dream, the director is not satisfied with his last 3 engagements. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics fall "always", saying that the action sequences from the film's romance have been confused, but this is not really a problem. The problem is that, "always", Spibberg needs more special effects to distract us from any conversation that does not end in any surprising point. <br /> <br /> 5. The film is filled with comedy, which does not just work. Spielberg's comedic flavors are not very sophisticated and it appears to have been from the screws of 1950 and just outside the Lonny Tune Cartoon. These exaggerated antics can work in a cartoon universe, but in a film it seems like an odd marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The lead of the photo is not as the couple's boyfriend, brothers and sisters. Spielberg's movies are always intimidating towards gender and intimacy, but the film goes to the extreme length: he is an advertising dome and he is an intelligent old man. They are more annoying than respect. <br /> <br /> 7. The film has a good view, where John Goodman has debated with Hunter Hunter, but in most cases the film characters are very annoying. There is no subtlety, every emotion overplayed, designed on each joke, filled with unnecessary busyness in each order. <br /> <br /> 8. How to congratulate the audience on "always" and "hook" Spillaber. After their failure (and the twin financial failures of "purple violet" and "sun empire") spielberg "shades of purple" and "the kingdom of the sun", and the "dark and white" world of "black and white" "Schindler's list", "Munich" in the world. "Minority Report" and "Savings Private Ryan". From here, "low light" and "dark painter" have become equally critical. <br /> <br /> 9 After the financial success of every "dark movie", Spielberg returned to his color painting and again flattened his face. Follow "Amstad" followed by "SkinLars list", "Ai" followed by "Ryan" and "Lincoln" "Munich". These "color" movies are always tangled for very strong, emotional, curly and hockey, but if you remove the stability, then these "serious" movies will feel the same way. <br /> <br /> 10. In the 70's, Spielberg himself tried to isolate himself from other "broad" pack directors (Scorsese, de Palma, Capola, etc.), claiming to be "relatively" and "humanist". He said this again and again in many interviews in the late 70's. The reality, though, is that perhaps most of these directors are unhappy, most of his films often reduce their content, their box office performance is always comparable to their amazing displays of murder. <br /> <br /> 11. Failure to attach Spellberg to "always" characters, and instead he sees that his filmmaking completely spreads for the purpose of filming forest fire, plane crashing. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, nages, trips, stones, etc. ... this spielberg rejoices. Right now its characters do not stop talking, but everything is self-reliant. A movie like "Amitath" failed, in other words, because enough black did not die and too much white talk. <br /> <br /> 12. The film's flying scenes were not set to the standard set of mega-hits "Top Gun" a few years ago. Of course, when your "enemy" fire a forest, it's hard to make movie cinema. <br /> <br /> 13. The failure of "1941", "hook", "always", etc. are often more vivid of Splibberg's more successful films. They expressed the steel skeleton below the strategy. They show that it does not work when the entertainment park looks like park, release the vacuum below the broken machinery. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Here's a good order (two actors in a room, only reforming), but this is mostly a boring picture with a prospective script. <br /> <br /> One philosophy worth
