It is considered to be Charlie's best version, but I would claim that this is actually one of his weak movies. First of all, it's not funny. One thing in this movie did not laugh at me. OK, a quick jump in a box that was a molten, but that was one of the frustrations. The first and only conversation of the tram where he spoke (he is singing in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us why he was so delighted to see two films in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush", at least ten times this film Better than This film has literally only a good view, where Hitler plays with the world like a sea beach. OK <br /> <br /> So, we got great acclaim as the first movie for war, even before the war. No Not true Not just the truth, so may be a bit of praise. Three Stages, 19 January 1940 with "You Natji Spy" - ten months before the October Chaplin film release - and that movie was really fun! If you want to see Chaplin's greatest film then refer to it for reference. And then pop into "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limitight", "The Kid" or even "Tilly's Pixired Romance"
