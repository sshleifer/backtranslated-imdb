Well, at least we must accept the horror of the big Hollywood producer - finally becoming smart and more conscious. Pursuing the buying of Asian Hottest Hit Patients and then instead of waiting for them to be rebuilt in America, they have now discovered that they can hire only Asian directors and directly create their new ghost stories in their state. It's like killing two birds with a stone; The way to go! "Messenger" is very similar to one another's supernatural, which has come out of the Oriental country from "Rinku". It has been translated roughly, it means that it is a boring, excessive and completely cow-free film, but it has a lot of terrible false accusations and has embarrassing weak characteristics "Do we still fear you?" The moment Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide) created the most impressive "The Eye" in the past and it is a tradition for them to create a story with a story of good news and hints that almost impossible to fulfill their comedy expectations. The audience, yet they do not seem to be interested in changing their formula soon. And they are equally unscrupulous enough to repeat over the issues of the same old and repetitive Scratch. The restless spirits of the residents of the remote villages are trapped in the remote villages? The dramatic family has severed the tragedies from the past, so they must first restore trust and faith among each other? Give me a break Throw in a video tape and a seven-day-curse, why do not you? Even if you try to jump on your seat too much, and you will not be afraid of anyone aged over 7. The door, the dirty, and gradually rising large stains on the walls, the spectacular presence, the noise coming from noise. The endless use of such strategies is becoming almost insulting to the horror fans. "Messengers" roam around their family as a sunflower producer of a new life in the country. Family situation has its effectiveness with a personal tragedy (which does not appear until it is delayed in film), its little boy stops talking, and parents allow their rebel teenage girl to disbelieve. Shortly after, children in remote farms enjoy strange views, but they do not firmly believe to leave their parents. That mostly concludes the whole film. Little Ben sees something, but he can not talk and Jessica is attacked by allergists repeatedly, but no one listens to him. The basic foundation of "messengers" is very derivative of Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", it only lacks continuous evil atmosphere and annoying tone. The final restraint is fairly easy to predict, but it is very important to take the script seriously and absence of violence and absence of bloodshed. At least "The Eye" has finally delivered some real shocks, where the joy of the last happy happiness of "Gospel" is sad only. The only positive element that I can remember is the location of beautiful rural film, adequate editing work and committed young talent (and beauty) Christian Stewart. And William B. Davies has a unscrupulous, but sadly helpful supporting role.
