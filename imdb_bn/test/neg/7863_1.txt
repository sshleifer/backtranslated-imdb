This movie is so bad that it actually gets fun. In my lifetime, I have seen the worst movies ever. The interesting thing is that there was a scene in the trailer, which was not in the film. Just seeing the trailer, I could save a lot of time. It actually showed what happened in the film without conclusion and it was also very clear. <br /> <br /> This is why it is really hard to think of a reason to make this movie. This is just so bad. Horrible <br /> <br /> If possible, I can give 0 out of 10. There is nothing more to say about this movie.
