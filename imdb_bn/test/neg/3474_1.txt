Perhaps we hear the antiquity brought on the screen, we are connected to too much of great spectacles. Probably, we are very much hopeful of this movie. However, if we, as viewers, are paid much less, then what will happen? <br /> <br /> I thought after seeing epirium - NERONE by Paul Marcus, a part of the production of the Roman Empire series. Augustus was included in Peter O'Woole by Roger Young of the first iPod movie, but what does this film contain? <br /> <br /> Very rarely. Historical flaws are so serious that the film transforms events and constitutes a distorted picture of the Roman Empire rather than true history. Throughout the film, we see Niro Youth: During the long rule of Kuligulal, the young man was under the rule of Cloodi and finally, during his (historically 14 years of long) rule, the young man And ... he's the same one. According to the film, Nabaro was born during Tiberius's reign, lived for more than 40 years, but after his death, it can be seen in the twentieth century ... The film is a big problem in the film, which makes it very reasonable, not reliable. Nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. At that time, her mother, Agrippina, was exiled by Caligula. Later, he suddenly married Emperor Claudius, who has already married Messina and took big boys. At the moment of the movie, we see the Nero's Builder Act (Rike Schmid). All right, historically "correct"; Nevertheless, no source proves that he played such decisive role in the emergence of Christianity in Rome. In the film, he is not only a dedicated Christian but also a witness of St. Paul's miracle (he resurrected a young girl Marjia). Alongside, historically, there was nothing like a monumental show in the Court of Kerry, because Nilea was born during the 4 year long rule of Keligul ((37-41) Nero. I understand that the movie can change something, but such error makes the script incredible! And many are related to most of the majority of subjects which are hard to guess, but after 30 minutes of watching this film, I doubt whether I saw a historical movie or total imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our supplies, along with entertainment, are here as history, as they are equally furrowed. The performance is artificial, cast is simply beautiful face but has weak acting ability. Probably, I was very much attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Lofton in the range, but Hans Matheson is not fit like Nero. She could have some of the moments as well as actors but but never as infamous Roman Emperor. He is an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a monk who printed love for his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "neutral justice"? Nobody. He is just a young man who does not know how to rule and burns himself in the fire for a long time ... John Simm is making the film as Kaligula and the worst of each other's picture. Elisa Tovti is just sexy as POPIA; Yet he may have been much better. The dress is wrong and the set is not surprised. Less budget impacts and consequently, less entertainment <br /> <br /> But the anger in this movie makes me angry and, as a result, I give it 1/10 which is totally unacceptable at some point: <br /> <br /> - With his body piercing Pope and St Paul's The death of the words, <br /> <br /> <br /> Claudius is about the current victory of Britain in this festival and soon mentioning his death (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Finally, The death of Nero - a quiet day in the lake and a neutral suicide which leads to morality "We forgive him" <br /> <br /> On top of all, this movie is worthless and time-consuming as a second product related to the Roman Empire. Better to make a good film in 30 years than ten small children, it should not be done at 1/10.
