Yesterday I saw this TV production, and I was very frustrated. <br /> <br /> It was a TV project, I did not have great expectations, but the whole film was painful. I think it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just those who were concerned about me. Each minute was a long struggle and I've really struggled to stay away from "close off". <br /> <br /> This film is about a doctor (Dr. Vargas), who gets many AIDS patients, and most of them die during the movie. Vorgis is hard to live with, so his family is punished with his frustration. However, both sides of this picture appear to have problems, most of them pay attention to the conversation with the patient, and sometimes we see the flick of his house, but we do not get much. The disadvantages of showing more than one part of Verghese's life is not better with the actor of New York Andrus, I'm a man (hopefully) can not see in a better future film. <br /> <br /> I believe that it got 7,6 (banned?), but I'm sure there are good movies in this market. Stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10 <br /> <br />
