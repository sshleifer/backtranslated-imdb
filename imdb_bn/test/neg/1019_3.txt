This movie is really BAD, without the beautiful settings, without Chilean landscape it's nothing interesting or worth nothing. I know four lines will be provided as my commentary for this movie, but the thing is that it is a bad film, that I can only say that it is actually BAD. Michael Iranside is the only one who has saved money in the film.
