Not done well, the whole movie was just going around and killing random people out of nowhere. There is nothing to do with the stories of random people, for example, like 3 school girls die. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the story of the family at the beginning, I believe that they were a random person who never went home, and sometimes had nothing to do with the murder of Grace. <br /> <br /> I did not affect myself, I was not afraid, I did not jump into any part, and just to get more money off the whole movie was simply a random piece. <br /> <br /> I believe that The Grade 2 is like a movie movie on The Grood 3, if they ever have one. They should not even say this fault 2, they should say the temptation of a slander 2, and if you saw it you will see, because I'm not going to loot anything. <br /> <br /> 1/10, scary, bad story, and it's not completely random.
