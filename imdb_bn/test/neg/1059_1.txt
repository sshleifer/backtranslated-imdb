Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffith and the producers think we're all stupid. If we do not understand this then <br/> <br /> <br /> American pilots go to MiG-29 Suddenly all the aircraft flew to F-16. Yes, a magic! After an action ... Migs land. Magic again! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that F-16s were Israel's sign? <br /> <br /> Another magic: Clearly, the unarmed L-39 trainers bombard the enemy. <br /> <br /> And more magic: Although all the movies are located in Europe, we can see the desert on almost any flight. Perhaps the director has ruined all his magic on top of all things, because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and the explosions seem scary to see the pilots bombing Malhotse. <br /> <br /> All right, it's a movie. I will write about his story ... wait. A story Yes there are some stories in this movie. And its terrible as well.
