An art teacher arrives at an old wooden bed made from Gingco tree and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he has been hunted down by an ancient soul which, by harboring the human heart in the human heart, sustains his human form. <Br /> <br /> This terribly horrible horror created ?? Well, in fact it provides something more imaginative / romance than anything else, and some surprising scenes, but the plot was very interesting and the source script lacked any sort of way of living. The problem was that I spent most of my time trying to keep my fingers away from the fast forward button. It could obviously make the film clear to the pacing, but again I did not know much about it, which was difficult to guess or it was hard to put interest in the first place. The performance is very melodramatic or simply plain lazy, and it is probably because these characters are unknown, barbarous and coma educations. The actual back-story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and combined together, as well as giving a lot of attention to radioactive romance, it should be ridiculous and overall it is created in a general way that tears alone or film carry consistency What compensates for the errors in the story is really a lady image, which looked grand, but the use of some pictures makes me somewhat amazed with the real meaning of the movie. Whether your eyes catch faded color projects, but sometimes the actual screen will look really grainy, or snowy. Although, it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but adds some nice smooth effects that are scary but sometimes good with excited scores. The camera work was quite diverse (although it did not add too much to the feature), but more intense scenes had many close ups or dark lights making it hard to understand what you are seeing. Also the show is not extraordinary and not extraordinary on some beautiful moments of blood and gore, but most other movies. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movies are interesting with some brilliant images that look like a painting. Especially is not enticing. See, it may be a deep transce you!
