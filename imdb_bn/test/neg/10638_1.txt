This movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 is so great. Nothing good bloody ... but many times without much meaning but without fundamentalism. Movies past, present (1996) and puzzle box about the future. The creator of the box and his descendants fight some giant but nothing links to 3 stories seriously. Pinhed is in the movie ... but it's not Pinehad, he's just a boring bad guy who kidnaps children and kills the birds, and worse ... he talks too much. One thing that I did not really understand is why dogs from dogs ????? He could not be a cenobites because he had nothing in man. Other animals from hell could take bullets without problems, why can dogs be killed by pressure ????? Blood pressure is incompatible with the film series in many ways. For example, Pinehade and Angelique are old friends in this film. But met with Pinhed Angel because Pinheed was a soldier in World War I and Angelique was an old monster and he lived in Paris for 200 years sometimes.
