This is about one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Although it is not the worst - it is the honor that Monos is in luck. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. To get started, this whole movie is a cheap rip off of Canaan movies. A sticky dress up baby wearing a hobbep, a cool Asian warrior, a bad cookie cutter, almost stupid solidarity, etc. There are many flaws in this picture. Thankfully, when I saw this picture, I saw version of MST3. Joel and 'Bots make the movie worth watching, otherwise I'll close the film for five minutes.
