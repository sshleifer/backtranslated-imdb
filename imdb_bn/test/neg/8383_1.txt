This picture is a nightmare! When you wake up from a nightmare, the feeling you feel is the same as I see this movie: "Oops ?? OK, it's gone, what relief!" I felt the pain of watching this movie, was so bad! This is a B-series low-cost movie, it's definitely, but I think it's not an excuse to make it so bad! I saw a brilliant low-cost movie, with excellent plot, excellent production, excellent acting, and most material! This one got nothing! The plot is ridiculous, it is almost an "American guide that transforms ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, as some children play with this ghost"? I do not know whether the Chinese story is actually in this movie or not, but if it is "harm" worse then! The production is just awesome, a flat zero (what are those "special effects"?). There is no mystery. The supposed "tension scene" is a complete failure. Not good at acting; And what about dialogue? O god! A movie that has several conversations for several times: "I'll go there later, okay? Is it OK ?? OK, OK - OK ??? OK, okay, then bye" ?? I'm not sure it is worth 1/10! <br /> <br /> can be very bad!
