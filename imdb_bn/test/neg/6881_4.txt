Overall it was a watchable movie. I could not stop it or stop coming back to it - a clear sign of a boring movie - so it passed the first test. Best of all, it got stories fast, no annoying back stories for any character characters. <br /> <br /> It will not go down as a great movie. Not as a great B movie. I recommend this movie to Slashar / Awesome fans who do not pay attention directly to the video release. Like some movies of <br /> <br />, there is no nudity, only moderate language and changing gore. Although there are violence. Death was rather dry and unimaginative rather. Computer special effects were actually quite good. In some scenes, the 'animals' way of preserving their discipline reminds me of 'Spon' and 'Ghost Rider' comic books. <br /> <br /> A little pet piv ... it is set in lucian, but no one seems to speak with no pronunciation. I did not even understand the photos in lagini. <br /> <br /> Like small budget movies, there are small touches for filming. The lack of time and money can be the main reason for the caves. For example, in one scene it is black pitch in the second half of the afternoon ... a small car ride. Another example was the double stunt for 'animal', when the animal was out of the hat truck 'animal' was not on the makeup ... it seems that he was wearing a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br /> In short, I did not hate this movie, but I did not like it. I probably did not rent it again, but if a friend owned it, I could see it again a few years later.
