After all, there is nothing against my Christianity. I believe, every person has the right to believe what he has right. But I can not imagine how foolish a man must believe! What is a waste of believers' money? They will use it better to feed some hungry families in third world countries. I do not want to talk about this "movie" conversation or plot, because I could not find any of these. The story is simple - two journalists, one atheist, and others (b) have abandoned religion for some reason. B attains trust in religion and teaches a lesson - Believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears ten minutes and repeats at the end of the movie. People, do not believe this "movie" rating, read the first review. I did not waste an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it classified as a scientist? Why are some strange words and some bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = evil of Satan?
