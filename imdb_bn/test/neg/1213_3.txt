I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's actually quite interesting and engaging. Cast strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields came in as herself as an actress. Black and white must definitely release him, because I have never seen him in these many commands playing this conventional character. If properly marketed, it may be a medium size hit.
