I told one of my friends that my grandfather actually broke into this terrible piece by looking at the theater one night. He does not pick another one again! It was bad! However, my friend then told me that he wrote something for his father's garbage. I thought he was having fun. It turns out, he was serious. He did not actually see it, and he said that it kept fast for his father's writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But, if he actually breaks and sees it, he can see in a few minutes why he ended his father's day as a writer. I mean, even in the 1980s, this shit story is far worse than that. Meaning, as Joe Frazier's terrible money? And why would two policemen take care of a house in the exterior house? And movie poster? Hanging a ghost with his tongue? What about that Makes no sense about this. Well, I told my friend that this frog did not just finish his father's writing career, all involved in the career ended. Or at least one movie has never been fully restored from this trash. Let's just say that I am ridiculed for revealing my father as the writer of this movie! Just how bad it would be to say!
