I love this for the comedy that I am seeing these days at the age of 60, one of the 60's in the 50's. Chronicles will never let you go with these movies, they take themselves seriously and have a very low budget, to ensure a recipe for better viewing. Ed Nelson is a very capable actor, as well as many other favorites who have met Superman and most Westerners of the day. The costume was quite bad and the alien-speaking word, the good reverb was a little off but it's beauty that. Creating a movie for its love, finding perfectness is not just a step to do it, but it comes through it. This is a fun time in films! MST 3 version is even better!
