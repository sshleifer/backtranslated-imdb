Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, part-time comic and funny guy African Scavner, a private killer called Duke named after the dog? I suppose all good nicknames were not found in Siquadari (Square), Scorpio, Flute, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latino (whip), Nebula (Blade), etc.? And why would some South American killer be familiar with a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army ?? Last time I checked, ERA did not want to open any branch in South America's headquarters. And why are some fishermen-hard, war-tired Irish terrorists like middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought maybe this movie is going to be the "The Cring Game" mustache when the character of Cerberti appears as a person who is going to find "Jackal". What a bad cast! And why would the FBI appoint abusive terrorists to be killed ?? It seems for mass destruction as a terrorist, and a killer usually hit one target in a non-sightable manner. But according to the FBI, Geer is the only person who has seen Willis alive. I thought the film was thought to be a repetition of a great movie "The Jackal of Day Jackal", but this film is a scarf version of "Assassins" of Stallone and Banderas. These two films are really stupid, and the stupid part is to force our Bruce Willis to go through his routines and we should say "Wow! She is not smart!" There was a better movie about professional killers with Gene Reno. "The Jackal" is a film of only two fat middle-aged Millionaire actors who can stand to pretend to be pretty looking and smart! "The Jackal" is so poor, that I hope to showcase Cami appearances as "other" Hitman or FBI, with Sally Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Gene Clad Van Dumey. Not saying, "The Jackal" has exceeded the FBI for 25 years, but only with Richard Gere's job, "The Zakal" just a few days before the clutches! I guess the positive message of this movie, "Thanks to the terrorists, the killers are safe on our streets." Overall, "Jackal" has no freedom fighters.
