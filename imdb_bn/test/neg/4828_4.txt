I have seen this picture almost 30 years ago and it has been stuck in my mind till now. When I arrived at the DVD, I did not hesitate much, even long ago, because there was a preliminary for my first Belmond Flecks. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to save certain memory and to disappoint the audience. <br /> <br /> Congratulations as a rarely impressive work of Chibral, watching it ... annoying. Some movies really do not really style age. But there was no style about movies? <br /> <br /> Script errors, unclear acting - due to the lack of possible direction - which is a type of production design that is not less than the middle of the photograph, its name is not suitable, but at the least, I saw the worst performance in the age, This makes it really difficult to stand up. <br /> <br /> My idea was that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but perhaps there was no idea or no skill at all. It is astonishing that the career of this chabar is not a sudden end. Do not blame it on the overall bad taste of 70, it is a fibers for its own right and the competing competitor for the most vulnerable waste of celluloid.
