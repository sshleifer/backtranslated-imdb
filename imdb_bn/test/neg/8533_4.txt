This movie contains all the elements of a great horror story and it's lost in the last half. Some movies can actually prevent me from cold. This one did not. Some horror movies give me a sense of fear. This one did not. Keep me guessing it. I care about the story. I care about letters The acting was decent. Unfortunately, almost half the way through the film, there are not many good things that can be found in the story. It is clear that everything cool about the plot is going to be destroyed. Do it As a great awful idea, the construction of the first half moved away to the horrific and terrible side. A potentially feared character turns into a series of incredible reactions from. The story ends with disappointing. Although this movie seems to be complete, there is an empty end that can set up for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a single pic. This movie is valuable to watch at the theater, just do not expect to be surprised. This rental is suitable as a movie suitable. This is probably not a movie that you want to like yourself.
