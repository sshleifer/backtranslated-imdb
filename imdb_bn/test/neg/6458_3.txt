Body Ackerman's role is no stretch for Kevin Speacy. She played that character version many times, well films. It is lucky because it gives its performance a certain resonance, without which Badi will be flat and incomplete like other characters on this indirectly short distance. The script gives little time for the plot or character development, which is similar to a porn flick in its snowfall to get "good things". The difference here is "good thing" people are not enjoying each other but inflicting pain, it is suitable for young adults to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guess there is something wrong with the "I swim with sharks", when people are sexually, and I want to see people during physical, mental, and mental torture. But if you are provocative satirical, interesting characters or anything else that is more engaged than your greatest feeling, you probably see elsewhere.
