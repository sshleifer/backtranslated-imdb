Above all, the experience of a law enforcement (not an ER or EMT, but a real law enforcement) takes this show seriously with a person. In the United States, any police force will be allowed to walk into Walker from the illegal and completely irrelevant strategies. Above him, he is a comic book character --- no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. Alex Cahill loves him really how dirty blondes really look. And Trivate black face final dress. Come on --- If you think that Waqar is a fairly impressive show, then explain why the jetty is considered to be a dolt. Always talk about Walker's joke, sometimes it is not allowed to solve the crime, and do not rescue Walker, he is a stupid thing For those who should die over 50 times. Although it may be true that many criminals go less than their pursuing detective and (and believe me, most of the police get spoiled from the dirt), it comes against intelligent Walker that once the bowler gets caught, the quarrel needs to be tormented. But again, Norris had created and acted in this show, so how can he get rid of himself voluntarily or even show his stupidity in his strategy. Six boys are waiting for him to take him all the time. What a horrible series! Like the hockey west, it's more disrespectful than Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Sisko Kid and Wild Bill Hikk, though I think most of you here are too young to remember those events. But just like those shows, the way Walker T.R is insulting and just plain silly.
