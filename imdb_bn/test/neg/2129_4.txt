I really wanted to like this movie to express appreciation for the Italian rip-off movie (especially the Jaw Rip Off!), But it is easy to see that the giant shark is not very good. All these signs have a great piece of trash there; We've got Lamberto Bava, a legendary film from Trashy Sust movie, the best comedian, Michael Sauquky, at the director-chair, and has been a central lively person who gave it the best, the film's genre has offered a run for its meaning, but in some way the film is still Moves to change The 'giant shark' is not often featured, it is probably a good thing given to the creature's design, but never again to drag the film through it. The plot focuses on a resort on the southern coast of Florida (or, in Italy, anywhere), where many local people are suffering from arms and legs. Local authorities have decided that this creature has never been seen before and it is caught by a small crew of many sea experts alive so long ago! <br /> <br /> The main problem of this picture is that it always seems vain and is less likely to be characterized by character or plot development, even at least the demands for the audience are likely to be disturbed. . This type of picture is very famous for being brighter, although the fun elements of 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' are unfortunately missing in most of the running times. The thing I love about lead actor Michael Soziqui is that he thinks he is taking it seriously in whatever movie he does, (although he only made four). Of course this happened here, though Bawa did not completely immerse him and often think of extra wheel like the rest of the film. Most runtime spends watching the characters of Super American lasers, and this is not very interesting; Although Bowa is doing good work till the end, since the Central giant will finally have to attack the prisoners. Overall, there really is not much to recommend this film. As mentioned, I really liked this kind of stuff and even I found myself disturbed on many occasions. Just for the Italian frightening fans!
