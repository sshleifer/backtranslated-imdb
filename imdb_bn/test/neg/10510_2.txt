I do not know where to start here. Imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from acting that the story gets angry at you. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's saying a lot because I'm seeing something bad. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade, but I thought it got Kung Fu and Vampires, a combination that I thought could be a failure. Until that I popped this into my DVD player. How Ron is pond and marshal art is as cold as some mess up me managed to get me excited. First actress I do not expect much to start from here because it's an action movie and a B in it, but the acting here is so bad that I could not help but be bothered. Expression and voice tones were far from the place, almost no emotions in the whole film, and when it was so ridiculous, it seemed like I was watching Mad TV. For example, Jeremy shouted, when Deckeck killed him, the master should not be born in the first place. Initially I saw good acting in elementary school plays. There are still arrangements. The film has worked until it is too late than the sub-parameters. But do not let the action down down the total as Ron still seems to have some martial arts skills. But his skills are galaxy by his stupid work, for example the part of the movie where he starts to tremble and the camera changes. I ripped a pillow in about half. And battle scenes where warriors close purple by swinging their arms to their prison friends. WOW.OR How Derek knows the magic part of the prison and everyone can express the feelings that they can create the holy water of the water. And to go as far as props. The gun looks like a walmart toy, teeth are stolen from Halloween costumes, and the word CG can not be described how bad the graphics are. I could go for hours with this movie for all the mistakes and believe me that it's just ice tip. It only got one 2 because it smiles me. Although I saw how bad the movie was smiling, smile smile. I say tell the vampire killer clearly unless you want to laugh in a horrible movie or plan to tort for a long time and want to practice
