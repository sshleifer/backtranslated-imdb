It has been rented under the title speaker from my local blockbuster - if you still need to see it after this review, but it may be a way to find it. <br /> <br /> This is a film about serial killer Richard Speake. , 60 killed several nurses in Chicago. Seeing the film, one feels that it follows the letter in the letter. Unfortunately, this does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem was my close constant music, which we knew was that it was a scary movie and some of the God-fearing descriptions of us spell motivation. This kind of acting was average for the film; To give credit where credit is due, the film is very neatly photographed for my taste. Your mileage may change. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this, your time may be valuable.
