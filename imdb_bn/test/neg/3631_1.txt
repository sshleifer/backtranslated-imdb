I first saw this smile a few smiles, well played, and hoped good plot. Sadly, I did not find any of these. <br /> <br /> First off, this show is completely unreal. How can someone go to a boarding school which is super hip, awesome location, and just a rule? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI Bar No school has a sushi bar. And what's with a big, super-cool, supernatural hip dorm room? This will not happen in the boarding school! This show seems to be perfect for everyone. Zoey, looks perfect, has perfect friends, does not have to do homework, and is very popular. More words like an arch to me! I hate using so many classes in this show, for example: Scan Dog Wings. He wears the complete unconscious and "red" clothes. Curiosity is old old and so old! If I were you, I would not see this show, it was one of the most awesome shows I've seen and I hope it will soon be canceled! Ratings: 1/10
