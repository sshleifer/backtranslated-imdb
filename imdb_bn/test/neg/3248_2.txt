All right, I can give it 1, but I'm going to give it two because I was laughing at this movie ... First of all, I can make a better film than this week ... week. Special effects This film is like a joke Look. Because people should not take it seriously because such a movie with a terrible special effect should not be done. Acting and direction were horrible. There were many plot holes in the screen and the whole film was not reliable. It will be the worst Indian film ever. The song was bad. The acting was bad and artificial. I would like to say more. Do not watch this movie until you're curious to see how bad it is. That's why I saw it. I'm going to the movie and I want to see how bad movies can be bad. Believe me, I saw the worst movie in history, if not the worst movie.
