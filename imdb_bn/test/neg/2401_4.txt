When the American film industry critically tries to look at their own government, they look bad even when it looks bad. <br /> <br /> This image correctly publishes 1 thing which is wrong in American politics. It seems that the cartoon can be f ** k, which it needs to be done !!! Mix an American congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and a Arab ... only in Ruskies **. Thank you for giving us Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> This picture comes in handy for resolving the frustration: An intelligent effort to recommend a link in the argument and argument behind American help using the imagery of Afghan children and stories of Soviet torture and then creation using weapons without any weapon. Every smart person knows why $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... Not sure that Afghan children are dying. <br /> <br /> Naturally serious problems face serious dialogue. "Here you are, you M *** RF ***** s" guess the end of the Huffham end, which is missing, the American flag on the background and the stupid military solution. Movies can not help but end up feeling the pride of America and how we (the Americans) have saved the world ... again. Even the last 5 minutes of the movie can not save it, where it is trying to stop praising yourself and it only ups its another American F ** <br /> and editing was good though.
