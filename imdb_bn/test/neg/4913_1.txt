Aksa is a horror movie. Scripts, stories, acting are all easy ridiculous. Dino has acted as a person who gave Mary to Imran Hashmi to persuade his wife. Yes, it sounds as ridiculous. Moria and Hashimi both offer incredibly and vaguely bad performance. Udita Goswami plays an aggressive, playful and angry wife. She has good looking but zero acting talent. This movie has a hit song "Jhalak Duklja" which is composed by Himesh Rashmemiya and has composed songs. I do not understand the hype around this song as though it is interesting to find it interesting though. The film is considered to be a thriller, but thanks to its terrible instructions and a writing like a classic strip. Avoid these cheapo at any cost.
