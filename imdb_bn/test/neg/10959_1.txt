I saw this movie a few months ago when it was first shown on the blockbuster shelf. It's officially the only film I want to undo. I'm not saying that I like the movie "B". I consider "Ice Pirates" one of the best comedy sometimes. I'm not the author that I saw the director / author of this movie. Acting Appraisal: If I choose a brighter space then I would like to indicate that Diane Day had a pretty acting debut with his role. For those who do not know, Deene is a boxer or an actor, so we'll forgive him the order of his crippled death. He shot what he did not? Budget? I'll be proud to lead the boasting lead, Rin Baskin so the bad acting will take on the highlighted pages. Rin (seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it seems to be great), this film has the most time to face, because perhaps he was a producer. His appearance is perfectly fine, but his delivery of soap operas releases memories of SNL phishing. I think she can do a lot with what she wrote for, but the part of the fault is her. <br /> <br /> Special effects: Not my specialty, but for a low budget spark, I think makeup and gun games were acceptable. It did not bother me, but it was also not affected. <br /> <br /> The Oscar is not something that I can never win in Gerald Knott for the best screenplay. Not only is the plot initial, but dialogue is flat and stilted. I understand stylized hokee-ness, but this was just bad writing. The thing that bothered me most was theft. Knot stole the scenes, shots, and Viggo's mouth hair from other movies. The whole sequence of the scenes of Russell Crowe walking through the wheat field in Gladiator, The Good, The Bad and the Evening, is not just spending such things with me. I do not like to comment on shooting because I do not know what it takes for a good shot etc ... Conclusion: Hire this movie, even pirate, it does not. It's too bad to waste any time. Better reviews may be completely bogus, after meeting Gerry probably think he is likely to be posted himself.
