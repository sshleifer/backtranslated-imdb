This movie was terrible. If it has never been created, then the world will be a good place. Come on, a flying wagon? What did they think? It was a sub-par with a terrible hook and I did not have the time to spend this dog festival for that, I'd like a written apology from this studio with some cookies. If you pay to watch this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV on Sunday afternoon when I had no good work and it was mostly destroyed throughout my week. A flying freaking wagon?!? And that should be made for having an awesome mother who is more careful about screwed up her own than her own children? No wonder there is not enough money to tell anyone that someone can kill them, their mother does not learn anything from them, but whatever she wants comes to the other person. Absolutely horrible
