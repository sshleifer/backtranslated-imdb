It seems that the script has been "borrowed" from a certain other movie involved in using an automated canned drilling machine (Ahmed Ahme, cough cough). View by scene, two movies were almost identical. These serial numbers have been filed fairly enough to prevent the copyright infringement case. But other than that, I have to say that I found it to be a little entertaining because I have deeply enjoyed the underground genre of the movie. As far as science goes away, it is a little bit stupid, but if someone is willing to tear his eyes, it is difficult and it is believed that the scientific gaffe here and there and above all, this film is almost conveyible. Better than "supernova", which was a major role in the life of Lou Perry which was another statue so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save it. A note from filmmakers: Approach a person who knows something related to the movie. This can be a very small part of the movie budget, but it will have a big impact in helping your listeners to avoid paying tribute to fool science. <br /> <br /> Production value: approx. passable. I saw so much bad in my time. <br /> <br /> A new idea for the movies of disaster: Instead, they are always happy to be happy where the world is rescued again, again some, where there are some bits more realistic, sometimes even very good efforts still end the failure. Especially when it is necessary to solve the problem, it happened because of the first intelligence. With silly, heartfelt endings, stupid-fatal disaster movies justify stupidity by uttering silly, "It can be fixed even if a problem is not terrible because of the absurdity of the universe." Which is certainly not clear. With a unhappy ending, a self-produced disaster film will serve as a good example of "not to be so stupid in the first place". Will you watch this movie? If you are bored and have seen everything else in the CC section of your local video rental, why not make sure But to avoid "supernova" I can assure you that you are not indifferent. That was definitely not one of Parry's best movies of the Look. It's rather good. It's not saying too much, but it's good. <br /> <br /> A dead body for a deep underground movie. A dead poke to be brutally leaked from another particular film painting of the same genre.
