All right, I have given these three three! <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie seriously and yes it takes it as a valid B-horror movie, it will get a star. But I believe this is visible within the first minute of the movie, which we are dealing with is a shit. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie and it was able to shut it down. Keep some more "Hollywood" but instead we decided to completely snatch this whole movie apart from the start. I became so much cheerful, if I used to see a comedy. <br /> <br /> The actress is terrible .... The impact and the death sequence are so bad .... The story is full of pain ... <br /> <br /> But they are really trying to create a serious horror movie. The most memorable part for me is that when two letters are walking, an inferred "dark basement" which is clearly illuminated, and they will not be able to jump in the hanging bone from the roof. Horrible is just terrible ..... <br /> <br /> So If you want to laugh about how painful the movie is, it was created in 2004, rather than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait, why are you writing so much? No one knows about this movie ... I suspect anyone will read this hahaha.
