Yes it is your typical video action flick directly. And of course they tried their best to change it a bit but miraculously failed. Snipes offers its completely bland performance that he always makes Kaloka proves that you need a talent for acting in a film but sexual appeal is not needed. The worst part is that it did not add to my bad movie basics: 1 ?? Cheap looking villains. 2 ?? Absolutely timer one liners 3 ?? Chase with severe explosion in the intense car. 4 ?? Hooking up with hot hot chick. 5 ?? Multitudes of naked or gently clad women for no reason. All right, so I lied, it covers them but it's very awesome.
