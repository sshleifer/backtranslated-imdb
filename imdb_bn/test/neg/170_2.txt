There were many classic movies where leading people became liars and they still look good. I'm not buying into that element. "Scrabble Comedy" was completed and there were many of Fred Asty films. <br /> <br /> Here Barbara Stanwick plays the famous "Country" journalist who has lied to the public for many years. , And think he has kept lying in his personality (and his work). He is also lying to a person about marrying, another thing that is always trivial in classic movies. <br /> <br /> She is a New York City woman who is a great dog and someone who knows how to handle a child, etc. Obviously he does not know anything and lies so fast that you lose track. I think it is considered to be fun because the lessons are finally learned and the real love, etc. etc. Please pass the bar bag. <br /> <br /> This picture is not quite funny. The Stanwick film was very good with the continuation of the film Nir. As Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again.
