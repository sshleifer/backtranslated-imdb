This image follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to grow it, but often spontaneously works in the blast. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for the usual Woody Allen Wonderful Conversation, Stories and Humor, but failed to provide any "sweet and down load". The main character, Emmett Ray, is a psychologist, rude, unlawful and harmful person. He is so impossible, I'm not about him now, or do not want to take care of him. I wonder why to make a picture about him. The pace of the story is slow, it creates a terrible boro. Even Shan Pen's wonderful acting failed even to revive the movie at a clock level. <br /> <br /> I love Woody Allen's movies, but "sweet and down load" is a big disappointment.
