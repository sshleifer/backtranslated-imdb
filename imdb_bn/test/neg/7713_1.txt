I'm angry! I spent some time watching the zombie movie for the last time, so I was really looking forward to watching a good ol 'gory zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A reasonable story but horror, filming, dialogue, and boring clich√©s and punch lines. I did not even see the first one that looks worse than this ... now I want to know how bad it is! Images are wrong and gangster full. DNA analysis using blood samples in the world! Why are these "Special Forces" who fight "hell and pursue" like 6-year-old girls? We see that the violent zombies bite at any opportunity, hundreds of them wave their arm towards their two "heroes", throw them on the ground, still leave them without scratch. I could go to this topic but life was too short and I've already lost a few hours watching this sad movie which is an insult to the film industry.
