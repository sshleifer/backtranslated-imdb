This movie is not a horror movie. There is nothing terrible about it. It's a torture flick more. And it does not give me ideas, there are some scenes with invisible companies. She is the woman at the beginning of the film. That Nicole and he get pulled back away for a scene in the restroom and he is completely invisible. Then he killed the police officer out of his sorrow to kill him and he would disappear, plus wanted to kill him twice to kill him. So I do not think, especially when you are half his head and do not kill him? In the end, he burned the murderer's truck in the fire. But that's not it. She is standing behind her. Then it was completely rebuilt for rest, and some people are in resting areas and a new girl has no idea in this film, like the first girl to ask for help and come to Nicole. Save yourself some money and avoid this movie.
