I like the original, I watch it every year. But the second was not a piece of garbage and it should be made. Had a different position if second could do the job. The son is not an original or even eddie kids do not act like one. The third was very smart for Adee, which dipped his father's role. Where it is none other kids. It just might be a lot better. I do not know why they tried to make this movie. There was no revolution from the first movie. I would assume that this one does not even exist. It is tragic that actors do not even see they make fools. A really bad movie. I think I've lost an hour or more in bad movies and I really love all of the National Lampon movies.
