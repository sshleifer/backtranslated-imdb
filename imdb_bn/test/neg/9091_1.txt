I was rather frustrated. The first TITSU also made me the first 5-minute instant Sukamoto fan of the film. It's fresh, innovative, and just ..... different. I rather enjoy having a movie in your mouth and push all of those "button to make you squirm". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, it could possibly be an inconsistency. If you think the first movie's visoral "Hype-Kantik", then leave it one, since all have been removed. Tetsuo II For some weird reasons, just flush an ideal Hollywood style action. I was rather confused. However, in my opinion it is still appropriate for a mortal Sukamoto fan.
