I think this movie was not very good. Basically, they take a bunch of one-liners from various Sherylim Temple movies, throw them together, and act like the Shirley Temple or perform the screen. "Oh my good!" It was said several times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you can recognize some lines directly from his movie. The problem is they are saying this in Sheryli's daily life. Ultimately, what we find is that the Shirley Temple movie, which was built again instead of the real life of Shirley Temple, It is a lot better than trying to save Sheryli Temple's film and protect yourself, trying to see Aur and restoring Charlie's acting style.
