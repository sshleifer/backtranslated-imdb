In the summer of 1989, when I met my grandfather couple, I thought of this terrible movie at the Camelot Music Store. It was a time when I discovered movies like re-animators, Bendon, The Return of the Living Dead and Dead of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genre .... or so I thought! I was only 12 years old so I do not really feel good about it. I think there is a psycho who is running a murder with a curious person, and some policemen (think) that the car was roaming in a car that was not really moving, but standing side by side looking like it was ... true cinema. I think this is a bad movie that I have never seen and I hurriedly thrown in the trash. <br /> <br /> I had to think about that movie (I can not believe that I remember the name actually), so I jumped on imdb to see if I was listed. I was surprised! And a whole other 5 people watched it .... Amazing. Although I thought that when I deliberately wanted to hate this movie, I hid it somewhere because I wanted to laugh and test it again (it would probably make a good drinking game). However, I'm happy that I saw this little "treasure" in a few parts of the elite. I would prefer to pick it somewhere for some sort .... but be careful, it is not a recommendation ... it's awful ... it's just for nostalgia.
