Bad script? Check out. Dangerous effect? Check out. Awesome actor? Check out. LAMA direction? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After watching the DVD box on blockbuster video and becoming a fanatic, I put my $ 4.28 line and rented this "film". My girlfriend was out of town and I disappeared on Tuesday night. I decided that it would be a perfect time for me, which would be displayed (based on box cover art) a horror movie. Instead I had the worst movie ever made. To the point that I have always declared the worst movie declared "Slumberton Party Genocide 3". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that you have heard about how bad it has been, it's for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 unchanging minutes of your life then clear this trash. <br /> <br /> Note: I saw "Actors" here a few have come and posted a comment on the bulletin board. How can you make me proud about this film? You all were awesome I mean really bad. For the actors was American Idol, you will be disappointed at the first few episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Sutter Coins
