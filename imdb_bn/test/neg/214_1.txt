This movie is very bad that it has forced me to create an account with IMDB, just to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I have been using IMDB for a long time, and many movies are coming to me both praise or their bash registration, but nobody has ever been able to do that. until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a huge Matt Dillon fan. I can ask myself across this movie "How would Dylan like this script"? Really I mean there's a hole in it bigger than VERFORT. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a movie of modern day, not a set in seventeen years. Crying aloud, even a child knows that there is a GPS tracking and sorting of armored trucks. It makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go for ages, but I will not. I believe when I say this. Save yourself time and give it a skip. <br /> <br /> Sorry mother, I'm still a fan, but she started licking this movie.
