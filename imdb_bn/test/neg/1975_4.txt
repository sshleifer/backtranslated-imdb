This show continued for most of the 1980s and its moments, but the plots were usually thin water and often pangs of laziness. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were spoiled in this sitcom, both of them were good, but it gave some delightful memories and I found my smile in some repetitive scenes. The comedy of June allows Whitfield's talent to stir on the occasion (when he does not fret the terry) and he is really cute. <br /> <br /> In the last decade of the 1980's, you will find such kind of middle-class, medieval comedy, and many people remember it as a memorable one, but I like to remember the decade of the satirical mockery of an alternative comedy and spitting image.
