This is a sleazy film one hack. Like many "women in the chain" film, this one is full chock of homosexuality. However, compared to most of the previous films, it is strongly understood that black mama, white mama shows intense skin due to the fertility of a horny female prison as a pregnant woman and as well as sexual intercourse with one of the prisoners. In the early 1970's, it must be a soft-core pornographic film - girls should wear girls' clothes! This is also a bad rip off of the defendants, even though in this case it is hateful to two hot women who run away when they hate each other. Although the original movie is considered a classic, it can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. As there is no benefit here and the movie is simply cheap - cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Greyer is a "black girl of Katrina" - a woman who was set up and sent to jail on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, they can not stand up to one another and can not keep the opposite. However, since it is clean-driven, there is no real surprise to the end of the film - both of them are becoming friends.
