This is probably the worst movie I ever seen. Can anyone explain me the plot of this movie? Yes, I know that the bus has gone out of the gas in the middle of the desert, the driver never noticed that his compass is not working, but what then? And how did it end? Maybe I was stupid to understand this movie, but to me it was a complete time wasted <br /> <br /> Recommend me? Do not be disturbed, many good movies will be seen. This movie is always my low-down (going downstream) - Adam Sandler and Amazon Fire - Sandra Bullock)
