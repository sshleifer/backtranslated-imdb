Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter do not care to see some of the modeling of Honey selling something. Strange location, excessive makeup and very skin is not necessary. The gender is not always sold when you are selling women. The horse goes the same for walking stomping the runway that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they need to show that there is. My daughter is a 36 "insect, tall and narrow and shaped 5, I mean a size greater than 12. We both want to see-- a size 2 after this when some of me will see how I can not see the picture, it fit me the same way I will not be interested in this, because I can not buy magazines anymore, we really love to consider women all sizes.
