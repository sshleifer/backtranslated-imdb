Someone called the film "Fable-Hur", and I think it fits very well. That is the least idea. Teens, each with their own vice, caught a twisted sideshow membrane eyes. She decides to teach by teaching a lesson in the Teens of Teens. A cool idea, but good execution has been executed. The fate of some teenagers is very clearly spread in your face, other letters may become more faded. Also, the end was a serious down. No resolution or big wrapping or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low-budget horror film, it's pretty fun to see. If you're in Chess spookfests, you should have a smile watching this one. I think one of its flaws ... even though it takes very seriously. It's a stupid movie, and when it came, it was a little self-conscious, I think it has been good. But there are at least enough perfect Carnival themes and B-Movie giant makeup to keep watching you.
