I saw this man for a hot guy - even he sucked! He was the worst - OK, all right, I had to give that scary police officer to the rapist, he was even worse. The man was not that beautiful at the end, it was the most horrible accent, and Hicksville had the most definite definition of fools that his mother could not stand that he had "love" any other way. Overall, and if it gives you any idea, when I think of myself for choosing movies in the video store, I've read behind a movie that looks like, "Well, at least it can not be done to be worse than Carolina's moon." The most terrible Movies, and the most horrifying writing, acting, plot - everything in it wants to flip my Gaga responses. This was the most horrific movie I could ever see, Gabriela was also there. I hated it and I believed, if there was a number rating for 1 under IMDB, then I liked it in heartbeat.
