It's embarrassing that it took 3 minutes for my work to stop in the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really curious with the half-naked photograph of 'Star'. <br /> <br /> I think this film looks at the fate of film school in New York and the fate of Sir Daddy - the biological leadership of this astronomy - can do it for you and for you and what you have here. And as well as a photohopped photo of lead "actor" with another body, which still does not appear in the picture. It has been a great deal of money because it is quite strange, it has at least budget money buckets, but from the beginning, when it laughs all the extra terror scenes, it is not good if it is done, but it may have some common ground. For 2 cents! In short, I was moving away from the scenes and quickly thought that I was really careful about the box. Kinky, why do not I just rent a porn or something? But the bad bad acting that I guess and played bad is just that bad. Robert Englund is quite unfortunate in this along with everyone else. It makes you appreciate that the video is not so much more so direct to horror. . . Most blah which I did not quite bother. I saw the tears, Oh hellkrager 3, if I want to see 8 packs! I'll imagine that horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store have to be their original tenants and they must start a class action suit!
