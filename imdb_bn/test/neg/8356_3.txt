I have a question for the author and producer of "Predictive Nationation": What is the main reason and what is the solution to the wide range of personal depression in America? In the ongoing performance of Christina Rickshaw, like Lease Warzell, the film depicts Harvard's student and author of an infinite potential young woman as a writer. But not the story of this success, we only see one of the self-destruct, when we see Lease grieving in the life of everyone. The film examines divorce, family difficulties, medicines, alcohol and prescription medications as a possible reason for lease disorders. But none of those surface definitions is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At any time of the film, LeJ was helpful in advising on the liability of his life and his problems. "The Depression in the United States", there was no light spread in the movie about any problem. In the story, a caretaker of Lease (Anne Heac), a caring roommate (Michelle Williams), a caring lover (Jason Biggoss), and a troubled but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In an important scene in the film, Lease Space Shuttle is lying in the hospital bed after the challenge of the challenger. Instead of equalizing the challenger on the life of the lease, the image should be used as an elementary point for its healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of "Hunting" film to make me generic. Lifetime Network. Especially a fantastic throw of Christina Rixie's hearty performance was lost. In real life Elizabeth Wurtzel probably found herself wealth with her depression and becoming a successful writer. It is unfortunate that the film could not even give even the least attention to our brave souls.
