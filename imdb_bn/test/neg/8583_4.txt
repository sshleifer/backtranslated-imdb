For a horror photo, this is criminally dull. Some memorable, damn bits can not compensate for a really poor script. Very little harmony is achieved, and the film is continuously demonstrating its basic concept (a killer cat) until it is repeated - and things get worse by continuous use of the shots from the perspective of the cat.
