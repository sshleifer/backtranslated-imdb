Yawn, that's my reaction to this film. I really hope this was a good modern day slash, but it does not fall into Slashar's section. Instead, it tries to be something that is not emotional, and it becomes so weak. Even the "Freq" title also suggests that it might be interesting. Match it with the cover art in DVD and you think "OK, maybe I will try it". Time is not worth <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And perhaps because of a scene, he was frustrated to see that we actually crushed him without any reason. After all this, he decided he was enough and smashes his face with a rock (I believe). The present day, he is now being transferred to the insane asylum and. On his way he escaped from the van and fled. Also the role of 2 Lead Characters, a small girl and her big sister. They are moving and hit the road. So most of the movies revolve around them in the car. But, the bound "Freak" has now become loose and suddenly the threat of deadly murder! (I'm totally satirical) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how this movie has become boring. The budget was never short on any particular effect, and I could only take less care about the dialogue. It's one of the movies where packaging is even better, but the flick itself. And compare this to Halloween? Garbage! I'm not a fan of the Halloween series (except for the third), but much more character than Halloween. At Halloween we have at least a great score and some really unclear moments. There is no music except here and here with some piano and there is nothing unclear about this movie. Maybe it would be better to have a solid score in this movie, because if the music is good, the worst movies are endorsement. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is my opinion. I had a full waist of time and money on it. However, the film has received 4/10 rating on IMDB, so the person who likes this movie has to be loved. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
