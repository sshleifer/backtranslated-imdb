Dear Mr. Sejtman, or to whom I am responsible for Mr. Svetmann, do not fulfill the exact fate of living by Rabid Oliverins; <br /> <br /> I do not know you, so can not comment on your character; All know, to give charity to you and little old ladies to help on the streets. Nevertheless, I emphasize for general love, not to mention any other playplay as long as you live. Step down from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to pay attention to injured brain protests, I have seen a movie or two in my life, and I believe that you will find my advice helpful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include the scenes of love that the teenager boys name as part of their body parts after the United States. If you have to pen such a scene, then do not give the name "New York" and "New Jersey" breasts; This makes unnecessary guesses, which is why the cities occupy nipples. Also, it is almost impossible to be stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. To strengthen the differences in the class, do not trust John Hughes in full movies. <br /> <br /> 3 Do not bludgeon the audience on the head with fatigue. Yes, yes, Kelly and Sam stand in the rain, and it clears their care. We get it. Yes, Kelly's greenery of the green soil of the ground continues to grow, though all the other plants have started to rotate. It is a symbol of their love. It is very painful if applied by a blunt-force injury from the back of our head. For God's love, Mr. Savitman, we get it. We all get it, all over the land. Amish man, hearing, unborn child - we all can get it. <br /> <br /> 4. Mime order does not require performers to perform. Ever. No, never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should be cured of the reverse symbolism? As the audience can draw parallel between Kelly and Sam's relationship without rebuilding the restaurant and without any help. Really We get it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script, and move the following lines and any similar lines: "I do not know anymore." "I do not want to lose you." "He just like the rest of them!" (And its significance, "Dad, you do not even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, he is running around a field in Heaven. We get it. <br /> <br /> 8. And other news, we get it. <br /> <br /> I saw dozens of horror movies in my life; I could never bear the pain of your art, and I left the theater, but with the hand "Drawed Love", an elephant fell out of the sky and gave me ank to my seat. <br /> <br /> While closing, your writing bites, you give me ten dollars, and I hate you.
