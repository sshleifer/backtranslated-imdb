As a rude movie go-er, I felt that when I was in my favorite movie ranking I felt it only fair to rank my most hateful movie. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing positive to say about this movie. This is actually one of the two movies I've ever left. Perfectly I went back and saw the movie to give another opportunity and I sat by it, as if I were away. The sad thing is that the movie is really quite a decent actor and crew ... but still the brightest stars in Hollywood can not make the body of a script alive. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Protect yourself from this truly tragic 'Film' 1/10
