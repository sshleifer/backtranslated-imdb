I usually liked the movie about turning older animals around people who threaten their environment or reptiles, but I'd say Snake Island had a big letdown. <br /> <br /> A fanatic, a group, with a group, accompanied by William Catt, went to an island named Duh, and you estimate it "snake island" and quote how the island's name lives. I will give this movie only, all snakes and snakes are snakes, lots and many snakes. So the film part is fairly dependent on its name, but writing, acting and direction is the Sukapu Lum, it is almost painful. <br /> <br /> The letter is so unlikely that I want to ask that the snake stop our suffering from bringing us out of our misery. There are some scenes that are considered to be very ridiculous and ridiculous - with swimsuiting to truly awesome disco music, two women meet together in dancing and there is a visible scene with a scene with a scene with a snake. It's stupid. I think the authors are trying to be funny but this has just stopped like some strange LSD trips ... <br /> <br /> I think William Cass went back years ago when he played "Keri", how much did he <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
