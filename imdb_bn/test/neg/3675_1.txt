There seems to be some possibility to see the story line of this movie. The acting was flat and the lack of depth of stories. There was a lot of reliance on the camera work, which had some high points. I will agree with other negative comments. I only wish to read them before buying the DVD. The film may be worth watching for free and you are bored of tears before hand. Why can many more plots develop homeless in the homeless in Moscow (ie Soviet-capitalism, the use of massive drug use (i.e. the increase in heroin trafficking in Afghanistan), why the USSR, the archaeologists or even more in the fight against Nililijam.
