At the moment Mickey Roberts is enjoying a revival ... and a game that is suitable for him. I always liked the ability to act like her pictures and hire like Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know you're going to get Rourke - money, moody, dirty. But this image gives you a lot more - and you do not want much at it. <br /> <br /> First and foremost - this whole thing is not just meaningless. A hard-working IRA assassin in Rourke, who escaped to London in London after a bus load of schoolgirls was killed. He runs from the comrades of police and his own army. He also sworn to kill again. It seems, the kids did the bus for the bus. However, when he went to London he was tracked by a local mobster (Bates - showing his eyebrows and hair straight away Burton's dummy) for 50,000 pounds and to kill his main rival for boat trips in the United States. Rau willingly agrees to do so but is seen by the priest (Hossein) and admits confession of confession to keep the priest face closed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, as illustrated by a scene through which an employee was pinned with a heavy heavy heavy wall like laziness - this is London It is difficult for the boys to kill themselves. 2. Not only that, Mober Rooke has received the witness to follow and kill with his own eyes. Why did not he just kill the rival and did not save all the hassle to face Raukake? 3. Look at Hoskins murder case and police release him - out of security, I can add - to accept? No way. 4. Crime is committed after accepting the crime, hanging around the church in the church (the crime where he killed the next). Why is not police checked out? 5. Hanging around the church in the rouge, and especially the blind nephew of Hoskins, did not bother him some days later. What? Does he run and leave it where he killed another? Stupid 6. Police actually meet Rouke of "fixing" church and he has no idea. Do not they know that he is running a school bus bomb attack? Do they not test him? Why do you have to kill Raukek, and then wait for a few days to go to the boat? You would think you want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why did Bates brothers suddenly decide to rape blind brother? He could not save himself for a few days? Until at least Rouke is not closed to the United States safely? Ridiculous 9. Raukake's sudden death on dark ghosts and his internal instability after the victory - even he knows that he is still a killer, but he still loves her? Again - completely ridiculous. And in addition - he read "love" with him during the record - a few days !!!! 10. The last bomb thing is more general than the point of view of Bits Point. 11. In some parts of this movie there are incidents that are not just intellectual or there is only to help in the story (and I just say). While riding the house in the boat, Route is ready to enter the room until Rauer shows moral highlands to respect the house's harlot - but still the blind girl will bed. 12. A heinchman is asked to route the boat to Bethes' boats - and Henchen uses the full movement of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the man said much more than telling Rouke. 13. The priest of Hoskin is a former army man and we saw him kill three henchains behind a pub. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, sometimes not very bad but can be heard at other times), its clothes, walks, shows in the sky etc. No, I'll mention music and sticky editing styles. <br /> <br /> Oops ps - I <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10.
