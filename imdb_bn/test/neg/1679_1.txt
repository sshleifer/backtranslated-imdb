I still can not see the first entry in this series, fortunately, I was able to follow the still complex and complex plot, with all its unexpected turn and rolling, and I appreciate them for the full range of ideas here. If there is any confusion, I am sure that whatever I have decided is pure, carefully written in a nicely decorated condition, as soon as it becomes like a membrane, when it grows rapidly and grows, then I have no doubt. It is unclear that a clear sign is conducted by a visual effect maker, in which the field is only another credit card Henry Rumer which is not well taken. Acting is always the best, and I deny that no one can find ... the Russian accent of Scottish computer-woman (come, serious, what's with that last name?) Is ridiculous and / or annoying. There is an attempt or two of style in this, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing fine. The music is quite calm. Even if the language is even that Violence is fairly bloody. I only recommend this to fans of B-movies, and I would say that you can do worse than that. 1/10
