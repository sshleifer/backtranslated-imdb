An annoying, terrible piece of Italian euro-trash, a scientist who spent most of his time gazing beer (this makes him American, right?) Our scientists have spent most of their academic lives wiped out of their mind. Comes from all really great theories), who is reading something (dolphin call, fish migration patterns, who knows). He heard that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica, listening to a strange sound through his headphones. At the same time, Jack Skillington girl, with 80 bad hairstyles, met with the worst, most bloody men, who were delighted in my interview, apparently trying to calm the dolphins in Savarwariyah, she was bothered about the quantity of doling fish in recent times. At the beginning of this movie there was a really bad colorful story about two boring, many Italian people were invisible under water in the boat.
