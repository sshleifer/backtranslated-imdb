I have seen tons of trash in every language, about each and every trend of filmmaking. Each time, every director and any type of budget is available. That's what I have really announced: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I have ever seen <br /> <br /> It's painfully bad. This is great. It's deadly. It's unconscious. It's annoying. It's a really bad mess. This is a piece-know-key about you <br /> <br /> And, what's more important: it lacks a point. And even if it was, even letters are so irrational and annoying that it is impossible to ignore the lack of integrity of the entire contents. <br /> <br /> It's weird to be weird. <br /> <br /> <br /> I was sick of seeing this trash. When I saw it (the Lincoln Center in New York) was started. Finally the audience went half. Eventually there was a question-answer program but no one lived. Everybody ran at the door, except for the exception of almost two sick ones. <br /> <br /> Save your life for two hours. This is probably the worst job. <br /> <br /> If you have a movie movie theater in Helal, this movie will be 24/7 forever!
