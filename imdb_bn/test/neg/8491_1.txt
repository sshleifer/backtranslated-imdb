Eleven years ago, Stanley Ephepes expressed his true inner spirit and people became the hero of the City City by inventing and wearing the masks of the masks. Masks have reached the popular position of Jim Carrick to bring the comedy forward and its originality and only pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. PATR Why? I'm fine! Now, after eleven years, I think that the new film "Sona of Mask" has been applied to the same philosophy. Nobody asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he responded, "I am the root!" Unfortunately, that answer does not cover it because I was still thinking about the son of a mask, "O Lord, why?" Other people involved in Guitman and Blasheme's films understand that why you are making this movie is not easy to answer the debate about whether or not the party is a party. <br /> <br /> The son of the mask Otis finds the dog a notorious mask and starts bringing back his owner Tim Avery, which is a clear tribute to the legendary Lonnie Tunes creator Tex Everi. The team acting by Jamie Kennedy, a struggling animation who is stuck to working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company, is a shelter for a one-day draw. On the night of the Halloween party company, the team keeps a mask and turns into a wicked, insane character that we all hope for. After leaving the party team home, the mask still conceives a child with his wife and Mahmme has great cartoon power after ninth month after the mask was born. The dog oats, jealousy for the baby's attention, Tom and Jerry's type keeps the child's masks and parts in maya. Meanwhile, Lone, starring Allan Cumming, found her mask on the direction of her father Odin. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I admitted that I respect the fact that the film is so respected. In classic cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Lonnie Tones, his will. Quoit type contraposition and infamous dance frog type plots. However, this respect can not save the film and it is less respectful and more waste time. <br /> <br /> The film's consistency became increasingly stupid. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, silliness just gets the usual annoying point. Characters are not fun to watch and what's worse, they're not funny. Flexibility of the characters can also be used as more CGI. Basically one of the most important things is that, certainly computer animation was used, so much depends on Jim Carey and his superb style. Jim Carey, we were sure, there was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy has no such ability, when you wear her mask and her facial features rarely move, then it is clear. Children and dogs are mostly animated which became increasingly confusing throughout the movie. The story next to Lokey's search for the face has become even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The mask boy is sad sad. I suggest that you go to rent or buy the mask, and thank the Nors Goddess, or anyone, bring it to us. And I will consider the sign of my self-denial as I have asked for infamous questions "Why?" The mask boy gets a star, though that star should be shared between Lonne Toons and Jim Carrier's classic makers, who will always be in my book's mask.
