I watched this movie during the Berlin Film Festival last week and had moderate high expectations. - Director Bertrand Tavieri and I was familiar with some of his earlier works in French cinema. I actually enjoyed some of his previous movies. - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steinberg ... I was looking forward to seeing all these talents on the screen. - I was not aware of the book based on it, and I did not read anything about the movie before but I was told that it was a set film in Deep South (we saw many of the past), probably it would be better to be like this ...) br /> <br /> After 2 hours, the last headlines will be shown: thanks god on it !!!! - Out of the understanding of plot If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were many minor characters and there were plenty of free plot arcs. We did not understand a thing! - It's my God! Tommy Lee Jones's pronunciation is good but I still have nightmares for singing Mary Steinberg's Kajun-French song ... - In my opinion, poor casting. I can not believe the old guy Tommy Lee Jones can come out of Linebaker's built-in quality ... and I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who are these people? We all understand what these characters are and what they do. Have a rattan shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a daughter from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - Comedic efforts were suppressed. The most interesting thing about the film was probably its "Action" and "Suspense" scenes. They were awesome. No thrills. Bad acting (Tommy Lee Jones can make different faces or he's like Derek Junker?) ... - And then there's science-related stuff. No spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoying kinky. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write any comment on IMDB but I thought the movie is so bad and frustrating that I feel obliged to share my opinions. But it's just me ...
