This film was very convincing and had a very narrow setting, I could not really say that acting and dialogue can be the product of kindergarten writing only. If you like Kathy Ireland, you might want to see it. This film was probably created as a vehicle to try to get him into Hollywood, but if it was a target, I would have to say that I hope he will not invest a lot of money in his production.
