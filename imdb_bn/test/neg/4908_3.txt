[Warnings have spoilers] <br /> <br /> I do not feel any sympathy for any characters, with the main person, who is the friend of his daughter, V. Even after Wiquley's death (but he's shakes with her, she works with a former prostitute from the casino). The main character appears as this wonderful intelligent writer, who gets painted in a web of cheating, all the time he is running his monologue in the writing book. I can not say that I would buy the book, maybe a good voice if there was 52 different personalities to represent every card of Dark, but a frustrated voice-over (which tells you annoying a movie that you do not understand through your book), but I'm frustrated. Finally there was a mobile phone, through which the main character set up someone close to him, but at this point I do not like his character so much (I think it's impossible to choose anyone in this movie, the characters are one dimensional zombies) I really do not care that, and the film The last was a delight. <br /> <br /> Plus point: English actress from ER is a South African accent doing a dodgy actress Minus Point: An Irritating Film
