It is said that there are some people who are actually the admirers of Monigram films. Well - why not? Monogram studios lived a kind of cost plus basis; The cost, plus payouts and enough to buy a pizza and a bottle robust muscatel every time enough. Of course, they are cheap. But let's face it: They are fat, fast, Philistine, lazy, but joyful. They have no perspective. They are designed to eliminate an hour or so an audience at the bottom of a double bill. So if John Wayne goes through the wild west on the street with a lined road? It's not art, it's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Flight to Mars." In the beginning, when we meet the first letters, a person can suddenly introduce his classmate, who can avoid any tedious benefits: "Professor, this is my drunk and assistant, a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. Being helpless with me because I've always been engaged in my scientific work, perhaps you can steal him from me, You can get married with a child, her children and can pikta-phyanadeda home, which he wants.

And Arthur Franz, New Jersey Perth Amboy Proud as Python Smoke Head Scientists And - for fans of science fiction - about this pair of Assis: both Maurice Ankrum and John Litel! There is really no point in detail plot details. Five crew members have caused land accidents in Mars where they live in living organisms to discover an underground civilization, whose evolution was compatible with us, on the right, five digits and little children in short scratches. And they picked English from listening to our broadcast. American broadcasting, that is, is judged from their speech. They tried to hijack space ships who led a terrible cabal, make it a lot of imitation, and colony colonies. They are not successful. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. Some extra sets of men roam around, with their black-colored dresses, stylized playing bottles are extinct in their chest and red caps. Their names include English phonas - Alzar, Teris, Ikron. Lysomm Martian, who falls for Arthur Franz, is called Alita with Indo-European tiny supplement and he already knows how to kiss. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that, but very dust. The story is Rogers of any Rock 1930's series. Once the world and the Martians meet and it is established that they have a common language, and that Martians have a sinful agenda, it is. Even within two hours, even the overwhelming screenplay in World War II could make it a story of Nazi spies.
