What a bloody laugh! You can not get things like TV budgets and some SmartSaver which can not distinguish between LAN I, II and III. All lazy clich√©s are well in place; The story and the human level story is so surprising and incredible that it hurts. And who is responsible for carrying them away with joy for their brilliant ratings. Tech details: garbage. Flying off that lancs will kicked each other from the sky. Line astern attack alone enined night fighters: ridiculous. As I said: The director I bet I had never heard of Lancaster before the project, and some kids who made the lankake waddling duck. But these minor things are more than the overall mediation of this film. Although it may be very harsh, I say that the death of both of these parties hurts the death. TV strap, ignorant people who do not care to entertain anyway. Those who are responsible for Sham Use your brain the next time. And you enjoy the gains from it.
