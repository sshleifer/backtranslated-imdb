Okay, here's the deal. I like action films and generally do not have a problem to suspend huge contracts of disbelief on plots or other disrespectful acts. However, this movie has exceeded minor flaws and has become ridiculous directly. Let me give this straight up. The police sent two bad guards and two buses on a bus with a notorious gangster and crane killer (with several prisoners). Then they were compelled to stop two police working at a specific place, one of which was a retirement day and the other was a burn. Apparently the building was nearly getting close, so the police decided that the whole year was closed on the eve of the New Year all night. Right But wait, it gets better Gabriel Byron shows him and other dirty police to get Fisherberg out before giving rats. (Although we could not find anything about their relationship or transaction). Interestingly, the police are slat gear in the night to attack the street, night goggles, assault rifles and the whole nine yards. After that they could even bring a helicopter with more people to the whole gear. I'm not a policeman, but I'm sure you can not find Waltz from the station with full station platoon tool without asking what you are doing. And the police helicopter ??? The supposed terrible winter storm ??? Also, no one can hear or see this big block running near the fire with a flash grenade and heavy rifle fire? I take it seriously, come on. I know it's set in Detroit, but it will also raise doubts about a supposed top secret mission. I love the fact that they find Tommy Gone in the proof room and how the gun still works and still bullets that are still intact and usable It's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The other is not tedious. For one, the movie's opening couple is shot in very beautiful and hydeactive ways within a few minutes, and I think the voice for the rest of the film is set. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of pensing or tension or drama left. The "letters" are probably not related to each other, which is basically because they are not particularly attractive. This is not a very interesting step to create a good action film and it does not have enough character development / story details to create a playful thriller. Hawk / Fishburn is the director of "Relations", trying to make the director even attractive or intense. Hello and the way, the desert scene? Oh, I thought it was in the middle of a driving industry in Detroit, and suddenly we were in the jungle? Actor is not terrible in this movie, it is only shocking to instruct and write. I really enjoy some other films from Hawks, Fishbarn, Bayern, Denhee but it's a terrible one.
