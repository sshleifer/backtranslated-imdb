It's a long time ago I saw this movie and still it's the worst one I've seen. I like many types of movies; Science, action, drama, thriller and sometimes even horror. Do not have two adjustments. It may be a wonderful movie, but they all blow it up. I do not want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on watching it. I did not have such a shit as it was. I liked the first part, Clooney and Tarantino going through Texas, killing them all along the way (especially the shooting of the wine shooting was wonderful), but at its bending point, everything changed to the tie twister bar. The stupid vampires take the place and what could be a perfect gangster movie is the nightmare on Elmastet's stupid movie. If you want horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloody thrillers, do not see it, you'll be very disappointed at the end.
