Watchable 'Comedy' rejection that runs very flawy but just like a watchrelly brother. It's the most criminal thing about welding though. In the role of superstars, Jerry and Connel and Jack Busse believe in one minute I could not believe, who can not drag a woman in a hat drops and I can not believe (very nice) Shannon Elizabeth as a solid police side on the road! Although the story is predictable, a ticker is managed to raise on some occasions, though 'fairly out', which is 'Shock Comic' scenery (a discrete laboratory and a set of a sperm bank), is simply general, awful and terrifying. If this movie is on TV then perhaps it is probably valuable if you are indifferent, but please do not waste your money by hiring it !!
