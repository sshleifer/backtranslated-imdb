I was watching this movie and becoming somewhat bored with a brutal plot going somewhere, when suddenly, the story took a real look for the worse and an actor played himself. Oh how i gossip Because it's so funny, is not it? We know Julia Roberts is playing the role of Tess, and here they are somewhat funny shy like Tuss's character in the film Julia Roberts. So Julia Jelia disguised someone to play. How well he does it, we will never know, because 99.999% of the audience do not personally know Julia Roberts personally (and do not count on reading about him in Hello Magazine). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis! Apparently, he is Julia Roberts's best friend. Well, he's in the film ... How do I know that Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I am not at least bit interested in actors' personal life - I only pay my money and hope they do their job for the work they give. However, they started a joke about plot twists in the movie where Willis (rather, unknowingly) plays a psychiatrist ... with a little baby ... you know? I did not, I forgot what it was called. How well Willis has commented on how well he played at the box office - how you are submissive Mr. Willis! The problem is that these scenes are not simply vain and terribly terrible self-gratifying, it reminds our audience that we are only seeing a bunch of actors and paying a huge amount of money for very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend my suspicions and forget that I'm watching the actor - I want to believe in the story I see. When you start dragging the visible scene, mid-movie, you just ruin the illusion for me. <br /> <br /> You know that threw a TV series in Hungary when it starts celebrating celebrities, playing themselves (stand up and simpsons, friends, etc. will count), but for the first time I saw a movie Jump to the shark. I am usually away from movies (eg horror movie, The Naked song, etc.). The problem is, I honestly never thought that 11 ocean movies will be in this direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story, and the last 90 minutes or more of the film was meaningless posting. Yes, all right: Steven Sodder and his actor friends stood up and looked at our audience and said, "Ha ha ... you've got all ... Thanks for your money!" Then they give us a warm warm greetings. <br /> <br /> Come back to you, okay. I did not really see this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for doing nothing. How are you their apple Now that a plot is twist.
