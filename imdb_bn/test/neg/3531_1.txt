I saw this movie at Temple University. I will never see this picture in a theater (presented in the film). Similar to the played by the Belle Bell (TV show). The plot is simple and unimaginative. Sound Recorder likes the sound of the wind and the DP requires a light meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
