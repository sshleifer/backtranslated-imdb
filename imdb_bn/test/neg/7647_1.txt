Sincerely, one of the worst written, guided and acting movies I have ever seen. Regarded like a TV movie for a made. And that's a bad one. I can not believe that people are seeing Danny Houston in this movie, or they still allow John Salais to make films. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and were very annoyed with it, when we finished it, I ended up cleaning the house. . . And it still bothered us! It reminds me that critics were so disgusted with the critics of previous films like Lone Star, who was on the road during his time, but really added a lot to the end. Spend your time on something good. Something
