Stripes, Bill Mure performing by the Army Training Shibir comedy and Ian Retman, my favorite. Metables, Bill Murray acting summer camp 'Ropp' and managed by Ian Retman, is a complete waste. It attempts to make an effort to create a film for four screenlines (this term 'comedy' Mithun unknowingly does a job with previous thoughts) as an ignorant, animate and annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Combined with - the word "it is not really important" is impressive. It does not support the auxiliaries who refuse Cast Talent - the most interesting thing about them is their hair, but then the meatballs were created in 1979. ("Chris Macpashes declared Rudy as" inaugurated in the opening. No, Chris is not Makepeace?!) <br /> <br /> Please, Reitman Stripes for two years after his wrong corrections. When he wanders about John Cannon, Warren Oats and John Lerrockt's choices, Murray's shatikatake is so much fun. Dig this and watch that.
