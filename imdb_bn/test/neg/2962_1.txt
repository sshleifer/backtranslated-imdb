The film was produced by producer Releasing Corporation (PRC) among the so-called "Poverty Fertilizer" film studios of 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how much money it has spent. <br /> <br /> Forget about music. Cast member Gerra Young displays the voice of an operatic quality, but a discount Deanna Durbin sort. The IMDB database does not show any other film exhibition, so hopefully he can go to any position in Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> Recently opening credits for Turner's broadcast printed classical movies indicate that this movie was preserved by the National Film Museum. This begs the immediate question ?? Why? <br /> <br /> What is their wealth that they can save so much junk? Some of the budgets or B musicals of the era are bringing their features back. There is no one in this picture. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, exclude this movie. It actually damages your time one hour.
