Bottom-barrel stinker is so bad it's fun. The "plot" is an American tenant, Rebe Brown (called "military adviser" in the film, but it is not really clear whether he is in the American army), while the guerrillas are joining the guerrillas while helping the country of Latin America, the government Returns him, imprisoned and tortured. Shannon Tied is a "Sports Equipment Saleswoman" which he has taken to a bar that is caught in all the plot. The description that actually makes the film sound better than it is, because it is actually a bite of the biblical proportion. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tieyd is turning to the most professional acting work of the film. This does not indicate what the 12th edition of this turkey is, if it is to be the "Z" -Good Horror Flick of the 1940s (and not to be relevant to the sound score from very good music scores)) in the same footage (i.e., the armored The carrier's carrier is moving below the same jungle path) Most of the most unauthorized stages of memory have continued to be reused in the "action" scene, this sunny one minute slugfest Basa will be. Tweed looks annoying, showing hanging on Brown, and by the time this thing is finished - you can be that long lasting; I could not - they will know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and gunfights, it can not be considered an "action" picture by any side of imagination. . It is boring (there is a scene behind a truck where everyone looks at each other for only three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebel" and "soldiers" are going over), irrational (when a group of rebels killed a government helicopter by gunfight Instead of keeping them covered in the open ground, they stood standing there standing), no When a gunman can not be heard when soldiers and rebels fall "dead", a gun battle inside the house where the fighters standing against the walls are machine-sized but the walls literally change unexpectedly) (in future, when the "governor" gives a prize for capturing Brown Since "someone" can turn him around, you're just "someone" and it's up to you Person who thought of it turns out to be correct) and only mere stupid (some pictured left). Blunt, stupid and faith stupid outside Do not waste your time.
