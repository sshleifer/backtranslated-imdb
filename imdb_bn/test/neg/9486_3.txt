This movie was just right. Two players of Merry-Kate and Ashley players (sorry for the obvious saying) are sent to Paris against their wishes so that they spend a lot of time with their rich uncle or with him. <br /> <br /> Two French boys (who looked a little inbred) started talking to them and taking interest. Blah Blah Blah. This is a Olsen Twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. As well, as well, the pair fits a suitable French model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They spend a fun montage with bffs and lights city shopping with models. Yes <br /> <br /> Plotwalla, I can not really tell what happened. I guess I could say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen Cinema" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was boring. I mean, can I really identify with two girls that they are respectful to hear about going to Paris? Really? Also, the joke was not really that fun. However, I saw the whole movie. So it will be a bit entertaining. It was set in Paris that was actually what kept me watching.
