Was this supposed to be a comedy? Black cape and skeletal mask are pleasing. There is nothing like zero plot. The movie starts with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a small reference to their excavated site. And then, look and see ... Halloween costume man drops, decorated with shiny black caps, with a skeleton mask, with an axis. So, he killed these two people. Then we cut into the wood with a bad imitation of Predator, the Halloween Costume Man is hunting only the Commandos, who now ride on the horse! More commands are seen, but these people are supposed to disguise as a hiking group. Yes, production is likely to be wearing commando clothing. Can you say, less budget? However, they come on a single old Indian guy sitting in woods. He's just very funny. And he started babbling about something, but you did not really know what he was mumbling about, so they killed some Indian flashbacks. Nobody really makes sense of it. And then we went back to our commandos where they died more. And that's really basically the plot. It's so ridiculous, you just can not see because you want to see how low it is. You could do the same movie with a bunch of your friends with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and fake gun. If you want a horror movie then do not see this thing. If you want a comedy, perhaps? Or just skip it and get something like real hunter.
