As soon as Richard Care and Diane Lane end up in a flashing romance, I'm really angry ... not only this is not my cup of tea, but my cup tea is not like the Dime Store romance. <Br / <br /> <br /> In this plot, keep a doctor in a toilet and meet a woman who has a deep but concise relationship. He goes to meet his disgusting son and he returns to his life. <br /> <br /> has played well and the filmmakers have forgotten to get the actual plot line. This dime store is the stuff of romance that makes women cruel and shake their heads in disbelief of men. I will not be so reactive as the continuous romance of the film, except that the film can move towards the final train outside the left ground, which is totally incredible. Why a certain type of movie will do such a stupid thing? It really destroyed it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, then give it a shot, though wait for the cable.
