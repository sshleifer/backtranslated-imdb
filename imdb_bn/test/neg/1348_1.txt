I was very disappointed by this movie. MS English says that he was a fan of the original movie, it took a large part of the artistic work and it was transformed into a flat-line "ho-hum", you've been producing a baby for a long time. I tried to like Meg Ryan's Mary Hines, but she was just boring. She does not seem to think anything about her husband's affair. There was no mental struggle, no deep hit The original film of 1939, Mary Hines of Soft Shi'a was betrayed, frustrated, weak, confused and angry. The 2008 production is about some fake Bonhoud theme, (actually my wife's word) and does not tear you a tear or even sneak. We just played eligible notes for Debra Messing and Bate Miller. (I wanted more than the belt.) There was no heroine in this film. There were many sub-themes in the character of Sylvia Fowler. And Crystal Allen had no fire. Reunion of department store with Anneet Benining and Miss Mendes Luc was warm. Panning was also slow as well. Evidently, the 1939 version needed to be updated, but it was not the same. The fact that the original version works so well is because the characters are dealing with "human" problems. There is a topic that does not date out. The real-film magic was that the movie was both sex workers, you never saw a man.
