After watching this movie, I do not have any disrespect for anyone involved in making this unreal film. For one, as a general comment, the story is literally incredible and filled with incredible clich√©s around. Obviously for this dialogue, which reaches the lowest common point and manages to supply a completely unpredictable main line. This performance is terrible and as well as across the whole film, there are 3 different and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed, because every prapati was easily distinguishable from its real life reflections. Overall, I will not recommend thinking about seeing this feature, because it will certainly not waste 83 (even 90!) Minutes of your life.
