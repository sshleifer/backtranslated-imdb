All that I can say really about this film It's a DBZ ... like the Tree of Mite and the World Strongest, it is not really compatible with the timeline for the show, although it must have been established before the start of the TV series. The action is pretty fantastic, nice. These guys have an excellent enough base of intrigues with each other and why hatred is the establishment of a good background. Naturally very good, there ... the problem is ... there are really many weird things. I mean, really, weird stuff. Like the most powerful in the world, this is a real, really funny song that can only be made in a drug outbreak ... It is annoying that when Gohan singing songs he makes himself very bad. Creepy Villains are weird and rather ridiculous ... Moroso than the normal DBZ type - it has been made as a dragon ball movie instead of the Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it is quite amusing, but ... just ... weird.
