I love this horror 80's summer camp movie. The best part about "party camp" is actually its plot. It simply drops a weak batch of "letters" in a position and then occasionally occur in the event. Here the cliches are unlimited (Spools): nerds vs jocks, hidden cameras in girls locker room, happening in hikers on a nudist colony, conclusions compete, hidden horny camp administrators, and annoying stereotypical covers throughout sex. The absence of the only cliche Correa Feldman attendance. This movie will let you laugh, but not deliberately. I repeat, again. A final note, in the "Astronomy" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. Share a beer late at night, spilling their hit each other The conversation does not literally make sense, and the act involved in a high school level. This is a classic.
