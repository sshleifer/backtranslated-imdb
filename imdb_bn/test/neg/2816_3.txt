When I was watching this movie, I never thought I would protect it. It's not enough of a plot to start honestly from me. There is no real character to latch onto the killer except. Acting may be some good, but it is mostly capable. <br /> <br /> I know, three of the ten are not starred, but the reviews say that it was poor and totally vain. I think it's fairly well set out to do what's supposed to do. The light is much less than most of the viewers, but it is considered as the top view, like the Camcader Snif movie. In fact, sometimes the quality may be very high, but it can not do it by tonight's camera, which is really bad. <br /> <br /> This is not particularly scary, but it's annoying at times. One or two characters that do not come across as reliable and soundtracks are sometimes tedious but overall it is cleansed in comparison to Camcoder movies.
