You know, I really hate the sensor system of IMDB, because if you exclude the curse, my complete review is almost gone. But here we go. Time editing! <br /> <br /> Holy Molly is this bad. I thought it could be a cool little movie, plotted by the summary of the plot, because I've already hired such gems as the frilly and American nightmare. But this is just boring. This is a killer who uses the actions of Adger Allen Bo as reference to his assassin's exploitation and as a reference to a detective that had to stop him. Can this heating hacks make a good movie without defiling a great horror writer's grave? I mean, killing here is completely free of thought or originality, and poe references are hockey and fake, without thinking enough about them. They are shallow, and they act shamefully to shame. With terrible sequencing, full of holes. The performance is very bad, reminds me of some of the abortions which were known as "horrible" in some third world countries, with all the annoying and non-mental lines. <br /> <br /> I understand it is an indie movie, but no excuse. I have seen better work after the death of children in high school, and I have been given enough time to get myself a better kill scene and a better plot. There is no reason for <br /> <br />. To avoid all costs.
