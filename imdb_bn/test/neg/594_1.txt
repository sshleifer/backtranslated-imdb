Do not waste your money or time. Terrible movie Bad acting, plot everywhere Really, really bad acting. Man, this movie is just plain bad. I closed off for 7 minutes. The script is bad, the direction is bad, it seems that the high school group has gathered to do a project for their class of class. Yes, it's bad. This act is certainly not trustworthy, remember I only saw it for 7 minutes. How did this movie make it to the DVD, it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have been kept in the editing room. I saw the cover and it was quite cool, I'm not sure that the hack will do the next time: _)
