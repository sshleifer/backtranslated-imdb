I made it around 8 minutes in "Steel Frontier" before turning it off. Then, I glutton for that punishment, I saw something else the next day. Today, I had to do iron pieces of cloth, so I decided to finish the film, and it was my own punishment. Here I do not understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $ 7,000 on their first feature and made two extraordinary films. Yet here we are hesitantly two directors with more money, and they have a huge, molded welding cast. Let me see if I have to argue: "It's a 'Road Warrior' but it's like the West in the future. We'll find our most exciting 'actors', write the script of our psychological disabled cousin and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do not think even MST3K guys could improve this. But if you look at it Insisted on, I recommend first to get very drunk.
