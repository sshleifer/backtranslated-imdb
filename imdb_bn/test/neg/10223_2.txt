Walt was qualitatively special. So how did the producers in Disney make such a deadly edit, played rough (even family rent!) To reveal a mess? Big Green was a good idea. And, since it's Disney, you know how the movie must be launched. But the Big Green is horrible. Jokes are hair. And still alive, Steve Gutenberg, pulls another horrific performance in his resume. <br /> <br /> Small city Elma is given the opportunity to play football in their new teacher with their kids in too much time. Even though the kids do not know a thing. And, for us, please, we try to hurt Steve Gutenberg from the beginning of the teacher. <br /> <br /> The camera does not speed up the work. The motion of the letters moved along with the big green picture is full of speed. Kids are not idiot. If you give them enough hints without displaying all their garbage they will be caught. Guttenburg, once for his life, should join an offer to join this movie. Also beautiful Olivia d'Abo should say this one very close. Biggren might be known as 'Big Bomb'.
