When this show was first publicized, there was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 70's. The first 7 or 8 years were brighter, but after that things closed. The program was no longer fun since 1990 and its downfall with today's complete deterioration continues further. <br /> <br /> How depressed this event is, it is really disrespectful. The text is poorly bad, the performance is almost bad - if the guest-host is not entertained for entertainment, this show will probably not be in the air. I think it's so hard to believe that the same creator who selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks to follow. How can one recognize such brightness and then take appropriate to replace it with this mediocrity? I think I want to pay tribute to the main performance of two big successes. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can not believe it still in the air.
