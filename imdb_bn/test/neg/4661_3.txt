Dear reader, <br /> <br /> I have seen in my study of the film that whenever Michael Bay produces a movie, people pan out and hate it, but they still see it and this is about 100 million dollars. Why? Because Michael Bay is the top five directors of all time. Michael Bay, standing alongside Reidley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, cemented himself as one of Hollywood's best action / adventure director. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only one person is capable enough to do this: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, trying to keep a summer hard driller that keeps his family together. This fact does not help her daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), has a relationship with her best driller, AJ (Ben Affleck). Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), appointed by NASA chief, Stampor and his team-power driller train to be asteroid and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part movie. First of all we are in the fun part where we meet gang and despair. Then they get replaced and all the comedy is sucked out of the window and the mind is replaced by mind-leakage special effects, cool music, and serious acting. Morphy's law becomes insane in the second part, which means that it can be wrong, it is wrong, increases the film's breathtaking levels. <br /> <br /> A cool cast and crew (as Jerry Bay producer, Jerry Brackheimer and Glue, and JJ Abrams as author), special effects, great humor, extraordinary music, and Mr. Ben-Hur also played a role, Charlton Haston, Armageddon <br /> <br /> signed, Constant DVD Collector, Matt MacLaid <br /> <br /> Parenting alert: This is not a movie for kids. F-bombs are used a few times and many other swear words are also used, plus strip bars are visible and the tiny part can be very difficult to handle a child.
