The only good part of this movie was the end. You know part of the movie where light comes and you go home. No, which might be a little hard - the dance in the movie was exciting, but unfortunately the plots ended. As long as the cast was dancing and the film did not go along as well as went away. For an anointing of tea - not too bad, but hopefully the next image will be deeper. Wait for the movie to rent or watch for the movie. I do not make the same mistake and do not pay 8.50
