I always loved Bill Murray in the movie like Lost In Translation, and the film's trailer looked really good, but it was very frustrating. Originally played by Marc Jack Karcarin, who recently found out that his father had died, and he expected to hear his wishes. He found that his father had a shoe because he kept a big shoe, his radioactive nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way Jack could get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and keep him in a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also played Pat Hingle as Vernon. Smiling like small moments, bending forward in front of a truck, and Murray screams, but overall, it is in vain. Beautiful poor!
