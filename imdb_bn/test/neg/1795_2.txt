A brief novel written by Joseph Conrad on Heart of Darkness, Greed, Corruption and Traveling Through Africa, was a less annoying lesson. Following narrator Marlah, a concierge who traveled on the African coast to rescue Kootzz, a little weird businessman who thought that he had gone crazy, concluded that the Ivory had stopped entering the main port. The story is based on the vast amount of writing around Conrad, he has set the scene surprisingly, but perhaps a bit broadly. The story looked more like a watercolor painting, which Conrad might gradually shifted to action story to slowly pan out. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes such that after reading a book, you can see the feature, which can help you with some of the ideas of film book books, or reverse. Even with the supporting role of heartbreaking actor John Malkovich, this film also makes me more confused about the Heart of Darkness, does not seem to be a main character of the film, nobody was standing beside each other, explaining the lack of comprehensive symbolism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not a book to take lightly, and you will rather have a poor mood. This book like me can be heavy for many people. But I would recommend this book which is eager for the tragic incognito activity without a good ending of a book.
