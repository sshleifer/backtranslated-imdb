Whatever someone says, it's a B-movie, and the effects are done badly. If you're a vampire fanatic, I think it's okay, 10 in 10, can you say others sincerely? We see it as a movie, do not read it as a book, so the effect and the characters are important, as well as the story. The story is good, but it does not carry the film, it is no surprise that it has the lowest rating on it. I write it because I liked seeing this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but I was very disappointed. I do not get it wrong, I thought Blade movies were great, and like underworld films, but these characters were not closed. Make-up on vampires is bad, and the effects are bad. This sucks. If I could not read reviews here, I would not have been so frustrated that how great it was to me. If critics feel great, critics must do something about the reviewing company or something, you are not concerned about acting or making them. This is a book as well. Okay 3 out of 10 for the story.
