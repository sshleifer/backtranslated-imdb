How nice. I've seen Damon's air just a few days ago, and I do not think I can ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but in reality for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> Humanity has never seen such a void change in makeup before, without any reason. Or, likewise, a very bad jambi (?) Makeup that makes you hungry for the Halloween green marshall. <br /> <br /> Or a very nude granny about that issue. But then, there was "The Shining". <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateur that it is actually a little bit of fun, such as the dialog. The picture ends with the description that the last shot is just so silly. It has got some drunken college students together with some pals and decided to throw Tinbybner's conversation to some Tunisia Willis type conversations (I guess) from some Elm Street movies. The result is jarring, and it could be really interesting if it was that purpose. <br /> <br /> Ah, what are you? I laugh anyway <br /> <br />, stay together with your friends and see this. But you are definitely drunk. Or, you can go insane. Especially if you are a college film student. <br /> <br /> Cheers.
