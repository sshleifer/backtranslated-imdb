This version of David Copperfield is awesome from the beginning. I knew we had to visit an unexpected evening when the embarrassing Antwerp and Olivier's point is a stupid camp as it has two baddies. It was after all downhill. Massima Batesy was enough, but she did not have any strange flair that was mentioned for her. The worst is the producer's choice for Uriah. It was the music version of this character, previously played and praised by Roland Young. And what was all these self-absorbed Angst from David. Dickens certainly saw his beloved child trembling tremendously at his grave and entered his grave. <br /> <br /> At this time, when Jolie knew more than Jolie's old England.
