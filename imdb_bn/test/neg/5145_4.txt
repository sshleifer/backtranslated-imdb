This well-established film falls within a very short period of time, and unfortunately in many cases. <br /> <br /> The view is beautiful, beautiful, with the help of North-Central Vermont setting for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill tried to go back past his whiskey running to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Moving back into witch realities and direct-moving scenes, this movie rarely hits its course. <<br /> <br /> Chris Christopherson looks like a Quebec Bill, or is it his line; Or does Yankee and Quebec's cross over his cross. However, he just comes off as a low-key hit-hard. Although its dialogues with Gary Farmers' Quillley character are surprising. Wright Sanderson's Wright Kinson is tough. Charlie McDermott shows some real possibilities as a young wild bill; But its part is not big enough to carry a scene and he does not steal one. Louis Guzman showed the Lum Memframagog (Lake Wilology with a good stand-in performance), which is known as a monk with boys' hands accent: Who knows? And then there's Buzzold's Cordia: an ornate like her called, she intones the line like "Yoda will marry you to a Quebec woman" channel Yoda !!? Just near the very strange and near enigmatic enough. <br /> <br /> The end gets really choppy. Again a bad mix of magical realism and concrete. And Yoda never provides an answer we can understand.
