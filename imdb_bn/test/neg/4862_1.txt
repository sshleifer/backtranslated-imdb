Interesting thing. Charlie Shane, Donald Sotherland, Sam Waterton, and Stephen Lang all had incredible performances. Who is the Wall Street crusader, Nayef or Satherland, who can be the enemy of the mosquito as the Korean War Surgeon? Both Watertown and Lang have successful TV and film carrier (Law and Order, Murder Area, Tribune of De Niro, etc.). So which of these world actors will work in this packing bomb like these beautiful actors? <br /> <br /> The plot of Washington's coup in Shadow Conspiracy is not bad, it is not unreasonable but it is not bad. . It has been confirmed (seven days in May - a fine movie!), But with a little ticket, it can still be entertaining. <br /> <br /> To implement the main problem of shadow conspiracies. At the beginning of the film Shane, political strategists correct the gaffe of potential public relations by blackmailing a congressman with extreme, ridiculously and impossible ways. Later, guns with Lint's silent Hitman hid half from Georgetown, describing the news as "gang war". Anyone who is connected to this movie remotely in Washington? Cien is very young, at the age of 20, to be so old in the White House administration. To counter the political crisis, Shane's reaction was so tall with false machismo, he saw that David Hasselhoff's performance was in the school. And the last time the gang battle spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted against Metro Stop so that they can maintain their monopolies. <br /> <br /> I agree with other critics that this film will be intolerable without a fast moving button. . I closed HBO a year ago and then saw 3 different views. <br /> <br />: Do not buy this image. Do not even rent this picture. If you see it in Blockbuster, run as soon as possible.
