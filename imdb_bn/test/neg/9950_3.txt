Mad slower Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George ZuckerO) started at the beginning of the laboratory, because he discovered the invention of human inventions to make humans wreck hazardous wolf, which is his intelligent slave Petro (Glen Strange), apparently planning to install a serum in exchange for war crimes, This monster, the creation of the unauthorized army of the final army Let's use it! However, for the first time Dr. Cameron tried to revenge some people for his sweet revenge on his spectators, forced him to resign, and forced him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron used his plan and killed Professor Blan (Robert Strange) for the murder of his demonic creatures, in unfortunate circumstances. Cameron was unable to control this animal and in the other unfortunate incident, the local farmer, Z. Harper (Eddie Holden), got the story of Tom Gregory (geni downs), and the investigation started, he said. Cameron began to suspect, and Gregory has got plenty of opportunity to soften his daughter, Ann Annel ... <br /> <br /> Sam Newfield's guide is less than 40 budget stuff, worse than its illogical low budget stuff . Fred Mitten's script takes a very thin side in about 77 minutes, which is much longer, there is no diversity in the story and it is basically the same. The crazy scientist said that the character of the crazy scientist, who is acting as a demon, a fragile beautiful girl, a hero and a pure coincidence correspondent, is a mad scientist responsible for her and romantic his daughter, fools, stupid police And farmers involved with stereotypical shotguns who are always involved in the alleged drunkenness. This was probably even clich√©d in 1942! The film is fairly slow and dynamic that Plods along with Newfield managed to maintain a bad thing in which the tension or atmosphere is not maintained or generated. Technically the film was not great, perhaps the budget was small and the crazy giant looked like the old homeless Vino, who was not bound for weeks and had a pair of plastic fun stores in his mouth. Black and white films are mostly basic and stable like most films of this period, and the better Dr. Cameron's laboratory has a saddle and some sad pieces of scientific equipment at the top. Acting rigorous and throughout the whole film of wood with Petro she looks like the dope, as the Zucco crazy scientist is not convinced and forgettable. Mad Monster is a beautiful haircut film, here's a little bit of fun here, but at least I've finished it in single spring, when I think it's just a bit of an achievement!
