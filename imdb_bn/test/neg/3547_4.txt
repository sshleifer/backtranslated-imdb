Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired police member who now acts as a crime scene cleaner-up. In his latest work, he cleared a new crime scene and destroyed the evidence and was not aware that this crime was not officially reported. Oh, this can not be good. <br /> <br /> You hear about cleaners almost all the time, but usually when a group or gangland strikes, organizations need to be removed and the area becomes clear. It is different from working with the police after investigating police crime investigation with Tom Catarler police. Hey, nobody has to do it. You know the police do not The film makes quite clean and it depends on the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is a great thriller, but a side plot involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story a little painful. I guess they had met some time. Oh, they brought this side plot to connect to another sided plot, but it was still an reach and weird. See? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good thriller because there was a significant lack of tension, suspension, and speed was somewhat tangled. The music has not been of any benefit because I noticed that the music was more suitable for people to see the long journey. You know, journey music. Take it? Yes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, sex: No, nudity: no, language: no
