Why have there any good reviews? Because this movie is violently bad. <br /> <br /> Establishing a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we are associated with incredible racist officers as a hero as Jim Brown's hero, and just as violent means Japanese officials characterize brown nose Jim Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie any actor ever made. Stereotypes are not just great, but they dominate the film. The cultural music of the sixties may be a good thing about this movie, because it does not have anything to do with the film. <br /> <br /> It's also hard to sit back and enjoy it as fun. This film is more racist than racism in the description of racism And believe me, I was alive for seventeen years, and we thought that such shit was stupid then. It was not popular.
