I studied marketing behind the college and although I missed the whole class and did not give any attention, I would always keep in mind the basic and most essential policy of marketing, for example: not what you are selling; That's how you sell it! This policy is completely applicable to "The Devil's Triangle", because it is basically a beautiful wrap and stimulus yet empty package. Writer / director Richard Winner correctly knew that he had to remove the viewer's views away from the main error, so he threw some material that never fails to provide a vague atmosphere, such as the Vincent Price and the strange word King Crimson Music. And I guess Richard Winner's dirty little tactics worked very efficiently, in the middle of the 70's and literally a large Bermuda Triangle campaign was going on during the production of each movie ?? Was it a faux documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick ?? Box office cover matters to make big money. "The Devils Triangle" makes you embarrassed with undefined and often irrelevant information, but the events must be frightening and frightening of the terrible fears of the fierce drama and of course the most powerful Vincent Price. The narrator goes back and forth in a continuous period of time, and throughout the whole of a century, the Bermuda Triangle has a wide range of "strange phenomena" of ships and aircraft ships and aircraft, but reports are always very vague and spoken Mr. Price always ends every chapter with bad words "The only mysterious mystery of Satan's triangle?" After a few cases, the whole formula has become just ridiculous and almost unfortunate, but I think it was a genuine massacre in 1974. The documentary expanded further on the mysteries of the most notorious Bermuda Triangle, as the five planes of the military Flight 19 disappeared unknowingly at a time and the ship is unique in the USS Cyclops, but still these services provide only the lowest serviceable information. For example, in order to explore the depth of the Bermuda area, the camera never gets at one point and the testimony of the supposed real life witness of the drama looks like suspiciously played scenes. If you search for an informative and intriguing documentary on the Bermuda Triangle, of course I will not recommend this movie, but if you want to sit back and hear the hypnotic voice of Vincent Price for almost an entire hour, it's your chance!
