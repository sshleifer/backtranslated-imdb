I'm sure Poe will consider this a joke. The first two stories are modest, nothing spectacular. And then Toby has Damaged. What do you think about the world? It's a rambling, random, dull piece, with a little recommendation. Should be frustrated due to lack of backstory or conclusion, but it only ends the relief.
