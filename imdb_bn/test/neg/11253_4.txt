First off, I criticized this movie because I really had high hopes and instead, the movie sucked. <br /> <br /> * Potential spoilers * (if you have not seen a TV series) Where do you start ?? ? Well, let's start the value. The movie was much better than the original TV series, and two war scenes were created very nicely. However, the CGI was horrible. <br /> <br /> Still, the whole plot behind the plot and the questions and the questions are all said and worked. This film does not stop in the successful conclusion of an expanded universe known as FMA, and what will happen in the future is nothing more than our fantasies to return to expand our universe. <br /> <br /> And then the story has the biggest faults. WWII and Hitler added ... why ?? The series was perfect ... and Hitler was not needed. It did not even need German. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> "End", end.
