There are some great things for "Sex and City" The problem is that it is involved in a number of negative issues that really hit the final rating and reviewed for six seasons. The best thing about "SATC" is that many conversations are true life, romance stories are interesting, and characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that some women work completely out of work. These four women have many partners, even in some episodes, lesbian is going, which you have no choice but to roll your eyes with irrationality. Most of the men in the show are as shallow, degenerate, liar, deceiver, and buffoon. The insulting language used by these women is much more than how it increases the normal conversation. Why does the author do this thing? Clearly, to stay in the top and get your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothers me (except spoil) is how some relationships end. They simply do not ring the truth with me or others. I've talked about this. <br /> <br /> I gave 2 stars to mourn, finally, I saw the show I saw the show. I actually saw more than once every season. I recommend the show to anyone who will not be offended by the strong prejudice and soft-core pornography. I could have done less offensive language and less work with nudity and sexual activity but the romance was very good and the sagati was pretty good.
