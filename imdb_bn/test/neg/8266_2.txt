Definition of Documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, involves political, social, or historical issues in a realistic and informative way, and is often associated with descriptions of true news movies or interviews. Here the original word is informative. I love they can be giant, and rarely learned a thing about them. <br /> <br /> Interview with all celebrities was very worthless. I do not care about Sir Voivel's thinking about anyone and Sid Stro was not suddenly boring. And can they be fun / funny to listen to people like listening to TMGG songs? It was not. I think the problem was: The movie spends time talking about TMB's love for coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee Material presentation was funny? No! There were indications that both men were married, yet it has not been discussed. And what about they single element? What motivated them to do it? Such questions are not solved or answered. <br /> <br /> I could move negative. I found a very interesting Dial-non-Song segment. If you want to know about being giant, just buy few CDs and listen. Seriously This movie is a giant disappointment. I can not believe that many people gave it 10. Incredible.
