Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for fans of the series, but the violent insult is more than Halloween 6. The story has gone to dogs. Michael is used as a helpless bird in this movie and he is not very scary. He reminded me of more weight than the Boziyeman people who feared fear in our hearts. There is almost no beneficial attribute about this feature and I am very pleased that H.20 is coming out because it will be renewed on our mind to the fans. <br /> <br /> I had about 2 aspects of Halloween 6. An adult Tommy Dale in the film has a nice touch and linked to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (his last performance ... otherwise a bad film ending excellent career). When he was on screen, then Halloween was actually awful when you remember the good old days. <br /> <br /> This is my friends. Rope sequences are immune to One of them is an intelligent rip off of Laurie / Michael Chase. Other characters are written under the horrible and are not just desired. Although tortured in this film, the film is bad, but the highlight of Halloween is the music. We get a silly rock version of Stalk / Chase theme. What did they think of creating this image? <br /> <br /> * Spinner * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake has been to stop Jamie's character (now acting by another actress, which is not worth mentioning) we saw this character escape exemption in two characters. You can not help him when he is routine for him and when he is killed in this movie, he is sorry for that and understands that filmmakers do not care when good characters are established in a movie. <br /> <br /> * Last Spirir * <br /> <br /> It is less embarrassing to say something less. I did not exist it. I recommend giving up this film, even 5, and going straight to H20 because if you see it, you do not want to see another Hollywood movie again.
