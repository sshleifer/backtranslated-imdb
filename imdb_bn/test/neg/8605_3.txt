I have seen this movie with dangerous fascination, such as the hedgehog stuck in the headlights. No doubt that (even if you enjoy it) is a bad movie, but why is the important question? This is a good throw; It's alive; It is unusual for a British comedy, which is ready to deal with sex heads, some characters actually getting something here and there. It's also Johnny Vegas and McKenzie Crooke, the Marmite actor agreed, but they are in their moments in the past. <br /> <br />, which is basically lacking. Characters are impossible fools, incredible and isolated, so men instead of men have created a film instead of producer play. Any intermediary writer could have a few copies of loads, zoos or even weaves while making a film about the sexual orientation of a sexist British man, and read Sid's sex worker and things themselves were written. Instead, the producers definitely try to take care of some moronic, character care, care. Characters Comedy - Opponents such as slapstick etc. - The work of the audience works only if some people can recognize the truth. But the funny thing to say about this movie is a boring joke, but you can not stop it. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that the film was created badly. The plot structure is weak, there are small letters compilation or development, and the scene is not so funny. After the same lump rage chatter split scene, stupid and gratingly. There are many essential repetitions - you did not have to do it again when you made a joke about parking outside a sex party. A surprise about what the UK Film Council saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are in the ray, and most women are constantly prepared for it. Apartments and alpi saw a similar global scene, but the producers of the film accepted it without criticism. This way they ended up with a sub-update of a window cleaner's conventions. Does anyone have to take such things to the British, and do it properly ?? I think a good next project for Simon Peg and Edgar Wright ...
