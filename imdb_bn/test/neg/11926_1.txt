Right up (or down) there with toys and Jurassic Park 2 and the Phantom Menace <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It was a nice shot-ness, and a small screen 30 seconds slot was shown. <br /> <br /> If you want to see amateur writing, second-rate influences, ridiculous dresses, and frequent sleepfifts all frequently. The plot is recycled sci-fi quad. Very bad, because coming I thought it would be bad but hopeful. It might be the worst movie I ever seen, and I have seen so many. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - do not look it up. <br /> <br /> Of course you liked - one of the top three films.
