Only one word can describe MR Magoo - slapstick. Unfortunately it is not an airplane. Looks like you can scream, and what exactly does MR Magu do. Depending on the old cartoon, Leslie plays Nilsson Magu, a left-handed cavity with a dark man in the thief. Now he must primarily be hunted out of them using blindness. And all these film plays off. MR Magu's Blindness. Now maybe there was some fun joke with them, but most of it is a "face of Dopiiphone" because it lets you "feel confused to accept you for watching these movies". <br /> <br /> But until the MR Magu Hack is not bad. It's got some fun jokes at least and it's a great fun for the whole family (Nelson has tried to create "Naked GUN" for families in Magu, but it's not close to that). So once see it, you can hate it, you love it, whatever it is. I personally do not hate it, but I'm not sure it likes it, even rate it "okay." 2/5 stars for Mr. Magu <br /> <br /> Juan Ulmer
