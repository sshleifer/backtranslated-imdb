I took part in the first part of this movie, and the small bit of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think that this movie is really valuable. Kinky characters and events catch your attention and rather interesting, but it also has bad things as well, and some serious things. Its magical and mythological aspects have blocked me, and for most Christians, this film will not be very suitable or viewable.
