I think Joe Estevez most of his time has been hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and displayed really bad movies. Joe spends most of the time clothed during his black time and looking around quite a moody. He ordered an angel from the face of the death penalty, who could face you with tango and cash from the lungs and face the battle of the future from Saif Burg. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job and it took some souls to some children in a big car to lead Zeppelin, who is being led by a stupid galloot. Well, car crash and back. Junk like Tap Harding and Rick Springfield, Junk like lucky kids are running away. They are moving around the city, broke things and are sitting next to their mother when she was dressing for a bath. Action is a hospital wind up where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away. In the end, some green lights flash, Joe screaming and Puffy disappeared without a trace. I could say the same for this movie. See it from MST's relative security.
