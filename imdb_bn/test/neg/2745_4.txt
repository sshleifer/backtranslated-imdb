- Speakillers ------------ I am a fan of the 60'70 -70 French film but not more modern than modernity, so being honest I saw it because of Baluchi. He is very young, very beautiful and at the top of this punch, this movie where he met Castle, it gives more importance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a great style of memorabilia. Then suddenly we were thrown into the flashback, and the back was tired. I do not think back to a flash, but I do it and get it with people !!! However, the film is still up to a point of interest to me and the specific hole of the plot, which allows for the rest of the story, does not allow me to enjoy the rest. I can allow for a small hole here and there, but not a complete plot based on the hot air. This is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame. This is the main plot. The story is going on in a really mysterious thing that will convince me that while some time I will go along, but the story is not really mysterious. Beluchi-Castle is a couple, then Baluchi will have to leave some work in Italy (not far from Paris, the world's most distant place), and she will leave her a message, because then she explained that 'what is that? Okay, so what? Do not call these people? I think he was away for 2 months (not a century) and he would not call his boyfriend in Paris to see how he is doing? Of course not. Instead, he forgot all about him even after he came back. And that's okay, but later in the movie he told his friend that it was ready for his greatest love and for the first time in his life. He failed to call him for 2 minutes and then did not try to go back with him. And what about the castle character? It is impossible to identify him in Italy, finding someone in Italy is very difficult, perhaps it is Siberia, especially an actress possibly listed on the Arts paper. And after 21 months when he returns, it's really hard to find and explain. Someone thinks he wanted to avoid him, but no, we found that he could not meet easily. So it is very difficult to meet in Paris. All right, I do not have to go further, because this phenomenon is based on the whole movie. Even worse, Bellucci is not really this movie star but this is another girl Bohringer.
