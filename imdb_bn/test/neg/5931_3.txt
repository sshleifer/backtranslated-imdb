This happened for the first time in this series (notable exceptions in F / X scenes) While moving closer to the production price of the film, it lost most of the entertainment cost of the first two. They were a lot more in the 'Very Bad Stars' section of the awesome movie entertainment. Any argument can be made, though 'believers' are trying to create a generic action film by simply praying with it? There are so many times in the film where they can deny their belief system as annoying. If everything happens that is according to God's will and they are simply infecting its instruments, viruses, which are happening as a part of its plan, okay? Apply for every situation that does not submit to the wishes of God, and you get a fairly deceitful short film from 'Director of Action Jackson'.
