The story of this movie has been cleared and apparently leaked from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did not even try to hide. It seems that there was not enough budget for creating suitable dinosaur-dolls, so instead of the audience, some robotic-like toys-Dinosaurs (from a cheaper toy store) that are very unusual. It's funny though, because it's so bad. Acting as a dinosaur is almost unnatural. Nobody thinks this movie (which I fully understand) really is really excited. Especially the last half hour is extremely annoying and almost impossible to see after falling asleep. The positive comments I would like to make about "rapper" is that it does not take a full 90 minutes.
