I can not believe that this movie has received ratings on IMDB. Of course, I have come to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat valued to rate a film that is good or not 99% to rate movies 6 to 7. As a result of the overwhelming response and failure of the Internet, it ends. For this purpose an average is taken from most people, and unfortunately, most people are easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I have no hesitation. The movie. I really do not want to waste time writing about me. Let's say that I think it can be made for young people who like to reduce it to young people, young people, any kind of violent film films just hit the spot, and to reduce the gothic vampire fantasy they can. Get them hands If you are not one of those categories, then you will see this movie weird. I enjoy the first underworld. It was fresh at times and held a disciplined quality. The second one was trying to plot a bit, but I occasionally enjoyed directions and movies. But this whole movie was felt like producing a scientific-channel channel or even a TV series. I found the actor guided over. Their body language became strong in the non-natural idealistic organ which was felt. The lines of sparking the young actors Shakespeare's lines spit out, sparked the pride of their pride by playing such a role, but in this way, the role played shamelessly. There was a right and expected right from the beginning of the plot. I was asking for something to "keep going" because it was going to be so easy to say. I tried to take care first, but my brain was forced to stop. At the end of the last episode, I actually fell asleep. There were so many parts that were inappropriate and they did not even understand that it is not too valuable to list them all. If you encounter a pimple teen or a lasting goth, sure, it has. For the rest of us, forget it, as I am going to fix now.
