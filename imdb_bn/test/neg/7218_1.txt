The original Road House was a classic Chess 80 movie, although it was not near-appropriate for writing or acting, it was a very enjoyable and popular film, largely due to star Patrick Soze and the presence of great supporter Cast. With some nice battle scenes and eye candy <br /> <br /> After 16 years, and MGM / Sony tried to recreate this magic that gave us a quote quote and introduced three rules ... a movie that cites all the original best liners and three rules . <br /> <br /> This was an amateur fan film, it will be seen as one of the most popular loving tributes to swear movies. As a professionally-produced film, it became a boring sign of DVD Bargin Binto directly on her face, with the reuse of her original genre and the lack of fundamentals of original films with the continuing recycling of the plot. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> "I knew that it could never be something special, To be straightforward, but I at least hope that there can be some new ideas and new things to live with the name of the Road House. <br /> <br /> If I was a director, then I would have deleted all references to the first film, so that the original wasted And it's the letter. Because, we're Patrick Soo Jar's character is supposed to be dead now (Jake has shut the screen on a haircut) and his brother and son are the main characters, who are surprising enough to have quite a different name. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was in Dalton's' The boy was driving the same car as his dad, in fact, the coolest tribute, although the car ended with it as it had before, just like before.   চিত্রটি কিভাবে '89 চলচ্চিত্রের <br /> থেকে সিকোয়েন্স এবং ধারনা সহ অনেক দূরে যায় তার একটি ভাল উদাহরণ। <br /> এছাড়াও অবশ্যই কিংবদন্তী মুহূর্তটি ভুলে যেতে পারে যেখানে ওয়াইল্ড বিল শেনকে হত্যা করার প্রতিশ্রুতি দেয়। "Kill your father" and then try to send him completely differently. There are amazing writings. I see Schaech listed as co-image writer. Acting, or especially, nothing. <br /> <br /> Overall, if there is nothing else to look at, it's a good movie and you want to stop your brain for one and a half hour, or if you do not see the first road house, but the classmates of Saayz are absolutely frustrated It will happen, how much of the mobile phone's insult to close the film. Since someone once proposed this movie as an alternative subtitle, "Even Jeff Hayley is happy that he will not see it!" Stay in the original Road House and save the old Swaaj days!
