Four Police Detective A Special Unit Los Angeles was distributing justice in their own way to the 1950s. Max Hoover is Max Hugger, the unit's chief officer and his partners, played by Michael Madsen, Chase Palmintrie, and Chris Penn. Also starring Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovic. An impressive list of most names. Unfortunately the only thing about this picture is remote. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when Connelly-run young Alison Pond, now under the direction of a remote region becomes dead. Four detectives are called our band and it is immediately obvious that Nolte's Highest Hoover is going to take very personal interests in this case. We will soon find Alison, as well as knowing Hoover as well as some important military and government types, which may have cause for his death. But who was exactly involved and why do they want this unexpected innocent woman dead? Set out to find Hoover and the crew. It seems like an attractive compound but unfortunately it does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive array of names, there is a lot of acting here. Nolt has been pressed, Madison seems incredibly indifferent, Palmintree and Malkovich came out of the same way as Character, there is very little work on Pen and Griffith is neutral. As far as the best performance is in all the fastest flashback sequences. The dialogue throughout the film is compulsory and woody. You would expect this kind of mystery to be completely absent. Nothing really happens really dramatic. Actually nothing seems to happen for the photo bulk. Instead we just sloganeering alongside a rather ridiculous and incredibly frustrated climax. When "mystery" is solved, you can say to yourself, "Oh, come on now, is it all there?" But after solving the mystery it becomes worse and we get a complete ridiculous and completely incredible step sequence. And even then we are more frightened, played badly, are more tacked as the whole unnecessary scene is tacked until the end. And then gracious it ends. And do not have a moment soon.
