You can not believe this, but when this movie is credited to the credit, I find the director's name. I saw it, I burned it in my memory and I forgot it. This movie is beyond the terrible. It looks like Ed Wood's films are like Orson Wells. At least B movie was entertaining, this was a spirit dead experience. The standard was very bad, I started thinking that it could happen. <br /> <br /> I heard that Uwe runs 14 miles a day. Because wherever his movies are seen, people will have to drive him out of the city with flame and pitchfork. The script was terrible, the light was like high school football, and cinematography Roger Patterson's Bigfoot was better than the video quality. Actors are ashamed to tell people their line with any credibility. Ultimately, Alan Smith did not have a picture of his name. In spite of that day, I learned this guy to avoid any film. It's not a bad thing from what I heard.
