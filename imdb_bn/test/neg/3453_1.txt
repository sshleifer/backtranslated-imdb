A movie for a million dollars can be a win for a line producer or accountant but nothing for the audience. Balance sheets were beautiful but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What will be a victory for Irish movies when people realize that production costs and scripts can not be deducted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another review of this site and I agree with what is fully written. What I'm adding to is that the film never patronizes the different styles of them without settlement. The picture will be directly benefited from direct comedy or social / political interpretation. <br /> <br /> I had an overall impression that the film was suddenly developed, not progressing temporarily and with high quality. Performance and music on a positive note were very good.
