Why is Lori Petty Tank cast as a girl, I do not know. Lack of his performance performance Her voice is grating. It is almost impossible to tell me how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are various "modern-pop" references to this movie, which I thought was very strange, that the film was supposed to take place away from the future. It has not been difficult to make it attractive on this premises. Some good writing loads helped. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts makes it a look as a light-mannered techno-geek. I think they might change the role. <br /> <br /> I will never know why anyone likes this movie, until they are a little fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Total waste of time.
