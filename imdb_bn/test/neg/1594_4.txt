I have seen most of John Waters's films Apart from some of her initial initials, I have seen only all of them, so it is clear that I am a big fan and it is certain that in my films I am fairly uninterested. While going on top and despotic way, I congratulated the women Trombol and Polyester - two outstanding treatments for bad taste and extra for serious fun films. So I'm certainly not silent and most of the water suppliers can take it. However, Pinky has created a movie in Flamnings, which is so annoying, unreasonable and so objectionable that I could not even stand it. Before becoming more mainstream in his other films, they were funny. Yet, there is no laugh, it seems like there is no intention to shock the viewers and entertain them in any way. I'm glad that after making this film, Waters' humorous feeling has improved, such as the Divine Dinner Dog Stool (as in this film), but not least for entertainment. My suggestion is to skip this movie and preach that it never happened, and then see the great films of 70s and 80s.
