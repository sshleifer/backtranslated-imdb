I'm a pretty tolerant guy, when it comes to movies, even B movie. I regularly watch some B movies for fun, and they can be amazingly good, can only be terribly terrible. I usually keep my hopes really low before watching such movies and even after doing it, the breeding was just terrible horror. I did not really think that they were removing the core somewhat, but they did not do anything interesting with the object. Some scientists are worried about Earth's earthquake activity, and to travel to the depths of the Earth to make Montreal stable. So what we get is a very long setup, which works on a top secret mission called Project duP, two perplexed scientists of Lew Perry and Rick Roberts. Man In-Charge, managed by Michael Field, secretly stuck important information from Assistant Marsh Crowford, who played Mimi Kujik's role. Cutting the caster, Netanye Brown, a Zane mission expert who created "Mole", created a drill that drowned in the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to some beautiful beautiful effects, the design set, descent nothing about descent. The film begins to be fairly entertaining, but it quickly falls into a tedious story about the continuing geological activity, which has happened in other films as the core of death. Descent characters include a poor script with vain, forgotten dialogs. To make matters even worse, there is no literal move, no real threat or danger. The effort of the comic relief effort is painfully unfunny. There are hateful holes in the plot and some mistress left the untied in the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> There was a cheap way for everyone to stop this movie. There was no idea behind this film, there was no invention, it was OK. Other than some excellent looking special effects, and set designs, this movie fails on another level. The story is from Hollywood's trash cans, and the characters are reluctant to boot. Reproduction will easily land you in displeasure, and frustration. To avoid all costs.
