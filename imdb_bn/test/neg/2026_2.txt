Voices may be a curiosity at the beginning of the word 'The Wind', but after the story was exposed, I knew that it had moved away from it. The main themes of this movie were all the major characters of bad acting, (except for some scenes involving Mick's inner turmoil), there was a total lack of character development and there was absolutely no point in plot - what is the author thinking? <br /> <br /> Michael Manzilo won two 'Awesome / Science-fi' awards for 'The Wind'. Oh? What was so scary about this movie? There is nothing! Apart from the evil 2 live video shot, the rest is' T.V. Made for thriller 'was more than that - it will not be edited either. If you want a great movie about 'Shelve Grave' murder instead of 'Love Cobra' then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
