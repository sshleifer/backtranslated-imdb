I was not expecting much from this movie, but I was eager to try something that initially seemed to be a terrible blow to 80th children. Although three teenagers are a bit of critical plot, but this is not a horror movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' is a little about the statue of Aztec, which exchanges hands with many hands (those who should be adult and thus, 'contaminated') to eliminate all the temples of the idol, and often not only the owners, Rather, there is a serious impact on the owner's losses. After a lot of exchanges in exchange for this item, three youngsters find it out in the air and can not find it, only when it is found that weird and dangerous things come quickly. They propose to explain the situation to a news reporter, who do not buy spiritual conversations. However, it is its producer who wants to investigate further, especially if it means that he can get control of the statue (I do not think it is quite contaminated to feel the dangerous desire for encouragement by the statue for thirteen years). It has been mentioned thousands of times in a story, especially the horror of 1950s and 60s and fiction of science fiction. <br /> <br /> It was at least able to maintain some interest for me. Although less budgeted, even if poorly played or played by bad acting, at least in the last decade, the terrible tenant (nowadays have the same Chess quality, but there is a big budget). We allow it to substantially reduce it, at least for the chance to be absorbed in the vomiting atmosphere and much more, in spite of the story of the stories. And, although not very dangerous, special effects are done nicely. Again, this is a routine horror story, especially with the end (which modern standards have become a device that has been boring annoying), but one that's not so embarrassing. It might just be worth checking out for laughs.
