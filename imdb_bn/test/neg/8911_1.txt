Stephen Sigal plays the role of a father who is talking about a shielded vehicle for a bank and he is driven by everything in his way. However, the police appear to appear in the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat, who has given advance notice to the police. This story covers many packets and turns and disappears from the hold and nobody knows its new owner. The poor Seagal gets painted a bit in this hold and naturally finds out the person or person she is trying to try to get him away for long periods of time. In this film, Segal tries to be a good guy but evil forces against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and rather annoying and very long.
