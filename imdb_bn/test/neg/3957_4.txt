A group of young people discover a bad video game, but once they start playing it, they all die like a video game. Since they have become addicted to the game, they have to find ways to defeat the game's central villain, The Blood Countess, before killing them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film can still be mildly entertaining. However, this "horror" movie is not all scary. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself very seriously and does not have much fun to watch the movie. Of course, sometimes laughs, but in most cases, the film is very slow. PG-13 horror movies can still be as good as Wolf of the Ring or the Action. Though the ring and steevive are not really the same type of horror movies. Stay Alive is more than a slasher film and its rating is PG-13, with very little death scenes. It should have sold the original movie and it was a fun idea that death could really be good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a big audience and had to change the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is a complete joke and most casts give terrible performance. John Foster is a very good leading man. He was busy caring for the audience or for the audience to care for him. Its character is not just very soft Summer Armstrong really gives fine performance, although in reality it is very little. Frankie Muniz is probably the best performer of Steve's Live. Houston Texans is an honor on the level of being the best player. Sofia Bush is absolutely terrible as of October. Its performance rushed so and it feels so fake. The most annoying character of the film is Jimmy Simpson's performance. His character is so unlikely that you encourage him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are quite unlikely, which make it more difficult to be interested in film. It is very hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids, and if you want to survive the characters, it is much more fun to see. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a small old but it's still kind of work. The film is really small, so it is not too much except pain. I would definitely not blame Caste because he was working with an inexperienced director and writer. The direction is not very good and the screen is not very good. Stay Alive is not actually the worst horror movie of 2006. That honor will go away when it calls a stranger. Stay alive though still a missed opportunity. In the end, this fatty and furry movie is better left on the roof. Ratings 4/10
