It seems like a feature-length treatment of a comedy-routine, which can be said in a ten minute short. Also, the technical credit super-par. The film really feels like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> Cast is a mixture of pros and talented newcomers at periodical stage but the issues are superficial scripts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Have been smartly marketed and offer a unique selling point, but ultimately disappointed on all levels of the film.
