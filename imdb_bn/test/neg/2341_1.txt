Most liked, I heard the public praise. And despite the strange, as well as unpleasant moments of COUNTLESS, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of film. Then two ladies went "performance" late at night. The rest of the movie (which is another 40-minute path) is also the Wanderers and the full conflict compared to the first part and the dump on what I saw. Then the movie suddenly came to an end. <br /> <br /> I thought, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a need for what happened. Nothing is understood, and I am a cute cute man. This other user's comments are not created in any sense, even when they say "Speak." I still have no idea what they are saying. Someone's dream? Is not real? Then what is the point of the movie for 2 hours and 30 minutes? Or is it real? I'm compelled to make a choice. <br/> <br /> [A] The movie is a work of mens level genius and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The movie is a strange request for the weird and not just knowledge. Anyone who loves it, they are trying to save their face and they are pretending to be "get". <br /> <br /> I choose [B]. You screw me I'm not going home ...
