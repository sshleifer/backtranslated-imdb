This movie, created in 1979, is the film that can be cut. A lot said, it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous projection or the horror, the horror camera- the tracking of the supposed "in flight" object, this is a stunt that closes the condom, which will irritate you unreasonably. Barrel-rolls, loop-the-loops and fierce "EVAVEVE" manuscripts have surprised me why the air force of the world does not fly Concordes like their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So here I learned from this celluloid cheese-festival important lessons: <br /> <br /> 1. Phantom 4 jet-fighter as the least impressive in Concorde. <br /> <br /> 2. You can burn a fireplace gun on Mach 2 just by opening the cockpit window and stopping your arm. <br /> <br /> 3 If the flyer fails to discharge the gun, do not release it, it can stop. <br /> <br /> 4. Two sidewinders could throw missiles to shoot once at Concorde. <br /> <br /> 5. Each shining one will be confused with a heat-seeking missile every time. <br /> <br /> 6. Switching your jet-engines is a sure-fire way to throw off the missile missile if 5 (above) fails. <br /> <br /> 7. While crash-landing at Concorde, it is impossible to pre-jetsen your fuel. <br /> <br /> 8. Concord Pilot All War Trained Veterans <br /> <br /> You can imagine, this picture is not very realistic. The effect is primitive by today's standard and that, concomitant is performed with conjunctivitis acrobatics, it makes a movie a little but blameworthy. <br /> <br /> is not recommended. Not recommended at all!
