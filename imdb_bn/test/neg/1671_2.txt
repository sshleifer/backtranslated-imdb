What is really true movie, I can say that the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and LSD because it will be the result of his 'trips'. <br /> <br /> You are following the whole movie. It's very weird but hey, I am sure that it will be a perfectly good explanation for this ... just do not be frustrated in the search of erm, it does not have any explanation and Creates more confusing. At the end of the film, you'll probably face the same thing as if you pay for your queue for the queen and the merchant told you it would be 11.95 and you would continue to wear the elbow in the ball to say no. There are so many reasons in this film which are undefined and I think it will leave the imagination of the audience completely strangely. Do not make me wrong I like the weird movie, 'The Cell' can easily be described as weird and twisted but it is a brilliant film in my eyes (I hate most despite the J-people vote, even if it does not run my opinion ). It's not one of those movies, and I think you'll consider the characters to appreciate this movie. I can tell you they are probably the artists who will go to an art exhibition, to see a division of pigeons separation on a white board and "Oooohoh what a wonderful composition, the artist has found a unique way of truly illustrating" Indeed, it all emits birds on a board. <br /> <br /> Remember the last moment of watching this movie, thanks for reading <br /> <br />!
