First off, I'm in the United States <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was a clear - and unexpected - came out of "The Office" (UK). I was thus giving the award for zero stars, but I see and see, it came from the Ricky Garvis series earlier. <br /> <br /> Still, compared with comparisons of solid American "offices" to see this or any other show with the same dynamic). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, That - and "office" and "Larry Sanders" in the US - the real enemy. The UK's "offices" are somewhat cooler and more primitive, such as real events that are crowded with real people in real events. However, unlike this or the sharpest Christopher guest "computations", this is not really a mockery, "The Newmorum" is clearly. However, in "Newsroom" is still "very interesting", it is different, and self-aware, but it is not enough to lift smart or gifted products with a cast and crew, it is a heavy comedy But it is not recommended at all. <br /> <br /> --- And what is the lack of an anaphoraphic DVD? I know it was shot on anopharmic widescreen, because I had our HD f Yanele saw the pilot episode. CBC, get with the program.;)
