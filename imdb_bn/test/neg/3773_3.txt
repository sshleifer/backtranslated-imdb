What a waste John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserve better than that. To start at the beginning, the pier here was terribly miscast led here. The role has been said for someone who can be convinced as a anti-crusher protagonist, who can be frustrated and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton used to fit the bill or even El Pasino, but the jetty is very alive, and seems to be very fun. Also, can anyone physically influence the person who has met the character of the jetty? Seeing the character presented to the audience, it seems that he can start as a tight end for the Oakland riders. Scarlett is a little better-based role. Where is the pain and the conflict created, it is certainly improving? And as "Plot" ... Well, it does not have any knowledge. Leap characters from funny one frame without letters - and of course without explanation. The motion of the movie may also be slightly preferred, such as speed. This is a very slow film, I have nothing against slow films, unless they are walking somewhere. The speed is only up to the very last side, when it changes from as much as possible to a slower pack into tedious clich√©s from an enormous race. This is to succeed in it - the only thing missing something involving a small dog. For Gabriel McCarth's performance, there were 3 of these 10 - he was the only member of Cast who was Cast Cast and b) was able to satisfy his role. All in all, a terrible frustration and a real waste of hours.
