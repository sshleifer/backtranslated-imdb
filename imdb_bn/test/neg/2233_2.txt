At least it is with this episode. Here we are a time traveler, professor from Gilgit Island, less, going back to time in 1865. Do One What - Try to Save Lincoln! Any really interesting diversity is rung on this old theme. As another reviewer said, this episode was particularly vague and unwanted, little to offer that "professor" really came back in the 1860's. Budget constraints are clearly clear, and the direction is firm. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark but it remains to produce a very flat. We often think that we're waiting for something to happen on stage sets, cute things. At the end there is a minor twist, but I emphasize minor.
