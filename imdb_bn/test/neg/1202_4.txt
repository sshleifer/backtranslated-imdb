... but it is still 4/10 stars worthy and still more worthy. A Moroccan Fool kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot by some Arab countries. They never give the movie the name of the movie, it's really funny, they vaguely mention some Arab nations, the film is not really the same. But Lama is here to revenge Nader, he is a friend of the main character Doug Master. Well, Dodge Masters, who lives on the base of the air force, his father was an air force pilot, but he failed to enter the air force's academy, went to steal two plots (with help from his disabled friends) and go to his father's rescue. Yes, right - this is one of the best movies of all time !!! Louis Gastet Jr. spawned his role. You originally wanted to drag the hell out of the whole movie of Doug Master. However, perhaps you can guess how the plot ends, I can not believe that they have created 3 Situational in this movie.
