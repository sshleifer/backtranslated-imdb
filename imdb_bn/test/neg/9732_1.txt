It seems that when a mainstream film company wants to create a movie for the thirteenth, it only focuses on one thing: gender. Do not make me wrong, I am not a projection but the reality is that these people are thinking of closing my stone, I am extremely objectionable. Take the Convent, a movie that relies heavily on you and it seems that the original characters are attractive, it could go away without a plot and / or a script that is not six years old. This is basically (supposedly) draft with hot guys. And, yes, it's that. It bored my tears. Even my friend, who usually laps our cowardly films, hates it. It's really surprisingly bad, where it might actually be fun. Most of the women in the presence of the movie do not seem to enjoy it if I had laugh. When the boy's kiss was over, he was with some of the inferior detective boys who crawled positively and died. Their firmly watching movies were really highlights. I do not think of the mainstream, the Hollywood movie will spread good movies for teens (or, indeed, for some), so I think I will leave. Until a young man who does not like the piscatet dl, Paris Hilton feels "hot" and MTV sees it is a bit deteriorating. Life is hard when you love fifteen year old Art House. :( PS No one should have told the director that all the girls can not find the girl boy band members "fully hit !!! 111 !!"
