Derek Jarman has shown our time and time again that the dialogue is not his strong case. She is a painter, and she painted. His films are often spectacular, but already exciting to look like a dry color. Quickly watch his movie forward, really fast setting that you can get faster DVDs. At Tempest, Jarman rarely uses scripts or letters, using only a jacket to hang very long and well-made cinematographic frames. He even opposed Shakespeare's original script so far, in favor of achieving disagreeable slow and lifeless scenes. There is no romance, magic, trick or script, little spontaneity, and especially the character of Caliban, becomes the same sharp and insane figure as the Gavson of Jarman's Edward 2. It is very bad that this is the only movie version of Tempest.
