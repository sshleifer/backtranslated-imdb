The film begins with a description of some of the narrators describing some crime in the city and then we know that a hero is a police officer who has been suspended or perhaps retired. I did not have the patience or interest to verify above before commenting. If the stories have a stereotype for deep, frequent sound, it is a higher time to finish it. I fell asleep deeply and was not bothered to stop the movie. I still try to determine what the movie was about and why there was an outdoor shoot. A movie of a third-rate television serial will have more sets than this shit, and I'm still pleased to starring actors and producers in this huge bullet of the movie. It should be produced as a normal TV serial or even putting it on the big screen as a local theater drama. Total waste of time and money. The film was supposed to be produced for a long time and it would have been better to leave it like that. Sympathetic sleeping dialogues and sets, this is my worst movie.
