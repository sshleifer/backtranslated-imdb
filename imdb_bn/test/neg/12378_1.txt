This is a terrible movie !! Some people told me that it was not really bad but I disagree! The giant is looking amazing (and funny) but this is something we knew I guess. In addition, the dialogues are awkward and it is very terrible to write. <br /> <br /> The film is as entertaining as it is. Not always for good reasons, but it's a good "very bad that's funny". <br /> <br /> <br /> According to a second character in the film named Pierre (the film is French Canadian), there is a legend known as "La Cascen" about a monster bird among French Canadians. As a French Canadian myself, I can assure you that I have never heard of such legends. It sure smiles me :) :))
