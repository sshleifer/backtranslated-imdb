I've rented this photo of the blockbuster due to the cover and title! Excellent sound !! This film suffers due to writing, it requires more suspicion. "Monsters" need more time to face. We have some special power and definitely need more "Oh Sh--" moment to have them. The photography does not bother me for a scene that does not bother me again. There was a lot of close up. But the film began to pull and the heroes did not really work for their independence. After all, I would say that everyone has kept the author for a long time. But this movie must be the lowest fares below. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better choices here. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 on this picture.
