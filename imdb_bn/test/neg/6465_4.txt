It is a short "less known" comedy in the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was a DVD of Qualo Films that integrated Olly-Laurel and Hardy Shorts. They are interesting and historically important, but generally the average average for style movies is below average. Compared to Chaplin, Keaton, Arabakl and Lloyd's shorts, they must be one step in their quality and humor. Also, music music was quite poor by other silent DVD values. I set off the right mood to turn off the sound due to the incompatibility of the music. But, despite this, they are still valuable. <br /> <br /> I will be honest about this brief. This is 8 ending in this DVD and when I got it, I was quite annoyed by 7 mediums in 8 shorts. So, it is possible that the film could be less than 4 - but of course, if this is the case then 5 is not even better! The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy. Nothing is especially interesting and there are certainly many good silent shorts.
