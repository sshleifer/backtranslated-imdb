I recently watched the movie on The Sundance Channel and it made me eager since the beginning. However, it seems to be taking me forever wherever I want to go, and finally, I felt a little cheated. In short, Nobel Wingham (Wallace's Texas Ranger Fame) is a boat salesman who started harassing the telephone by demanding a boy to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Wilmingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects the son and he (son) is enjoying him reminding him. I will not loot anything for anybody, but for me three things have prevented me from liking this movie. First, this film has more dirty language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glennery Glen Ross. 99% of it originated from Willingham itself. It's been a long time to wear me with a constant four-letter word. Two, I could not believe that someone would answer in the telephone that many times, especially when someone knows that the other side of the crank caller line. Whatever the movie, home, diner etc., in the Willingham movie, the phone has a ring and he always answers the "son" with a germ, and then only answers when he calls back and calls back in about ten seconds! How many of us do it? Now I understand that if she can not answer, she probably does not have any film, but I could not suspend my unbelief on that special issue. Three, and the smallest of this criticism, why is the director showing our "Corndog Man" (AKA Caller / Son) so opposed? Most of the time he is listening to the rodic word on the other end of the phone. If the other things break, I could stay with it, but since they are not the only one to deal with it. I started the film's credits with some basic ideas and started to draw attention to me, but it's about it. Watch it once, only once. However, if you're like me, you'll say "Triple Marine!" Your sleep for a night or two once you end up seeing it.
