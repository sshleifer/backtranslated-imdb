Let me tell you in the past In the past, I have had a huge Karlin fan. I think George is the smartest person in the world and one of the best comedians. Why the past George was so great that he had the power to look at things in his own wrap and to give us a unique perspective on them. It was not always meant to be funny, but because you always respect her opinion, they are presented in such a clever manner. But all of you are diseased are just a long rant. He does not give us a unique perspective, he has given us a long list of stuff that he p.o.'d did. There is no insight, there is no cunning, just an old man has directly complained for one hour that we have made all the complaints. And above that, it was not even fun. You can not cope with all the helpless appeal which is easier and more advanced than anything stupid people. I do not feel angry with the joke, but George can do so well. I really hope that the next show in George Carlin's next show George has shown in the past.
