A few years ago, he saw a young girl killed, now as an adult, he has been diagnosed with various mental illnesses (he is a fictional friend?) This picture disappointed the viewer, not the feeling of tension, but rather a sense of sleep . Feeling furious, I find it difficult to sit in it by getting my moves to feel stupid and supposed to be heavy and heavy with each and every minute of infinite 'mystery'. Are you going crazy? Or is it unusual? A good question, who is the care? And that answer, no one. No one at all Avoid this movie, save yourself some time to do something more appropriate. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
