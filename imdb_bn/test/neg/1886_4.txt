OK - The title "Frankenstein's House" was a reference to a line in the original Frankenstein film. When they follow it with a movie entitled "House of Dakula", which does not give any real sense, you know that it started to become a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explaining, Dracula returned, and he himself calling Baron Latos. He enters the house of Doctor Edelman with the claim of his vampirezism remedies. Edelman has a Hanback Nurse who helps him (What's with the Hanback Assistant in this movie?), But Dakula is really interested in one of her finest assistants. At this stage, Larry returns to the "Wolf Man" tabbot (again, no explanation is given) and his Lycanthrope is looking for the same doctor for the healing. And then he would just be holding Frankenstein's giant exactly which may be raised to help him in plants, which falls into a cave. Dear God, when will be finished ... Sure, other universal giant was silly, but it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good thing at first. There are some great settings, and the impact of the vampire bat is slightly better than usual. Some of the other effects are very yarn too. John Carradine would not feel bad if he did not have a bad nightclub, but there was nothing bright like a lugosi. In my opinion, Onoslaw Steven has played a lot of good vampires in this movie, though the opposite is the problem with the carinine - not all emptiness and none in the class. None of the performance is great, but it is more dangerous than other types of misery scripts - especially in female parts especially badly written But as stupid as it is, it remains reasonably entertaining in most cases. The best thing about it is the short length of it. <br /> <br /> Now the bad thing ... it's not unclear, it's bad writing and it does not work. I hope three monsters will start a supernatural struggle for power, but it will not happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, which is not particularly well illustrated. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula transmits other people, but it is done with blood circulation instead of a bite, because it is always uncomfortable with the universal possible lesbian theorem. Larry Talbot is always as modest as Wolf Man, but he plays a relatively small part. Again Frankenstein's giant portion has reduced in closing climates. For God, Glenn was fantastic as weird creatures! Why not give him more screen time? It is unfortunate that this series had to end (the classic comedy is not counted as "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, it just exploded in sunlight and died, much like Dracula.
