Changis Khan "Fan" I was waiting for this movie. After reading the legend of the legend of Kange iyagulandas, after reading epic novels about Chinga and reading the historical records, I know something about this and it was thrilling to share my knowledge with friends through this moment ... <br /> <br /> A fraud. This movie is actually made from the beginning to the end. Some things that seem right, but mostly believe it's authentic writers. It does not have to be a problem, I like some other unfortunately good entertainment such as good boring as well. This movie does not bring glory to anything. <br /> <br /> If you know something about this, I will not recommend this movie.
