When I was the first father 5.5 years ago, I was ready to sacrifice a lot. I knew I wanted to change the diapers and take their swim lessons and join the parade in the park to swim a lot, but I was not ready for the kind of sacrifice that I had given last night. This, my modest opinion, cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. It's not quite bad in Karate's dog, but it seems like a fairytale dog fox. The underdog was a television show, I recommend flipping by. Even the presence of poodies and the voice of Banky Edwards can not save it. Bow Wow <br /> <br /> It was just about the 80 minutes that I enjoyed. James was sitting on my right side and Michelle left, and I spent more time watching this conversation, flying on a mobile phone than watching it on the screen. At the age of 5 and 3, they were target audience, and this was the target of the film. There is a scene where the underworld thrusts in the face of another dog and Michelle thinks it is sometimes the most fun scene stuck in the film. When the underworld was flying outdoors, James was literally on the edge of his seat, mesmerized. The kids absolutely like the underdog, and that's why I was there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But if you want to kill the four-year-old 80 minutes, then I will not judge. I did a blast.
