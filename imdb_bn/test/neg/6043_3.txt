All four of our cities have electric power plants that find a mini nucleus reactor, launch it and fall into a parallel universe residing in a parallel universe by a giant spider who collapses with some of the people to accept the earth. But is he left alone? If so do not join the rest of humanity and hunting him down. What happened to the military, some billion plus noise can not be used in any way, and why if there are many more protective places available then it can be hidden in the basement. Also do not poke on the city workers, but how they looked like a mini nuke reactor and how they were not in a parallel universe, how they know how they can open the arc? Sorry but there was nothing to be liked about the movie
