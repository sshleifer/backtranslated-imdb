Seeing ratings, you think it's a classic, but again another example of poor independent filmmakers is trying to show interest in their movies. Are they not smart at all? I suppose that curve and offset all 1/10 will get it. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Acting, fool and garbage. <br /> <br /> Sound is perfect, cheap and nasty, if the actors do not see you where it is coming, you do not know. From <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people work as they have borrowed their cameras right after parents watching this matrix. Less is more, but this group is more fully popped up. <br /> <br /> Hairs too are rubbish. I do not doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and this can be a good reason. I hope the zumba will eat their eyes because this 90-minute peppe that I will not go back. <br /> <br /> And it gets worse by one million times as the ratings are false. <br /> <br /> One critic has said in the last 30 years that he was one of the best horror films? I can only assume that the transplant was successful in his recent childhood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
