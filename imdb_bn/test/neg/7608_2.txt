I saw a 1974 film called Dark Talon. The credit of this movie is just like the Dark Star, so I think it was an alternate title. The Dark Talon was not anywhere near somewhere funny as of nowhere. The acting was long, editing slipshod, and overall stupid. The 1970's trucking song is a boring song "Buson, Arizona", which has nothing to do with the film. Originally the plot revolves around a small crew of unstable bombs that bombs the places of explosion unstable. Bomb sensitive and human response. Obstructive disruption prevents communication between bombs and crew. A crumen went out and talked silently with a bombshell without any knowledge. The movie that I saw was done in less than one and a half years, which was commercially cast, so I suspect that a great version of the Dark Tallion Dark Star. <br /> <br /> Alien painted with a blown red beach ball spray it with a pair of giant hands to walk. It was as stupid and unconvincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe it was in the hands of John Carpenter. His other movies were so good.
