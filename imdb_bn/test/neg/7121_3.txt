I love the first naughty, I just saw it in the theater, and honestly, I was frustrated. I never heard of Chiling before the unique audio, it was a real secret. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And everywhere, in some scenes (such as a woman urinating from fear, or else A young woman who drinks milk once drinks again), which does not really make sense, and help improve the image's crap factor. In these scenes, and some people, the people who were selling sold their hands laughing loudly. It was a good indicator of how the film was lacking in the thrills, cools, or cripps. Acting was good, the illustrated emotions were credible, so the actors closed the cap, but the cluttered story and its lack of direction was something I could not shake across the whole movie. I was a little more disturbed than the unexpected scene of the same old unfortunate gagging noise, but overall, I was very frustrated.
