What a disaster! Generally, when someone criticizes the historical movie, it is always funny to point out the wrong errors in slips, generally the writers add to create a more "dramatic" situation. However, "Imperia: neron" is a complete nutritional type of animal. In this film, the bad-boy artist of Rome - bored to find anything confirmed by the historical record of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of the emperor. <br /> <br /> And this is a kindness, because Nero is the most impressive among all the Roman emperors. His life was filled with tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. These messy creators have chosen any other route, which can only rub heads of a known observer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. When Keligula is murdered for her father's princess, her mother expels Agagripina, and Nirok is portrayed as a 6-8 year old son to send the boy to the village slaves. "Ten years later," the story begins just before the murder of the Killiglu. Fact: Nero was born about six months after the four-year rule of Keligul, and he was killed only three. Nader's father died due to natural causes; Agrippina was temporarily deported for bad behavior, arbitrary; And Nero was not raised among slaves, but there was usually a young man in the empire's family. <br /> <br /> 2. Well, according to the authors, Nero now has become his great uncle Claudius Emperor at the age of 16 (he was actually walking around 4); Agrippina, the engineer of the engineer, dies of the engineer and Clodius, who accepted Nero. Then he went to conquer Britain, and soon after the winner came back, Agrippina poisoned him. Nero has declared the emperor, although she is probably 18 or 19 years old. True: Two years after Claudius began his rule, 43 AD Britain won At the age of 54, Nero lived by natural chronology until he was 31, but at the age of 16, he won the throne. <br /> <br /> History tells us that "Five Good Years", "Where Nero has been well-governed under the teachings of philosopher Seneca and the Pretorian Buruus, it is shown - sort of - depicting the Roman Senate and opposing the neutral steps of Nero The Senatorial dispute of Nero began only when he started showing signs of dementia and the real or imagined argument <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother arranged Agrippina's regulator, who killed her uncle and husband for the murder of her son's emperor. After a while, Niro decided to tear his intoxicants and kill him. In the film, he sent his Hennchen Tiglins to death, all true enough, but the reality was so good! Agrippina Nirro tried to poison him three times, but as an old toxic person he realized himself that, and he failed, then he tried to kill his bedmaker's roof and kill him, but it also failed. Later, he sent a ship to the ship, which was deliberately designed to isolate separately; When it went down, he jumped into the sea and got down on the shore. Finally, he killed him. Now everything shows that this film has definitely improved! <br /> <br /> Other mistakes have increased: Niro's boyfriend Act was not a slave-boy since childhood, he never refused, and he did not prove that he was a Christian. While sitting beside the lake, Niro did not commit suicide by throwing his wrist. Etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Source of life of Nero was primarily a Roman historian Tacitus and Sutinus, both members of the Senatorial class and his memoirs. But the evidence proves that he was very popular with ordinary people, one of the final scenes where he crowded the city for suicide when he committed suicide from the city. <br /> <br /> Why writers? And the producers take an spontaneous interesting story with lots of good stuff for any movie, and make this piece of shit? Oh, and I mentioned how the sets and costume was delicious? Lol <br /> <br /> One star, because there is no way to reduce it.
