Want a great recipe for failure? Take a painful, left-wing political plot, add some weak and completely unused characters, and then throw the movie in the worst sequence. Let stew for one week (probably spend time creating this trash). The result of '<br /> <br /> is' Still this movie,' a cinematic experience that does not contain bad films in hazardous and extremely low places. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie jumped on my face for my entire run time. Words can not express how painful it was. This is not one of the bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and have fun with. This is not 'Plan 9 from External Space'. It's a long, annoying and time-consuming waste. 'Steel This Movie' The biggest waste of power and talent I've ever seen. When I realize that people * actually * took the time from their lives while working on this trip, you can say "acting". But again, when your weak side, poor writing, everything is bad - the last thing to criticize "acting" is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is very fast, existent, horrible that a friend or a loved one Somehow it could see. I really want that I can destroy every copy of this movie, so it will not pollute the mind of the aspiring filmmakers. Thanks, Robert Greenwald, thanks for giving me a new honor for any other movie. You've really shown me what's really awful and why I should only praise all the movies who are crappy and / or boring.
