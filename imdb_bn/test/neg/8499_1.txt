I could not give this rating so low (2) if its average was not ridiculously high, but someone would have to bring it to more reasonable. I was sitting in most of the film, watching the scene watching the tagging and the scene of the store scene. No dialog, just tagging and shoplifting. Finally kiss two tags. Something happened. But then back to tagging and shoplifting. I left the screening. I only recommend this movie that is influenced by fierce filmmaking. I do not like the previous picture of managers (Man-boy love self-righteous defense), but at least that story was a story, interesting character, dialogue. The graffiti artist only had the view after the tagging and the shoplifting scene. I want more than a film than this.
