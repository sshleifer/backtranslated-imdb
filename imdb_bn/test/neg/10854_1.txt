Well, I'm in a British university, I actually went to the same film, and there was nothing like that. This is a terrible, poorly made and acting film. The worst thing is, it can be really good, if they are annoyed to spend 12p more in it, in fact it should work as one and want to take 15 thousand pounds when it wants to represent real British students. He did not say anything about life, where was Bush's diving, drink up until 4 o'clock, endless chat about group dynamics ??? Where was diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but Fraser's week was not that awful, and I'm impressive. And ultimately the question is still ... a bed or clothing?
