This movie lacked in many areas. It is about the people who drive about the LVs type people and the bikes of the Santos Angels reach them. One of them is known as Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. This alice man wants to be their "driver". Occasionally, I wanted the people of 3000s to calm down because the movie was really good. Of course, there were violence and many sugar lines, such as "what kind of beer do you want?" It was Chess. Banjo was a great boxer to the acting father and I was happy to see him watch some war scenes. Also, the fatty curator had a NAZI SWASTICKA on his jacket !!! That was pretty brave if I would say so myself.
