The 9th company's (9th rota) main issue is not sure if it wants to save on personal savings or complete metal jackets. The attempt of Spielberg's image is shameful, like the barley sergeant crying on the red flower field !!! In the training sequence, there is no intensity or reality that Kubrick has given his best writing. <br /> <br /> Another reason for the debate is that Afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are never seen. Here they form a Russian firm firm attack around with no effort to use the cover. I'm sure the tricks have gone from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene of this movie has been seen before in other war movies and done very well. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why do all the meritorious members chew in a match? Finally, I always doubt about a movie that does not need to start with a description, to get the last qualification. <br /> <br /> "We Win!" ... errrr ....... no you do not
