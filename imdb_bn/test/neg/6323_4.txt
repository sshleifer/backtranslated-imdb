George Segal lives with his elderly and barbarian mother. He has many jokes about dementia like his Alzheimer's and most of them are not funny, although there have been some funny moments (and nude park scenes and old people running out of the house) here and there. Initially, Segal tried to kill his mother because she is difficult to live with him because she is a selfish person. Will Quite vs. Wicked Quote vs Rodrower Comedy, where he tried repeatedly to kill the unwanted girl, became frustrated - it was not the whole voice of the picture that was very bad. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the effort of making a fool movie for blaming anyone in Rainer. I have a special place in my heart for the benefit of Eddie and his dead mother, eating route and Kakakurias - movies about death which dare to despair. The problem here, where, where is POPPA? There are some fun moments, but it has a lot of plane and the overall product is amazing bland. It is really difficult to make fun of topics such as gay rape, lawlessness and preference. I can read "Silver Guides in Movies" that it is considered a ritual movie, although I can not see anyone who just wants to see it.
