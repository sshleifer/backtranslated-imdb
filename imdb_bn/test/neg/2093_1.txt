I can not believe anyone let this lonely light star this lonely star. I never got 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This should be one of my worst movies. Some pictures they are very good so bad. This is that it went so far so that it is so terrible that it is terrible. I was not expecting it, it was a low budget, bandwagon jumping, a movie movie rehearsed, but it still came down to my expectation level. Even TV movies have high quality prices. <br /> <br /> There were very poor poor influences, threatening conversations, terrible acting and totally vague plots. Who has cursed him and why, the 6-inch snake has turned into 15 foot snakes, has anyone ever heard of a highly poisonous snake or a python? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? So much promise, someone delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments you believed that this image is valuable for the past five minutes. It's not even a rental price. Stay and watch a low-budget TV movie, you'll enjoy it a lot. <br /> <br /> Why is it made? Oh yes, embarrassingly cash on the Internet events that SOAP You are ashamed of the Malachi Brothers, you shame!
