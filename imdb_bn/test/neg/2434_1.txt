I was a serious mistake in Disney's part. First off, do not have to pass the "Emperor School" to become the emperor of Kuzco! That did not happen before. Secondly, new voices do not sound like basics. Very poor redo And when I enjoy the movie New Grove of the movie, the New School is simply stupid. All the jokes are the same, and from many movies. Plot unheard of, always Yzma (how do you spell it?) Try to become Empress, Kuzco stopped him, learning to become a good person or Kuzco etc. I think Kuzco is annoying with her constant complaints and questions. She is a spoiled brat and it bothers me. I do not think your time is worth five minutes, much less than half an hour.
