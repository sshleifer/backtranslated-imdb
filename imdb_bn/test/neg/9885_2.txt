For me, the best thing about this movie was that Brian Dick played Raffe and made me. Rife and all his good looks were made to enjoy the movie, although I started to cry and scream. I have not seen a hot man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is it really that. They picked up the beautiful story written by Ante Curtis Claus and threw it. I, in my all-pervading spontaneous glory, what was lost, what changed, and all the other mistakes with the movie. Sit tight and go here: <br /> <br /> - Obviously, Rafie Estrid and Gabriel's son, and apparently, are not children of Astrud like Ullf books. And, I remember from the book, there were Ruf and Astroen LOVERS. <br /> <br /> - Astrid is clearly Blond, in contrast to the highlighted red hair in the book. I believe that the book says that he looked more like Fox than WOLF. And the film also shows that Astrid Vivian's aunt. <br /> <br /> - Where did Excel go? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vivian would go to Eden because of his poem 'Wolf Change'. However, according to the film, Eden beat his father and fled and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. This made me go to 'what to f **'. <br /> <br /> - There are no 'Kelly' movies. Where was Kelly in the movie. Book Kelly hated Vivian too. And they broke up after the date of Aden. Vivian even get tips on the book and trash his room. <br /> <br /> - Gabriel carries a striking resemblance to the Colombian drug lord in the film. And he sounds like one too. His performance was very good, but his face threw me down. <br /> <br /> - There is no father in Vivan movie. Her father and mother and two siblings died. Yet in the book, when he came home one night, sitting on the sofa after the war with Asteride on his head, ESME Gabriel. And Vivian has no siblings. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> - Aden Vivan takes it for granted. This really got me. He killed Rafi in the wonderful church, fought Vivian and shot Eden to protect him from other wolves without him, so they tried to find the drug and then they tried to leave the city together. WTF?! In the book, when Eden escapes wolf, crys like a dog, throws stuff on him, so he is scared and goes out of the window. Then he made a story that he tried to break up with him, and he threw a chair outside the window. It is not acceptable to me. <br /> <br /> - Aden wants to run away with her. In the book, he does not want to do anything with Vivan after returning for him. No he can keep his mouth lovingly and he can control it. She weeps like a woman because she is in her sketch. <br /> <br /> and the final rage ... that gave me three best friends around and I'm hit on our seats: <br /> - In this movie, Eden and Vivian have escaped together, and Vivan Gabriel killed. As he shot him. Gabriel died. * The book * does not kill Vivian Gabriel only, I believe they will end together. For example, he does not end up with Aden, he ends up with Gabriel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> is a terrific shock; I am ashamed. The book was not really hard to follow. Disney is a random h! Can you use school, why did the director get a random h school? <br /> <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie, I liked the book, it is unfortunate that it does not follow a bit. Rafi (played by Brian Dick) was sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did an excellent job because I give it a 2 (just as the top of this review state). And, they keep a poem from SteppenWolf. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
