Detective Burt Williams is in search of the infamous P.O killer for nearly three years. Burt's daughter, Chris Williams, took over an FBI agent killing with his partner San Michaels. Burt reluctantly resigned from the case and retired. In the next seven months, "Po Killer" his murderer continued to rage, until Chris discovered that the killer used the Internet chat room to catch him. He is logged as Enbele Lee and is quickly captured by Po Killer. Find out the suffering of Burt and release his daughter before it's too late. Amateur and greatest branded blurred blurry with no mystery and some nasty gore. This act is utterly horrific, the characters are painfully stupid and killers are not deadly. So far I saw the worst Indie Harry Flicks 10 out of 3.
