I think many years ago, Michael Douglas wanted to keep his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in romantic films because he thought that his wife had all the products. He has no doubt, but not in this picture. A huge waste of time, no stories, no character development, no chemistry, NADA. We do not expect this car to be a boring and a big disappointment. Even the whole movie, I did not see torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones clearly taught how to do kitchen work, turn around, present a dish, but it is not a food network, it does not have to learn here, and once she has appeared in her opponent, perhaps chemistry of romantic interest, where chemistry was involved. The poor slab on the second floor of his building tried to connect all pliers and there was no development of the character. Her sister was told because of disappointment that there was intimateity there. The sister's daughter was plotted and plotted with something that just wanted to draw you here, no. Just a waste of time during the movie. Promoters must work with all the teasers to lure them into all these networks to establish this deficient film. Do not spend a dime, saying.
