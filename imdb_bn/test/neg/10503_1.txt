OK, usually I am fascinated by Z.D. Some of the talented actors, directors, writers, etc. in this movie If they want to get that talent unfortunately for them, they will have to associate with crappy people to make their films. But there are at least one subject in some Z. movies that can be significant about them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... 'Wow, knock off a blade. 'Believe me, if this movie can be in that label, it has made a good film. <br /> <br /> I was a little bit of the most terrible acts of my life. Master Kao was bad, I think some of my brain neurons are trying to understand his acting. I am still trying to understand his expression and why he will raise his voice in talking ... I am sure to add nautical effect ... but it was not a clear reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Purple Cape People beat Hero for about 30 seconds, but he was so bad that he actually felt that he was afraid of war. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist and chief villain did well. The main hero (Derek Washington) actually knew martial arts.
