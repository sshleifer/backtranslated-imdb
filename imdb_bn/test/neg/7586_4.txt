I usually do not waste my time criticizing a vain movie like this. However, I stopped working this week, so I have enough time to cast into meaningless filth. To get started, let me tell you that I often enjoy non-mainstream, non-mainstream movies. (Click on my user's profile for supporting movies.) It says that there are several bad films released in the countries outside the United States Trust, I've tortured hundreds of them. "Lying in Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is an impressive, non-stop show of moral distortion. This image has provided some classic ethics that has the same level as Kim Ki-Doo's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women are actually enjoying being raped; 2. Rape should be glorified, appreciated, and respected; 3. It is uncomfortable to rape a woman of your choice, because when you "work" she will start to like it and reach orgasm; 4. If you are raping a wife, make sure that you have blackmailed her rapist for a lot of money, but if she does not pay, she will compensate the wife for her repayment; 5. If your wife is raped, then rape the role of the rapeist next day, make sure to screw her and downgrade, "Do you like him?"; 6. If you are a husband, then take a rapist; 7. After personal rape, make friendship with your rapists and confront them whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can someone take care of these characters in their true mind? They are nothing more than a bunch of frustrated people, who do not live their life in a vain manner, but rather revive their meaninglessness and support each other. Although I do not misunderstand me. I am very capable of enjoying films that portray lifestyle and ethics that contradict myself. "Ichi The Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whippers" (1999) Very interesting illustrations of Saad-Mashokism. "Curious Circus" (2005) A very distorted game on child sexual abuse. "Marriage A Crazy Things" (2002) Traditional marriage is a serious complaint. Even religious-oriented movies like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) have also entertained me at the event. The difference is that in those movies, some interesting psychological content and character have evolved, where "Lost in Beijing" is practically nonexistent. <br /> <br /> It contains unreasonable psychological people on this planet, but without its own behavior, there are some types of character development or psychology, you end up with a cosmic manifestation of abominable behavior. Why, okay, Bing Bing finally favors friendship and care for her? Why does the wife of barbarism take her behavior unconditionally? Filmmakers do not bother to talk to us. Even obvious contact with the rich and poor classes is undoubtedly conjectured and ultimately it is acting as a mere situational welfare. Feel very bland and forgettable after it all subsides half of the dirty opening. <br /> <br /> Other critics seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. For which you can not choose the bread because it has not been properly developed. It does not seem that this movie has complex characters because it is not explicitly defined. On the contrary, the reasons are not explicitly defined because we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is rarely a positive feature of this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> You can place it on the trash side like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time It Has Hacked" (2001), "Universal" (2002) and earlier "Bad Guy".
