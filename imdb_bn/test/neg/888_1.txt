I saw many bad movies in my life. Date movie That was bad. But this is ... it's right ... it's not good. House party 4 worst movie It's as simple as that. It's basically the Feris Bueller with black people. Oh, and it's not funny. It's boring What the hell Chris Stokes can be a superstar on the BEET, but he is a fool. She can not write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I would like to mention him as a black, less known Uwe Bowl. Uwe Boll's pictures are funny, except if you know what I want to say. You can invite some friends, Dark in the Dark in Pop, and have a great time to have fun and eat with your friends. Just like Chris Stokes, if you invite friends to see House Part 4 with you, no one laughs. Even prejudiced tokens are not black people or uneducated jokes. I'm serious, I do not smile once throughout this whole movie. Terrible acting, and the movie looks like a bad indie film. What was the budget for this movie? 5 thousand dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie just sucks; Do not waste your time with this shit. Annoying
