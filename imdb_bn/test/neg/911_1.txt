Rob people certainly ate the whole budget, but I could not blame him for running the money. Even he must agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filing, editing, direction, dialogue, set, makeup, writing, casting (especially young girl and delivery child psychiatrist), and the story was the worst. I have not seen such an awesome movie. Pass it one for any other rental selection, or find out the comments on the TV with the shouts. Dead silent should be silent for all time.
