The Greek locale was very nice for the parts of the film, and photography got all my votes and it was about my quadrangle for this movie. All the characters that I have seen were found in American culture often found in equatorial archetypes and shallow and unwilling. Susan Sarandan and Gena Rodlands are easy to see but I find that their characters are so disrespectful and impossible for many other reasons. When C ena Rowwall sings in a party, I wonder how this woman might think herself as a level star. I was tempted to hit the MUTE button ending up singing. Molly Ringwell was by himself and the character of Raul Julia was so impressive that he was suddenly vague. The film was too much for my favorite time and I could not even sit through it at gun time.
