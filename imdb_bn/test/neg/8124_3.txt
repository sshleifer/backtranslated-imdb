I still think Frog Baseball was first promoted on MTV. A bit weird, weirdly, the cartoon captures the stupid thing that every child is growing up in America. I am now wondering how I burned a troubling grassroot using a glassing wire, but at the time it was interesting for some reason. In the 1980's we all knew "stoners" These children wore Iron Maiden T-shirts in school, they had long tall, immense torches and at least two inches tall was more than anyone else, because they were either grade or two blank. We laughed at them because they were stupid and even stupid. So Beavis & Co was easy to understand because we already knew from them that none of us had even theirs. If the generals like me had been able to embrace the 1980s decade over and the granular movement of the 1990s, Beeves and Co was a peculiar post-modern song for us. We are not curious if we do not have a game like Beviss and Koe. It was just an inside joke that we all got terrible but we got it.
