Sorry randy I love your comedy but in this case you really keep a 'golden turkey' egg. <br /> <br /> This plot was slim than a layer of my skin, acting more wood than a giant redwood and I think the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The NAT LAMP played the same character on European holidays, but much better. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of contacting Cherry Chase and Beverly D'Angelo for this thought. If so, they surely knew what they were doing when they turned their share. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Griswolds and Randy Quaid can not make Chevy and Beverly better than anyone who praised them as a complementary one before them. Movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
