Occasionally when I see this movie, I start thinking that those who made this movie were in drugs. What would have been wrong in this movie, I would call you a bad plot, bad jokes. Bad acting and flat-out characters are all bad. </ br> <br /> This film is about two-bit scam hostels about Worm Vargas, who has been able to survive 24 hours to keep the German hunter alive to live up to $ 50,000. Now think of the ways of pest. Think before killing this predator. <br /> <br /> I know your thoughts "What is this hell?" Another Wannabe Ace Ventura is trying to get the money. This plot is truly playful and confusing, it changes the plot of the story and you are lost during filming. <br /> <br /> For this funny scene, it was straightforward to me, oh yeah, I smiled a few times, but with a loud and a little aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly to kiss Got it Dry and flat You do not know much about the main character insects, they all know that this is a boring scam hustler but it does not change its image or just might be a little intelligent. That's he crazy and wants to go back to Germany. Actually you will be surprised if this man is on an island to go to Germany. The hunter's son Himel fare well, but not much. He is really a coward and snake- he is terrified for the reasons. He is standing beside his father and insects. <br /> <br /> <br /> Not acting nly there is no memorable perforamces but just above. For example, John Legizomo is at the top with performance and Jeffrey Jones, who does not fit in his role, who plays the same thing to the hunter, but offers the same stereootic performance. Alongside it is not enough just for rest or just not at the top. <br /> <br /> The overall bad comedy you'll find for $ 2.00 on K-Mart.
