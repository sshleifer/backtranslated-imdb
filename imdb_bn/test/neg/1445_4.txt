I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Then how many times have I seen it. My only complaint is that it's too small. "Strangeland" will be a whole piece of horror industry at two hours. It stands, running only one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Ex-twisted sister member De Snyder wrote Shockfast set in the small town of Colorado in 1998, produced and starred. He starred Carlton Hendrix, a mad psychologist who loves psychological thinking and close-death experiences on human evolution. Hendrix is ​​no pushover, he pumped up to six feet "modern primitive". Anyone tattooed the extreme and penetrated their body. When it first appeared in the film, it's a really awesome sight. <br /> <br /> Hendrix's chief hobby shared his "spiritual awakening" with his hijacked prey. He goes to the internet chat room named "Captain Howi" and then invites people to his home. They believe they are going to be a team. Instead, they find themselves in pain and pain home. Hendricks closed their eyes and mouth and tortured them by sticking the blades and hooks in many parts of the body. If it seems to be sick, it is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Gauge simply does not manage to save him, but arrests Hendrix. Four years later, Hendrix was released from the kidnappings of an entirely rehabilitated community from an emotional institution. Rodnec, a team led by Freddy Krüger, actor Robert England, decided to kill him. They fail and Hendrix returns back to her old self. <br /> <br /> I'm going to leave you in the rest of the film, the only conclusion is satisfactory and you will be left in shivers. Without Schneider's exception, acting is not very good, but it is effective. The direction is right, too. "Strangeland" has some ridiculous parts and they are very funny. I like the soundtrack, if it loves rock it is extraordinary and worth buying. Overall, this movie is worth watching this movie. If you love low budget horror films with a sense of humor, check it out. You probably like it.
