Wow, this version was hard to see! Any other reviews have been mentioned this, I saw the public domain version was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was closed in about 10 seconds - that means the dialog and action did not match. So, something good happened before you saw it - a very confusing offer! The worst is where you hear the gun shot and then only hits the man and dies on his taxi. <br /> <br /> Although it seriously assaulted the film, it also makes the dialog conveniently - and there is a serious error as well. The conversation was just awkward - often distributed almost without any transition or feeling. As a review, it was like watching a high school play. This part was understandable, the word was a new medium, but the film's dialogue was worse than the other 1929 films - really bad. And, like many of the first of these sound films, the film was too much talk - unfortunate and too much melodramatic language and not too much action. And you'll be thinking about the headline titled "The Racketter" that there will be some steps !! However, it's really a sad romance - with very little steps <br /> <br /> The image finds that Carroll Lombard is straddled with an alcoholic musician. He stole himself to try to steal himself - and the coincidence, Robert Armstrong, came to his aid. When Armstrong tricks him on the card, he covers for him and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet - and naturally he is in the process. The problem is that once screwed sobers up, he wants very tall and he must choose between them. Wow ... a restored drunk or mobster ... talk about a great possibility of a couple! Overall, I saw the lousy print rate considered a little difficult. However, if you ignore it, there are many problems due to the movie's dialog and excessive fiction. And ... it was very sad to boot.
