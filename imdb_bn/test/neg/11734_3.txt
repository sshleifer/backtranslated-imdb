The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely considered as the best work of Alfred Hittak and of course, in my opinion, one of the best movies of all time. Decide to make a shot film by shot remake, so it's a little confusing. <br /> <br /> The original constructor was neutral, so there was a lot of Cast in this remake. Vince Von as Norman Bates was not a good choice for leadership. He is a pretty boy pumps too much and is not very believable as Bates. I can imagine doing better work in the role of actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Tarturo. Anna Hare has done a credible job as a Marine Crane, but psychologically she compares her to leaning the jacket. Julian Moore is a much better actress than her and Vigo Montesan is playing her role only. The best of this new cast is William H. Messi as a personal detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant has done an acceptable job, he can not create the way he made the hitcoat suspicious. And why does he change the scene at home? Basically, the atmosphere is dark and moist and closed, but in this version, it is like setting in a brightly illuminated laboratory. And I think the original version of black and white photography has a specific advantage over it. Another flaw may be that most filmmakers have seen the original and know what is going on. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, if not break, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
