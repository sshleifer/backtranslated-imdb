Hello - I usually love movies. I was 19, I saw a lot and dislike only one or two. This one, the second it ended, it was a ridiculous horror movie because I had to pull out my sister (who wanted to see it) out by outsiders and I came out because I smiled into tears out of smile. <br /> <br /> Why was it terrible: - All the cows were woody, especially the boring men had a stroller - no letter was unique or compelling, perhaps without the main Coyote Dog - Surveillance against the quotes is just ridiculous - Funny 'moments have become just a sequence of repetitive and lasting work - the theme of working together, which should have appeared in the end, it was no exception Order Instead, people can get the impression: Well, I have to take all of this on myself, and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to take me back without my knowledge - all the moments like lion king (described below) and even open for a children's film There, even <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... it is in every way that lion is transformed into a throne. Parents are killed by Quotes. Heinas, Doug, Lead Quoyet, equal to the equals) The farm is in chaos, Odyss (Cow, though primarily as Simba) want to play almost and are surprised that his father's death, believed that it was his fault (although in this movie, It was his fault), faced with the quetts and an ass shook, after which Doug asked him to leave and left Odyssey to save a little chicken and his friend Decided to person. Up (of course, by surprise, he knew he would not help him). Other things taken from Leon King: Star signs are going on around, fathers refer to stars / signs in a mysterious loving way, probably how Father Father Ben Oddis had seen and cared for him, and how Oedis love interest in the end. Give birth and have similar experiences. Born at the end? Happy God, what the hell ... and even similar types of music, which finally seems to be caught up to the end because it is completely different from all previous songs. <br /> <br /> True, this is the first movie. Never seen where I was ever rooting for bad guys - I do not understand other people, so far. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time to see this. The kids do not see it, and watch lion king watch again. That is, or take them to see Ant Bully, which was creative and artistic.
