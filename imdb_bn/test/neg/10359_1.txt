I've read positive comments in this movie. I certainly took this idea to give some good news to the people who came to this movie because it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I have always seen the whole movie, despite the quality or lack of it, explains why I have seen this whole movie, but I do not think I was laughing at the time of this film. The trick was mostly very bad, but when the joke had some promises, the delivery was off. If you like it, you must stop clay because you have to store 5 or 6 brain cells released. This movie had a poor script, bad acting, poor direction, weak plot ... virtue was nothing and was not entertaining. If you do not see this movie, do not.
