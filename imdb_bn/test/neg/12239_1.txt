I'm sorry, you know why. I feel annoyed to see this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to watch this movie, and it was not yet fully satisfied to see it (I left it for about 20 minutes ... expecting God to make me feel comfortable at least for a moment.) Now mostly movies, even These bad things ... When I see them, there can be a small part of the movie, sometimes a curiosity I feel some pleasure because of the joke or the good line ... On the other hand, I made myself completely uncomfortable and crazy all the time, especially when I wasted it. It was badly written, badly operated, badly shot, and certainly played badly ... <br /> <br /> Please, do not see this movie for love of humanity, even some of your people want to say every movie Has done ... not just ...
