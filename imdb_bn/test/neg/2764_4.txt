Someone can make this movie teach people that there is a difference between "presenting multiple twists" and "screwing audiences". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the hole in the plot; Whenever they can not find a way out in or out of the scene, they simply say that she has returned to her past "or" she is now bathing from it ", and they think everything is explained. This film is a dishonest fraud and The last 20 minutes has become a complete lung. (* 1/2)
