Like most critics of this particular movie, I really do not want to say that most of the Cynthia Rathrak fan. But when I saw that this film was Fred Williamson and Robert Foster (both great actors), I just had to see the film. Williamson Decca Smith, who is a terrorist to scrub the toilet with a toothbrush and even worse than the captain's (Robert Forster) directive with the Cynthia team. Foster is always observable, it's just a cry of shame that the movie itself is so scrawny and retarded. This is one of the lowest horrible villains committed to Cellulite. Williamson will return to Dakota character in a few more films, later "Down An Dirty". <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T & A; Mary Kappar jumps <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> I saw it: Showtime extreme
