I made the mistake of buying this after collecting comic book inspired movies. Even in 6 dollars it was very expensive. I think there may be some camps in the fun, a "so bad" it is probably a good idea, I was wrong. I've seen it a long time ago and do not remember any of it. Now I know why. I was disturbed by my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. I do not work for any of the grrrll strengths, punk attitudes and unreasonable humor but any of the Tank Girl. The script is bad, you do not care about the characters and humor is quite lame without some fun one-liners. Special effects or locations are replaced by poor or often comic panels or animations, which are far worse than live-action. It seems like they do not have the means to shoot cold things, and the drawings have been enjoyed, although they may be cool (but the sensor-animated feature is good for tank girls that I think would be). The action scenes were impressive but not in a fun B-movie way. The tank itself was impressive or dynamic, although it was sorted interestingly. In fact, the best action scenes involved in the tank were animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs of light ork, hall and artists known as portisehd, but they are not suitable for most of the time instead of developing in the atmosphere. Once they break into a ridiculous song and dance number that was only intelligent and awesome. I think that when fully tuned. I feel the tank girl acting by Laurie Petty, trashy shows the broken part, but her "attitude" and sometimes rarely reverses the funny repertoire, it is the most rogue and the patron than the worst comic book characters. The Jute operated by Naomi Watts is probably the only saving grace in film and how this inconsistent actress is involved in this zombie is amazing. Malcolm McDowell was not too bad playing his usual villain role. It may be a civilized film for somebody, but please consider that it is really different from original independent comics and the original makers are frustrated with the movie (see entry for Tank Girl in Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
