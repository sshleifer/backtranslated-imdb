This picture tells the true story of black slaves who found their own mountain peak communion as free men in 17th century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this movie - as a film - terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack period is not music or tribal music. It is the Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980's.

Rather than calling upon the mysteries of African religion and spiritual beliefs, they just think of the movie as cheap. They are totally incredible, and I just do not understand the meaning of neutrality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For this society, as shown in the movie, Kibbut in one part, a group Afro-Pop Festival Moreover, the black actor is almost embarrassed to see the director of talented singers and dancers who want to be just happy to be director. He has portrayed daily life as a genre of dance industry, where free slaves rolled themselves around bright colors and strains of 80 'pop music'.

If they need food then they have the right. <br /> <br /> I am glad that I have learned about this episode in history, but I have been relieved of the relief that a movie with such low production value and today's super trend The businesses will be not be today.
