Again, I think the planet is the only person on Earth who was able to criticize Japanese films before the 1970s. "Fires On The Plain" (1959) is one of the unexpected lines of "classic", which is appreciated by all types of praise. No seemingly good reason As much as I like to concentrate on all the personalities of this movie and to psychology, those who have such terrible taste, it is often impossible to make a reason why anyone would think that such a badly created fluff should be declared as "best composition". I think it's really ridiculous that fans of derivative "classic" such as "Place on the plain" focus on so much attention in filmmaking ("the quality of masterpieces like scripting, acting, camera-work etc"). Always the most respected "classic" looks like this is a very shortage of values ​​too. For example, among the most embarrassing of the filmmakers is a compulsory oral exposition involving the audience, where the audience originally explains everything to the audience, even the creation scenes are completely artificial. Most surprisingly, "Fire On the Plain" uses the most impressive technique of this first scene. <br /> <br /> Following a funny title, the following vain dialogue invades the viewer, "Why did you understand the situation? We came here to pursue the unit to strengthen the unit, we lost our two-thirds of the people." Our gunfight was in transit. We tried to reach the airport at Bourwan, but it was impossible without artillery. Gi across the valley to a fanout. You know that. "So why, exactly, he already knows what a character speaking to another character? Oh yes, okay, the makers of this film are very lazy about more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, these facts will actually happen in a quality movie, or worse, it will include a character dialog that has no knowledge of these facts. Hack, an opening summary of the viewer's given paragraph form, was even better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> These examples of making poor quality films are split into the "plain on fire" point where this image seems to have been written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the main character stumbles on some skeleton covered in Japanese clothing. Instead of doing natural things ?? Oh i do not know Provide a sad approach, the character blurts out "Japanese soldiers". Thanks friends, but I figured that one out for myself might have figured out. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this movie is associated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scenario involves a pair of boots. This picture. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of boots worn. Someone would think that this type of search is totally in vain, but it proves that the soldiers' boots are in a worse position, so they wear boots and have boots in the back. Fine, I get the point. Are the soldiers really shaped? Starting with their obvious boots is definitely a true emphasis. The scene was ridiculous, but I was ready to give it up until the second army came! Did you see, he's wearing the soldier's wearing boots and notice ?? Get ready, because here comes ?? That's his boot super boot knit boots! Lucky people, she takes up wearing worn boots and leaves her super duper to boot the boot. But you see, not all of these ?? Because thirad soldier then comes! He found boots wearing the previous soldiers' super dip and wear their own super dip and boot them together. Since both pairs suck, he pulls them on both sides and as a sunny man, he walks barefoot. At this moment, I was ready to throw my television in the window with my living room. This feeling is made out of heavy interference, overdramaticism, and the foremost absurdity to create bad films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a lead character asks someone, " Hey, are you dead? " The person actually answers "yes" if he actually kicks the bucket. I would be the first to quintessential posterchild for fancy feedback, which condemned the performance of the main actor subpar. I laughed at the head of his head, where his head faced this stupid, stupid expression and returned to his face. <br /> <br /> This trivial Fluff piece has received an IMDB average rating of 8.4, although it is the most authentic "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003), which gets only 7.5 percent of the stupid idols. And some people actually misguide themselves to think that "ATOTS" does not understand the meaning. Well, every movie can not have its chest boots completely super-super-super-duper.
