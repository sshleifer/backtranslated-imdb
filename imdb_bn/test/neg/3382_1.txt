All right, so when a friend of mine told me that she had to point out MM2 and MM3, I thought, Hack, I want to test Manchester man and see what it looks like, maybe I can take part in it, but when I I popped it in my DVD player and did not try to do anything bad for the first 45 minutes, bad, I mean the terrible boring from the lean ass Com comedy thinks of his funny thoughts, how the director spent on helpless desert journey, I came to the conclusion that there are no sources of what these boys are doing and missed the boat with a long shot. This story may be slightly different than the usual BS, which you see in the blockbuster / Hollywood video shelf by entering the lions gate, but they must have compromised it. Why boring bad acting and bad trick so much time and effort in shooting, why road trip is not short and keep more of the movie plot. Mayab's writing was so bad that many of his films would have to be cut or the director could not shoot horribly and cow-like, so that for a normal 84 minutes you could find the filler ???? Above all, and I'm going to be easy here, because a friend of mine repeatedly had a red faucet in the scene, while chasing his three rounds outside the street, his pole was crushed, I tried to give it at least 1 star, and the gore / murder scene was bad No, again, they tried. Too bad, Lion Gate could create a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. I do not recommend to rent it, maybe you can find a cut-down version where the movie starts from a hit hiker scene. Shit!
