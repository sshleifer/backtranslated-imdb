I am not willing to vote for this shit single star but IMDB is not rated as rating rating ... The worst movie I've ever seen .. The story of the movie. The predecessor crashed into the earth. 2. An alien and some mouth huggers are released and they start killing humans. 3. A hunter comes to earth and he begins to kill aliens and humans. 4. Then a human jet drops a bomb and kills the human, alien and predator. 5. Some people find hunter cans canon. 6. The last instructors should consider refunding the viewer back. If you still want to watch this movie, download it from some torrent sites and say thank you for saving your money. All the movies are depicted in some dark corners of the world, you see even dark shades of the workspace. Too much violence .. I was not expecting it from a Fox movie
