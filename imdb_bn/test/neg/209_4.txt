Dylan, Fishport, Reno should be combined for more efficiency because it slides into BB-Division and can be done with a name actor and a lot of small budget, since 2 heavy armored trucks and a waste ware can not be too much coasted. Since the authors were not able to come up with a smart hayst plan, they targeted the drama of the situation, but there was not much for it to exploit. Fishblog and Reno do not bring anything in this film except the media board, they are only expensive advertisements. Dillon is okay, but this park was walking. The main character, Toy Hack's choices are fairly vague and the final "prize" is a good child. Time, money, actors and so on waste.
