When I listen to my parents, I see this (after I have gone 10 minutes in film), they have no idea what they are going on. When "Charles Dickens" looked at the camera, I hope half of him turned into a monster (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie for various reasons: one, it is impossible slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only speak up to 10%, and the characters are weakly launched. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like many conversations, but no work, horror acting, Chase smile and over the same music / sound effects over, then this is the movie for you ... <br / > <br /> 1/10 - Completely awesome <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
