At the beginning I said that I am not a very artistic person and I do not get new art. That said, this film is absolutely crazy, and my opinion is not crazy in a good way. In a series of very short stories combined with a series of short stories depicted in black and white, Avida is a film that can look at their modern art and says, "Wow, I feel the pain and emotions of this painting." The only reason I gave this picture to 3 out of 10 because I actually managed to laugh at some of the parts, although the smile in the film's fierce frenzy. I do not have any idea what the characters were going to do, by throwing two chairs in the chair. I will not recommend this picture to anyone.
