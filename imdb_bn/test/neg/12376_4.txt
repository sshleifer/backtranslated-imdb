When I was about 12 years old, I saw this movie. I think the most horrific scene is to eat helplessly big birds from the parasut outside the air. fear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A happy resolution in the death of the professor and the monster's last death. As a 12-year-old and predictable plot I did not care much for the romantic angle. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Done. . I sat at the time and took notice. Since screenlitter is making stories, it can be as scary as possible and not from a disciplined formula. There are no rules.
