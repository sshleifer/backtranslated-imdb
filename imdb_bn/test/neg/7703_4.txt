Start by saying to me that I was a huge fan of Abbey Hoffman and stole this book and steals this urinal check. Also a big Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a secluded lollipop, which produced a very PG version of Abby Hoffman. The director did not take any opportunity to make Abhi Hoffman attractive to this movie. He was disappointed with Stu Albert as FIL ing IT Cartoon Chasercutter without being firm, he was Berkeley Professor for Christians. All right, they did a terrible casting for Anita Hoffman, cutting a terrible job for Jerry Robin's character. I guess the news that the movie has seen in the books of the ABI or its books is not correct. The movie just does not fit and makes me feel bad. Oh yes and the theater The worst voice I've ever heard about Richard Nixon. This is some of the movies I have ever rented that I could not sit on all the roads, because I was passionate about the isolated band of AB Hoffman and the EPG, and this film was very poorly done. And it hurt me that when people watch a movie about EPG they will see a terrible adaptation and will not get the true realization. Instead they can get a hollywood program. <br /> <br />
