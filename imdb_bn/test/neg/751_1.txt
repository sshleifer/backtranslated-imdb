10 out of 10 ratings could give out? Because it deserves one. Although I'm not very fond of Jane Austen's books, I was sitting with these two women. Well, at least we had a big smile about how bad this picture was. Robert Hardy was the only actor with no effect on the whole thing, though he was generally more like this (though he was as bad as William Shatner). But it was not enough to save this stinger from laziness. It is often difficult to separate the order of the girl's dreams from what is "in reality", and there are many holes left in the story which can mean what is happening to you. A lot of loose ends and felt like "tune again next week" in the end. The main actress wanted to be very cruel and funny, heroine, played as a very foxy-look and firm protagonist and music director's Hippie Girl sounds like some cheap cheap new-petit project (I mean with saxophone screaming some spacesy operatic ladies Mixed?). So, conclusion, I recommend you to light up a DVD budget and order as soon as possible. Especially if you are like frustration
