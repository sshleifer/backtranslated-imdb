Although I can see the potential release of this film through this plot, I mostly thought that the painful long nature of the scene structure was much more than the audience asked. As such, sometimes "your father has died today", the huge pit of screenwriting makes this mother's comments more difficult than understanding. <br /> <br /> It got first place in the ear in 2001. Consider a shock Perhaps the French were hungry for the silence of that year, and were frustrated to do something sad like this movie. As long as I could keep the viewer uncomfortable as much as possible, I could understand the lengthy scenes, but when the inability to relate to the main character matches it, it is far away for me to keep the story away from the point. <br /> <This is the silent film's only protagonist and it is a film that does not expect any contentment after watching a movie. I liked the movie "Transposing" or "Recom for For Dream" - which was a lot more annoying but at least showed the audience editing and pacing. After the scene, I became so tired to see the slow and painful silence of these teachers that I was fatigued - and I really wanted to like this movie every moment.
