This Hollywood does not believe on how the film (not) and how a great example of a textbook panders his elder name. The Christian character is completely rewritten, Noah-Opposition Noah encounters his own military unit, Michael's story changes significantly, and the end result is reduced to book power and terrible beauty. Due to the ability of the resonate movie (words and images) so powerful in your brain, even I did not even seen it, the desire. I would rather have left the book with the impression. The book can be written today, it is honest and bold that. Movies, no. My suggestion: movie skip; Read the book.
