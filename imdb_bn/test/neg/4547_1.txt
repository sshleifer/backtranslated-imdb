When I decided to try a movie about the genre Junkie ("Creonoid"), I did not expect it at all. It's exactly what I got, and then even less. In addition to a special lack of special effects (squibs?) And a serious lack of acting talent, "The Chiling" I've never seen a movie in the worst bad script game. At 45 minutes I had to stop the tape several times to repair my intellectual damage. <br /> <br /> Also, the collection of letters is so ridiculous in the formula and one dimensional: the corrupt doctor; Her assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know she is her "assistant" because she has repeatedly mentioned her title); Widely traded by Blair's character, the widow businessman recently developed a heart-shaped heart. His criminal son; Blair's alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boyfriend, whom we introduced in the most adapted use of a flashback; And, of course, rough, tough, bearded protector guard who become heroes. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the preservative fluid that uses some Cryogenic Labs on the body is highly conductive, naturally catastrophic occurs when all the lab containers do not end without a unique sequence of events during a lightning storm (Halloween night, no less) . Like the zombies for yourself, if you go around aluminum foil suites to watch people in green latex masks, "The Chilling" movie for you. Zombie action is very weak at its best; The process of preliminary killings of the body is on the shoulders to catch people and lean towards death. Most zombies fight the trader and security guard, in which there is a very suspicious view of liquid nitrogen re-submission of untouchability. I tell you, the steel mills scene in "T2" did not find anything in "Chiling", so that the enemy was depicted frozen in his tracks. <br /> <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair got stuck in the middle of this piece of drip is really a mystery. Indeed, his career was not in the skyscraper of 80 seconds (sadly), but this movie is a shame for him. The script does not even have the right to keep it in a good use. The way his character is given is "Here They Come", "Do Something", "Hurry!" The only thing I can understand is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on the food ration in this movie. The hero Gregory Adams himself played Dan Haggerty. In this film, he faces a tough competition from his beard and safety dog, and he is a good creator to improve them both. <br /> <br /> The only terrifying part of "Chiling" is an introduction that presents the elements of the creative and proposes that "the image you are going to see can happen in your own community". When I was counting, some names were repeated on closing credits, and then suddenly I saw LukasFilm to credit. Fortunately, it was only for the production of movie sound. 1/10
