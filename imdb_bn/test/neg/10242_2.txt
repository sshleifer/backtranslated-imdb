The strange thing about Galaxina is that it is extremely bad, although it is not. The strange thing is that despite being the greatest, it is not funny. Very bad movies are funny comedians of their own special brands - they can tell you secret, their success. But Galaxina is completely different - it's the worst nightmare of MSST 3, a bad movie that deliberately * and * unexpected humor equals equally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Sometimes it's a timing question; Sometimes it's a good idea to work out bad (human * * may be ridiculous, but it was not); Sometimes it seems like some mix up in the cutting room, with the last punchline on the fly; And sometimes jokes are just bad joke. Bad movies get their smile from such unintentional snafus. It's hard to finalize why Galaxina does not get any smiles counting Some mistakes with some deliberate humor (some not really honest) are somewhat wrong with the strange humor in this film. This is a very bad movie whose very badness is not generally the quality of the release. This is my experience completely unique.
