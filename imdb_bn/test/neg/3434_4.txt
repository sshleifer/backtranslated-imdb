So I got this from the rental shop where I work before it's released (release 8/21), it's seen today, and now I'm stupid. They have a decent movie here, but they screwed it in some painfully obvious ways. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Severe" divided by reflection. It was a lot more like a straight comedy glue lock, stock and two smoking barrels. <br /> <br /> I like to like it, because I think that Krisinski is funny and wants to see him better. The story was not bad, just not too original. But the guidance (and a lot of acting) was terrible. I swore that the people have difficulty facing the shot and whatever they go with it. <br /> <br /> When their gunmen corrected another character and told them that their "dirty Harry" gun is no one, their apathy is displayed. 357 magnum but a .45 (it was, everyone knows, a .44 magnum). See if you like 1- really like John Cricinski 2- Want to see a low budget (and bad-headed) movie or 3- You have too much time (this I!)
