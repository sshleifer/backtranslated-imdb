Claire Hawk (Caspar Van Diane) and his men were attacked by a bunch of vampires, where Slayer started in the South American rain forest, rarely managed to escape with their lives. Going forward six months later, Huq was asked to look at the Colonel Waiver (Linda Carter) who told him that the vampire has shown something else, and his ex-wife and his sister Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) has gone. In the Beatles study campaign, he asked Huq to take a team of soldiers in South America and to officially assist Captain Greaves (Kevin Groves) and his men, at the same time, Lauri was not officially sought and killed. The vampires who decided to leave the civil and civilized world from the cave ... were edited, written and directed by Kevin Vanahook, it is still another badly-made scientific-channel channel which is not only very good at respect. The humorous script is as far as I could see, there is nothing for it, it is one of the modern vampire films that decides to choose the 'traditional' vampire movie rules and choose if these vampires are trying to use it. There are heart and fangs but at the same time can freely walk around the sunlight and they do not sleep in the coffin. The film moved along a reasonable speed but it's all too dull, soft and lifeless. The story is poor and only stupid, terrible to the characters, forgotten conversations and little to recommend here. Slayer is also trying to try some kind of environmental message, because the main vampire claimed that they started killing people only due to regular destruction of the flood forest, because they lived secretly for centuries, unfortunately there is no firm belief in it and a better statement A throw line filled with time. There is not enough absorption material and it's an unwelcome way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The makers do not even do anything with the jungle setting, I do not expect Predator (1987) in hell but I hope more than that. <br /> <br /> The director has created a number of horror films of Vinh Hook that I have seen, equally poor, I'm sorry but he does nothing here and the forgotten appearance and feelings become a movie. Do not have any atmosphere or tension and forget it for genuine scares. Cow's soil is resistant, some thorns and some blood is spread, but it is not something we have not seen before or has not had much effect on it. Finally there is also a huge vampire monster, but it does not show that impressive appearance and it can easily die very easily. <br /> <br /> With a budget of approximately $ 2,000,000,000 it was actually a decent amount of money spent on it, but it's still a junky film, it's reasonably well-made, but nothing special or memorable. Acting sucks, I'm sorry but the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is yet another poor, stupid and annoying TV-for-science channel channel that I can not only recommend. British video will not be perfectly confused with 'Nasty' Girl Film The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this track.
