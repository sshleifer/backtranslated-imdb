This movie was very irrational for me to finish watching it. The courtyard was very silly and anticipated. I'm not too far into this movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is probably older than cabbie (until she's much smaller than she looks). She is black and she is white. He earns more money than he (he is only a cabbie). The most statistically failed unions in the society are rolling in 3 and we assume that there is an opportunity for them in hell. He does not love that the man would be better to marry. <br /> <br /> I just saw it partially because I love MJW as an actor. His performance was fantastic. Hey, oh! It was ok but authentic too silly. Did not see the end I could not make it there, so I do not know if I'm ending differently from the end of the forecast. I can not imagine any black woman who likes this movie. There is some illness to show black people feeding such a white man. And that's an old one. Please! Not real earth!
