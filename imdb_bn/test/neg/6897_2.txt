... I usually hate puns, but this seems to be the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I doubt I'm the first. And I'm sure that many, many comments focus on bulls stupid with uders. It certainly bothered me from the bat. But the film is more inaccurate than the basic lack of mammalian work with this film. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I become a parent, it will eventually be disturbed by violent changes. Showdown with coyotes. (Although it indicates at least one small step for me.) And from the point of writing a conventional screen, you might be expected to play a bigger role in quotes conflict (Gee- your "widow" is a cow ... perhaps its " Husband "was killed by coyotes? No ... there are many figs explanation.) And what kind of farm it is? Otis promises to protect all creatures from harm, but certainly does not seem to be a threat to humans. They reference the farmer to the clay, but what is he doing for pigs? The story of children's animals - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you name it ... the reality of farm life has been touched at least. Perhaps our friendly peasants are running some rescue shelters (there are some references to this, but it has never been explained.) But misusing the horse in a scene that all the farmers came back that seems ridiculous, but I was left seriously disappointed, If he's going to wind up in a shallow grave in the back of the sack until the tomb is in the air. And what's the deal with the "Wild Mike" Hack? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen at the age of the worst kids movie. I usually post on an IMDB to highlight a movie that is not quite known - the current # 2 box office has not reduced the injury. But this movie has made me excited. It was taking place in my local theater, a place that can be used to look somewhat effective. This summer there are lots of family entertainment - actually played at least 2 child movies in the same multiplexes. But I did not get permission to see anything like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom could cheat the family from an extra $ 30. At least I had a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that this film is not designed for me if there is no 35-year-old child. But at the age of Pixar, there is no excuse for such lazy, horror children "Barnard" for the movie. I was bored by the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly did not get angry like me "Bernard". "Shark Tail" was a poor hipone attempt on the street, but there were several smiles. Regardless of that, you can turn Nicoladoran at any time of the day and see some more entertaining and intelligent - that's why they should be ashamed to name them in this trash. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10, only because the pipe mouse was sporadically fun and there was some fun line as Marion Bamford's farming wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmers. They did not really explain who he was. They did not explain much. Especially why Sam Eliot - the final "Man's Man" - revolves around him. Creepy
