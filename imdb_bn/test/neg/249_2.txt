I'm afraid of bad nightmare, cheap horror, B movies and a big fan of all the 100 movies below, and I refuse to deny them the worst elements to enter the big screen, even in your home video. Some of them, such as. The hands of the infamous Manaus look, really bad, and meet them, especially on your own, without a friend and beer, torture for a good movie taste. <br /> <br /> La Momia Azteca Contre el el Rollito Humano was not bad. Well, it's BAD - it's stupid, dated, cone, cheaper, etc., Aggett Mummy, a tin robot, a thick masked villain, crazy scientist, Mexican mobsters etc. Montage poor, line, well, let's not be dramatic, lines of FX and SFX may be proposed in Mexican low budget etc. Best of all. Etc., still the film is FUN. It's too bad it makes you smile cheerfully for an hour. Of course it depends on a sense of humor, but I'm sure LaMomia will have to learn something new for how to enjoy this kind of movie. Please note: The film lasts for about an hour, and I think it is just enough time for the insertion, which is easy to position. <br /> <br /> Another thing is - La Momma sees the idea of ​​the whole SF / Horror genre in 50 seconds, when you compare it with the current Matrix era film. I think how art and audiences both have been invented, because in fact the movies like LaMomia attract movies full of special events (such films are special), and often get permanent encouragement in the theater.
