The best view of "The People's Ages The Lake" is a strange, night-watch scene that features a house, a murder and a lake. Then, it is much higher than it is, until it becomes alarming. A family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) is disturbed by the suburbs (light) hazardous environments, and decides to go around and stay near the heading lake. After that, this image raised a happy family-related Do-Doo to Lama, sometimes some bodies are popping up here and there. The scenes where they discover the bodies, they are quite convincing (in the case of vermilion), but they frequently interfere with the remaining parts (the family consistently combines elements of everyday life). The truth about the issues (mystery as the cause of the murder) soon learned, only the family is unaware and during the outcome of the audience (a discovery in the basement and running around the house), as if the thing made for the TV suddenly appeared that it was supposed to be a horror movie . It is not really made badly; Content and stories are not just enough interesting. Caste's only highlight is Barry Corfin, although her performance / character is considered to be very serious. Blood kitty Tammy Lorraine (girl) may be a recognized face for the lady junkies, because she starred in "Weimmaster" (1997) and made TV-out-TV shows like "I So What Should You Do" (1988). "The Stooper Children" (1987). Although he did not do much in this film. Else, but watchable, if anything.
