Before reading the back of the box, my first thought was that it was probably close to No. 2. I could not do much more than the truth I thought they gave a camera phone downside and someone with $ 10.00 told them to make a movie. The plot did not exist and did not play. I was watching an uninterrupted film about growing grass. It did not fully discover me that the whole film was "reformed". At the end of this "film" I lost my desire to live and I saw AIDS to watch this movie's cat. It was about 70 minutes that I could do something which was less painful. Like jumping off a building.
