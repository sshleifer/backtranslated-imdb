Hey I know. This name is "Cinematograph" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I did not think of some of the movies I missed in the theater. This is not some junk "film" created by people at showtime (only station). Geez, these few stations make profits they think they want to make any garbage movie! It's not good I'm a big man like a senior fan, but this movie was just stupid. Annoying Dull Unfunny Silent You will learn about what happened to Friend Junior prisoners. Otherwise it is simply a stupid movie.
