I had a suspicious chance to watch this movie on TV. It is a perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is not bad and the effects are not terrible, the film has more logical hole than the 10 pounds imported Swiss paneer. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie as an example of not making the film, which director did not use one of you. <br /> <br /> I closed the TV during the last ten harmful minutes of the show. Calling it "gracious" is a gross understatement.
