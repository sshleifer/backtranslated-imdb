This movie is so terrible that it was literally a clock watch. I wanted to get it out of my VCR and get into the house, but I was thinking (fooling) that would eventually become fun and then everything would be okay. "You lose, we win, yes!" This film should be needed to see someone who once enjoyed Jackie Mason. After that, hit the head over with the film until the tape is cracked. And if you're even thinking about renting this Turkish (or worse, but!) I have a question with you: Have you not even seen the cover? I mean, with such shit, you can just say with a glance how bad! "Oh woey!" This movie sucked.
