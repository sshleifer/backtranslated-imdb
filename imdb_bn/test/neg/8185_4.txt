At the inaugural night of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was very excited to see the historical and not good movies. This movie has opened up the idea of ​​a guest speaker, ambiguity, and the idea of ​​how the film was underrated. The scientific section of the film was very fun and fantastic, but I'm not sure whether it was directly displayed after "The Bound" in 1928 or if Russian filmmakers think famous for the Russian novels (hundreds of letters, rural plots) But I'm sure the dramatic parts, like parts of the world, were not created in any sense, were annoying and I The second twenty minutes were lost. Maybe it was acting, but I believed that the film was "unknown and intrinsically": it's annoying, there is no plot or basic story, and the act is horrific. This is certainly no "batheship potemkin", but I would say that life like the Russian film is not a real good effort of lightning.
