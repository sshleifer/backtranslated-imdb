I can not believe that this Hollywood remake is annoying and annoying. It's so terrible. It made a place easily in my top ten bad films of 1998. What was going on for it is that Bruce Willis, who would kill his mother for the right film as a ruthless killer, should have action films. But instead of listening to Richard Gere's irritating Irish language, I'd love to hear Rabbi Calton Talk American for the week. But this movie is impossible, blurry, disrespectful, overwhelming, disrespectful and a Sydney Poetry will return to potential career to play a brutal role. Completely for a filmroll-footie purpose.
