Those who do their best work with a terrific script, a timeless direction, and the worst score I have ever heard of is an extraordinary cast. More TV movies over the week than serious drama Sources are sad when considering that the material is very serious and very realistic. The filmmakers decided that instead of creating drama and character, it was good to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hoped that the audience would be frustrated with sympathy and care. In my opinion, adapting one cut and paste film is the most blatant form.
