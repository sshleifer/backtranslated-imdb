Don Wilson occasionally played as a policeman who enjoys the game of virtual reality, but when people decide to take virtual reality from game games to a real new level of virtual reality, behind all the games, they make cyberce models. As the prototype, but the main reason behind the video game raises the bad guys and starts killing people and now the person who can hit him, Don Wilson, who falls in love with the medieval cybercrime model. In fact, my biggest confusion is to try to understand whether the virtual reality came from the land, robots, humans, cyberbags or just some unknown computer programs. It does not matter that this is just an excuse to see one of the worst actors of the Butcher conversations, as if he was driving a doll. The complete drawback of the film is the biggest mistake of the film, since one does not like the person, he is very well-wisher, his voice is very high and does not look very impressive in the action sequences. What does this bore-festivity store from my lowest rating is the Athena Mascii who looks very hot in high cut dresses and sometimes nude. Also London Avendon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dornon are persistent as the main voice of the bad guys, but their efforts to hide by Wilson's very bad performance are unsuccessful. The biggest mistake of the movie, which is another mistake, is the lack of action, as it is called for the publication of our story, but there is really no interest in some unknown entertainment due to the absence of Messi's nudity and ridiculously inconsistent performances. It extends into action sequences, which are richly dissolved in dancers, poorly operated, and fully potential tensions. Making this officially unwatchable <br /> <br /> * Out 4- (Bad)
