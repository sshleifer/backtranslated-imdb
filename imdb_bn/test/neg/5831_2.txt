Each time, 4kids brings his company's new show. For the last few years, they have brought pure gold like Kira: OK Ya! Or Mau Mau Power. But recently, 4kids have been closed. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> There is a problem writing a negative comment except for show, but really, there is pure garbage on weekends. It is surrounded by a group of people who are active brain. Though he seems to get some bad though. It may be good on paper, but after viewing it, you will understand how good this show is. <br /> <br /> Pizza Guy is an extremely timeless character. He is very 1-dimensional, really does not have much to do with him. She is very active, the story ends. Although many think that the character closes a rip in the south park, I just think the opposite. Mechazawa is an interesting character from Cromartie High School, and she was able to laugh at me. Tino failed to do any of the two works. <br /> <br /> Cast is not good for the show. Like Tone's mother, they are characterized by lack of character. They are only a characteristic stick and it's that. Only the quality of the release is that the show can shrink you. Whether the scene may be funny or you can just laugh because it's a fool <br /> <br /> Thais is a great character of Disneyland / 4 kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it should really be kept to the kids.
