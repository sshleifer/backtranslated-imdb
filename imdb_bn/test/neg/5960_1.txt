Do you like the worst horror movies of the 21st century? It's a laugh. "Manas: The Hands of Fat" is the worst movie of all time, but El Chapakabo must be the worst movie of this century. It sometimes has the difference of having the worst leading actors in the worst. The actor who played the main role Eric Allegria, El Capuchabra did not have any other film, why am I surprised. <br /> <br /> Apparently the demons are attacking the people, but each of the attackers comes slowly and is really stupid. And, there are no police in this city, only two foolish detectives - hello! The police first saw the scene of Hussiside, then the detectives came! And, apparently the monstrous one person's backyard, and some deserted area by docks only attack. Or ... the only place that movie makers can access movies. <br /> <br /> This 'film' IMDB will give us negative stars. This easily -10 stars, or at least 0. claims. They should be allowed to rate a rating of 0.
