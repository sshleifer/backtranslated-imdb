You will simply see it as a bad execution promoted abortion and you will really understand how bad it is. The main message of this movie is that even sick people can not afford to miscarry. If you ask that you do not have a long way away from blowing abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill some poor girl but she must first satisfy him for abortion. What a shit is a load. And the worst part is that he has a strong argument (bringing a child into discouraged environment), but it is considered frustrating because he is scary. And the Bible is part of the Push ... First of all, they thrown out this girl because she explains that someone steals her money (the rule should be somewhere in the Bible) and in the end they are on the front yard of some angels who provide pre-appliance Harassed by the evil killer. Come on. There is a confusing picture among the other following points (and I do not mean it in a good way) ... So why is this guy some psychology? Because her mother once used some liver? And I do not know about the rest of you but he thinks like the greatest personality of the whole world! Although he was clotting a clothed girl, stolen and taping her car girls. If you forget the stupid story, then this film is really a great painter and Bob Hossain was really great and it has some funny English speakers. It's actually about some psycho killer if I'd give it a 7.
