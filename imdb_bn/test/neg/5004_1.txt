This movie was a total cheese. Stank it. It was acting good things about me. Other that, then nothing is significant. <br /> <br /> Big time Spoilers is coming up! <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful life has been lost due to their little boy and later They find the older boy. Their day care has been molested by the care providers. Although in the court they are called liars and defense attorney is a real pric that the jury convicts them and they feel guilty. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can tell the director that "next time you want to make a movie like this, it is different".
