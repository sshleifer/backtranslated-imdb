When a friend of mine suggested this, aware of how secure it was, the underlying theme of the film and the general greatness, I had hoped for an amazing, least entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> I spent the time showing this as a huge disappointing waste of my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is overbearing, but even in guest movies, there is something that puts it down, even if it's only a little bit. On the other hand, the film felt forced and fake. Many shots were unnecessary and I saw that the director was trying hard to work from the artist. <br /> <br /> The performance was poor, and the relationship between the letters was not nearly advanced. Maybe I could see something else, but I did not understand that there was any attraction between DU Su and Mago, they began to get it half-way through a film like a rabbit in the morning. Then again, maybe this picture was bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not against violence in the movie, but this one, almost everything was unnecessary. I shouted painfully and painfully all in the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The ridiculous sounds come to mind. If I did not waste my life two hours after this worrying and ridiculous plot, I would be astonished. In spite of all the movie flaws, to the end, I was hoping for something interesting to finish it. I will not discuss the last talk, because I do not want to "loot" a movie I have not seen it. Just figuratively, "It is a rock or sand to be a grain, the water sink as they are." Everything can not be used as an explanation. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made only for shock value and shock quality. I hope that sooner or later people will stop being so motivated and recognize a bad movie for this. I saw other major Korean movies and it disappointed me that people appreciated Oldbie as the best.
