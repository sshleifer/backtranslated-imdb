As Indie filmmaker, I tried to make at least one decent movie. This part of ____ was out of budget. It was shot in video and not at least 24 p mini-dv. Its appearance and feeling were only Bahad. I was talking to the director at the showbiz expo in LA at a few years ago and he was talking about that book, he made films for dummies that he had put together. I thought this is going to be some of the small videos but I guess I was wrong. He could bring that little price by shooting video instead of 16mm film. The plot was the statue and the act and all the fake screens and sounds and the whole nine yards. I had a choice tonight to rename and mistake any movie. Damn !!!!! I bought Joard which was a movie. Maybe the director should read the actual motion picture book in the making of the film and try not to cut the corners while trying to flick the budget. Perhaps he will learn from master made, saw the death of living dead and Evel Dead and chain genocide. Just a few names in the big budget big hits all the time. This is a video that should have been dead. I can not call it a film because she does not use the film.
