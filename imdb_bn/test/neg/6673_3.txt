Czech cinematography is traveling through dark periods ... This movie is a real proof. Slama apparently wanted to create a middle documentary about the characteristic personality of their stupid character. A young man and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefer to live in a corrosive shock with a painful alcoholic uncle. Because of the statue of Tonic, who will only be able to declare "Dad, I will not work in the factory" (I really want to know why); I understand his "house" status, but I'm not able to digest a really awful mess. The fork sensitivity everywhere. Why did not Monica detain his son to work abroad? Young Czech couples often do this, and somebody else's children live in a devastating burner ... <br /> <br /> ... yes, someone has already said it - played badly and played soap opera. Martin Huba, Cast actors like Bowler Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately it could not save the whole piece.
