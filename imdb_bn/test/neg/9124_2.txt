Like many people, I love the original; "American graffiti" was one of the best movies of the 1970s. Siegel, "More American Graffiti" is a movie a horrible, depressing mess. It was not funny, interesting characters became violent characters and stories became fiction (stories were "Laurie"'s other brothers because Richard Dreffas did not sigell and "Terry the Todd" and "Firon Joe" somehow managed to manage Vietnam together). They have a police officer named "Falpha" (originally the character of Harrison Ford) who created "Camio". He did not even look like Harrison Ford, who was a big star by 1979, even bored with the garbage. <br /> <br /> Here's the operative word "funny". This movie is not even fun. Debbie (Candy Clerk) mixes a stripper mixed with a dot-spoke hippie cloth and is trying to host her dealer boyfriend from prison; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Syndi Williams), basically the love birds have two kids and they have become annoying, annoying couple; Adorable little tomboy carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", yet another Hippie Children. John Milner (Paul Lemat) is a victim of a destructive nation whose driver was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was an integral part of the original and it gave such a huge flux, only heard sporadically. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was a different story writer, a different director, and a complete lack of line, which makes this movie an insignificant failure. <br /> <br /> Interesting curiosity and authentic Nostalgia are not available in Siegel. It was a film that was not needed to be made and the best was to keep in mind that "American Graffiti" was a great movie and could avoid movies with "more" in the title.
