I am surprised at the main comments here for this just Surface Film. It really does not originate from the beach antics from Benard School to "Dreamliner of California" and is really complimentary. Lead kids may learn to travel on a board that they hit the good Sheriffs in the actual ocean in a concrete wave pool. Most of the urban teenagers surf in Australia, the film laughs at the audience, with the ocean sown grains. Created in the 80's but in the 60's with his heart, it looks good to see and see, and it is not in classic class. Even the actors do not exlast this. We take advantage of the Leviad Bridge or Round the Belded Surf or the Bech Blaket in Beijing Land. The oz stars like Oxy and Big Wednesday's hero Gerry Lopez have drafted to add recognition to shake heads for the efficiency of our farm's wavelengths, but it has only created a gopher crowd. It's 10 years old who do not ask a lot. It was not even in the hands of the GODS and that was silly.
