I know that this movie was shown on the local TV when I was a child, but I could not remember whether I saw it or not; Looking at it now, consider it completely forgotten, I still do not know ?? So count it as I first see! There are many films with title characters, the creation of visionary French writer Jules Verne; They include: Under the SEA, it took 20,000 (1954; in the introduction of James Mason), the philanthropic (1961; Vincent Price), mysterious islands (1961; Herbert Lom), Captain Nemo and Underworld City (1969; Robert Ryan) and mysterious island of Captain Nom (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This edition was awarded by Academy Award winner Jos√© Ferrer. However, even if half of itself is not bad? Awakening from his submarine animation, "Nautilus", and finds himself in the modern era, did Nemo take all his skills to defeat the Magnolomanius scientist Bergess Meridith to the US Navy? It still emerges as its most infantile adventure! For example: Five Seconds in Film, Meridith's Assistant ?? Donning a steel mask ?? Rants that "the world will be ours!"); Equally laughable, similarly, outbreaks of midget at the decked out-out, whose work is all the important "Delta beam" of the professor - and how does the Meridithian ship work on those and roid-type microbes, which can never do anything? ! <br /> <br /> The whole life of returning did manage to maintain his status, but MedieDith was an embarrassing event (which was the 1960's Batman TV series and the repeat of his penguin characteristic of the film, which was really budget)? Most of the mix production design and the impressive special effects of investment, doubt, and are definitely influenced by both Star Wars (1977) ?? That, apparently, they could not even afford a decent costume (she looks positively idiotic wearing a tie-type sub)! The backing of the supporter cast (in the production of another Arvin Allen, playing a sabatu in Joan Fontaine's vein, [1 961] Voices to the Bottom of the Saa [1961] and adding a Sashblackling routine through the name of the engine room, Nautilus " ), Linda de Georges (oddly, she is the only female character) and Horst Bukholz (for any reason as King of Atlantis ??, Nemo Famous Law Covering the continent in search of ta). <br /> <br /> However, a three-part dramatic mini-series for the exhibition is being reduced, the film seems choppy ?? Although clearly still in a phase one ends and the other able to understand where to start.
