I do not like Himash Reshammiya. I do not like to sing his songs too much. But his songs are a madness in India, especially among ordinary people. Now when will he become an actor? That was a big joke! He has guts as much as he does in his prime time. I do not want to see this movie. But one thing is to change it. The film is becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Upa Karma collected 14 crore taka box office? Compared to the same 7 weeks, 7 million taka collected. Apan and Rajinikanth's stupid sevagira can sit ?? To try to understand how this movie got this movie, I have to give this film a big hit? The real story is about the life of singer Hemesche Reshamiya (HR) who went to Germany for the concert and was in love with Rhea (Hansika Matwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherwat) loves Himesh. Now Hemes was arrested for murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after he fled from prison, proved himself innocent and had to find out the actual murderer. <br /> <br /> I say that Himesh has nothing to be his hero. He tried hard but unfortunately failed. He is kind. I thought the movie could make so much click? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film's saving grace is that the script is far from Himesh's prison. (But then the film snorted under the helpless stupid limitations) Secondly, the songs of the film are good, engaging, crowded. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? She looks gorgeous and works well, as the second lady. I can imagine that the fans of Mallika are coming to watch movies for her. Fourth, the cinematography of the film is lovely ?? Especially the German locals, a treat to watch for the eyes. Fifth, the story of love between Himesh and Riyad, the main part of the story ?? Clayed conversations that might be associated with young people Sixth, director Prashant Chaddha Hemesh's ruthless acting skills have been made to hold the shots as much as possible, Himesh does not need to do much. <br /> <br /> <br /> Heroine Hansika Matwani is a small budget film heroine. Rajbari was destroyed in a small role. Overall the movie has the lowest average. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about the whole movie ?? What was the movie script like the main movie with Salman? I think it would have been a lot better. Then maybe I'll give the movie 6 out of 10 but now ?? (10 out of 4.5 stars)
