Generally for the first time welding, a rich small-town environment, and some pretty descriptive vintettes specifically designed with HBOs, which are assumed to be of average production value. <br /> <br /> But it is a huge 'but' with different concubines, some favorites, impressive with most annoying characters, paper thin and stretched soft for more than three hours. <br /> <br /> Often disinterested story is disturbed by the middle of the middle of the entertainment. Enough, and personal drama, all without deeply. <br /> <br /> Shame, because some scenes are really shining. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 4 grubby Paul Newmans
