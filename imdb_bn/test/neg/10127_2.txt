You may think that a ceremony about regular teenagers with the Director General will be interesting, but far away from it. Take the idea for example: The main characters are a big secret that they hide from their colleagues. It's just Raven Montana and That's Ryan. Next, acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to have slept half through a lot of scenes. In the end, jokes are either clich√© or annoying. If they are not used, they are colorful, yet to "laugh" our strange conversation, they are throwing different promos around the house. I really wish to use this original and entertaining element of this show. In conclusion, the Weaverly Place wizard is frustrating.
