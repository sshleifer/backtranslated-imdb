**** Some spinners **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in the net. Nothing about this film is frustrating. A man in the movie sodomizes a goat, has a bulldozer decapitation, and burns a lesbian face. These scenes of "extreme violence" are so nasty, it is frustrating why anyone wants to revive the trash of this trash. I just can not believe that I've spent hard working money which must be the worst movie ever produced. Do not fool the reviews, this movie is shameful for some ... without a prison who wants to torture in prison. For a real absorption classic, look at Bloodsucking Freaks or even the latest recent Dome Generation. Death Island shrinks below the toilet of the film and needs to move beyond the existence.
