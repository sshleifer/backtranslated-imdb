Not a bad idea. I just wish they could take it from the other side. This is a movie that tries to cry with eternal behavior with you, which works for most people (guesses with a weak stomach). But there is not much of this movie. It's not funny and it's not romantic, so please change someone's label, and since I already knew that animal husbandry is actually the largest place and million dollar industry, I was not really frustrated. But most people do not know this thing and I thought that how the movie got raised after the secret came just frustrating because it could be one of the eyes openly seen in the eyes which taught the senses of an idol that is too much reality (yes I have my homework ) Have thousands of people So if you want to watch bad movies, you can be amazed at how you can make them look even better when they see them.
