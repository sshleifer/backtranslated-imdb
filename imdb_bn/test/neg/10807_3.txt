Now I see this before coming out in VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a beautiful movie, but then again, we were a teenager. But honestly, retro is a movie that is not good. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of the carnival of the soul. But the bad movie is not actually illogical; However, there seems to be a lack of charm in this one, there are usually a lot of regular Mst3k sheets. But if it was on the wire, and I was bored and drinking beer - sure, I'd like to see it again. But then again, I have seen Haoling VII almost five times, so maybe you will not listen to me. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else think that it is sad that the director has commented on his movie? And why does he feel the desire to use so many caps lock?
