let's see. Different things of different people in this movie. As shown by the opinion, Finns, it can be right or horrible or annoying. Other people, it may be something different First off: If you do not speak Finnish (I do), you'll understand half of what you're doing, subtitles are awesome and even the title is incorrectly translated ("butt mother" will probably be translated as English badland in English) <br /> <br /> <br /> Why did not I like it? Because it's a Tarantino-style film: It only takes a very harsh reality and it returns it to you as cruelly as possible. However, I am not American, and thus I am not particularly interested in this proceeding because it all shows that the director does not have to say anything new. Technical skills (camera work brighter), script (united) do not save this movie from the bottom. If you want to see a Finnish movie, then go for any film of the Kurisamy brothers who compete with talented actors and talented actors and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his motives and priorities: nobody was intelligent, and thus the film failed. By seeing this you will not miss a lot.
