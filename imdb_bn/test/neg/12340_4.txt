Rather, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen show all the appearance of Robert Redford's "Jolie" project with their racing car movies, because it is found in the alpine sunny hills and below the branches. <br /> <br /> The story is light with the name of David Chapellet (the name of the lead name) of Redford's small city, which is light on ice, with his eyes on the Olympic Mahima Award, in a special order, his coach gets nose, father and team mate . The woman is proven as a mere side-show in her inferior world, sparv proved by an old girlfriend and then a fairly annoying pick-up scene played by the selfishly impressive pursuit of heaven, an independent thoughtful, independent woman, Comilla. Ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work, which involve numerous obstacles and scraps on the PC, but their effectiveness has diminished due to the familiarity of skiing events with current TV coverage. Plus I'm not sure that there is a similar mass identification with the general public like the summer games at the Winter Olympics so that in the end Redford won the gold medal of the final relay, I could not really get excited for him or else <br /> <br /> <br / > Actors, Redford, do not need to forward the best profile, really do not have to do much, and Gene Hackman is equally good with little material Wake up. M. Sparav behaves well with the main woman's interest, as he treats Redford, as he treats another man with his autocratic behavior. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a lack of dramatic tension for which the sequence of actions are not fully compensated and you do not care for a fig for any of the leading characters. One of the movies where the actors could probably enjoy it more than the audience.
