But at least this movie got what it deserves - Mike, Tom Saro, and Crowe will be sent to love satellite. Robot "Mystery Science Theater 3000" from Pearl Forrester! "Salto" is one of those long lost, forgotten movies, which is so bad, you will be sure to have nightmares or depression after life. Although the movie is not old, it's still a very forgotten movie. If it was never for intelligent minds in "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film did not feel that it was never made, but the film would not be very enjoyable by our movie stars. <br /> <br /> In real life: This movie is really bad. Love satellites: This movie is excellent!
