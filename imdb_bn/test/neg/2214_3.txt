This is one of the most dirty things I've ever seen. Perhaps no bad movie is ever guilty, but if you did not see many bad things, it could easily create your top ten worst list. When you consider what you had achieved with the original "King Kong" in 1933, you have to ask yourself why someone would stop so low for generating this frustration. Then, it is taking a step forward and realized that in the next year "Star Wars", the quantum leap has gained a new level of Saif-Fi entertainment, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now I ask you, should Professor (Peter Cushing) go along the umbrella as a major part of underground research equipment to move towards the Earth? Okay, so it's going to be quick to stop Stomachosauri (Paratosaurus?), But let's go. In no way do I think that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote when he wrote the story of Pelusudara. He was probably not with the psychic Caroline Mono as Princess Dia, perhaps the only freedom fighter for this whole escape. <br /> <br /> At least one pseudo-scientific explanation was that I got kick out; I'm always looking for one of the films like this. In the main part of the Earth, the sky was in the lower part of the world's hinge, which explains the divine pink burning. But try as soon as possible, this story could not prevent me from finding interesting things about Huza's Sluen and Juble the Augle One, less than half the petrogactic creatures. Good professor paraphrase - "You can not mesmerize me, I pay attention!"
