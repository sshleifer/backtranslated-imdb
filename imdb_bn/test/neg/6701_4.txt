Last night, I was present with my cousin in Badland's screening. Director / writer, producer (his wife) and various customs members were present and after the film, after the question-answer discussion we were excited to know. But once the movie was over and the credits were starting (and the film was not really well edited and was not too long), my cousin and I got up immediately without consulting with each other. We once started talking outside that we both were so angry that we just did not want to stay in the discussion, we did not see the Cast and the crew standing near the exit and we were walking just as we kept it <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> I saw the roots of my anger being planted during the scene where Jerry's fisherman had torn the palms of his daughter Selina with a knife. Lechila could leave his blood. A fake trail. It was necessary to connect with the physical pain that was in my body with my mind, he killed his mother and two brothers in his presence and imposed them on his soul and was taking him along with him during his escape. I've cut my bird before (in fact); Even cutting a rough surfaced is incredibly painful because the heart is so sensitive and it does not keep you unsteady but it becomes too slow for healing because you try to open it to try it for yourself. But after a very short period of time, a narrow strip of cloth jumped around his palm and a scene with a band-ed, as if he would never cut. My anger has reached its peak - I will not waste it for you at the moment - in the final scene of Selina. <br /> <br /> I got upset because a lot of sympathetic characters (actresses portrayed in Selina) are a good one); I was And you can not tell me a good screenplay that does not know it? Its physical and emotional pain submerged in both feelings; And the screenwriter, Selina, treats mental pain so severely and disrespectfully, treating me with the audience members, barbarians, and completely disrespect. <br /> <br /> Sure, the script is the tears for Selina, and some conversations that tell us that she is hitting somewhere, somewhere else. But this time, we feel so impressive to the audience that we've stopped. Manipulation begins very early in the film, when Jerry's family's dialogue message gives an audience message that Jerry was suffering from mental problems. One of the rules, screen authors: Give your audience some credit. Let them make a good bit of their own creative work. Tell the story; Do not explain everything we're supposed to think and feel. We do not like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin knew that she was having problems with the movie, according to the conversation, when Jerry and his wife talked each other with each other *** this, f *** that, f *** You Some couples actually feel so bad in their relationships that the F-Bombs become other words from their mouth. But it is like curious who many curse observers like. Some of them are really fun; Curse is helpful. But some of them called the curse for humor and the option of a curse to convert this screenwriter into conclusion. Not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This husband and wife team has chosen to brave a complex complex story. Characters. But they could not realize that the meaning of a story, especially a complex meaning, would be different for each member of the audience. To make a successful story, pay attention to the important realities, do not have to work hard to explain the meaning of the story of the entire audience. I have been working with Vietnam Veterans for five years, I've heard more than most stories, and I'm always happy to publish their stories to a larger audience. It is important, all types of different levels, we hear them. But I have already decided on this romantic story that Jerry's story began to convey and made it for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay attention to detail.
