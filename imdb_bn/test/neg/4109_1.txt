I hope I see this movie and instead use the travel machine when coming back to other plans. I saw a free screening of Sound of Thunder, so I can not complain about the price, but I want to get back my 103 minutes. The acting was moderate, and special effects were great. If people can not make movies about Diana, they can not afford to show prehistoric animals better or better than Jurassic Park. Spieberg spoiled us. Edward Barn, like Travis Rare, was the only one who saved the movie. I noticed that women under 18 gave the movie the highest rating, and the only explanation was that they had caught Barnes all the time. Total long 103 minutes This film should have been in about 80 minutes. It just dragged on and over and over. Do not waste your time or money on this remote flickr.
