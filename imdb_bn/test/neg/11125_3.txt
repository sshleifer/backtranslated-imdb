First, and foremost, I discuss the title of this movie. 'Chopakabara' is not the Spanish word. The name they are referring to is 'Chupkbars'. I imagine that they put 's' because it makes plural sounds, but I assure you that it is singular in Spanish Next, I think this movie has been done many years ago. When I was an early teenager at home when my stopside was outside the city I saw one of those B's horror flicks came off it. Then it was kind of awesome. Let's talk about the special effects of <br /> <br />. The most important 'effect' clothing used for stereoscopes This is the main character, you think it has some serious meaning, but this is not the case. There were some stupid spooky home-like shapes, colors, and textures all insane in the design world. <br /> <br /> There was a time when there was a walk that no one could walk. His movement was disgusting and strange, but looked like a normal man walking around the floor. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have taken on the issue is that there is no creature in the world that kills everything, it actually shows it with no respect to eat. Chupkabars will kill one after another, but they will not really eat prey. You say, "It's just a movie" and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it is stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> He thinks Jamaican / Hawaiian / British / something different, but he seems to be Latino. The problem is, its pronunciation is so bad that even a Russian can say that he is not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers roam around with this thing, in the fire. I am not a military person, but soldiers, especially special strategic forces, have some intelligence to perform their duties. Do not worry that they were to shoot and was wasted while trying something new? They do not. Chupkabara continued killing, and could not eat, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> :) However, my vote was 3 for this glimpse, because it was bad. Why did I see the whole thing? I'm sure you've done the same on occasion, so do not give me a crack. ;)
