A completely forgotten movie but an incredible soundtrack: I want to give it 9 (soundtracks) out of 10. My CD and guitar work (Neil Loffgren) is fantastic! I have seen the film many years ago and had to remember what it was to check the IMDB. I was obsessed about getting the soundtrack and since it was replacing it. It ranges from a level of gospels to blues / spirit / ballad. Unlike "Elle Loughgren", the other "lead" lead guitarist of Eli Street Steve Van Jundt wrote, arranged, prepared and performed all songs. This dude can play! The voice is directed by Niles (he can not sing very well), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Leopson.
