An ear-split movie, an old-fashioned fashion scrawl romp designed to showcase comedic features of singer Madonna. He is actually trying to prove an exaggerated parole ready to be killed here (after running a red light he found a body in his car trunk ... big smile). After an energetic animated credit sequence - which is a lot more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to see but Madonna's black mosquito and red lips are set by her platinum hair and pale colors. What do you have Gryffin Dunne, the keeper of Maddy, feels defeated to play, and laughs at the lively dialogue with the poor-looking supporting cast. This is an unfortunate set-up of James Parrot's competition, which allowed his star to run wildly in the spirit of a snapstick film that was lost in the 1930s (but Catherine Hepburn was also in favor of "Bring Up Baby"). Wretched * ****
