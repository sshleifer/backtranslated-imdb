Fred "The Hammer" Williamson distributed another cheaply produced movie. She could set a new standard for herself. Look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar canon that is visible on the street during a chase scene. If you do not see it once, you see it many times. Find out the focus shots in the scene and try fixing the camera operator to turn it on. Watch this with a group of people and create your own mystery science theater!
