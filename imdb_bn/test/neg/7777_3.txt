There is no way to put these words into words, how bad, silly, stupid and laughable these "Vice Academy" movies are. You have one experience for yourself. For the third time in the row, writer-director Rick Sloan does not even show an ounce or talent instruction. There is nothing here that a person above 5 years can believe or laugh, but still (very short) nudity and other "plot" elements make movies inappropriate for the kids. Which I believe is that they are really targeting adults with 5-year-old mental power. Elizabeth Kitan Linna has done more than quigli reception - she is winner bubbly and clever, and her wonderful big smile is the only thing that can make the audience smile. But in this movie, to see her and other girls, it is good to see a bunch of flowers in the covered area of ​​horse-covered deserts. (*)
