I recently went to screen screening of soap girls in the presence of filmmakers. Before filming, they are sunny, sunny, taking pictures. I was excited to see the clothes in real life, and could not wait to watch the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The audience was stuck with laughter during the movie. It was clear to me that they are not laughing at the picture, but in the film There is no argument behind it in detail in a grade B movie. Some nude cast, some blood and whala! You have a movie! After the movie I came to a bunch of filmmakers and asked why they wanted to make this movie. They all played serious, as they were serious filmmakers. They each said to me a little different: to create a controversial movie, a fun movie, an uplifting film, to create socially responsible movies. Everyone mentions something different. It was clear to me that no filmmakers knew what kind of films they were making, and they are now trying to restore their money by publishing this movie so that they can get people to see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not buy in the promotion! As long as you can not do anything seriously, the filmmaker's time may be valuable for reading how the film should be made. Alternatively you're better off saving two hours of your life.
