Strangely unreasonable, but tragically, a Brahmin writer in the trashi crime story, traveling to the Madrid to help gangster memorials with Michael Kaiyne, astonishingly miraculously ridiculing the detective film; Soon, he realized that he was following and his life was in danger. Caine describes the proceedings with significant intelligence and low keyed limitations, but its actual performance is the existence of energy (anger or frustration seems to come out of Caine's currents bursts nowhere, and he connects with anyone on the screen). Other cast members (especially Mickey Rooney, a silver-haired Lianol Stander and Leibniz Scott) performed Sunny, although Al-LÃ©tere has a cross-dressing gay humiliation (humiliated until Laty was able to defend) himself, an inevitable Location). The writer-director Mike Hodges's idea is a good idea (1940's detective films mock without compromising strictly spoken conversations and millions), but his humor is not very sharp. When a bogurt looks out - ask a question about a falcon - the best joke, followed by what is actually animated. ** **** to
