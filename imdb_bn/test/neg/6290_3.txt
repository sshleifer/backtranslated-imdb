Who should be singing - this whole movie was a big bore. I could not understand the badness of boys and did not understand the romance between Miles and KK - sex scenes were unclear. The end was horrible - the unresolved - will be the cause of the murder. And the boy's entire jealousy was weird ... Mom always wrestled with the boy - do not you think he'll get something with Freden? Why can not someone teach who, instead of talking to change? <br /> <br /> I could only pay 1.00 dollars to pay this rent. <br /> <br />
