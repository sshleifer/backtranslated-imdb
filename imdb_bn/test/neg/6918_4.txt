"A scientist has developed a serum that distorts the hands and head of the victim uniquely. The scientist decides to marry a man's daughter to marry his wife in exchange for money for the healing of his concert pianist." Summary of DVD Slave J. Carol Niesh (Dr. Eger Markcoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in Lugosi mode at the bottom of the budget. <br /> <br /> The Serial Serum is a real disorder, "Acromoly", which defines American heritage, "Chronic Disease of Adults Distinguished by the Extremist, Mouth, and Jaw Bone Growth caused by the extra effect of the pituitary gland." Ralph Morgan (as Athenie Lawrence) plays some dignified poor people. Beautiful blonde Wanda McKay (Patricia "Pat" as Lawrence) is a girl chosen by a mad scientist; In the early scenes, Mrs. McKay and Nisha are brilliantly bright. <br /> <br /> See Lola Worrell (as Maxay) in an amazingly good supporter's performance; He is a bit greedy, and long sorrow, a destroyer Miss Bayrell definitely steals film; And, you have to give him aside. Markfay can question Sanita. Add Glenn Kinky (as Steve) and a crazy Gorilla (Ray Corrigan) fun. Giant makeup (Maurice Sedman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ Jay. Carol Knight, Ralph Morgan, Tala Barel
