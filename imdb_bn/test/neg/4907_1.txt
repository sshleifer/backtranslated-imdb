This is one of the most intelligent, tiring and clich√©d movies I've ever seen ... and, yes, I saw Pearl Harbor. Even Jena McQueen can not choose that they can come out of fearful dialogue. It has been described as an 'art house', it can only be a warmth for the absolute, terrible and impartial, timeless. Why is a movie when the plot is not canceled, critics think it should be claimed as an industry? But much more annoying, why does America love it? Without you, the grains of this film remain, perhaps, it was belonged to.
