All the films made in 1931 are not that crazy, and this is the "best picture" that has certainly given more inspiration for the development of television. <br /> <br /> It is possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to mention the ideal character of all the returning novels. Dix - The film is so strong in the first third - almost faces, but no one knows why and it does not give any idea. And what about Dunne that makes him so stoical? The views of Oliver in Eden May are as priceless as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie plays a role in movie history, but it is long and annoying.
