Kate is a twin young girl who has problems meeting and dating guys. Throughout the film, you can meet some of her lovers friends. And throughout the film, you are subjected to satirical negative views of Kate on love and relationships. These negative perspectives are presented as running and ultimate truths throughout the world. I had a real problem with this. Why would anyone want to teach me about dating, living, and dating anyone possibly messed up? It would work if it was fun, but it's not. For the film's jokes (which is not fun or original), you must believe that Kate is saying: all relationships end in an inevitable way of bad or with a sex, which can build the highest level of relationships when you are able to burst in front of your partner Be ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no movie in recent memory that comes close to the stomach disorders like love and sex. Why do filmmakers spend their trash time? Each joke of love and gender I have experience in other movies or in my own life. Nothing about stories, production, or style is original or creative. It is cone, stupid and pointless. upset!
