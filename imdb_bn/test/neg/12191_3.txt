WARNING: I recommend that anyone who does not read this film yet. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I expected it was a vampire movie, which would be amazing how Rodriguez and Tarantino helped to create both pictures. I started it in about 15 minutes and in the meantime, my hopes for this movie were below the drain, which disappointed me. First of all, the story that was going on was not objectionable for everyone and was just boring and disrespectful at the point where I just wanted to stop it. I'm getting more frustrated with this movie, as it pulled it, but I guess it would be better .... Finally when it finally shows the vampire, it expresses my mind very badly. I thought, "Well, this film started with some horrendous horror stories about these two criminals, then slowly some vampires turned into movies, which I thought was going to be from the beginning, like the last 30 minutes?" To add to it, they try to make the original characters cool and terrifying and finally when they are not right; A Bunny has been more awesome than these characters! This crap is a terrific piece of crap !!! From evening till morning, disgraced me and leaving a terrible taste inside my mouth, the depression of my head went away and my body could not move away from the terrible shock, which I left in my 108-minute horror film of life. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quantin Ternino, Chechen Marin and Danny Trejo are able to take part in this vicious dirty work, they all are well-respected actors. In my opinion, Doc was one of my worst films from Til Dawn, which I suffered in my eyes. Do not see it, you're doing you a great favor ...
