There is no clear picture about this image or what it wants to be. If there are some good bits on the Stewart screen and they give some lines to work with it. It works best as a romantic comedy, but the story keeps title for the more dramatic region and is lost in the process itself. Last fifteen minutes or later, the plot twists are simply a series of dramatic clich√©s. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are able to see it, then the main reason I can say you see all the movies of Jimmy Stewart.
