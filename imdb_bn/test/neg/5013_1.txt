This movie was in the channel's channels today and I had nothing to do. It will be the worst football movie ever made. This will be one of the worst movie periods. The wire service has a rating system of premium services and they have 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even half the star. Bad acting, Suck as Scott Bakula normal, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad, if he tried, he could not work. Rob Schneider's one liners stunk full. Fred Thompson should be ashamed that he was also in this film. The only saving grace for this movie was that you would see the nude in Kathy Ireland in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
