It could be better if the film was made two years ago. But unfortunately, it was made in a decade that there was no idea about what a horror movie should show or work. When I first heard of this movie, the people of IMDB classified it as a seagull cheerleader camp. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, Bittsi was Russell but Uma Thurman was not sure. I really like to find that person to start rumors of that whole sigall. I'm sure though many of us will be I'm not going to give anything because really, this movie did not end! I'm just going to see you a real camp horror film ... Burning starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and Gaiac Reidmant Hi in Fast Times. A word to the wise - there is a sound camp in the headline of only one horror movie, which means that it is not valuable to it. Oh, and other things, mid-90s have been made at any early flick, even better!
