First of all I would say that I do not like so much from imaginative movies! But there are some movies I really like. This is one of the other;) My opinion here is some (most) like others. The film is still going on behind me, but few effects are not really enough to see the whole time .... I think they have done well 3 animated sceneries with sun and 4 moons, but it's only I liked. There is no intelligent dialogue (there ???). But it's a great movie for Lara Croft or hot-pants love of some girls. <br /> <br /> For managers: "Try again, please !!!"
