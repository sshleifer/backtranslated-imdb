Is it a bad thing, the trash's cliche-ridden pill? Of course. Anyone who does not understand the video store box can pick it up, there is probably no correct trial movie in the first place. So, I will now rate aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and violence: 4 - There is very little death for this type and Gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood will probably see elsewhere. The only way to get rid of these is that children are doing these terrible things, which makes the bar a bit more. <br /> <br /> Suspense: 1 - All right, I looked at the children who are afraid of these two dreads. <br /> <br /> Nudity / Sex: 7 - A lot of chickens from three different women, among which Julie Brown, MTV, was born. There are two sexual scenes, but little is shown among them. <br /> <br /> Strange humor - 4 - There are some good smiles trying to do scary things, but above all, it's bad, not funny. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - This is not unreasonable. . There are plenty of funny moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the whole movie. However, if you see a big fan of slasher flicks of 80 only this movie. This definitely falls on the bottom of the scale, but it's not all the way down. The actual downside ends frustrating. It almost destroyed the movie for me.
