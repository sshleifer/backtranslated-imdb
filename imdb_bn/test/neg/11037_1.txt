I am now reading IMDB's comments for some time. For this movie, an average of only 8.3 gets my nerve. I do not want to pull one of them "I just signed up for an account so that I can post in this movie" bit ..... but, I did it right. The only theme that you will take from this movie is that cruelty is not worth laughing. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize the film's many-love-titty films that I love; Yet, it is crap. Actually, the thing I found is that the director hopes that you will be sympathetic to the movie 'Villen'. If you have sex with your sister, you should be expelled from society. Just my personal feelings I guess. Yet, I've been sitting on this * overwhelming * 2 hours. * Hope to have some deep logic behind the dei-swaay jail. <br /> <br /> I like many foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with Korea. Brush and it has put them in the end of my book line. Oh ... I feel good after a while.
