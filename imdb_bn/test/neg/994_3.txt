This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film by Busbee Berkeley completed Noor? Please! First, forget about the plot, a really simple human version of a monk stiff man turned into a saint by the love of a beautiful blonde. Yechh. So what hatred him to make him active in love? With a group of other boys, she helps protect a child from drowning because they all swim in the water tower and try to survive to save water. It's not just heroism, but he suddenly smitten. Cloud Renaissance tries to portray hard-bit, hard-talking, no-type police, it's really painful. A miserly stutter, with its vital voice, is its chief and rather unfortunate acting instrument. His most power seems to try to hide the intelligence that shines his other role. I do not understand how he has ever been talking in accepting this work. Enjoy it, if you can pump old cars and gas for a while, do not expect a suitable movie experience. It's 1-1 / 12 hours of my life wasted.
