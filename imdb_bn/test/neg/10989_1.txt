I always say, "There is nothing like a good movie". And I must say, it was nothing like a good movie! Drill, dull and tiring It was like a bad dream that never ended, why do not you try to wake up. I do not think of the concept of a movie without a word (i.e. a fiction or a dream world), but there must be something to capture your imagination, not just an image, which is the film. No character seems to have been developed and it jumped so fast in the scene that it is difficult to clear a story. (There was even a story?) You might say the actors are trying their best, but unfortunately, poor actors damaged the work of all actors. It looks like a kind of cinematic masturbation ... the director and nobody else is satisfied. Big waste of time.
