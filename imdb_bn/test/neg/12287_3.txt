It can be everything that you know it to determine whether you want to see it. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems to be conscious about it and it's fun to make it fun. It manages that it is quite bad to be ridiculously funny with some moments as it cliche aligns after cliche and even manage to grow even worse. <br /> <br /> You can laugh about the quality of script writing and production really poor quality, you can enjoy it. Otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
