If you come here, because you've already watched this movie and others had an interest in telling it. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I really * do it. And I sincerely apologize as a Canadian (because we do what we are doing) At this moment, just for a moment this film has to cross your eyes. I have heard that in every dozen cases there is no remedy for retinal bloodshed. <br /> <br /> I like everybody else, believing this movie has some stupid B-movie ripoffs on Blades. I thought, "Sure I could use a stupid movie a good smile." I will give positive comments about the 'creation' of the film's creators: Thanks for removing the REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see what might be confusing to see this movie. <br /> <br /> and for the record, I * saw the movie, but did not see it. The dialogue was inconsistent and most of the scenes occurred in my grandmother's troll, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> Do you know? I'm no longer writing about this It's very painful.
