Someone takes a fantasy-type video game and puts it in a blender, and the scene of the sequel is a combination that we have to sit down. <br /> <br /> Now go to the record by telling me how much I love. Chinese Fantasy Films. From fun and silly, to focus on martial arts, more dramatic and romantic? This is a section that I enjoy very much. "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora Box" and "A Chinese ODC: Syndrome" movies (both of which were written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "Bride with White Hair"; "Butterflies and Swords"; "Green snake"; "The story of a Chinese ghost"; "Swordman II"; "Ju: Warriors from Magic Mountain"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; And others. I was looking for why "a Chinese Tolle Story". One of the characters in the film is "Monkey King" (Akash San Wukong), which is a well known character in the Chinese mythology. The first one said about the story of "Journey to Way Way", which was written about 500 years ago in the epic adventure story. (The story of the monkey king and his disciples is one of the "Chinese ODS" films, also the focus of others). Other known characters present in the film are Zhu Wang (character of pigs) and Shu Wing. <br /> <br /> How would it be wrong? Well, take an example known to western audiences. How about the mythology of Robin Hood? You are a well-known story from the old days. Let's say that Robin Hood has played Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and played Helly Joel Osmement as Freer Shank. No other than the maid Mario Rosie Perez. Come on, Sir Robin, as well as Vazir, because you never know when you can waste Nottingham's Sheriff. Their rocket packs may also be required, and when we are in it, supply them with a strategic nuclear weapon because it can certainly be effective. If you think Robin Hood's story is really clear, then you have a movie "A Chinese Tall Story"! As I command above, this movie is a jumbled mess. In the first 30 minutes, we are not acquainted with San Wukang, Zhu Wang and Shaw Wazing, but rather Sannyasi Triptik (who is actually the main playwright), kidnapped child, "Boom giant of millennium" (which shoots laser) beams), an underground tree god, An incognito tribe, an angelic girl, an angel girl, Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a sea dragon king, an ever-morphing magic golden activist , A chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space, and four celestial knights. All of this will not be very bad - there are all kinds of fantastical elements of course pass down for years and stories. But I guarantee you that we do not include the last half of the film in Chinese mythology. (Helpful advice to the filmmaker: Only the influential people in your computer can bring cool cool spaceships and intergalactic war screenplay, this does not mean that they should). <br /> <br /> If you ask your Chinese legendary movie director (and I'm not making it a wrong track then it is a direct quote from the commentary) "If I change something, then we'll be more rock-and-roll type music I'm asking the musician to have an item like Android. "Is there a story hidden somewhere? Yes Yes here Most of the courage follows Tripathi (Nicholas TS ?? "Jane-X Police," "Time and Tide," "My SchoolSet the Barbarian") and Miyanan, The Leisure Imp Girl (performed by Charlene Chio and Computer) Miyan Choi is the best thing going on in this movie. You can learn from half of Canto-Pop Group "Twins" and other movies like "The Twins Effect" (a fun flick) and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly well-played / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, being an incognito imp and all, rarely recognizable with his warts, snogged teeth, doughy nose, and is hunched back. Unless the computers hold him and make it beautiful, which makes it worse. TS passable, but all supporting actors were abysmal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I am able to atonement that the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very nice fan Bing-Bing) came out and started talking to Marlowo (!) Tipitkar, Who was practicing martial arts in Spider. Man Costume (!!) But this is not a mockery. Of course, there is the discipline of Hong Kong, but the film takes a lot of scenes from romance and Patos (corresponding to Slidehammering of Volines and Developer Sales) and enthusiastic steps and adventurous scenes. <br /> <br /> You can think that you can look for Netflix rent and it will not cost you anything. (Oh, but it will cost you, okay). <br /> <br /> Have something to say? Of course. Vibrant colors (they're the best thing about this movie). And filmmakers must be trying very hard. Very bad all efforts went to a movie that is not more than a bad video game.
