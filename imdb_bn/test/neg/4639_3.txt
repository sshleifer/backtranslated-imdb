The new celebrity execution is terrible. They kill popular people and win less budget celebrities. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'Flip? Lil Flip and Lil Wayne both should die. Lil 'sucks the flip. The fight between Lil 'Zone and Lil' and the Lil Flip was MAD Connie and brief. They should just kill them all. Why does Tobi lose Jake and lose Adam Adam? They are good actors and superheroes. They spend a lot of time talking instead of war, which can encourage viewers. Everything is thrown for some reason, they just can not make a long fight? The old deathmatch is way better.
