"Battle your blood" Rambo said at the beginning of the film, "Do not Fight It". What is the ball Did the script writer Mikey get out of Sly? It is impossible to miss the joke of any person with primary school education. Nevertheless, Stallone does it without the indication of satire. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor is applicable to movies. Rambo IV was a very extreme, stupid activist who was deliberately funny if not deliberately violent. One of the most harmful fantasy fantasy, where villains are so dangerous, just not enough to kill them ?? You have to dismember them with the taste. Stallone did not stop to close his point in a blue-collar clinic. Dieting for the main villain, it is not enough to have the type of fire drying in the kids - throwing-pigs, throwing. He is also a pedophile gay. <br /> <br /> What is the IMDB? It took the hand of the Rifle Society? How high is this cruel excuse for that high absorption rate? I like a good action movie as next man, but do not entertain this ?? This is the vulgarity of violent pornography, which ultimately disallows Myanmar's true tragedy. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly does not stop her shirt. For this I will give it a star ...
