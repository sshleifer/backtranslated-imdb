This was last night on TV. I painfully forced my way through her, and barely made it through. Firstly, apart from Lorraine, Hillary, and probably Coco, no other student seems to care about us. It did not have any value like HSPA, just sign in to the point line and you're in it. <br /> <br /> The lines in the story were blurred and clear. Doris was simply incredibly awful. The gay man ran so far away (funny that there was only one gay man in school, right ...) I like the character of the layer, but your teacher should call it obscenity and then should be sent to the lorry packing by hypocrisy. Looks like Lisa looks somewhere else, and since she was not a talent, wondering why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I could rate this one star (terrible), but the music was not bad, and I fell in love. If the students became attractive and actually had some genius, they had some talent but it worked better.
