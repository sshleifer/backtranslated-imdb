When the film starts, it is clear to how old and sick children are. Although Oliver Hardy is very much, it is Stanley, who is as bright as death. Apparently, he was seriously ill during production and probably lost most of the weight. Although he will eventually recover and save one and a half years, he looks like a dead man. Besides, when I watched the film, I was amazed at how much Stanley had taken the Prattflas - I was hoping to release half of her body to her. I do not understand why they came out of retirement due to their health - especially when the story and production with this movie are poor like price. <br /> <br /> Stanley is an island and a boat heir. Olitin, a permanent man, when he literally falls into the boat and starts to find the island, then he and Oli are ready to leave. Along the way, they discovered that Giovanni had moved away, but still four men became friends and lived on another island. It seems like paradise and they are all very happy. A little later, a beautiful young girl joins them and shows everything grand. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the area is flooded with refresh. Finally, the people can hang up and decide four people - at that time the island returns to the sea and the men are protected. <br /> <br /> I'll give some credit to the movie and be interesting for it. However, this is not a thing FUNNY - and it is disabled for Laurel and Hardy Flick. Although not a bad film, it is certainly not a good one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Although it may not be a very bad movie (it is big), it sure! Seeing this film is painful and clear to people after serious accidents.
