Hard to work hard on Brad Sykes, a hard working person who loves her is honest on her, which often lacks with other micro-budget managers. Look at the small crew credits of Camp Blood, their normal gratitude is not all in the pizzas, they ate with Brad and his friends, and this is not any dirty trash. Jennifer Richelp is not your average horror flicker, but you are well enough to tell, Bethany Jolt sees you as a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny that it hurts. The clown is rarely a bad guy in a horror film, but the design is good, Shame Mosley does a good job of bringing her to life, and the picture fits nicely with the rural backdrop. Camp Blood finds it as horrible and basic as blue collar, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just one thing.
