Although it is true that the film is a little fun, but many executioners (blood leather dolls of many leathers, I spit on your grave, and born in Flames) to execute the execution. I do not think it is obscene, but it is in the eyes of obscene observers: If it works as obscene for somebody, then who will tell me that he is wrong? In the general thoughtful review of Winkimation ("As a shame"), I was rather rather confused that "once we actually see the face of a man." A few years ago I freelance review occasionally for an adult mag and when they came I saw many people's faces. I think when some of the male porn "stars" (and especially when the man is the director) in this movie, their features are more common. Although I can not mention a specific title vaguely, I know there are some events of Ron Jeremy, oh, work. I do not even know that I would agree that when a person comes, his weakness is seen.
