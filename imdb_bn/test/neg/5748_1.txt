First of all, I want to make it clear that I willingly present myself to watch horror movies. I saw what I saw as the worst. In my opinion, films did not get anything worse than DEBs, Leprechun 6: Back 2 The Hood, and Terror Storm Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Pirates movie, without any exaggeration, is the best movie in the world. I was informed before the film was really awkward, but I did not believe in the allegations. When I tell you that this film is just hate for movies. <br /> <br /> It starts with a 3-minute clip of pirate boat, apparently in the middle of a war. "End" splashes across the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the actual end of the movie. The movie is about an unexpected, unknowingly innocent girl called Magell, which carries around a gatebo blaster and is vaguely attracted to gay pirate boys. She drowns and falls in love with Frederick, like a very dressed scank that took place when she came out of the ocean. He might actually be gay. Pirates King has a Ruby and Diamond steaded codpiece. When he spoils it, he laughs. <br /> <br /> singing in this movie It's a ridiculous musical that you can have impression. It's not Trust me They're looking for any bad songs that you've heard, and at the end of the first melody you break your ornaments. <br /> <br /> There are "references" in other movies. By reference, of course, I mean "clear rip off." The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clausau and Lightbabber was really frustrating. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is painful to listen at its best moments. The horror is terrible, and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene, which is not very well hidden. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, there are shadows of curiosity but your mind about this movie, to get rid of it. There is a time when people want to see how bad things are, but this film is not worth it. Keep it completely in your mind and do not worry about it again. If you cherish your mental capacity, then I pray to you, never see this movie.
