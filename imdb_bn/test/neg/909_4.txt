The story begins at the house of a little girl, who is going on a birthday party, and both mothers and fathers both worked quietly and kept with each other. They take their daughter forward for their presence, and they face each other in the face while they give their child this expression, "I hope she would love it!" Film and a murder of Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Carebridge), 2000 "Ripper", involved in the case due to family ties. Julia is working hard to be a doctor, and this special murder hinders her whole life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View to the Top", is a neighboring neighbor in the same apartment as on July 03, and he finally goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie, but it's definitely not crazy, unless you like the location of a Canadian movie and look like a native Catherine Mary Stewart in Canada.
