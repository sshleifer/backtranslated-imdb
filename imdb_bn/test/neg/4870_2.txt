This movie is filled with so stupid moments that you are surprised how you made it. For example, they enter the squire from the Capitol and when they are in the sieves, you can see the signs pointing to different government buildings, and then they come in the middle of the street! I am very doubtful that government buildings will provide public access through the sewer system. However, I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because of its comic quality. I laughed completely through the stupidity of everybody involved in this movie.
