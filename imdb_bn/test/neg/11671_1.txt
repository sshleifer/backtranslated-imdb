Like the previous two 'Mad Max' movies, 'Mad Max Binder Thunderdom' is not a part of a violent and strange plot. In Mad Mac Post-War society where he can get rid of master blaster and children get tomorrow's 'land tomorrow'. It is usually a safe film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pig and strange characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it gave me nothing. I did not feel inspired after watching this picture; The only decent thing about this image is a very strange character that has been highlighted in various ways throughout the film. It was very strange for me, and it was very very dull.
