This video is based on a true story of the cheap Flick Direct. I do not doubt it. This does not mean that it is not particularly attractive (unless you are one of the main characters, actually living with this experience). A young woman named Angela bought a big, big old country in reality, really cheap. Well, we all know from the horror movies, when you're buying a big house cheap usually it is scared of any form, shape or form. In fact, the second house is being handed over to Angela, the house that the wise boy was, now takes time to "introduce" Angel in a moment! Nice guy, is not it? Angela communicates with a psychological and abnormal specialist and says that her house is spectral and invites her to come and see the ghosts for them. They come to a party and are sure to roam around, sit on the sofa, hang in the garage and try to persuade people in the bathroom. Some friends fall asleep at night, horses and sworn do not return home again. (See the girl who was killed, "I'm scared, I'm scared." Absolutely stupid. If she is so scared that she does not get up, she knees down?) The demons do not really have to stop (And there is no flurry or lightness about them. They look like regular people). They steal celery in the kitchen, puts the chair around the La Poulterizist and seduces a bisexual female ghost Angela, who, get this, does not seem to mind! This scene plays like soft-core porn to see you in the spice channel. (Umm ... I did not know! Actress is not your ideal porn star though. They should hit the beach and the gym more. When Angela does not make love to the dead, she becomes crazy and she is standing alone in a room, shouting, "Why do not you go away? It's my house! Get out!" They do not leave. I could not help but always think of the emotional Silvio Brown on TV that if you have a ghost in your house then you should quietly make sense with the soul and say, "Look, you have died, cross the other side, in other words, get out! "According to Silvia Brown, unless your adverse and nasty about it, they will leave! Looks like this movie costs about 50 dollars to make it. It has a really cheap feeling, and has bad acting. I could make this image with 5 friends and a camcorder.
