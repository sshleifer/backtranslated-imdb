The eugenet has been shut down, so I was not ready for heavy (and I think heavy heavy) religious themes. I was neither Satan's disciple nor any other, but very heavy elephants. On top of <br /> <br />, the acting stunk. It might have got good boys to play bad guys, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful cool movies were involved, so the director might want to check out any of the fans in style, but get ready with the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> The editing was somewhat frustrating. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Closed the squares against a white 240Z. Wheel spin, camera change, and know, that white 240Z is transmogrified in a white civic. <br /> <br /> I leave early, so I can not vouch for its moral effect. But I would like to say that this type of film is fully publicized to the singers. If the director / writer / producer was trying to bring religion to the unknown street people, they all went wrong about it. I think I would like to see an adult diaper commercial for us to listen to a slow Bible Thumpper about Jesus' death. Yawn <br /> <br />
