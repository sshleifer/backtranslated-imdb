Well, for this film to work here - you have to accept the following for the film - A woman who was killed is alive again at the end of the film, a detective stopped asking the fog of a dead woman because a newspaper journalist did not ask her, and she The same reporter, knocked on by a good looking blonde in the night court for suspicious behavior Judge him off the hook with his wife in exchange for giving up the air. Are you following me I do not just have any ideas that you have to stop times and repeat the pictures repeat scenes. In the end, blond (Claudia Dale) and journalist (Richard Hemingway) are married, but I have no idea how they came to the conclusion. Actually, I do not understand how filmmakers came to the conclusion of this flick. Oh, I think there is a little bit of entertainment here here for its uninterrupted money, but if it has some pieces of it also it was nice. Still, I'm not ready to add it to my top ten worst list. I think the night with the bird woman could save it to the club scene. But why was the movie? I just do not know.
