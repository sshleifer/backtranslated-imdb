If you want to create a love story, create a love story, but if you want to use a disaster movie title please, please, please enough to show me this disaster, please see this film, Gishen Riteau or a gazila movie. Please show that the man who wanted to scream and break the building was in the movie Aja did not get a chance to. Don does not make me wrong, I love disaster movies and I love the original Nihin Chimbootu and Gishen, I also like the last Poseidon, there is no story in it, but a very good and graphic disaster sequence, New Nihin Chimbutu is losing the point of pearl ports or tomorrow After many days but at least these films show good disaster sequence and with the costly FX The excitement does not show anything that does not show me, until you destroy them properly I know, I want to hear like a nightmare, but I loved the love when I was going to see a romantic movie, Grrrrrr and Kimchi Sansi cried to me and the movie did not : T There is also a TV series named Chippetsu, created in 1975, I have a DVD and it is even better
