Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Von, Keitel etc. One of the great actors think that this star parade might really warm up this movie, but not so. Trivola also played the role of Chilean palmer, but this time we have already seen gangsters who wish luck in the difficult world of making movies, it is not funny anymore. This is a common problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first is good, the second will be twice as good, no, the first was original, the second could be the second, Hugh Hollywood could try to duplicate the originality, you give us a new budget , Not only the same movie again made with a big budget. I found my nature constantly when I was watching this movie, I was still very laughing, but still got many wonderful actors like Harv Cittel, James Woods, Vince Von and The Rock, and for that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
