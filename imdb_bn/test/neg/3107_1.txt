Do not hire this movie. I ended up buying this "previously seen" tape for $ 4.00. Thinking about that a rental price was around, so I could buy it well. After finishing this review I'm tossing it. The movie played by Lvie is a music video that performs several lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and bad edits. I thought I wanted to see a stupid action flick, which I wanted to see, I did not even get it. This film is an exercise in slow shot, no scripts, close-ups, terrible edits, and a badly developed plot. I can not believe that it actually ends with a scene that they think viewers think about letters. At the end of the film, we still do not know who they really are. Believe in the theorem, stay away.
