Yes, I felt after watching this movie. The average and special effects of acting are terrible. Actually, the worst I ever seen. This is a very low budget movie. There is no way that this movie can make you scared, it does not have any horrific or alarming moments. Mr. Hannah Eater was a fun animal for me. It might be a lot better but oh well they did not have a big budget. The film failed to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. I'll name this movie The Time Eater (Water). I'm sure you have a lot better movie / etc. Still see this: 1. There is nothing else to see. 2. You get to see it for free. Do not rent all rentals.
