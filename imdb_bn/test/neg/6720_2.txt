Three words: what a stack ..... two words: do not disturb! One word: Sakad! There are zero reasons to see this movie. Even those Segal groups will move away from this movie. Martial arts, usually Aikido, terrific. Martial arts itself is running, but cinematography is kinder. Whenever Sigal gives his victims "place to assassinate", the film goes slow. Worse, it shows the same steps three times faster than the three slightly different angles. How stupid Seagal's performance was simple, stupid, but I still played for the role of this movie "6" because the role of "villain" was actually quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid. Seagal is playing a federal express agent with a license to kill. His character also has dedicated work ethics which means that all his packages are delivered to the people at the right time - there is no extra charge - and nothing is going on in his way. The killer, the political leader, the explosion, and even death. <br /> <br /> I hope for a certain level of violence in the martial arts film, but most of the scenes in this movie are fierce and fearsome acts of violence which lends itself to any means of progressing in the movie or its stories. This movie has gone directly to the video and there are a few reasons to avoid it. Nobody should be bothered with this trip. <br /> <br />
