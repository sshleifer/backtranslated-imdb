I rent this picture, it would be great just by film cover. The judge and the jury had biker with a beautiful gun and pulled out most of the best assassin who beat his wife, but the film became increasingly stupid. David Keith is an extraordinary actor, especially when he plays a very bad role, the movie was a piece of depression, it actually spoils his talent. The judge and the jury spoke very well, I gave it 3, for 2 it should be given, because David Keith's gun was calm, I gave it an extra star.
