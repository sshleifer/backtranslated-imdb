'Bloody Birthday' is a seamless and sometimes humorous low budget budget horror along the lines of Micky or the less intelligent version of 'The Good Sona'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Set in a small California city, three children were born at a height of a planet, where asteroid alignment means they are born without emotion. After ten years, our three small psychotherapies were victims of murder, parents, siblings, teachers and others who went away with them. Only a teenage girl knows to be able to stop the truth. Why children born in the world are not equally the same at the same time but there is no explanation about where you go there <br /> <br /> It is very violent for a slash film and it's very long in Gore, which I think is the problem of casting small characters like killers Highlighting as you can express young actors. Rather, it's funny and somewhat annoying that three-ten year old people plan to kill and use their guns, knives, and crossover to plan their plans. While showing the dark side of the real sunny girl, the boys are very convincing about their role as well as being intelligent enough to play with their innocent characters, because they know the true real girl. <br /> <br /> 'Bloody Birthday' is a horrifying and bloody blood-like medieval phenomenon, but it is a risk factor for having children like murder, because it is as unique as it is. If there is nothing else to see one.
