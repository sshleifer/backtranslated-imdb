Millo's slash of Flick Mickey's full hole in 1992, if you actually see it, then both movies have the same tagline! But if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie, there is absolutely no plot ... good film for you. The terrible and flashback scenes of acting are extremely confusing. The story behind this torture is easily a child with Milo Zyder's serious family problem, her father was an abortion doctor who kept abnormal futures in a garbage (NICE!) And frustrated for her own child, she found a way to give life to one of the isolated children And he gave him the name ............. <br /> <br /> All bad acting, awesome directions, the sound of annoying Milo and the sound of breaking the bells on his bike, if you remove all the badges, then it is still a bad but interesting effort film. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a bank blowing 10 out of 1
