This movie was produced by Costa Rica's biggest producer. Although their writer Costa Rica was proud of it as the greatest film of all time ever, and her actor even used to say that she did not get Oscar nomination due to political relevance with oil (she, right) ... well, these are all lies. This film was supposed to be based on a book about a love triangle (a topic like the Super Clive Soap opera) of the Colo Salazar Herrera, and it is a secondary oil company exploring the oil problem in the region on the coastal Costa Rica Atlantic coast, but explore the oil Until it was not approved by the government. Now, it may have some nice footage about the beach, but that's it; Nothing bigger than this ... it's in the camera. Most actors are lousy, without two or three. The lack of understanding of what acting means: they mostly overact. The story is quite simple and cliche, which I have said as a cheap Mexican soap opera. Because the crew advertised it as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the film is based on the stupid love triangle. The script can not make any impact, it is very easy and the dialogues are not very worried. It has also received some editing problems regarding some of the changes in the scene ... but it's also pretty cool. The director has done just that, that is, he is not like Oliver Stone, but he worked with the work he had done. I want to ask him why he used to spend most of the money on foreigners instead of using Castrican actors .. I mean that they are proud to be 100% Costa Rican Productions ... that's the least hope you have. The final end is not done well, there are errors and details do not match or are vain. In addition to the most elaborate movie in all Costa Rican history, I think it is intermediary. You can make more interesting and better picture ways with less cash. Ever heard of "pie"? However, if you are interested in Costa Rican or Central American film, it will do one, but you definitely have not lost anything.
