My age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Siegel, has been sent by Kenyan Ivory Wains to help Detective Jim Campbell, in order to solve a series of murders, whose victims are crucified. Since the coil has reached the spot, he has noticed that the killings have changed somewhat and it seems there is a different killer. When his former wife is killed, he becomes personal, and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell investigates mysterious coils, and finds out about a very shady past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I enjoy action movies, but the worst actors I've ever seen. This movie is not quite funny, incredibly stupid, and obviously Steven Siegel's acting performance is absolutely awesome. Although Keenen Ivory Wayans is not very bad, though. The only freedom fighter in this movie is sometimes a good footing scene, although most of the time, due to the absence of the reason, it is very difficult. The plot of this photo is absolutely lazy. I do not care for it all. The past "shiny people" of Sigal's character was stupid, fights and fights in the Mafia were almost due to any reason.
