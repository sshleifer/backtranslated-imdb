Set in a post-apocalyptic future, a small quadrant called the quimin MacLeod is being mentored by a small tamer, a new Ramirez, while his younger sister tag is advised as well as their campaign for the destruction of an evil immortal overlord. To do this, all knowledge of other immortals must be absorbed before Quantin before this immortality. Courtton, Quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching is a "nightmare I am a reluctant hero" way for me, And he is not an immortal and at least not easy to catch it, that can not be killed. Ramirez used to do better to punish him and destroy the corton.
