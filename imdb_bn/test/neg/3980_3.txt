Like most people, I saw this movie "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it has received some well-deserved barbes, it is one of the more well-known movies on the show. <br /> <br /> Nowadays it's even better than your average Hollywood blockbuster. It poses some interesting moral conflict Although the score is sometimes unmanageable, Richard also provides some lovely moments while walking through the river. Seeing the film, you can see where many plot developments are probably very good on paper. An interesting problem to consider Richard's uncomfortable problem in modern society, and the last part was probably the 70-style Manfac, if the previous things were not so secretive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is cheap in appearance, making the error all the more obvious. "Clone Firm" may very likely work as a college campus, and a main plot point of beer. Lena and Richard have zero chemistry - we believe that this is a meeting of logical mind, but they do not seem to be a brain cell. The "cranky old couple" schtick also gets real old, real quick. There are some mistakes that may be made to blame bad choices, such as the decision to make climatic conversations beyond access to any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> Finally, a great effort, but still see the best MST3K.
