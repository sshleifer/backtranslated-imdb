Oh dear! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, I have been feeling a little frustrated of every film I've seen over the past year, and I am deeply revisited about what kind of movie I like now! (Maybe I can see romance flick from now) <br /> <br /> Speaker Alert! (And that's not saying much!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This flick is so foolly intelligent! Special Effect Clearly, the Big Mac truck was stupid with its roller coaster seat control, the assassin robots looked like a more stupid version of the power rangers, a huge fat man was first coming out of the port hole window gun. .. space truck school ??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The compulsory 'sex scene' (snicker!) Was performed so badly, among our young heroes, I almost smiled on my TV screens. <br /> <br /> The notable character is the pirate ship captain / cyborg / this attack mad scientist. He had exaggerated the remarkable word and was lazy, predictably, but I believed that he could have been more deadlier. He said and told funny things (all the scenes involved him!) So for the captains I give this movie an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this flash is so bad that it will want to misuse your TV or maybe throw your TV in the window! It can kill even some brain cells and keep it in an isolated condition. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Captain likes the path to walk around his peg leg when he is clearly a fake groin leg !! I could give 0 out of 10, but he trapped me with my stupid antics ... this flicker gets 1/10!
