In terms of quality movies, it is not one of them. It was actually the first Chuck Norris movie I saw and I was pretty overwhelmed. There is not a lot of battle scenes slow and different. Norris uses a lot of kicks roundhouse on all the bad guys coming after her which makes just quite annoying battles. The film is very small, but for some reason the film does not seem to finish yet. It's a fantastic anti-climax ending. Although similarly, I have seen many bad movies, and this is the worst one I've seen. It's a clock price, I'm particularly speculating for the Norris fans. There is nothing like a rock group injured beneath the desert, in my opinion the movie was highlighted.
