What a mess - and I'm not mentioning "destruction" in the title. I can go to hacked plot, lazy effects, (actually notable) cast grimes because they provide the worst lines of their careers. I would say that there was no palm tree in Chicago for the last time. Check it out, and leave it on. <br /> <br /> Hmmm .. to post this IMDB, it will take ten lines ... OK, well, I think a DVD release with Outdex can be interesting. Perhaps in the future, to present this item, it will reveal to any party to be invited. Maybe Diane West should show the bag to get involved with us. Maybe the CBS will apologize for the hanging ...
