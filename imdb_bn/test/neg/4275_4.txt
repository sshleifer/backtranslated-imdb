All right, I have not read the book yet, but I have to say that the main character was wrong. How do I say that you did not read this book that you read? It's normal. As a miniseries, I became anxious by the method, gesture and main character Fanny Price. It can be a good person, but it can be a stick of mud creature that refrains from facing someone face to face or otherwise fulfills their views. In addition to the additional "Susan B. Anthony" profile, he refused to look at the other person. Edmond is pouring his heart, he looks straight at the whole time, compelled him to do the same. As a result, it was just painful and I could not love both Henry and Edmund alone. Many have said that it was true for the book, if that is so, it is hard to believe that Jane Austen will make such a character as his main heroine. It is possible to create a character that is established by others and is successful in achieving their faith and hard work, but this illustration of these small images did not do this for me.
