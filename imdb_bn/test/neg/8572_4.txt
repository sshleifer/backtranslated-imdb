To make six students unforgettable in a convent - a murderer who was overbearing murder. Now, eighteen years later, Nun's soul has returned and retaliated for his murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, basically it's short. There is more than that, but I do not have any sources yet. The only spiritual effect of the really cool thing was that, I was quite impressed for being less budget flick. I'm confused about whether I am in English. Most actors are Italian, and even here the title is in Italian language, yet they spoke English in the movie (I think, or it is dubbed, I can not say yet). <br /> <br /> However, the real foundation of the movie is quite stupid, and the end is not only sensible, it does not ... well ... do not understand.
