Why TV can not be made a good movie, I was happy today and saw this movie in a satellite channel in the UK. It's a terrible waste of time in my life. Poor set, poor performance and oh my God is a terrible flood. <br /> <br /> I really want people to make TV movies using good effects, good or low credible plots and better acting. The killer floods up well with poor performance. Some bits of ham can not do any bad thing. <br /> <br /> 1 Final issue I really agree with the comment about dogs, but I believe it will be frustrating in real life!
