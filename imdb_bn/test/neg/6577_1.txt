How does this prove the hit movie series with a paramount studio and it can draw almost with budget and formula? In this movie, less than the amount of TMP has cost less, which you can understand as long as there are 10 gaps in the making of movies. $ 40 TMP cost will be equivalent to about 75 million dollars in 1989. This photo was not given the right opportunity for the director to manage other films. Every time he turned around, the studio slashed the budget and claimed the story. Most of Roddenberry and Shatner agreed that it was a new story that the work of the new directors had been strong enough, but after all the machines were completed, finally the end was a vague story and badly executed. Special series is not eligible for the original series, much less a major motion picture. The most exhaustive example: - All of the fascus effects appear to be critically endangered and are fake-looking. - The enterprise shots were going to halt great, so obviously zoomed away from a stem-frame shot. At the end of the enterprise that popsicle stick was successfully matted out. God "chasing" Kirk on the mountain ... Igdes, they can climb to Godzilla on the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985" and use thumb sticks to stop film ties. Electric Bolts come out of his eyes on the fantastic Captain Kirk ... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the look of the last scene. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Star Trek VI. A photo reporter ...
