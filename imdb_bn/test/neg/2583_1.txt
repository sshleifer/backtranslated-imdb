I saw it at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seems curious - how wrong I was! For 50 years - I saw the worst movie could be easily! I watched the director my age (b. 1948) and lived with Niko of the Velvet Underground, which led us to Andy Warhol, in a nutshell, I thought when I saw it - nothing that happened in 24 hours of the Warhol. It's not industry, it's annoying. <br /> <br /> In particular: black and white. Okay, maybe ... but what's the purpose here? Of course, their color was in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the subtitles were white, naturally. I do not think I missed a lot, but about 20% of them are illegal. Next, it is a chronological sequence, but seemingly random events have been cast. The purpose of the dialogue with the old people of the dinner table? It adds nothing to the movie. There were many similar scenes - almost anyone takes a camcoder and portrays random people and divides them together to create a movie. <br /> <br /> Plot? None. There are some rocks at the "riot" that occasionally closes the rock. Most of the time it shows people (far away!) Standing around. Repetitive opiate smoking is just annoying. When the main character got a cute girlfriend, I perked up, but not, he was very annoying! This is probably the only French movie I saw that does not stop their clothes. Perhaps they were very annoyed. <br /> <br /> romance? None. The girl seems completely indifferent to everything - maybe she has some interest in the sculpture, but if it does, then we are not shown it. We all are unappealing because the characters are completely indifferent to the fate. Probably all of this?
