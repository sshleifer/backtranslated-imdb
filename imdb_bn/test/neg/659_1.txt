The cheesiest movie I've ever seen, scary, just bad. The first movie made by WWE, and believe me, the only person who can apply for the film is wrestling fans. It played terrible and I still have the worst guidance seen. I find myself smiling, and smiling bad actors. I have seen that WWE people have tried a lot of hard work to do many wrestling in Christying and there are several camera effects. I think they have many copies from silent hills. This movie does not attract any way, so if you see it, you are going to find yourself because of the lack of suspension. Finishing worst, no matter, you'll want to refund your money out
