I never saw Net during the Liberation War, remembering to pass it in medium reviews, and then watching a snippet here and there during the television session. It is coming now, fourteen years after the original publication, I got a little leaked about how much time was flying. In my age of 20, it seems to be my childhood ancient. I think I can do some exercise before starting my fat stack in all the wrong places in my body. Cut on fat and sugar. Much more coffee and cigarettes <br /> <br /> However, for me, this movie was the best part of the experience. I would say the first 30 minutes of this film really kept me with the opposite heaven. They look bigger ones who call computer. Look, they chat in the chat room! I remember that tank top! They look ... Fool. And hey, even Sandra Bullock too. First bill! <br /> <br /> <br /> As a movie, The Net is an unimaginable, general and complete routine Hitcobian Cat and Mouse Thriller. Nothing old about this, they made them as soon as they made. Bullak plays a complete computer nerd who works, fixes the software for those who do not get "the whole computer thing". As it happens, she stumbles over some delicate information and ends up hiring a sexy killer until her holidays end up killing a murderer (played by Jeremy Northam), and he smacks both an American movie and guy and should be doubted by this doubt. There is a British accent!) He gets his "identity removed". Empty his house, for sale, and check it out, it turns out that he now got a new identity. A convicted prostitute and impostor, less. <br /> <br /> Now you can say that it is unlikely. How could they possibly do that? Even in 1995, it is impossible! This is true, but many people who came back in '95 did not even know about the internet. I can see how it was a plot hole that you could take back. The inconsistency that does nothing to do with technology is a lot more crushing. The film is likely to have a huge amount of hits in Hitakoos (it is one of the thrillers that travels during the night), but Hitko has always ensured that her films are well-respected creators. While trying to prove their innocence, the characters did not act like a confused dog and the plot was not easily set up for structures where an obstacle was inevitable. The letters also tried a little before giving up in the whole rouge chase. Does Bullock's character ever have any friends ever? No old high school teacher can confirm his identity? Or is his nearest pizza guy? Oh well, he ordered pizza from the internet. Do not miss anything. You figure out the movie very quickly. There seems to be a former boyfriend's hope. You really think that? You should always count at least one surprise. Net does not offer anyone. <br /> <br /> The Internet creates many dangers, this movie seems to predict. But, today's movie has been created, Imagine convincingly that the problems that villains have to ensure will be conceived. Not only do they have to do all the annoying things, yet they will be subscribed to Facebook, at least 100 friends or similar, and do not mention the tags of the photo, YouTube or Link-In, and what they can mention about it. His video blog 150 daily hits, or his home webcam and other people's cell phone, webcam, his video has been recorded in web download ... his IMDB membership?
