That difference will go to HARROW DUNGEON. Ed Wood was a delusional attempt at producing science fiction at least for a short time, during which the suspicious "star" power of Luigusi, Vampira, Torr Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot was. HARROW's Dungeon has no redeeming attributes. Perhaps Dr. Island's style may have a striking and suspicious plot about a soil elite on constipation. Morawu or mysterious islands, heavy dialogues and performers by MonoTonal actors, whose lines sink into the stupid sea like a silly sea. The "special effects", which are held in the bathtub, make the film more fierce. Even some of the Victorian interpretations of leprosy treatment in the Bible. In its final stages can not be contracted with leprosy from a person, it can be ensured that Aristocat phallon and his lady infect Kasprada disease and the real inhabitants of Castle de Saad end up in the end, are wasted for insanity and inhuman cruelty. . It is playful that a member of dance does not make any other film. No wonder, talent talent talent! The lack of talent ignorance, where this film should find its extraordinary end.
