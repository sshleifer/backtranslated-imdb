I have a number of other numbers that have been cleared by all other critics already! This movie is horrific! Except terrible ... In fact, it is so impossible that they still did not bring a word to describe the horrors of "fictional man". If you expect the minimum logic and plot characteristics of your movies, you have to stay away from the human way. Of course, this sunny cap is being loaded with this skeleton-doll, but does anyone get annoyed to explain it properly, where he comes from or why he is so angry with the world. He saw the "Master of the universe" in the sketter and like a crossover from the "sleepy ollow" of races, and some angels carried Ashok in the desert. Another complete opposite aspect of "Sculpton Man" setting! For almost half an hour, I thought that this movie took place on a small isolated island, but it played only on the mainland where the fancy highway crosses the jungle and the power stations are located at the end of the jungle! is not it? Why everybody pretends to fall into the trap of going for one million escapes? However, after a couple of completely random assassinations, a special commando squad, led by poor-washed Michael Rumer, came and they do not know anything about a demon victim. Really ridiculous that every member of this team is presenting himself as a specialist in the field (our sniper expert, tracking genius, drill coach ...), but before they all die, demonstrate their supposed efficiency skills! The terrible God certainly hated Caspar Van Deen, because he was present again, portrayed a hero soldier, who did not steal a truck for any reason, was upset at the highway, but just as he died back in the middle of the desert. All right, it understands ... as well as stealing cool one-fishing devices from "predetermine" characters, the bone horse continuously changes color, helicopters are brought with bows and arrows, ordinary bullets explode the tree, and completely untouched Vietnam flashbacks Michael RÃ¶mer Hunt. . I say that we all combine the forces and vote for this kind of charity in the top 100 ASAP below IMDB!
