I am glad this is the end of 40 public mummies. The movies were of different varieties, and this film was certainly a small number. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this is a very slow moving movie, which is not really interesting or exciting. Mami could have been better if she entered the movie before. Instead, the film spends its first 20 minutes again, explaining what happened to the previous Mummy movie, again using the archive footage from "The Mummy" again in 1932, which follows the film's fourth Mummy movie. 1932 Mummy Story The film never knows the real speed of motion and even though the film is still for more than an hour, it still feels a bit like a drag. <br /> <br /> This course will not help the film but it's a rather straightforward and actually very little interesting story. The film is quite hesitant. The first and second half of the movie does not connect to each other and they feel like two different movies on themselves. <br /> <br /> At least Lone Chaney Jr is still there. For the third time, he reiterated the role of Mummy Khariz again. Very bad that he has such limited screen time during this time. Mummy character itself is a big waste that she gets unfortunately very little interesting. The film is more futile with more shameless actors, who are almost playing with fools. It was so unnecessary to me that most of the letters used to speak such words, and in fact it became quite boring and boring at points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
