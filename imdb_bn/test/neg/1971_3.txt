There were so many reasons why this movie could be great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Siena Giloir She was very hot in this film and I was reason to visit it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 2. Team Curry Wonderful bad guy and I'm always excited to see him in movies (even home alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3 Jason Donovan For all of you Australian and Poms, it's a rare behavior. Ex-neighboring Star 80's Heart-Thrab Drug Drug Sale <br /> <br /> Not one of these things, and this film is about drug / raw culture that has been directed to make the film even remotely interesting. The script was neutral, performance general and J. D. Despite the scenes and scenes with Siena, I did not find anything beautiful about this movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
