It is easy for a film that just tries to be suspicious of jumping until discouraged. This will happen most often. Dark Harbors are not only reluctant, but it is done very badly. The scene after the scene is otherwise tacked overdone premises. A sad couple only shows up on a troublesome stranger to find more troubles. <br /> <br /> Some movies create stories to create excitement. Dark Harb adds his story but it never puts on the building. I hope, like other movies, the mystery will eventually explode. It's not Also, there is no continuation of the scene from the characters scene. They could work one way in one scene, but then another view worked in a completely different way. First of all, you think that they are simply out of character, but at the end you realize that they are not actually letters. They are just props for the final bend. The final ten minutes try to be frustrated. Instead, it is rather lame and reluctant. The only disappointment for me was that the movie finally ended. In less than 90 minutes, the film still feels a long way. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the least budget gems. It's like a fraud watch that breaks as soon as it grows.
