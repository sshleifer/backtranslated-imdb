Just saw this movie. I do not read books. There is nothing new about this film. <br /> <br /> Bad people do not seem to be slaughtered with a few slashes, how many times their hero is stuck with a big sword, he looks at the same (ISA)! There are different action scenes but they are very fake. Movie makers believe that whenever they do not bother the battlefield, they will close the camera, move quickly, and start the music ... ..... I feel like making it again. <br /> <br /> I appreciate them trying to deal with the dark story without the usual Hollywood cheese but I regret that the filmmakers have unfortunately failed. Characters are dimensional in 2. We rarely know them or think for them. Leadership is an impressive farmer's voice of arrogance ... though he does not seem to say much ... <br /> <br /> If you are not disturbed and get half of it, do not be bothered to see it. Price from blockbusters ....
