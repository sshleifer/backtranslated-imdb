Humor does not exist in this damaged film of a movie. The head of the carrot is a surfer dancer inventor who consistently plays hammer on his fool, hired money on vain inventions. Then he helped an old guy broken down on the street, and voila, he is a big corporation successor. And on and after and envy relatives, corporations, hostile takeovers, humanizing the interest of compulsory love .. aargh ... just going to say this movie. The key to the carrot was not satisfied to let me go to her strong show.
