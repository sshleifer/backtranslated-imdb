Breaking Dawn begins in a college in California, Professor Simon (Associate Producer Joe Morton) tells his students that their six-week study of the psychiatric patient at Cape State Hospital would have to be studied as an important part of their education, failing and they would never be able to become qualified doctors. Ew (Kelly Overton) is a bright, young, attractive and intelligent student who is studying particularly difficult patients. His name is Don Weke (James Henen) and a guilty murderer, he covered his body with the body of a woman (Deeen Verona) and his little girl (Jeanette McCunky). First did not even see Dawn Evey saying very little, but like a soldier he is trying to find out Eva. Finally Dawn started talking, but what he says is afraid of Eve, he says that someone is watching him and mentioning the name Malach. Eve then began to see the image of a dark galaxy in each of its runways, Don destroys the conspiracy theories and bizarre statements, and the eve began to lose his mind gradually because the lines between fantasy and reality became even more obscure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, we're all going to finish a good wrap, Ultimately, it surprises us, it works well with the rest of the film and because of our memory, six senses (1999) and Fight Club (1999) are just two good examples and for the naming of the end of the film, such as Scrum (1996), where the killer The identity comes in a wonderful surprise and The not clear. Then, there are definitely some movies that have finished all of them before and have taken an example, oh I do not know Breaking Dawn because I have never seen the horrible ending of such a movie, never. Breaking Dawn starts with a wonderful thing started with Eve, as a psychological horror thriller, sometimes not the highest action packed film by any side of imagination, but it is related to interest, it is sometimes not the most dry film, but it is much more than watching and It's not bad until it's a bad movie, I need to mention it because ATTIC In any other place (which was right to be justified) suddenly became irrelevant. I am sure there are people who think that the worst case of their funeral has been finalized, I can say that nobody can satisfy me and explain this thing to me. It's not a bit of knowledge and I will never be as concerned. Breaking Dawn is frustrating and it is wasted while rewarding it with the most perfect ending of film history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It was destroyed in the editing room but I think it was probably more than a rubbish script because he tried to stop all illusions together in a few muddled minutes of space and am blessed with the final shot To give all happy. He made quite a lot of excitement in the first 80 odd minutes but at the end of the day is absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Technically breaking Dawn is good and it is usually made well throughout life. Acting is quite good, overturns are beautiful and easy to eye and puts a decent performance. Konyal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), John D. of Italian Sled Classic, like Canball. Ferox (1981), Stagefoot (1987) and The Church (1989)? All right, maybe it was just my ... <br /> <br /> Breaking Dawn Rubbish, for the last few minutes I hate everyone. I do not misunderstand that it does not excite me until that moment, but it was right. Surely I can avoid as much anxiety as it seems to be a fair part of positive comments on IMDB ...
