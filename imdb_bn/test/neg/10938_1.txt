Eat Oh, this is a * really * bad movie. The act is absolutely illogical, the script is God-awful, and photography is just terrible. <br /> <br /> How does this movie stand, that you never once care for one soul - good people or bad people, living, dying or dead - in just 87 minutes. "Oh, he's dead ... Huh ... they said," The best response I could do after each murder was the best response. The letters are so black-white that the volume is closed, you can still find out. There was a peculiar nostalgic quality across the cast's voices, their faces impressed that you are looking at many old silent movies, many of which are bogus quarrels, exaggerated broken and "fascinating look". Each character is a ridiculous, passionate, one-dimensional comedy hat; Once they have played their special role in this Fiasco, they are briefly boycotted. It is impossible to think of me if Thomas Bor Nilssen (director / writer "SkyGen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low budget version of "American Psycho" and got confused with the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly great movie; Cold, emotive cast ensures that. This is not an offensive movie; The director plays so safe that someone probably can not find it. It's simply and after, a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky and actually paid to see this bomb at Pay-per-View. As part of my understanding, I am writing this review. <br /> <br /> I said enough.
