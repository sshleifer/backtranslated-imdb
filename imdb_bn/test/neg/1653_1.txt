It says much about the UK when television programs run it not only for three series. Helpless, politically correct and ill-played and poorly written point. Mira did not have any fun or accomplishment in Syria, tell me I am wrong, and Josh Carrot, as she is a funny person, the chief of her eighty year. It's such a bad comedy that can be made by ITV, but the stingers like the up-hand and James Ballmer of Cars Park also have stinkers like Fawley Towers compared to the trash. I want to sit with the author / director of this event, so that they can express humor at this event. Most of the UK's population is made of weak educated chabs but it will not survive their funny bones. They can put their mobile phones on their mobile phones from the elder brother but it is another story. Completely and nasty dirty!
