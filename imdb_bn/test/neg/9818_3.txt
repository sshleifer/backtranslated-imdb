Originally a notable B-movie, which is mysteriously run by the main talent of the golden era, Fritz Lang. Even Lang, Walter Piszon, Joan Bennett and George Sander's tabloids are also a funny story, bad acting, slowly set for the phone set and for Misscasting. For the sake of transparency, I must admit that I am a proponent of Walter Piszon, who has received a special place in the MGM's artificial dream-factory, lucky, and supported Garrar Gerson and others, played a central role. 30-year-old Raymond Madcack comedy tone, her role is dangerous, where she is hiding, she is acting silently, acting on a chip. Joan Bennett's vocal accent too much, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup and classy outfit belly belly a street-wise Cockney slum-girl. George Sanders is unable to play bad, but after the opening of the Priestaster, Pidon goes on claiming to shoot Adolf Hitler anyway. The surprise tone for Fritz Lang is inequality. I am rumored to be in the middle of the mysterious thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay. Hitco is sometimes reversed by using comic relief at least suspension speed. This image has a reason to be unknown. It does not serve or disseminate any profession or reputation and forgets it because it is an amazingly bad movie of a descendant group.
