I saw this movie, or part of it, hoping it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but soon it became clear that it was just plain silly. For one you have the worst performance! The lead "actress" Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, uninspired and very less attractive even though. And he certainly does not look like female fighters, who can easily cut the king's butt from some terrible fighters, but he does. And with what feminist attitude, it is common populace. For one, one of his family was killed, then he joined some warrior schools or something so that he could learn how to fight with men. Then he joined with a fat servant and the king of his child, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. Those two letters are simply fools and destroy the little atmosphere managed to create the film. After that I could not take anything for Nilssen's painful performance, and the absurd clich√© and the lack of some practical work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
