The makers of this movie are sitting one day and said, "Let the Russians have fun and show us how much we improve people". This film depicts Russians as an inferior person who can not understand the bright ideas by Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and based on expensive research than in any other country's campaigns. However, this movie has gone far and it makes the difference between East and West too much. To me it looked like a propaganda campaign during the cold war.
