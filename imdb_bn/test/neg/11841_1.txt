So I was sick on a Saturday Flu and silver lining that was a marathon on the day at the Syphai Channel - "Carnosaur" trilogy, "Peterdactyl", "Raptor Island" on that day. Then I went towards my cable remot, and found that Saifai was fascinated by the movie, in Saturday's prime-time slot. Some movies I've never heard of before are "Raptor." I was quite excited. When the movie began to drive around a jeep, they were stalked and killed by a Velociraptor. I was fine, "Hmmm, it's weird, which looks almost like the scene of" Carnosaur ", in addition to that it was in the middle of that movie." Then I was sitting through some really bad acting and then some people suckered walking in an underground research laboratory where she was eaten by a harmful T-Rex. Now I'm fine, "Wait a second, it was a scene of" carnosaur. "Then, after seeing some scenes I came out of" Carnosaur 2 ", I just realized what was going on. So basically, Roger Cromon and Co. The "Carnosaur" triangle stopped the scenes of using the action scenes, it was suffering from a fundamental "dinosaur-run-amok" plot and as a real movie I did not know who I was angry, Roger Karamen or Saifai Channel trying to pass this pass as a worthy slot for the Prime Minister. The only reason why this conclusion was appropriate was the actor / actress who, in their "Carnosaur" trilogy Looked like an opponent and would guess that any scenes will be raised later, as soon as it gets me That, as the dinosaur lover, I have no alternative other than to give it the lowest possible rating, because I am completely off.
