I borrowed the DVD this day from another friend. I really did not know what to expect. I did not see a lot of Russian movies, and I do not think I've ever seen Russian war movies. Perhaps that's something different to expect me, something along a fabulous Russian mentality line. But they were ashamed of the expectations that came because they were a general war film. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of some young people to follow through their recruitment, training, deployment, and anything else. War, well known. We saw it work many years ago, as well as more recently (as Jaredh). Of course, there is a difference because the film is often about the American soldiers rather than the American soldiers. But generally it can be easily as a Vietnam-movie. I suppose that Afghanistan reflects the feelings of the citizenship of the Soviet Union of Vietnam only to my feelings. A country that should have pushed a push for the director-general to drag the war for years with the terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> This was a good point in the movie was some beautiful ambiance shot that had a good feeling) and the decent effect for what I suppose has been rather a low budget movie. What disappointed me most is the story itself. It just does not manage to stir any of my emotions. Because the character development is lousy. And when people are shot to death you really do not have to face cardboard cutouts facing them. They are unable to do that in this movie. Also it seems too late, and that is a kind of recent trend. In my opinion, there is a lot to give to a movie for more than two hours, and this movie will not be cut. There is also a visible music that is like a wet blanket on each scene. Especially it is very annoying in action scenes, you do not need action-music, but more than just slow keyboard-music will be great. Otherwise the price of production was good enough, there was no problem where there was. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to see this movie. Any matter of you, as a reminder that the war sucks? Which Russian filmmakers have already seen some American war movies already do something real? However, this movie is rather clipped, lack of souls and its distinct technical qualities, it lacks script and character development. Ultimately, it has become one of the only war movies that fail to make you think and fail to add anything to the genre. I've seen a lot worse, but a lot better. I rate this 4/10.
