With my two stars I'll probably go to the head of IMDB ?? It was hated. "- This is apparently listed for the most popular TV series. <br /> <br /> This website has decided to purchase a DVD version of at least not because of enthusiastic comments because I generally think British humor is fine. I gave up through the second installment. ?? and other comments according to the "fun" bit already already through Was there. <br /> <br /> I know, according to another comment, I certainly lack the sense of humor. But when I was laughing crazy while watching the Fauli Tower of Black Book (and again seen)? Although vaguely ?? Subjective related Why different reactions? It can be a mere generation things, and yet differences can be identified. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> By a miracle ?? To survive. Fauli Towers are fun because the plays can deal with situations that can deal with them. The interesting thing is that they make a serious effort to succeed and laugh for them even laughing. There is no situation in black books, it is only there and the owner feels sorry for himself. If there is a threat to the emergence of a situation, it is quickly removed. It is amazing how fast and how often a subject is omitted and the plays do something completely different for the extra pair. Called a joke ?? And very good ones - all looks like black books. Why a bookstore? A hardware store will work just as well. <br /> <br /> No, wait, wait. It is considered a book shop, because of the cruelty of obscenity, obscenity and arrogance, dramas are considered subtle and safe. They are not bumbling some humble but semi-intellectuals are bumbling. Hey, they're like you and me. I can explain the success of Syria's successive success. There is nothing extraordinary in the drama, because of their financially unrealistic living conditions, many visitors may be jealous for them. Nostalgic and vapid that belong to tribes and bear a sense of friendship, think of a trademark during the time of the first world living now. <br /> <br /> Recently I saw Tittybangbang, a fairly new British TV comedy show. . I found it weird funny. Is it often quite tasteless or xenophobic ?? But always hit the bull's eye in an objective and his social criticism. Humor is mainly made by the characters in situations or with a purpose. The low ratings of IMDB may indicate that this funny brand is not compatible with the time, but I am still happy that it is still alive and kicking and hoping it will continue.
