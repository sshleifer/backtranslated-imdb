The poor but overrated dramatic thriller, the film strives to draw out spiraling internal demons in a painful artist. The problem is that the single relation on the screen is not trustworthy, and the width window appears to have been found. The title character is so difficult that it is impossible to imagine any on-screen career of emotional investment. Conclusion is also fairly predictable; Certainly there is a lot of consistency in the direction of the story where there is a proper direction to get directions properly. Choosing to completely suspend your belief in the situation or relationship, the film plays well (especially through mobile phones) and triggers some excellent tensions, which the story unfolds. There are some foods to worry about as a metaphor feature, and the script has been strong, here's probably the potential that can be used well.
