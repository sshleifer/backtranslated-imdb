It was quite inevitable. From this movie "The Core" and from the movie taken from it, borrowed from "Armageddon" and movies taken from it. There is also Luke Larry in addition to this time. The revised version of these films, known throughout the world, extends the spacecraft and the full ring of fire starting from the Pacific Ocean. It soon determines that everyone on Earth will just be destroyed. So the military and some scientists go inside the earth and build one of the high drilling machines (it will not be fun if it does not go anywhere in space or anywhere in the planet). There is also a line that considers the journey of the world to be more impressive than traveling in space (such as "Armageddon"). It is a science-fiber network movie, so script numbers are drawn by disaster films. There are wars between scientists and military forces, there are rock-laced lasers, people die and wish for good for everyone, and most (poor CGI) have special effects. All that is real and not that entertaining When you do not do anything, then a movie to watch it, especially if you get beer.
