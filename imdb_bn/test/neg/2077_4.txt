Carmen is a prostitute who escapes and stole life from the soldiers of the Spanish army; She, without any doubt, is the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resists his charming attitude, he decides to do everything to destroy him. Finally, he would fall on his web and forced to force him to commit things he had hated to stay with Carmen. Although Pheja Vega is very nice, she does not seem to be a Gypsy (like Carmen) and her performance is not good for Sobergia. The story is very annoying, and, most of the time, when it appears to be frank, very stupid. Similar circumstances and special effects, though not being that they are not acceptable, but it is highly synthetic for a historical film. Very annoying developments are annoying and bad, collectively, there are many wireless things to watch.
