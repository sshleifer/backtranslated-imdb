In London, the Venetian Curla Barin (Eulia Mayerukouk) is searching for an apartment to share with her favorite lover Matto (Jaro Bernadi). He met the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rented a large apartment. When the jealous Enero finds some pictures and letters from Bernard (Morro Lorenz) of Venice, he hangs the phone and ties with Miraah as soon as he gets uncomfortable and unhappy with a group of people. When Matto arrives in London, he concludes that his desire for Karla is more important than his jealousy and behavior. <br /> <br /> Another "soft porn" ridiculous story of sick director Tino Bras with "Transgender" and sickness, where every situation is a motive for expressing the underlying parts of custom women The amateur camera displays the body of beautiful Ulea Mayerukouk in every possible corner, and her character is abused, touched and beaten in every part of her beautiful body, but without explicit intrusion. This flicker is recommended only as a voyeur experience of this director fans and Yuliya Mayarchuk looking naked in erotic situations. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "a pervertida" ("distorted")
