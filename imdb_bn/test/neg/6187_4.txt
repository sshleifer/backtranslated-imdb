This film is compared to the comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", which is a comedy, although I can not see why. Monty Python is the only one to connect with ("Nunce"'s Arid Idol, John Claes and Michael Palin "Wanda"). Otherwise two impossible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The promise of the first riot is a projected, average film with significant casual sex jokes and ridiculous ridiculous. Sometimes there are high spots, but not manage to operate cast or crew tasks. "Wanda" type manic finish is an attempt to "try to reduce men" as well as to try to be very amazing. When you think about it, women are trying harder than men, people are trying to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
