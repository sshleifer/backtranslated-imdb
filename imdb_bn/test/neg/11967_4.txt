I guess the 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it has some good points, but it's a flash of another flashback. Work is not so horrible plots. <br /> <br /> The story goes from a legend about a living scarf of Karenfeld. When a initiation became a fantastic one because of a life endangered life, scarecrow comes alive and starts a murder frenzy. Sound familiar, right? Get it from the screw, Friday 13th, Zipper Crypres, The Corn of Children, you name it! <br /> <br /> 'SquareCo Gone Wild' is less than the average movie. Suddenly there is a scary moment. Even the final scene is ridiculous! Sadly, we can still enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer to see you instead of something else. Unless you are a big fan bad and cheesy movie, of course close. <br /> <br /> 4/10
