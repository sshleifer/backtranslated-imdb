My girlfriend wanted to see this (in many cases in this case) ... so I rent it. Then I saw how this was nominated for the acclaimed 10 Oscars. Great! This would be good ol 'drama. There were many possibilities in this movie ... direction and path whatever was very good. But after the film's ending, I could not help but ask myself if this story is actually worthy of making a movie. Virginia Hill (Antenteben Benin) was extremely annoying, I just could not tolerate all of her character. Warren Batty was excellent in acting and science, but I feel very sorry to show sympathy to his character .... He originally came as a gangster's abusive, hotheaded holler ... among which 'Life' was the first place. How can he get the same as Maya Lancashire and lucky Lucian ??? This picture just gave me a soft but uncomfortable feeling ... What was the big deal with this movie? I just did not feel a complete with Bugsy. Beatty's antics, though played quite well, looked just too random and unreasonable. I guess what Segel really was like ... but it was so much. Here just does not seem to be a real story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, in the failed attempts of the casinos he made, he was killed with no consent for the money owners of his crowd. <br /> <br /> Do you have more than that? I just did not see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. Many movies will not be shown in 1991, it was nominated for 10 Oscars, was out of my way (although it won two, it is fair). 1.5 / 4 stars.
