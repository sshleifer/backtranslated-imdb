For the rebuilding of "Lost Harijan" as a musical instrument, Rogers and Hammerstein needed or required the type of Lara and Lowre musical composition. Bert Bechratch and Hal David chose the wrong. That said, my favorite thing about "lost Harrison", his score It just does not fit the score piece. Cast, most non-musical genius (Ullman, Finch and Smile, is all dubbed, and still not sound that great sound) is made up <br /> <br /> Frankly, novella, on which this, and previously non-musical film versions were based, medium, best. Although true, the possibilities of the cinematic musical version exist, they do not realize here. The film succeeds in passing a good, rainy day to pass the time. Otherwise, you might want to buy his soundtrack CD, stop it. Due to the film's horror reputation, only recommend as a curiosity piece. I've seen so many good; But I saw a lot worse.
