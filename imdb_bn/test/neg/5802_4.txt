After all, I want to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, that said, I can not say that it's a "good" movie. I went into the theater with very little expectations (I've learned something). I'm glad I did because the plot and development was not stellar. The joke was low grade humor. But, I was the right psychologist to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I'm not the only one. Actually, the whole theater laughing aloud. No one complains after the movie is closed. I also saw a man smiling on his chair! But again, you have to be careful, Grandma Boy is not a top quality picture. This is a funny (though at least) movie, and if you take the right mentality you really enjoy it. Oh, and it does not take kids.
