The Navy is an anonymous, racist and surrender film that uses the Middle Eastern conflict as an undoubted retreat for the development of an activity for the Middle East's audience in the Middle East. The conflict, as well as the involved, is used only as a gunpowder, which proudly blows the Arabs for 'independence' to glorify the young young people. But the worse thing is that the action scenes of the movie are conducted suddenly and are overwhelming, which prevents navy seals from acting like a stupid shoot. <br /> <br /> The character of Charlie Shane (Hawkins) is hateful, objectionable, unconscious, lazy and above all, racist. He referred to the Middle East as a ** T-hole and its residents were 'angry-headed'. Throughout the film, Nano Seal's characters are glorified as beef in the use of Lebanese natives. They arbitrarily kill these people with a free-of-open attitude. The son of a young Lebanese shot by Hawkins has even silly killings; Hawking made fun of his language before shooting another funny quip while shooting him. In addition to the tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (though predictable) anti-American sentiment of the film is also rebellious. Lebanese American female journalist told Hawkins that terrorists could not speak because they were "religious initiatives". Hawkins 'then yes, and we retails with the Navy is sealed!' Formality is probably meaningless next zealots of US military power. Moreover, even after insulting the ethnic heritage of this journalist and behaving like her sexuality, the script demands her inability to resist her hateful deception and she still sleeps with her - because she is an American navy seal. In spite of her objectionable behavior towards him, Hawkins' limited to the character of the journalist by compelling him to 'higher' anti-American attitudes. Apart from morality, this plot twist also has little faith as the drama. <br /> <br /> The script also is amateur. Most scenes combine without any thought for the development of mood, plot or character. The 'music video' scene in the golf course, for example, is simply lazy eye candy. And four characters, where Charlie Shane plays helpless hero, it is also vain. After a while, he shows his partner how to stop the bridge from showing him how difficult it is, and on the other hand he runs a tower truck with a push bicycle and runs his car. In both cases there is a follow-up anti-climax, both are unlikely, and there is no effect on the plot entirely. They are designed as a car to showcase the cheap American-American heroism of Hawkins, only a poor alternative to candy and character development. Most plot development scenes are poorly documented and recorded badly - this problem actually affects the whole film. In addition to the character of Michael Biehn and Charlie Shane of the African American Navy and his wife, each member of the team seems unknown to the audience, so that nobody thinks rolling around the weather scene and <br /> <br /> <br / > Action sequence in this movie can retrieve potential production. But they are not here. These are badly managed, badly lit, and display stunts performed badly. Indeed, their directive is so poor that they are almost helpless to the audience, making it impossible not to follow the scenes, but also to the complete lack of fear and suspicion. Poor lighting only adds to their craft. The explosions are fake, the shots of bullet are harmful and one of the more courageous stunts involved in crashing Mercedes on the tank, it is like a stove that is staged in a backlight and then badly edited. With the completion of the navy, the coins were firmly placed in view of these production. The first was the scene of slow-moving 'non-existent explosion-the murder-kill-me' visible with Shin, who first carried the bine behind him. This is a default view of movie trailers as a star. Then, when the seals were missing, wounded and floating in the ocean, they were rescued by a submarine. This submarine was actually long before the house, but it certainly came back miraculously. Despite the violent and intense aggression of Sail, despite the top of it and most of their colleagues have been killed, most of them still bleed deeply, they all lead to laugh sincerely to the blessing of America's blessings. Guess? You can imagine this last while watching the inaugural credits. <br /> <br /> This film uses a medieval medieval clash for all-American trends in the mosaic of joint composite joint lead. Arabs are treated relentlessly and inactivity, and their assassination in the film is used as a complete form of glorification for the use of American military power in the consequence-free environment of a military-based minority group. The 2001 incidents noted that the loss of conflict between these minority groups and exaggerated quarterly is certainly not free pass time. The Middle East and the other one ** can not be written as a hole, which pushes each other with a head of anger (here to quote Charlie Shane); It is now a place where there may be a fatal consequence of involvement. Today we have reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can be expressed intimately close to themselves. Therefore, the navy seal rarely looks stupid these days; But this would be like. This is a very unknown movie, whose production value and professionalism are equally suspected. Seal of the Navy, ideological and artist, is a complete insult to the intelligence of his audience.
