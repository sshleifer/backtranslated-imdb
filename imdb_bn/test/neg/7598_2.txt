When I first saw this DVD for a three-dollar bibberin bint, I could not really believe in my fate: Tric Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman starring a Christmas movie ??? Not saying, I hijacked it early and it was considered a suitable investment. <br /> <br /> This film was just as bad, and you are expecting to add any movie to Christmas and three "celebrities". The conversation was inactive, the characters were one dimensional, and the pressure of Carroll's character was completely unbelievable. The film itself was a bizarre piece of annoying, which refused to finish, and when it finally ended, it started using me as a human. My advice: Unless you see this movie then and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggnog.
