This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Superb amateur When bad guys loot in the boat, we see two machines with machine guns and one of them says, "We're plundering your ship!" She blinks and is completely shy! Very awesome Routofol !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are really bad actors. Actually, everyone involved in this product is a non-actor. <br /> <br /> This cheap generation has so many continuity mistakes that it is awesome. In one scene, the boys are wearing a type of swimwear. In the following shots, they are wearing a completely different swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A bad movie will look for any fan. I have VHS. This is very rare. I cherish it
