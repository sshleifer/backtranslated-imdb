In the first film of 'Yellow', Chris Chan Lee usually tried to enlighten Asian-American screenplay of Hollywood, leaving stereotypes depicted in mainstream films. However, doing so, Lee has done many more serious offenses: He exaggerated his own stereotypes of Asian-Americans from disbelief. The result? Horribly one dimensional character and an indecent shallow script makes the acting excited, which is finally a film that is physically painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The positive reviews garnered by 'yellow'; Each two camps fall into one. At one corner (for example, at imdb.com), you have found Asian-Americans who are so impressive that can be depicted on screen without any glasses and math books, so that they ignore the stupidity of Li's final product. On the other hand, you have found movie critics who said that it would be incompatible to completely annoy the 'yellow' that it claims; Finally, it is a great Asian-American film created by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... now for protected areas. <br /> <br /> Case example: Main character Sina Lee (Michael Chung). The writer / director Lee achieved a commemorative credit with sin, thus editing 'yellow' so that he never screened the screen without scrolling or screaming. See the sin resenting the support of his friends. Keep your mouth shut. See walking walks along the beach and the brood. Keep your mouth shut. (Yelling ensues.) Seeing sin showing off her father's shop. Keep your mouth shut. See Sin urine. Keep your mouth shut. See Sina breathing. Scowl <br /> <br /> Yes, I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American anger. what do you think? I'm not sure. Keep your mouth shut. Scowl <br /> <br /> Just thoroughly, Lee introduces us to Sin's father, Woon Lee (soon-tech oh). Throughout the film, Scene simply scolos or screams, Mr. Lee scowls * and * yells. In fact, it's the main role of the yellow 'yellow': scowling and yelling together. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. what do you think? I'm not sure. Keep your mouth shut. Yale <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Lee's only dimension does not bother you, his story line will be there. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), there are two characters in this movie that are completely intended to overcome a tensile and completely irrelevant love story in the film. You see, Lee learned in the film school that every good film must include some elements related to love, and these two characters let him fulfill the obligations. In a fascinating, inactive Florian dialogue between Mina and Joe, a kisser kiss was humiliated: 'Nerad!'; `Stupidhead '; (Eyes seen); (Understanding the smiles); (Kiss ensues). <br /> <br /> But rest assured, somewhere out, when sin is scowling when all this happens. <br /> <br /> Anything that Mina or Joey contributes to in any way, the plot of the film does not make me too boring because Lee is the strongest player to complete his nonsequitures with the clips of most hackneyed films. And believe me, the flirting sequence is just ice tips. At the end of the film, we see that Wayu Lee is constantly fooling her and Sean's girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suah)), I'm sure Lee is meant to be a mood moment. What a wonderful thing: Woon is sending a fairytale story about homeland with a loud and loud voice coming out straight from the Reader's Digest, in which her voice quiver is among those extra special parents. A compulsory shot with the camera tremor shaking hands. We feel compelled to roll in our eyes, unless we realize that Uncle's interpretation does not give any sense. But lack of substance did not stop Li to make the film, then why would he spend this specially inefficient scene? Finally, the world can always use another cliche. <br /> <br /> Well, you say that the movie can be painful, but at least it should be a technical skill - say, 'Dreams can come.' Sorry, on a technical basis, 'yellow' as well as frustrated. Lee's edits are weird and hindered the existence of a little rhyme in the film, but I'm sure Li thinks that they will think of hip. To make things even worse, each frame is either undefined or overexposed. Although the light meter was discovered in 1932, the Newfound technology did not create it in the 'yellow' set. <br /> <br /> Actor actor Bert Balos, who plays the best in Cine, Alex, performed relatively well in light of the complete lack of cinema. Although the balls have a little effect, you can not blame him while screaming and shouting Lee's script. On the other hand, Balos' cassettes do not show any restraint to any of them. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a bad film as 'yellow' for a long time. And I really pray that for some time I will not see any movie as 'yellow'. Please do not waste to see it; Life is already very short way. Thank you.
