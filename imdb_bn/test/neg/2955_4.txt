Light spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> <br /> She and Dessler look like the only people who are doing this movie. The old man greetings to Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in this film !! What he does is completely screwed in a fake way and screams about the "old dah-vell sea". He blames "past" of Garbo, his whole life and everything in the sea! He comes across stupid X-10. Charles Bakerford Matt, fairly 'n' Tumblr sailor Garbo falls with love, and he fine his role, but nothing really outstanding. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Finally, Mourin stopped speaking about the badness of the sea and kept his head and fist at the table in perfect time with Bikford. Then very soon he goes on a tirade about the sea. <br /> <br /> I have to implement myself to finish Anna's christi. It is very melodramatic and creaky too much. There are many good initial discussions, but this is not one of them. If you have not seen anything before doing anything else before Anne Christie, such as Camille or Grand Hotel
