Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a Rouf of "Rozen"? See only letters from two families, cones (rosan) and hirs (reba); The blonde girl is married to a big girl (Bucky Connor and Cheyenne Heart), Marc (Marc Helly and Van Montgomery), the fantastic little girl (Darlin Conor and Kayra Heart), younger brother (DJ Connor and Jack Heart) and quirky relative (Jackie Connor And Barbara-Gene Booker Heart). <br /> <br /> And then, of course, the biggest harmony, the reva heart and Rozna Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the moody and tough-style style mother without the same loving qualities as Rose. Or, perhaps, they made him * very affectionate, because Reba Hart seems to be roaming through money and fear (So Van's wife Cheyenne's line "I do not fear you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And being sweet And caring with little conversions in between. Roshan was directed to achieve the above all that he was stupid to be silly, because he was always meaningless and satirical, and whenever he tried to keep open, it was difficult for him. As inconsistent as the character of Rev., its hard to be credible. <br /> <br /> But if the characters did not completely leave "Roshan", they could not even save any event from the sub-par of the plot area. The authors tried to show the substance but they could not actually close enough long fork to give any effect. And you feel good, the curiosities are authentic; It seems as if at the age of twelve he wrote that no joke is ridiculous. Occasionally they bring something that is funny (I say not because I do not smile in some episodes) These gems are very rare and far away to taunt "Reba" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Overall, The program can be even better, in fact, if they replace all actors, especially Reba itself, they are more community-theater quality more than the CityCam quality of time. <br /> <br /> I fix it 3 out of 10, so that a good joke comes.
