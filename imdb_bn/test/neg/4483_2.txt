All right, let's start well: nice scenery, easy to see Chaning Tatam, Amanda seafrade has beautiful hair, about it. How much of the movie went to the floor of the editing room? Probably the plot, action, good dialogue, and the point. Terrible acting, horrible choppy dialogue I tell you how bad it is: my friend who always weeps in the film, was part of the tears, and he smiled so much we thought we were crying! The film seems to be at risk of war, damage, autism, and cancer in most cases, but it is so satisfying to cover a subject satisfactorily.
