Actress is tricky and set, while easy, quite okay. In addition, there is nothing to save from this movie. Unbelievably bad acting, tears in the dialogue, all expected plot, a lot of fools and inconsistencies (for example, a beautiful girl gets hit on the head by star in the morning and she just does not survive, only with scratch!) ... to make it short because it is even more Not valuable, even fans of fans can avoid it.
