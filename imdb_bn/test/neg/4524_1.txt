<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Poor fool me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> This is the worst movie (the first 30 minutes of the good one) I have seen for a long time. I could not wait for the first half hour, my hard drive would look like de-faggett. <br /> <br /> I can bear bad ... bad, okay, sometimes even intelligent. But with the opposite Hollywood shit (and this year will be a lot worse) I will not keep up. This movie is a serious insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year old girl may have good writing - and she is even inconsistent !!! I'm really trying to see the rest, but I'm afraid I have a better job ... creating a pizza and growing like it <br /> <br /> How sad despair. No ... I'm lost! What a swindle! Mel Brooks once said; "Shirt piece!"
