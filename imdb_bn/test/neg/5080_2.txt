Seeing the names of acting actors (Steatham, Snippets and Filipp), I thought the movie must be of course fun or funny. Instead, I got it only 92 minutes was not boring, but the frustration to know what was happening, and the words "bad police" were heard in the words of hair and words. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that there is not a good story to start in the movie. And when you have it, not stetham, no one can help you with the help of Wesley Snipes ... even John McClane can not save this film :-) It can be great for kids if it is not more than 12 years old , Because they do not pay too much attention to the story and some big explosions happened in the movie.
