In 2007 nothing was bad and if it was Wrestlemanman's road then they would choose the wrong road. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and Hardy have defended MVP and Minn: It was the best match in my eyes, but here some good wrestling is not here. 7/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> The cruiseweight championship is open (which won by Chavo Guerrero): Awful, high flying, really fast and annoying. 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Little Busy and Fanley Diff little Bogmen and Boogman: It was more comedy than wrestling, some smiles. 5/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Cain Diff King Booker: These two are a good effort but they can do well. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Weiwe tag team championship Paul London and Brian centric Deff Dus and Domino: Another annoying match, is not flying high by a champ. 4/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Worldwide title m. Kennedy Deaf Bobby Lashley (incompetence): My mind is the worst match of the night. Really terrible. I thought ecw had no rules, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> Jana Sen and Shaun Michaels told Batista and Undertaker: OK, but the match was a lot better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Overall it was Bull * * ID to give it a 3/10
