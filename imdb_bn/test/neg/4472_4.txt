4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> This movie was not completely funny and even the characters did not have any kind of passion to invest. Eugene Levi is perhaps the most interesting ... ... the rest work on them, but the story does not really get very deep and the plot never has a lot of holes, which are filled. This was not very fun at the time, although it was very funny. <br /> <br />
