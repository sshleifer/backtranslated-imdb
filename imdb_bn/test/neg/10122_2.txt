This, logically, the main Ava Gardner film is the worst. Yes, he's gorgeous But may wear thin thin over time, especially after the genuine and predictive film is over. <br /> <br /> In this Turkey, Robert Walker pretends that Eddie Bracken (who embarrassed him). Olga plays San Juan Jane Pavel (Lane, GE) part. Dick Hems plays a little sidemic (!), And Eve Ardhen plays Helen Broaderic (and another wise-cracking female semi-comedian host). Yes, this movie contains a popular popular song, "Speaker Low." But check out another, completely forgotten, piece. Dick Hems is singing very well, and so incredible vocal dubbing for Ava. <br /> <br /> The set is filled with clich√©s, scripts are filled and comedians are filled, and Tom Conway seems to have been fighting with alcohol like his (actually he was). In short, if you want to look a whole bunch of his head, then buy a photo and clearly sign this film.
