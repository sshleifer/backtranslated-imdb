The ridiculous ridiculous movie that makes the process of college admission fun. Satellites are not true for evaluating students for college admission, what is said about the film is fairly ridiculous, and not repeated or viewed. <br /> <br /> College admission officials want to see that the whole process is a very narrow view of those stupid people This film is insulting to hard-working high school students, who work hard and then suffer through long process, until they receive letter of acceptance or rejection of the schools accepted by them. <br /> <br /> This film must be rejected at all levels.
