Well, this is the Hollywood Samletz that you can see a mile coming away. It is enjoyable in parts but just so arrogant. I must admit that I did not really enjoy it, but I'm very hard to please and many of my friends like it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty sweet, and the actors give good performance. This is a nice backdrop and eye candy is quite good. But the annoying predictable, unreasonable and truly neutral story holds the film. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The chick flick gets some bad news but there are some real dogs spread there; This is not one of them.
