It was painful for me to watch this movie. I realize that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream movies. But you usually want to follow the basic elements of filmmaking. First off, kick jump. There are numerous in the opening 15 minutes of the film. There is a shot that looks like the same shot has been edited together at the same time. What I mean by what I mean is that a character is called one to half line, and the rest of the line looks a different. Second, the dialog. I understand that many authors are struggling for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since the movie is very specific for its location, the dialog must be in a specific voice (for example: set a movie in Boston, yet people use the West Coast slang with the Chicago accent). Even with this understanding, this actor is still difficult to sit through some lines present. I have had these two most vicious problems with this movie. There were a few others. I do not want to sound like a rude critics who do not know anything. I have experience in film (more importantly low budget indie film) industry. I also understand that with many directors often have a method of their craziness. I can not find this method used in this movie. It is difficult when trying to determine whether I can see this movie as an example of a unique film making film, or other low budget example. I honestly hope this is not the next. I would like to hear if someone expresses such insight in a specific way, or has their own opinion / opinion about this movie. Hopefully I can understand this picture more and my current opinion can be changed.
