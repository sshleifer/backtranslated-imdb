I did not find it difficult to take care of these characters, who were annoying or cruel, they all lived their fascinating life in urban life. <br/> <br/> Conversations were occasionally stimulating and at other times it was difficult to follow the story - was it mine or the whole scene was removed? <br /> <br /> It's like a bad movie that has become a movie in any way. Stereotype and jokes were probably fun at the beginning of the decade of "men's group". As it is, most of the comedy comes in the film - and boy, it gets old quick. <br /> <br /> Along with the fascinating Irish people - this image was ugly. And even a "so bad it's the best way". The last 20 minutes was particularly painful. Perhaps if you have never seen a gay person or have never thought of homosexuality, then this film could be meaningful. Else - darling, you will still be good to rent off the boys in the band or the beautiful things.
