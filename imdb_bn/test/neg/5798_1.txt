I can only laugh at all, but unfortunately, there is no one who can not find this stingbom bomb! I saw this movie from the beginning till the end, I could not even laugh. I'm surprised that Sandler, Shender, Spade etc. will put their names on this number. Worse than the worst SNL players, worse than any worse. What more can I say? How could this stupid, highly unfunny drivel taste come from such a pool of talent !! Maybe I've lost my sense of humor (probably not), but I can not remember a movie that I have liked it for so long. Do 2 hours a waste I will not get back.
