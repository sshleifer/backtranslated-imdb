I do not understand that they tried to complete this movie, I really understand. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he died, but to be really dead, this girl would have to shoot? But the ordinary people can not see their bodies, why they leave the body? The script already has a hole in the form of Nebraska, then there is the main character played by Susan Patrono, who drones his lines in just one Monoton, the voice is boring, and with a very low emotions on his face, he has acted like a female terminator robot. This is absolutely awesome and I did not understand how I could see it till the end of the movie. The last movie is stupid like you, and there is absolutely no reward for the viewer. They might call this movie a "little movie that choo choo cho-choo." Can be called.
