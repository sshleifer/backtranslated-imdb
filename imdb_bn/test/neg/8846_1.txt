Forget the shy acting, that such a film can be forgiven. Even horrible, uninterrupted dialogue and unreasonable phenomena (if my subtitles actually say what was said). Is the absurd absence of a skilled or experienced manager who can take the editor a while on the film's creation, even worse? Seeing the film, it seems to be quite old though it was made 7 years ago. Next to a computer virus as a portal? Ha ha ha? A dial-up internet connection? Photoshop Photoshop Photoshop Photos ("Oh! Look there ... What is this a face?" - Face up - Oh, the word closes - 'Chip' - Input View -), the scenes and the sequence are edited badly and as a result Does not flow. You can find a corpse hanging from a girl in a scene and after 10 seconds later she is seen to be a bit uncertain, sunny and moving. <br /> <br /> I have issues with many production-quality, it is painful and repetitive and thus completely annoying. <br /> <br /> I recommend the superstar's 'Shotra', an Oriental (Thai) horror movie has done well.
