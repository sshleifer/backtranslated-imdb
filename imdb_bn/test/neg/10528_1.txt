This film is sometimes a Wild 80's college sex comedy, others are a romantic romance ... then it is a serious drama moment and a dash of science fiction ... It is so ridiculous that it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I have clearly identified one of the worst movies, of course, I certainly have seen that they threw Peter O'Woole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to do for him. Work here Bad dialogue, poorly played to work away from everything ... and yet he is pretty good ... his part is not a good thing about and still makes it only if clean leather works only. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so capable of achieving so much that everybody else in this movie showed the spotlight on how he failed, it really looks worse than me ... <br / > <br />> If there was another actor who played the role of 'Otol', I forgot this film as a crap and never thought about it, but a fine performance of Peter O'Woole Regardless of the fact that I will remember this movie for a long time ... if it is just like a movie that anyone is involved then it would have been good if almost half good like Peter O'Wowel
