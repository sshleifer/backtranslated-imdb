And I saw many movies. I saw it in the theater in 1989 and this day it seemed to me that the impressive desire to continue. If you like John Balushi, respect his talent, even the film's holiness - this picture does not give you anything. This is mostly the author of biologist Bob Woodward, Beluusi's biographer. We can see that the screen of the life of Belu≈üi passes on screen, Woodward actually looks like a ghost character. The most invasive scene occurred when Belushi died, watching the writer stand up on his death sentence and "weakly" for me, Woodward. There are many terrible things to mention to all of them, at least which is inaugurated, which jumped from her body bag in Belushi morgue and entered a taxi driven by a man named "Angel". I'll have to leave at that.
