The pace of this movie is quite slow. Katie took about 70 minutes to go to China (which we know she will) and leave 30 minutes to wrap things up. The story can be estimated after 5 minutes after all. Nothing surprising to you. I think the film is about the upcoming movie, but the film is full of most of the stereotypes that are mostly at the top: <br /> <br /> - A beauty which seems to be that, boys and shopping are not everything. He realizes that he can "feel" and "see the real world". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Worried that Hollywood dropped those letters in the mid-half year. <br /> <br /> The nurse who can often know everything around China, at the moment a carbon copy of the soil is a woman who can not handle the situation or something. <br /> <br /> Distorted Chinese girl helps Westerns with our help and become beautiful girl. Because there is nothing in China (the third world country according to the film) and so we need charity. Gah, wake up and smell the way you were. <br /> <br /> Surely there is some poverty in China but the screenplay of help from the Western countries (read America) is so shallow and happy last-day sad and rebellious. Shanghai (where the movie is set) is the world's most elaborate and developing city at the moment. <br /> <br /> China's father is so beautiful and sincere that in the end there is a desire ... Be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> Teacher (Shan Austin) that really spread this heart The story (not) he said without feeling said. Why Shan? Why <br /> <br /> <br /> etik etc. In fact it is difficult to find a "real" person in the whole movie. 15. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to know something for example in the world instead of Rwanda Hotel. For the better life or old movies, I recommend you to watch the Italian "movie paradiso" which won the Best Foreign Film Academy awards a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only beautiful thing in the movie was that small scattered things of the beautiful Chinese country as well as some other (not all) that city sceneries I have been there and saw something in it.
