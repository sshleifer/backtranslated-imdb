Well, I'll be clear and admit that I was forced to watch this movie as part of my history degree and then write a short film review as part of my grade. <br /> <br /> If I were to watch movies alone, I found it very annoying and foolish on my own discretion. The style is its date to exceed the year, and acting is harmful. Instead of using conversation instead they exchange eye popping movements with each other, or sometimes thin winds. For me, the top performances are not expressed in such high emotions, and after watching a long close, hundreds of Ivan's face was praying for the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating though is how much of Ivan's character is wrong. This man was nasty, his bodyguard's killer's lips and his character was horrific. There was nothing but a fragment of film Stalin's promotion for me, wrong and dull.
