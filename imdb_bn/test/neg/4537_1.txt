Victory is a difficult animal to win. As a writer and director, all accounts have failed. Some things, funny that like making movies, just need to leave the professionals. 10. Out Out 1 It was not funny. I tried to laugh but it was not funny. I was not the only one, at the festival of Chicago, nobody else laughed, at least showed the show. Just very bad, sorry :(
