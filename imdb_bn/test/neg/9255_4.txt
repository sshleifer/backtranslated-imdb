Well well, ultimately this is a scene of intrinsic flick. But you can not find a good copy of it, the terrible copy with green drops, the edit is not synchronized, sometimes the word is its horrible and sometimes you can listen to the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, you have a waist while saying but it's not. Slowly, this is the first half of the movie to talk to each other and to love it. It is still weird that in the 60s films, girls do not wear any bra. When they enter the sleeping room, it is a full glory. However, the ban on the UK from 84 and still on the list of video nasties. The reason is simple, it is poor for their time. It really has some nasty dismemberement and it is surprising in some ways due to the fact that it is filmed Handy Cameras. So moving each image in the image, steadycam they do things these days. If the quality of the film was good, then it would have been better for the Galilean people but better than other movies like Circle in Skinchers.
