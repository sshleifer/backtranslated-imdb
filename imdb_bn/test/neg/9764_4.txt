Since Magas is a confusing puzzle that is not really a solution, one has to sit and enjoy the visibility. Set in a "Remote Greek Island", it makes Michael Keane very tall as a teacher working for a boys school, who is caught in mind with a local wako / mysterious person. Anthony Quinn and her gentle girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looks like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sail shirt, really good but the kine seems ready for the blast. Bergen, though stunning, should never be a British accent. He does not like that kind of things very well. Guy Greene's order is fine, but if you do not have endless patience with the film's circular argument you will not enjoy it. A real nagging note of Kaina's welding Anna Kareena, who is excited about the happy landfill. A woman who likes a woman and a band appert, her presence here is quite annoying.
