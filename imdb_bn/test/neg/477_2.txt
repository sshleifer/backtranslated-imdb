My brain was shouting, "Why do you see it, turn it off and go to bed!" But the sofa won potatoness, and I saw the end of the forecast. I guess it will give an opportunity when Bruce Campbell. I am less complaining about a budget movie less budget ... Time and time again We see a low budget movie, a good story in the movie, good writing and good acting proven enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start in such a movie, but they could not learn from Sam that it took more time than it would have on film to produce a movie. <br /> <br /> It's also sad, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I still do not believe in making these bad films. Bruce, I'm really frustrated.
