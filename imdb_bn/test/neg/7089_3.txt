Just listen to the Broadway cast album and the voice of Barbara Harris and John Kollum, who work wonders for the wonderful Lenler and Lane scores. Then, to make a new recording with the beautiful cast mind, see the film with Streisand Streisand and Yevs Montand is reading his lines through so much heavy French accents that it can not spend on seeing a chain. The best part (for those who need something to wait) is what make the start of the Montand title song. He listens / sings: Anyone of us can cry or have a formula, can you have a magic achievement of magicians and musical instruments? (The part that solves the problem, as a result of cutting the "name star" in the movie musical instruments instead of the appropriate talent for various roles.) I only want to enter Rex Harrison in that scene and Montand also recommends that justice can be done for the beauty of the English language. > <br />
