I hate the gun and do not kill anyone, but half the events in the shuttle happen when you or close ones and you find guns, you take off your surveillance. Three times Five times Whatever stop them on the pulse and you increase. I think even God will say, "Good call." A very 'hostel' type film, but more realistic ?? Since this could really be someone, well, if you are a beautiful young girl, is that ?? 'Shuttle' is a decent film, though long. Some good shocks (always call the AAA to change the tire only), is basically just a surprise but in most cases you're seeing things coming up. And instead of shooting mentioned earlier, "Typing to Hee", the most annoying part was the closure of one of the best friends. Those who get past, enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two uneducated women who are traveling alone from Mexico (well, this is the original) and lost their goods because of their lost luggage because they left the airport. And after a clearly predictable sign-language scene, they entered a "very-good-to-true" half-shuttle ride. Claude Jacks, who was previously launched, asked for their way to the shuttle, Allan Rock's Stunt joined to join twice as much as 'Speed'. From here, it's clear what happened (I've mentioned it was a 'hostel' hit) but still, I could not find it terrible, but there was nothing spectacular. Although it has served the visitors well, it has been about 15 to 20 minutes removed, but I recommend spending around 2 hours to kill and going to the worst.
