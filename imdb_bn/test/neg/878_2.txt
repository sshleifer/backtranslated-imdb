This is one of the more extravagant movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is now looking for a romantic lead role too old. Diane looks as normal and frowning a bit but she thinks the romance is unconvinced by herself. Casting Cast is not very memorable. <br /> <br /> Story: The medical drama that she needs to deal with is not disrespectful and interesting. The story is weak - not enough to happen about a movie. There is no new thing here or there is no new way here. <br /> <br /> The setting is a bit slower and the set room is unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Do not like to remember!
