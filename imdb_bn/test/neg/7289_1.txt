This movie was terrible and it is not worth a movie. The way I see it, it is a video of Disney Medieval episodes of three medieval days that pretend to be the first Alentian film to be a seagull, which was more well-made and enjoyable. And do I even start with this DVD problem? The story The character? Photo / animation? To me they are all bad and unwatchable First of all, this direct video video DVD story is ridiculous and pointless. The only good thing about it is that it is consistent - from the beginning to the end, consistently bad. Even after the film's ending, I do not know why it is back in the mix and how the three short stories are related to each other or related to Atlantis. And I could remember about this movie, how bad I was seeing it. Character looks wooden and lacks personality, and draws look much different than that first. You can say that they definitely do not have the same animators from the first one. When acting as a DVD, I take less and less care about what can happen to the characters myself and hope the movie will end soon. Along with the stories and characters mentioned above, the quality of the picture is such a poor, perhaps Disney is the worst of those directly on direct video products. As a fan of the real Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not get disappointed with Milo's return, which was a total waste of time and money. Thanks to love I paid it instead of buying it first. Nevertheless, I still hope I will never see this pain or even know its existence.
