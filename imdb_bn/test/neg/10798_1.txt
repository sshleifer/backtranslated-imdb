It was quickly destroyed by poor quality acting, cinematography, numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain. Let's see Joe Estevez bad (as usual) but he is not the only casting issue, the author Vivian Shilling is no great actress, in fact, he sucks well. His script is not so bad, it just guessed bad. Actually if the order is good and if good actors are cast then it can be a really good movie. <br /> <br /> But with all these problems "Solkar" failed to be even that passable, plus pacing as a horror movie is very awful. <br /> <br /> MST crew had some fun with this one but it was definitely not one of their best efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
