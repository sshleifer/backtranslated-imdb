This film was not bothered by the content, but it was boring because it was directed. It did not create a highly overweight mother (Angela) even on the cover of the video, while most of the cast was done. It's not fair but itself a statement. I'm missing his image from IMDB (perhaps his own choice) and seems like this is his only movie? The language of this film was owed out of necessity. I met my 10yr old boy because it rated PG in Canada and the language from their mouth was shameful and hateful. Like many others, Sirley has never been grateful like McLean. <br /> <br /> Cathie Bates and will always love. The senior part was boring. <br /> <br /> Little boy Alex is a very small actor. What am I going to see now?
