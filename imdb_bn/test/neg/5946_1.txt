People! A "joke" about a man whose parents ask him to kill because they are going to Hannel and want to get out of their misery. Several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, protects them from the trap of their last moment and reduces his body parts every time. The movie seems to hate its main character, which makes it more painful to visit. <br /> <br /> This movie is the first time I saw Tom Seleck without difficulty, and I think his shaved top lip is weird and made in mind. I feel a little slick. But it may be due to the horrific premises and the death penalty for the movie Lum.
