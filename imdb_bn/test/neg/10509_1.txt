This movie is actually crying to me. <br /> <br /> To start with a fake tooth. Then you set a nice plastic or drawn spot. All actions to make it more annoying are to follow the flash of a bright light. Then talking: The sound levels are so different, sometimes it is very difficult, then very soft, good movies are not exactly like. Also, it is so loud that I think the whole set had a microphone. And the topic is bad, have you ever heard stereo? When switching the camera, the word is always central. Talking to actors like they are reading from a board behind the camera And zooming in another scene, how horrible kids <br /> <br /> Music is so badly selected that it never adds anything. It only destroys an accident created by the accident. <br /> <br /> To finish this, watch the scene ... my 3-year-old niece will create a good fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie does not look good to laugh, it's just bad ...
