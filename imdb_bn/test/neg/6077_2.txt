I myself feel alert that the people of criticism do not criticize such a thing. Structurally and literally, there are many similarities with 'Amadeadas', 'Copyright Bithovan' deliberately chose the right way by putting the audience in front of the industry. And therefore, deny the pure, intelligent and creative work in the world. Now consider the following: The real story of creating nine symphony can be really a compelling and powerful story and equally a dramatic thing to say? Did Bethovenne complete deafness by writing Seyphony ?? Is that not more interesting? How was symphony operated? Would not it be good to know? So ask yourself, can any filmmaker give any possible motivation for introducing a woman as a copyist? If there was a copyist, he would certainly be a man. What was his story? (If you like the discovery of a female musician, try to criticize it here). <br /> <br /> To serve the purpose of fiction writers, reality should be far more than distortion. For those who want to compare Salman's claims with the discovery of the claims of Amardas to kill Mozart, and find out the right to judge them, consider that he acknowledged a priest in a crazy shelter (used to influence Shafa's film to influence the film). Anna Ludwig enjoyed the scary imagery if 'Bitoveon copy' could work. But we believe that he is 'probable' ... yes and that Strauss helped the aliens. <br /> <br /> Most positive reviews I read here will often be good in a designer expression film; Almost a deliberate retention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A short note about which can surprise you a bit. Ed Harris is not as good as Ludwig van Beethoven. Does that shock you? She looks painful throughout the film, decorated like many actors, but set up and standing at the catering table. Most of his lines are called cues instead of answering Holt's lines (ie he does not listen to actors). He clearly played a role in character rather than an actor character. <br /> <br /> How many times can we get Bithovan from his grave? Just ask yourself, will Ludwig allow?
