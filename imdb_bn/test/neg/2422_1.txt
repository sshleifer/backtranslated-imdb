This picture is probably the worst movie I've seen quite a long time. A door of acting can do a good job in a door. The plot is much ridiculous and shallow and much cry from the actual "rugby" reality shown. I still do not get "haka" as pictured on this poor excuse for entertaining. I'm not a kiwi but I know that Haka can only be edited by one of Maori, or by American Americans. <br /> <br /> I've made it for American Americans. So the irregularity and "Disney End" were disrespectful, but there was no attempt to exclude the basic rules of the game from prison, where the main character suddenly charged an American football game and everyone was playing rugby. The best thing about this picture was the last credit. It will be less painful to spend 90 minutes inserting toothpicks in your jaw.
