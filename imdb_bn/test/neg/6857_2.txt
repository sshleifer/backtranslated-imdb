I do not really know why, but I saw it with most expectations. Unfortunately it was misplaced. Firstly it is not terrible, it is not afraid and (it is not even worse until it is possible - which is possible) does not try. This is a satirical humor, and once I am impressed, I mean, I gave it to No. 2. This picture is really the Greymins Rips, I can never claim to show myself a movie that makes my voice even more. Very, very bad - to avoid.
