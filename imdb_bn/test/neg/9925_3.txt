As much as I love Allen Barkin (who really involved) I would have to heat this movie. If you are not telling it and why the first half hour you obviously did not see a psycho-sexual thriller or did not meet 20/20. It's like filmmakers and actors that they have the way to shoot it and the way they play it, they will not be considered dead. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film perverts who want to mix messy violence and gender. Not a funny movie, though you love Allen Barkin but its place is nice to look at a tough woman.
