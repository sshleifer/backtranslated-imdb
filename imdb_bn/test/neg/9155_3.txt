Great book, badly done movie. Cesi performances and resort situations make this movie a sensual bore-fest. Flat and uncertain work from most actors leaves the film later in the school special section. There is no doubt that there is a lot of talent to tap on this cast and crew, but some mistakes are made. The very talented Gretchen Mole is trying to drag the film out of Maya, but she can not even go beyond a stupid conversation. Looks like everyone just called it. Even makeup (the movie's 20-year-old Muluroni) looks even amateur and weird. Do not waste your time on this clunker .... Read the book.
