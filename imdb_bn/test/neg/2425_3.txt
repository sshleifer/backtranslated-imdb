At first tell me that I live in South Africa where rugby is our biggest game, and our national team, Springboks, doubled rugby have won the World Cup, so this is a big thing here. I have played my whole life and am amazed at the poor detail in this film! At first I thought it could be a great movie for Nicole McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and San Austin to be considered for free, but it has become a fun thing of sports. They basically combine with your usual daily American football film. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie has probably taken Rugby's standards, but the discipline or I say the opposite is the total lack of time in the games. It appears to be finally playing an NFL game in front of referee with Penning ... which promptly led to a few red cards, because it would never be punished like a criminal game. By a referee, that I can assure you! You can not even find a coach who has so much control over his team in Rugby. A coach will dump the player's head if he deliberately gives the surgical team or dual teams to the final final ... red card and fixed suspension, full stop double team. Second, it is a strange matter that the coach will accept a new player, who has played all his life wings, and I'm taking him to a hooker which is a very special position and says it is on behalf of the team. Good?! What ?! Hooker is a very special position in the front row where you will be able to screw up very well and especially be able to throw the ball at line-out, which does not make the penning anytime or any other reason. Moving wings into a whistle for any long-term training, it will first lead you to the death of your team during the scram and secondly the poor child will probably break his throat! How do I ask you for the better that for the group? Finally, the film's overall high mental pitch is much higher, because the rugby is a great game but it creates a great friendship and team spirit, it rarely gets out of hand and yeast. I saw true-life football drama with less emotion than this movie, and it has been fantastic, but this one's acting performance has dragged far too far and a strong reaction from movie viewers makes a very strong effort; <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Will be in danger. <br /> <br /> Whether it is right or not it's all!
