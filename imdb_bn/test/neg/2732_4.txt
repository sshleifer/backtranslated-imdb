"Core" meets "crack in the world" (made on TV in 1965). Acting stock, suspect predictable. Once you subtract all empty spaces from "core" - basically the canned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of "crack in the world". "Crock" was an extraordinary movie starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists working in South Africa entered the crease with a "snatch" with a nuclear device to supply a permanent source of geological energy. One of its subordinates, a bright scientist agreed. He believes that the explosion will not dig a simple hole, rather instead it will create a crude crack. (Potential spoiler) He is right. As a result of the destruction of the earth, they must set another nuclear device in the path of the crack to stop the crack. <br /> <br /> Although I have a spoiler alert, I do not know whether I really spoiled anything for the movie. And since "Worldwide cracks are available in very rare VHS format, if my decision is not revealed that counter-blasting activities are probably academic. <br /> <br /> I rate everyone" average down just 'descent.
