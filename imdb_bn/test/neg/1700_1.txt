Jason Connie is not the actor; She is the actor's son. His Macbeth is the worst I've ever seen. Oh yes, he killed King Duncan, but he killed William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please, give me the version of Polanski in DVD, so I can forget this monster. John Finch, Orson Wells, Lawrence Olivier, there you have your own cast!
