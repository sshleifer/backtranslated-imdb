All right, I've seen more than 100 tromba films, and some of them are quite bad. "Sejle Beach USA." Was horrible, and "I was a teenage TV terrorist" was unexpected, but it is the biggest movie of Trauma Library! <br /> <br /> A group of women is kept in jail and they try to run away and torture them. <br /> <br /> This is really terrible. As even go to the absorption film. If Doris Wishman and Hersal Gordon Lewis have seen this poor excuse for the film's film, they would probably kill the director. <br /> <br /> <br />
