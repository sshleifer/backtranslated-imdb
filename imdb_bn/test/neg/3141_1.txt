Looking for something dirty? OK fine ... that's the image. About it This image tries to create a deep connection with the audience through various symbolism and becomes annoying. I am not sure if the director's purpose is to put some deeper message to his audience or to threaten this frustration with violence, sex and violence. I think that perhaps it was probably the first ... but in a failed attempt, it ended up being part of the Arts Trash with just a lot of blood, some humiliating characters and religious symbolism. If you are looking for some independent films to criticize for trying metaphor ... stay at it. If you are looking for a big flick that will make you annoying and uncomfortable ... here you go ... if you are looking for a movie that will bother you at last, because you understand that the message was stupid ... the movie was stupid. And you will never get that moment of your life ... it's definitely a film for you!
