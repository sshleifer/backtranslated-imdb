(R # 64) <br /> <br /> Unbelievable, low quality, and above all the Derry trash. The lens is the only star power of Henriken when you know a movie is going to be bad. The French title of this movie says it all: "Unavailable". How can you make a movie this incredibly bad in this day and age? Anyway, Jonas Kostel's strategy, it works. This uber-trash, I'm talking about 'mind-level' shit, meaningless, out-of-date, even-even-bad-that's, the most growing filmmaking father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lance Henrikine Harlan Knowles, a character that might have been interesting if he was not completely isolated from the personality or personality. He went on a field tour to find a bunch of poultry as well as a bad Saskatchev, which is believed to be a plane or a plane collided with a plane. Nothing else. There are some soft-core (ie: classy level) nudity and some obscure rip-offs of "predators". The pain of 92-minute pain and the other became visible, from this time on "Blair Witch", the film eventually ended up in the finish line and ended. As a bonus, we can only see the giant for almost one or two scenes of the whole film. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this picture. What you need to know is that it is not a bad movie and a "bad-to-good" flick. "Antedoed" is the entertainment price, which is the character of Orlando Bloom. Avoid it like arsenic.
