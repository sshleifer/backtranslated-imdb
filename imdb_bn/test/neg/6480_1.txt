I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> Problems with huge continuity, bad acting, etc. For example, Sam should be far away from a human, but you can see that the ski slope can be cut on the hill soon afterwards. <br /> <br /> The most fundamental problem is, the essence of the book, Sam's courage creates a way to make much progress in his entire family, even if it does not touch it. Instead, in the movie, he gets upset with his family and leaves his rich parents in their own right, and when he gets tired, he goes home. Where is his development? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not read the book and hockey's 607 mm (duplicate / triple / quadruple aspect of Falcon) and terrible production quality (cracking, aham, fire, winter winds, their halongs for dialogue And then resume, etc.) I suppose it may be * 8 * year old. <br /> <br /> But this is a terrible disappointment compared to the book's fineness. Read the book instead of <br /> <br />.
