This is not yet designed by Scarlett Pimpernel, by the most annoying and disgusting version. As a Pimpernel fan, I was pissed off by what they did with the character - but this torture is not worth seeing, even if you are not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blaney, for example, does not knock people behind to get down a hallway.

Chauvelin's name is not, nor has it ever been, Paul. They completely erased any references in the pseudopel's disguise, instead replaced them with the James Bond-Alex gadget and Gizmos. <br /> <br /> Like this photo ... makeup is awesome. Women look like shoes. Elizabeth McGower's beauty symbols randomly wanders around her face.
