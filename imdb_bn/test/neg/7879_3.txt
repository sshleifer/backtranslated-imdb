Another French film with Absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of killing two young women and together with S * CK. One of them is a pornographic star who ran away from her community after raping and killing her boyfriend. The second was whisker who killed her flatmate and shot her boyfriend to death. After that the events are seen at a tube station (both missed the last train) then the whole thing starts. They find a tied and come very close. They are sexually assaulted, taken into drugs, driving around the country and are very sexually active. Thats all about really Baise-Moi. We can see there is no mercy for their victims. They even killed a woman for her money. Both actresses are France's real porn stars who influence the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scene, even though they can not make the whole movie look like me, there is no need to play the film more than that. It is a version of Thelma and Lewis at a different level. I could suggest you to work instead of seeing Baise-Moi. So, if you want to see a pointless, weird film, then get annoyed. * Out of *****
