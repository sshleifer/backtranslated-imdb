What can be said about "Dead and Road" ... <br /> <br /> Just like Edgar Allen Bo was so ashamed. Acting, writing, impact, and everything in this movie was awful. That's not even justice! This film was my biggest waste which I could never sit. That's why I closed it 20 minutes before the end because I personally do not take care of the characters. I saw bad but this was definitely bad. I was hyped up for this because I was a fan of Poe and this was just bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> I also have more objection that you can not rate movies with negative numbers.
