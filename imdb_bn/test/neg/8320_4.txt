The brave one mentions that the main character must be brave, brave. I would like to disagree. In such a situation, the more brave thing that happened to her - was being brutally beaten with her maternal grandfather, which would not survive the other day - the perpetrators would have to go after without the distorted view of society. The character of Jodie Foster, Erica, a radio personality, who is walking on a distraught street and recording. We have not given any deep depth to anyone who loves him, he is dead, the police are not following it, he gets some guns, jad-zada-jad, but he is not really involved in lead intelligence. In character, so there was something left of the movie of the past: the judicial system of intelligence, where there is power in its own hands. But if we are not sure whether or not Irika is in close contact, if filmmakers take a road or any other position (which, ultimately, any stupid message that is taken, dogs included too much metaphor), when today's New York City, Which has become significantly safe twenty years ago, seems to be that if you're down the right lane, you're alone in a subway, you knifed Find the beaten. <br /> <br /> All this might be a little better film - perhaps just under the supervision of Terrence Howard's detective intelligence, who has involved a child in some custody war, who is not her and a woman. He is not related to his parents, who can not be away from parking owners and can not be a bad boy-sister, I do not know - but we will go to a script that is not both ham-faced and rational. It may be ridiculous, for example, it was not initially able to shoot Irir's logical side, for example, a husband and a wife could see a robbery at a convenient time in the first shooting of the shop - and then shot him while shooting his car and shot him. Was killed. It does not help Jordan's style with the camera, it becomes slightly larger than the camera: it is called a stem-cam for a reason, because it can not be knit inside and outside. Ironically, the script and the direction are very good, or rather they can do their best in the desired situation: seeing the actual deadly scene under the bridge, completely disorienting the video-taped point by one of the perpetrators by regular camera cam That's a speed And when Irka returns to the air in the first radio show, she tries to do her old shots, and from Foster's performance, she finds a 'heart' about how much this scene feared him. Clear directions and scripts, the best view of the movie. But there is a lot of posting in the most appealing psychology: is he the taxi driver's DD Neuro or the death of Branson? We have his description on the scene, some of it does not have to do with his radio show, as he travels around the clock and does not see his spontaneous work to clear the street. But unlike Death Wish, a movie which holds more ambiguity and ultimately does not respond to the scene of revenge, the only way to endless violence is to hear a message, which will not be known to anyone who sees the Live Time second, the movie of the week is the MollyDreama. <br /> <br /> Actors work with what they've given, and ultimately it is expected, turn the Hackneynade plot, and Plain's old inexperienced (plus, oddly sunny, like a few sounds by Howard after getting a shot in a scene), and Walking motions become stronger and stronger. This is a very troubled figure, a genuine interest and a clear-headed convention-with just a few moments.
