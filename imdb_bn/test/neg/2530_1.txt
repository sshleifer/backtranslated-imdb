This film is trash because, for many reasons it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is a trash. I must say that Mark Furman is a racist pig which is just looking for another way to get himself in spotlight - and others who belong to this kind of trash are in jail. For the film, based on the book, it was horrible. The murder case became such a big book and film because she married her only in the Kennedy family, her daughter is married, and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family has the power to create and cover somehow, they are just a family and the middle America needs to get on obsession. This poor man and his family have been terrified by police for years, they could not get Tommy, so they became Michael. It is amazing that he went to prison with all the evidence, which does not support that he did it, restricting restrictions in other things, God did not see this trash after the trials should be returned for love after the quarter.
