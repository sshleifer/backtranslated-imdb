I give the lowest rating of 1 in "flashdance" 10 because it is not much more than a series of music videos with a small film surrounding music videos to watch as a feature length movie. Since that picture is counted as? Jennifer Belles starred 18 year old dancer, Alex Wans, who did the job of doing the padding steel plant in an impossible way. A line of work Most elderly women can not find their way, 18-year-old comes out of high school. Meanwhile, at night he worked as an external dancer, who never took off his clothes, a chicken bar named Macby. Nevertheless, watching movies on the streets of the night with good choreographed and good polished dance routines, you think they are working in the best casino of the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex is an anticipated romance with his boss, Nick Harley (Michael Nouri), who doubled his age. After opposing Nick's progress, because it's not a good idea to get out of the boss, it's not a waste of time to always walk with him after his first date. Alex and Nick did not make any effort to hide their relationship on the job, it does not give any idea how to see Alex's colleagues. <br /> <br /> When the bell is not doubled for many dances, the sequence of the movie, its character, often moods throw tantrum. Alex's dream is to get invited to invitation only to Dans' prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory. Unexpectedly, when his boss / boyfriend helped him get audition, he was dreaming, he threw a fool of her. He is angry that Nick is not auditioning because of his interference and then comes out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is the only view that lets you think about what they thought when the makers made it. <br /> <br /> Alex has finally received his audition in Conservatory. He kept a dance routine in front of the Conservatory Board, which is a movie that you think is very ridiculous for the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie selling in the MTV generation market. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I can judge whether the bells actually work well on the basis of what I actually saw "flash dance". That is why the character that is forced to play him is so bad that I do not think that it is a fairly litmus test for his acting abilities. <br /> <br /> You have to make it "flashadens" though. This film proves that creating the poorest film can be covered by a fierce marketing campaign. In this case, a best sale and awards soundtrack and music video for this soundtrack for heavy rolling in MTV. If they engage in more power to write scripts, they might have been able to tell a plot and stories that I care about. Instead we can not take any visitors seriously with a functioning brain kept in the ridiculous view of what the stock characters get. A really forgotten "film"
