Even a true yawner and a bad film for Chan series. I prefer a good Charlie Chan film or even a reasonable good, but short ways to mark this symbol. When Charley has stolen any other energy plan, the work for our government is listed to help figured the killing of a scientist. The mystery is very pedestrian and does not rent much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Montmartre as Birmingham Brown. He has given the film a comedy and has some pretty awesome faces, but then the pickings are rather thin. Benson Fong here as Tommy Chan and pair up all the chan's girls. What about Sydney Toler? He is very beautiful but it looks like he is busy carrying the film. What I did the most goals was the film shot. Chan manager Phil Rosen, whom I usually like most of his entry, uses long shots without any action (such as the initial walk of the house from Charlie). Why? It takes 64 minutes to cry loud loud! As the shot tells me that the manager had to finish the time because the script was even worse. Perhaps it's not the worst chan film ever made, but unfortunately I'm the worst of it ever since.
