Let's not brood ourselves, this is not a torture plan or a cat woman. It's bad, time! Performance drama can be changed from School Theatrics (Marla English) ('Tom Conway') 'can not be less careful' Photography (even in a good print) is so annoying that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. The real problem is, however, pointless, vain, almost intriguing story and leaden, stupid direction. In 77 minutes it still feels uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is particularly inactive. There are two story lines that intersect at one end only at the end of the picture. Tom Convey is trying to create a super race using Voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in the evidence) that he can control telepathically. He has kept his wife captive (not for obvious reasons). Meanwhile, in anticipation of gold and jewelery, a few small crocodiles and a white predatory type guide are trying to find out the village that they are working on. When they finally arrived, Tom Convey decides that one woman among them, the perfect thing for her test. She turned into a giant, killing Conway (natch!) And then returned to normal. When he saw a gold statue sinking half of it in a warm pool, tried to recover it and the water fell and apparently drowns. White hunter wife rescued The final shot we supposed to see, the woman drowning again appeared as a monster; A serial threat (now that's really a terrible thought!). <br /> <br /> An avp producer, Samuel J. Arkoff, includes a DVD, in lecture, teenager prides himself on the old market spot and is pleased to impress it with less budget movie. However, it is impossible to see that anyone can satisfy any of this obscure concomitant of the audience. What might they possibly think? The giant is rarely seen that it can rarely be called a horror film. Jungle action is tepid and tiring. There is no teenager in it and no child can be expected to identify a child. <br /> <br /> Producers have released a 77-minute film, but they did not make any films. This is a trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of his cooperation with her.
