Dresden had great prospect because of his spectacular theme and its high budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted to be better ... but not so. The only good thing is the special effect that is done very well, but, like the really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It is badly written that the script is trying to fill the genre with standard suspense / love-story elements but there is no depth or originality. It's way down the average. Next thing: It's also bad guitars. It has an indispensable TV-directing-style that wants to do great work with many close-ups and quick editing where there is actually no step or doubt. The actor is not bad but there is no performance touchable touch in any way. <br /> <br /> I do not know ... they are obviously trying to do a simple TV-movie and not for movies. , Where it is always good to have some edge and a clear visual style. But why do they try to fill the general commercial Hollywood rules? It seems like a real screenwriter, like a weekend-class American scriptwriter-guru, and then distributes this mess. There is no producer who is not responsible for the project who is interested in dramatic / visual style or plain, these magical movies that make some TV-movies superb?!? Do they think that a TV-audience does not have to get stupid and high-quality movie experience? Downfall was a very good example for a good TV-movie, but perhaps there was some executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with "Fall" instead of ...
