I saw this picture in a party, we are very surprised at last, rather it has become poor. Although the whole movie is not very amazing, I hope a little better. This movie is pure trash, but I suggest you see it if you find cheap videos with a weak script quite funny. Personally I liked the advertisement, it was my overall highlight, the battle scenes were basic, a shot of a knife, some shades on the window, fake blood. I must say that the garni dress was quite scary, this image is a mixture of joy, blood of Shibir and bogey hay 2. Apart from this, the film has a slightly better camera and color treatment than the blood of the camp.
