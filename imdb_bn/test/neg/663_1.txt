On the way to theater (military base) to see Superman Returns, I was trapped in traffic by 15 minutes late on the traffic (I live in Sicily), and there was no other movie "C do NO Evil", for which there was no poster, and a brief description of the movie. ..But my girlfriend and I decided to test it ... as soon as I saw it was produced by WWE, I Anatama it's going to be awful. Some of the theater people were very laughing, and it was the first movie I said to walk honestly, and I saw "The Ringer" ... OK, I used to go out of it, but I was very busy sleeping. Ultimately the death of the bad guy was good, but more than that, it was just stupid.
