The only reason I know about this movie is because I wanted to see what was happening since the end of Nancy McKean's life. When I searched for her name, this relatively new TV movie came up. After most investigations I could detect a copy and I was totally disappointed with what I saw. D-grade played, poor script, terrible FX - it was like watching a toned-down, more stupefied version of that day for more 3 hours after next day. Despite the long running time the letters are fairly unstable, we are not worried about their little issue and, most of the time, are desirable for their death. Get together with the terrible lighting and cinematography and you have a real disaster in the movie. How they are so excited to be present in such trash so many "names" actors (such as Dean West, Randy Quaid, Brian Denhehei). Summary - I want to return 3 hours of my life !!!
