This is a movie where acting, set position, direction, and effects were so bad that you must rent a copy of 5 or 6 friends, bear owl, sit and see it. To borrow from Douglas Adams, "If you see this movie your brain will be broken by a piece of lemon ... wrapped in a big gold brick wrap." <br /> <br /> <br /> What is wrong? Everything. Posting as a British actor American, there are many that it can stop like Bob Hoskins but he is not one of these. Why not choose North America, why not say it in England or something else? The director actually likes to take more shots of ass and ass than the girls coming up with some kind of character motivation. So at the moment you will say to drunken friends, "All rights! Another T & A!". There are not many conversations, so go to the kitchen and make those sandwiches. What do I like about this movie? After my friends went out, I could collect $ 185 from them and told them that after spending the terrible movie, they spent it on the strip bar.
