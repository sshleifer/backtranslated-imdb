Comedy Broadway Success Screen Treatment "The Gay Divorce" (a title used in the US that is considered to be very sad for American moviegoers) is about meeting with a woman and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) in shameful situations In the process of divorcing his wife to divorce; They dance, argue, make-up, dance, dance some more, and dance some more. Betty Grable is very interesting among a very short (singing number "Let's Kiss KNose" with too much sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star looks sad and unhappy across the couple. Nearby scrawl-sophisticated still characters are not one dimensional. * **** to 1/2
