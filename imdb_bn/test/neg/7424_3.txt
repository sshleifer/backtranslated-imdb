A plane carrying a large biotech farm employee - including the CEO of the CEO - falls into the dense jungles of the Pacific. When the search and rescue operations are stopped, CEO, Harlan Nolis (Lance Henriquesen), combines a small rugatta group to run their own search and rescue missions. But only Noules is trying to find and rescue, and just following what and watching them in the jungle? <br /> <br /> Oh, what was this trouble! It was a shame because it played Lance Henriken for one, who is my favorite modern-day actor and two, it could easily be a decent movie. It suffers from two major flaws, and perhaps it is the fault of both the writers / directors Jonas Kostel - this film (which I call by the lawyer of Saskatchev) only afterwards I have ever seen the worst edit in the Dark (2005), and for the castle's seamless uninterrupted It seems to be suggested, "OK, let's try again, but now I want everyone to talk on each other, non-crude To improve growth and usually boring as possible. " <br /> <br /> was possible. Regardless of the rip-off direction (Any element related to flat crashes was probably trying to dig the Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to title giant predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like expression and laughable dialogue, plot commitment and subtler And there was potential for much less saccharine subtexts. The giant costume, once we get to see it actually, was enough for my taste. Castel and fellow writer Chris Lanning stopped stereotype authenticity from 11 to at least 5 and used to spend more time searching for their relationships, but the mix of character can be great by using wood. There was some nice production design of the "Layer" of the giant, especially the corpse decorations Ala more primitive zipper cryippers (2001). If it is well edited, there were some scenes with a good view that could easily be implemented. The most scary thing about Saskat is the number of wrong paths: For some reason, Kostel thinks it's a good idea to spend conversation scenes in real-time each other, instead that we see some lines of the scene, then some lines of view B To see, then again A, back to B, and more <br /> <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks the use of black screen in conversation snippets A good idea, although in irrelevant comments sent within a specified time after another at another time, or irrelevant comments seem to be happening. <br /> <br /> For some reason, she does not care about whether she is shot in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the middle of the night. Random them. In that case, we seem to be selecting the scene shown in random. Important events sometimes or rarely appear, and we're stuck with many unfathomable scenes. For some reason, he saw the cave industry scene when it needs more details to justify it, or it only needs to be cut, because it is not important (demonic intelligence and "humanity" are easily shown in any other way. can go). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Manchini - although she is essential but has gone to the script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , The letters are called Harel Nolls "Mr. H", as they are stereotype of Asian pets. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, the costliest "Blu-ray cam" and "destert-cam" for giant attack scenes, although the dress does not look bad, and it would have been more effective to put some fog, except for a delicate filter, or bad cinematography. something else. <br /> <br /> I could go, but you can get the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to make this picture better than me? I'm a fan of Heinrichsen, I'm excited by the topic, I like setting, I like hiking and it's basically a level hiking movie - but I could not do it. Every time I thought it was going to be good to "end up from this point", Kostel made some other terrible steps. In the end, my score was 3 out of 10
