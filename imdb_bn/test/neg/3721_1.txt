Although I do not recommend this movie, I do not recommend reading this review without seeing the film. Although I have not finished or have made the most of the plot, this film will be best viewed without any prior information. The main problem with the movie Donny Darko is difficult to understand, because many have to deal with. It seems that Richard Kelly of his first feature film, teenage anger for encouraging teenage plays, stockner's directories on late night, collected enough views of self-righteousness and illogical, extraordinary philosophy; Then mashed them into a single two-hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply unfortunate - for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to guide viewers firmly without any feeling of emotion or money, making them sympathetic to one-dimensional characters, and on all expectations they will ignore unused conspiracies, which are vaguely full of loose ends, conceal it, and conceal CGI effects A veneer of -surrealism. The main character, Donny Darko, committed a young man, committed for therapies, misunderstood his friends, and expressed adverse reactions to his suburbs. We think that he is more intelligent than his classmates, although sometimes it is a difficult assumption. For example, when a friend came up with unreasonable theories about Smurfs and Donie Counter came up with his own theory, then his friend complains about "All Smart" acting about Donny. But Donie's statement is not much smarter than her friend - just passion The only clear proof of his intelligence is that the original description of his proven test scores has been described as "scary"; But the manager's slant against the general classification of human elements (such as the order of voice-love) is slim, it is a poor alternative to character development. To deal with mental problems, Danny took drugs, which was not directly added to this film. In fact, the whole problem of medicine has diminished, and the director had to lose the first opportunity to break the film. Danielle's strange fate, this could be a product of his imagination, the possibility is pushed back into the background, which makes 100 percent science fiction. It would not be a bad thing in itself, but "science" behind the "imagination" is too loose. Explanations of time travel are weaker, poorly known as the best word for the barbarism. We think that the author of the film can read a book about time travel or several chapters and can not remember how it works, but it sure was really interesting and wanted to work in the film. The scientific part, consequently, relies heavily on costly computer animation than the actual development of theories involved (at one point, a teacher discusses the time of the trip, that if he talks about it, he will be fired.) No further explanation is required. Daniyal's behavior with an audience in the future will take him many rogue steps. Justifying for this action is a tricky business. He damaged his school, but it is okay because his school does not treat him like a person. His punishment of a vague self-respecting advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruz's character in Magnolia) caused people's humiliation. But what should the audience believe that any kind of spiritual angel is Donny? He is fighting against ignorance and barbarism? He himself seems unaware of the impact of these events. Along with these flaws, the film is flat, associated with selfish generalization of humanity. This movie was set just before the election of Bush / Dubakis in 1988, and the director touched this time at this time. But the focus has spread so far: Danny is voting for his father Bush, planning to vote for his free spirit, rebel daughter Dukakis. Here even there is nothing similar to the political statements; Simply a clear statement The former does not need to make a good film, but the next should be dropped. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt statement can not divide all human emotions into the joy of "fear and love"; It does not tell a large part of the audience's understanding. Everyone knows that there are two more people passion, and this is very important. Mr. Kelly paid tribute to some of the 80's pop culture in his film: ET, Stephen King, Smurfs, Back to the Future. Its heart, like this film director, looks like self-esteem, self-experience, interests, personal heroes, and collective hands collected by adversity, recognition and stupidity, stitched together by almost unrecognizable hands. The full songs are played in the format of the music video format, the director likes the song. Characters that have no relation to plot (including archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher), have given unnecessary focus because the directors really wanted to pack them in some way. The strange mess that Danny Darko has surprised us, if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas to make any other film on his head, or if he wastes all his creativity in a vain, tedious, scary endeavor. <br /> <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
