My summary indicates that this movie has 1479 votes - it is only 21 small to be eligible for IMDB's notorious 100 list below - 100 lowest rated movies on the website. With only a loss score of 1.8, this film will be ranked on the list between # 38 and 46 - Talk about very suspicious achievements !! My score of 3 is not bad - but it is closer to such a horrible list that brings the picture closer. <br /> <br /> This once-intelligent Haroon Carter for this photo - someone else's default and forgotten pop star of 1990 When he broke the first scene, he was a cute kid with some songs in pre-teenagers and tiners at Radio Disney. His song, look, and image were all made intelligently and made by marketers and strategies - some huge albums led to the sale. Unfortunately, by 2005, sales were reduced and Carter hit the painful stage of his life - all of his children had to cope up to his age. To make it happen quickly, he is no more attractive in this film and is in a very difficult phase of life. I now think he is a fantastic young man ... but he was not disappointed at once and again "popster". Here, he is very normal ... his position as a pop sensation is the death penalty for a child. Interestingly, the film has some appearances by some former ex-teen heart-throbs - including the role of David Cassidy and Lefé Garrett - two people who want to be invisible from circles. The cache was broken into pieces by creating a building for itself, although Garrett was a great example of the pop star, after which the stardom was a curiosity to live. Hopefully, in the future, after Carter Cassidy, and thanks so far, she managed to avoid the negative publicity of many former pop statues and the appearance of the court. I was very thrilled with the film, but with great importance in this section. In the middle of the 1990s, he was not blamed across radio and television. <br /> <br /> Carter does not need to stretch herself in this picture - she plays a pop star. However, despite millions of people being created and adored by the girls, he "does not have it all". She is quite dense - mostly because she has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that her mother does not decide to go to school at home - she is forced to go to public school. The problem, though, is that she is rather scary about taking exams ... and making school grade difficult. So, he got the idea of ​​finding a smart girl of today - who would normally be forced to help him in school. He is intelligent but likes Bookish Zen (Alana Austin) and he really liked the tragic endeavor to use this project. <br /> <br /> This path is not bad and may even work, though it seems to be much like an episode of "Brady Bowche" or Nicheldian Seat-less Show. Sure, it is predictable and you know that the formula will mean that he will eventually learn his plot and hit and he will finally realize that he actually watches for him and at the end of the film, all will be forgiven and they are a real couple. However, given in good acting and competent direction, it can be valuable for its teen fans, not always as bad as expected. And, as it turns out, this plot is not exactly where went ... but it was very close. <br /> <br /> I have some good things about pictures. Tenn Bosley and Stella Stevens were very nice to play Zen's grandfather - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. Also, in 1970, the film's movie star was seen in the film of Andrew Stevens - it looked nice to see him again - though this part of my hated him because he looks so big after all these years and I'm 45 years old! She did a fine job and it was nice to see him in the same film as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> For Carter, he had a long experience on TV, he was not surprisingly good. His relationship with Jane does not seem very believable, he and Mrs. Austin gave them the best. The film was not great, but they tried and I think most of the problems in the film were in writing - with a good and less formative plot, it could work better. Plus the whole "testophobia" angle is pretty convved ... and seems rather significant. Who gets worried about any Mega Millionaire Star School gets examined? Overall, the current rating is not a leakage film, although there is not much to attract to a wider audience. Carter-loving up-big stars will probably enjoy the film. Older people will also take care of few young people who are not likely to listen to them. For them, there is no nostalgia value in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film ... Letter Garrett advised Aaron. I felt like screaming "Do not listen !!" But no!
