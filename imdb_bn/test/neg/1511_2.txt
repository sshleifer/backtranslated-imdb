(As a note, I want to say that I saw this movie in my annual church camp, where the whole young man laughs at it. One year later I saw this as a shelf, if only for humor, I was born from a bad effort to make an evangelical movie.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Regardless of the authenticity of Christ's sacrifice for you as a nice movie cinema or movie and witnessing tool, it is minimized. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Although it is easy for a Christian to agree with disputed matters, the audience never finds life outside of a clay. The scene of the war between Ben and his brother was tremendously dubbed. And there are at least three blatant types in subtitles. <br /> <br /> I encourage the director to comment on any comment for the director. It really helped you to understand why it was written about why the movie was written. Contrary to the way the directors' views of secular society fulfill their requirements for movie-gear: he has expressed strong ideas about some issues of non-Christians as well as religious conflict; Most of the editing he acknowledged was run, but "satisfactory"; He thought that over transit and theme used to be effective; And was completely happy with acting. <br /> <br /> He also wrote the title that he was rather proud: -Al (Read: Most) names are notable. Ben Destin = "Ben Destined", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nikki D = Nicodemus. - The donated car is a symbol of the cycle that lives without Christ. - When Pete Pitt goes on a motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to make the cross. <br /> <br /> I'm not making any of them. He threw some things like that on the street and when he said, "Get out of your brain guns" and how "when you die and when you are under God's control". Yes, it was not a type. She really said that. <br /> <br /> I apologize (small) for this movie. Do not jack the "cool car" and "good message" to make this movie better. However, the film was made from a group of people irrelevant to the 1/100th budget of "The Fast and the Furiouss" and the time limit was not forgiving. Remember that I gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10, so I think it deserves.
