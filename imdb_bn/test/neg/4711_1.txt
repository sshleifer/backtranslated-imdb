Terrible acting, terrible scripts, totally unrealistic Bumblebee Flies However for example cliches and sentimentalism love to throats viewers of that movie studio. Alias ​​Wood is unknowingly bad in the initial role, and plot points are narrow and sad. Cook's and Wood's relationship is the best ridiculous. But the worst component of Bumblebee is scripts. This was mostly misconception of the mind-narrow bad conversation I've ever heard. Bamblabis actually crawls between my ears and my chats will be better than listening to Eliha Wood, spin his robotic ribs in his robotically. I wish a "Bumblebee project" would take place on me, so I could have graciously no memories of this stinker.
