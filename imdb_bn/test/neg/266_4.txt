I enjoyed Ocean 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable, performances by performance and direction. However, I was frustrated with this picture. Do not make me wrong due to Brad Pitt, Kathryn Zeta-Jones, St George's performance of George Clooney and Matt Damon, it's Steven Soderberg's skillful direction and practical guidance. However, this film really is truly slow-pacing, I slowly fell asleep in a cell phone. Secondly, the plot is very slow and has many turns and rotations that make it hard to hold. This camera work was not innovative in the first film. In the first film it was smooth and professional, it was shocking and weird here and the music was not particularly memorable. The screenplay was not funny or funny, and the film seemed anti-climatic. Despite the expert playing and direction, at the end of the day it was all very lazy. So many potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
