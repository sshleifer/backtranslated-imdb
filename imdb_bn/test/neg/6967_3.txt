Many know, it's Edward D. Wood Junior features film as an early writer / producer / director / actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for many years now. Although I do not like it as many of his other films, it is perhaps the most insight that the film's people get out of wood during their life. Everyone knows that he was a transvestite. This image is about one's sexual change and how transvestite can cause conflicts between loved ones. The film is ahead of time dealing with this issue and how it deals with it. However, the film still has a natural damage to the rich dialogue, meaningless stock footage and the special effects of hockey. Threat to Badu Lugosi's wooden normal overdose, and Wood is the first attempt at being your director. <br /> <br /> The plot goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite. Tips to avoid further problems along this line suggest how to commit suicide. The doctor tells him the story of Glenn, who is also a transvestite. Glenn wants to marry Barbara, but she can not bring herself to keep herself secret. She told an inspector about Allen that causes sexual changes because she is more suitable for being a woman. While Lugosi is acting a scientist who seems to be adding some series of commentary about what is happening (Logosi's section is not well-defined and probably his film can be a car for his star and logosy star in cash). <br /> Finally, the film shows Woods' carrier's symbol. It was probably shot in a very low budget and several things were instead dropped in disguise. It definitely has to remember it "It's so bad, it's good". However, Edge has to congratulate her on her progressive view of this film. In the early 50's, transvestism and sexual changes were not very open subjects. Wood took a big risk in creating a film that shows transvestite as a person who is not sexist and has put more people in front of cross-dressing.
