Ego It seems that there was only one reason for this movie. This movie is so wrong in so many mistakes that it is proud of writing a lot about it. Each character had a similar emot of praise to praise and lead actors (only the director as I use this term liberally). A little story, if it fails in basic aspects like logic, feeling, and drama. Many pages of guidelines are preferred. Blantant flaws are everywhere (character objectives are not defined, possible husbands are found overnight, broken car windows corrects themselves in other things) <br /> <br /> can not work in the glacier. No, it seems, Hansika Matwani can be. In his defense, he still feels a cruel child who is older than him, thanks to tons of make-up. Rajbaar overacts and makes her little presence as much as possible the fake. A little more smile of philosophy. Hemes is the only natural actor to be friends. <br /> <br /> Some questions come to mind: How much is the price of this movie worth 500,000,000? Where did the money go? Messa√ßa Sherwat was fined 15 minutes and 15,000,000 rupees for 2 songs. But the stupid stupidity of the film is intelligent. (3 of the auto rickshaws in Mumbai that shows and the police jump in the car) <br /> <br /> Good: Himesh Sahib shows the courage to show his courage and tranquility to make the film "topi." Let's give the Devil the reason for this: Himes, naturally, give good music. <br /> <br /> Bad: Instructions, stories, and it's still hard to get rid of Himesh's song! <br /> <br /> Ugly: dialogue and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> The final word: painful in every sense of the word! Watch this movie if you like Subhash Ghayer's "Yadin"
