Frustrating fantasy action-adventures films based on Michael Bayett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard), since the talent some scenes of his painful pissing, poor characterization and general dullness Why Solomon (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army in the African war, where he is confronted with the riper of Satan ?? A demon who gathered the debt of Satan's soul ?? Just refusing to go to hell, he avoided Ripper and started a new life in the English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has gone behind the culture of its violence and bloodshed, and has instead accepted peace and priceless values. But once he was expelled from the shrine due to fear of Devil's Ripper, he would have to return to his home in the city of Devon and along with that he would be friends with a Purvianan travel family to travel to New World. The family was attacked on their journey through British Council and their daughter Medeidith (Rachel Hooor-Wood) was abducted by Maliki's army, which proceeded to the front lines of the mysterious mascaid rider. Now the people of peace, Solomon will have to go back to his previous life as a destroyer of past violence and the destruction of Meridith. <br /> <br /> Despite being ready to work from a large source material and potentially create. Exciting and chronic medieval action-adventure film, the film failed in three main areas. The pacing of this film is terrible, which can do much with an incredible run of just one hour and forty minutes (and it may be a consequence that might make this movie a triangle). Continually screaming into actionable and bloody blood clots between plays and self-charities, some sequence kills the order of the verb. Visitors feel incredibly uncomfortable at the edge of their seats rather than blurring with eagles, and it follows the next critical criticism. An action-adventure movie is not often called as 'Action-epic', 'Solomon Kai' or in some circles. The action is hypocritical and dull, and usually ends before you have the opportunity to praise beauty of decapitation. Finally, apart from Solomon itself, this film has very small characteristic. For example, we know a little bit and for this reason, in a very young age, Solomon takes a little care about the young lady who travels on her journey. And I imagine again that the filmmaker will mention the criticism that perhaps it is going to be a second movie that this movie must have missed touching these aspects. <br /> <br /> This is not a complete terrible film. James Purefoy gives a fantastic performance as Solomon, the tenants who do not fall back to his conscience or his blade, and his decisions will certainly have to be decided on his own, but also those who will have an impact on him as well. Respect, respect, and acceptance must go to the baset and its crew, to create a beautiful position that they beautifully reflect the timing of filming. It is not difficult to do this occasionally by praising the location position, shots, and the beauty of the maiage-at-the-scenes. Which certainly shows that many times and efforts have been made in this film, unfortunately it is not the same for stories and characters. The 'Solomon Kai' course was more likely than just a 'action-epic', but it seems that due to the lack of true depth of stories and characters, Michael Baset did not create more than one-dimensional appearance in the medieval period.
