"Quintet" is definitely not a movie most people find interesting or even interesting for that topic. There is no visual, dialog, acting or plot development which will illuminate sparks. The ice world is one thing, but duplicate plots are something that you really can not endure. Characters are not just three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there is no emotions and there is no idea what is going on. There is a world in the ICC where no one other than quintet playing is doing meaningful work and the rules of the game are not even indicated. The house is not hot, even electricity, but who and what produces? There is no wood, but there is no creature except dogs, so where does the clothes come from or shoes, since there is no apparent art and everyone is dressing in 16th-century Europe, which is just the opposite. So do the future pavilion backdrop. Althamen's imagination will have to stop the entire movie sequences, and he will never bother about sharing his ideas or his vision with the audience. There is no relation to solitude or frustration with the lack of appeal of this movie, George Lucas' "THX1138" is not a brighter place in the world, and the characters are not funny, but the story's way. In Quintet, there is no clear or even suggestive way, and in my opinion it can not think about the idea behind it, for example, similar films, John Bormann's "Zardz" It's not even Altman's unique style, so it does not appeal to its fans, and I'm also one of them. After all, Robert Olman had a dream, and he was not talking about what he meant to mean, even not even to him.
