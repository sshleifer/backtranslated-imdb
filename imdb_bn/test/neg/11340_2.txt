As much as I follow Syrian, I hate this movie, at least I can say that wildfire was funny. Animated series is probably one of the worst things produced. Animation is quite often inappropriate, though it is consistently bad. The shape of a character is even able to change the variable even in the same shot. Scripts and voice acting are also going to be a bit preferred because most casts feel as talented as a third-grade play cast. Cami and DJ-like characters have become so strong in the stereotypes of their nationality that their episodes are often painful, but this series is not always painful. Episode plots try to reach new levels of lumen with every celebration and plot pores are so full that it surprised me that it was time to show ads to them. In fact, it makes me shocked to show me advertising on advertising. In addition to a bad series it's an even worse adaptation to the Street Fighter. Many have failed adaptation to the film. For example, why and why the men are foolish (although why are supposed to be rich), Blake is Gail's friend Charlie, and Chun Lee is a journalist. The movie takes talent as something to take as bad and makes it worse.
