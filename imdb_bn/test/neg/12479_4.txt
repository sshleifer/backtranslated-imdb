There are some horrific directors for whom I have developed so much respect and respect for so many years that they can not decide on how to decide on the garbage and how can they decide about the garbage. Lucio Florina must be one of them, but the enemy, he is trying to disappoint me with his next effort! In most cases of flowering movies directed or produced by the end of the 80s, you can easily afford yourself and see "Bit In Brain" instead, because it retrieves and repeats the title of less than seven of Phulasi and the most important footage. Fluffics with the sequence of the most deadly killings featuring "Flash Alice Broke the Mirror". Overall, this film must be placed among the weakest and most profitable achievements of our directors. This script is as inconsistent as hell, the foundation is completely impossible and there is absolutely no mystery to be stupid and enjoyable. I love the title, but it's actually quite meaningless. The story has a character named Elise, but it is only a helpful introduction and he certainly does not break any mirror. I think he can break the stuff using only his voice, he is an opera singer, but he does not. The plot surrounds middle-aged and gambling-addicted potters, who spend their money spending their wealth by raping widows of rich people. Lester Persson deceives women (as well as unexpected witnesses) in the method of lady, extracting stacks from their small body parts and feeding the residue of her cat. There is also a stupid psychological sub-plot that he thinks his own shadow is responsible for killing instead of him. The difference between "Alice Broke the Mirror" and Phulchi's greatest horror films ("Bound", "Living Dead City", ??), is that it is a complete horror atmosphere. Characters included in letters are colorless and annoying and murders in general. Is pictured; headache on a microwave in the head of the world or running repeatedly on the human body with a car The common thing is that the light is poor, cinematography is very ugly, strange and amateur and the performance of the performances is undoubtedly tragic, and if I did not know anything good then I think Lushi also deliberately created a cruel film for all the rigorous protests that critics Dislike, how important it is to keep it in soul and effort The obvious ingredient to enjoy here is only harmful cow and bloodshed, because the attempt to mix black comedy does not work properly, as long as Lester swings off his chains and women's feet, "Alice Brooch the Mirror" is an extraordinary piece of awesome entertainment, Recommendation is not complete.
