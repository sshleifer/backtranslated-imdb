Jr. and his parents started a new life in a new town. It's the same life because junior has changed a bit. She is still the same rotten brat before she has still gotten larger. At this time there is a pal in the name of his tricks and he is a little worse. Junior does not like her father's dating and compromises the facilities she has. Then the grandfather came in and the dog came along. I thought that both of them would make a good movie, but eventually they would not even become friends. This is a movie for most strangers. It does the diapers, farts, doggy, and there are toilet humor in it. Anyone under 12 years old will be very happy. I hope when I have a son, he is completely like junior.
