This formulaic film (married to hero girlfriend girlfriend Wilson) did not go as fast as possible in some situations. Scott seems to be old at this age, and his characters often leave arbitrary tasks, making the scenes the default. He somehow weakly responded to his death; He fled from the Knox gang, hiding the full rain barrel; His turn in the highlands and John Russell's pursuit seems to be irrelevant, as is most of the movie. The plot may be harsh. <br /> <br /> High point in the film: Arnie Ford sees "Tennessee" without any mustache "Man in the Saddle"; A very brief scene to cook Alfonso Bedoua; High Country Color Photography, and Fight Scenes with John Russell
