Like Mohiuddin's real possibility, the frustrating thing about this movie is often heavy-handed. We talk about metaphor metaphors, metaphors ... but the truth is that there is no such thing in the surroundings that there is no plot or actual character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > They ... do not understand where they are going. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All styles and no substances Of course, this is a taste ... but I will never accept the symbol and Splash's confusing modernist pesti on the spiritual clarity of Gene Kotko or Reno. But it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I guess.
