This film is a hippe and proof of huge success proves how frustrating our people are to a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the huge success of "Tash Maa Tash" is also a proof. <br /> <br /> I am not going to start how important I am making the film, because it is obvious with half the brain? The world has changed. <br /> <br /> I will not say how many films in our society need to solve our many problems in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and more. <br /> <br /> There was a bitter Saudi film news that was a solution to some of our problems, especially on youth. Instead we encounter a boy's movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> The script was clear to ignorance and naivety. It was such a 13-year-old who wrote. <br /> <br /> Now I have heard that the budget for this movie was huge. I want to know, where did the money go, right? The effect was really ugly, the edit was poor. The script was "Kharbet". You do not know how the story and the director are watching from this movie. <br /> <br /> The actor, who played a religious brother, had a good note, but in a bad way. He is another thing about the role of religious friends, how religious people work in Saudi Arabia here! According to the will of the film, they are not "Evil". In fact they are among some of the worst people you ever meet in some extraordinary ways of living and this is what should be present in the film. <br /> <br /> The youth are following religious people because of one reason, and the youths are the most passionate and feeling. And young people follow them with religious living on the established principles. Again, this is what we should see. <br /> <br /> We need "first movie" with our Saudi authors, actors, directors, musicians, even cameraman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie. Since the people of our society are still seeing art as a sin, the challenge faced by the Saudi filmmaker is to change the angle's mindset.
