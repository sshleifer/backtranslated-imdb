OK, where to start I can not believe how well reviews I read here. I saw this (2004) and I had to fight for pushing the stop button, I decided to continue the good reviews I've read. It was my duty to tell the world after watching this. About 30 minutes before the end of the film, the film seems to have never started, the audience is wondering, 'When will it start', so do not ever call it a 'revenge movie' because revenge even until half of the movie does not start even Starts. In addition, the film tries to convince you that it is a post-apocalypic Australia I show half the movie on the sad rural road and do not regret showing a vague letter on a sign, even until 1979 it was not a science fiction. So anyway, randomly add it to the homoerotic sub surface and you've got a great movie for yourself (I have nothing against gays, no need for it). The only good part was the first Chase scene, it's a good direction like 1979 and another good part is that he killed the last person. So basically I suggest you take the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself more than the things you have been sitting in the middle, which can lead you out of your eyes. I do not say I warn you.
