The original review that I have planned for this movie was probably a little more rigid, so I'd like to promote it well: Sleeping Hole is a perfectly acceptable beer-o-pizza or solver movie, which you see with a good group of people when the mood is light and nobody really The movie is focused on. The visual element is beautiful, and some part of it, fun. But awful, my friends, it is not. I made it wrong to watch some lights shiver with lights off all. This is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (This is a serious offer.) True horror fans are well deserved.) Now my complaints are complete with Spirir Spirir Spiris Spolyllus Splilers in Spleel, even if you do not even try to try, bother to make a movie "based". True, feeling, voice, or original theme to stay true? Listen carefully to the symptoms of ill-written dialogue and you will hear the rising slowdown of Washington Irving in his graveyard. I'll accept the big-city detective bit too, but ... Richie lady draw around the bed? Come on, there's nothing even vaguely in "The Legend of Slowly Hole", but it is a historic forest. I'm not taking care of an neo-pagan ax, but in the 18th century "magic" meant selling your soul to Satan in exchange for confident energy; This entire brutal White-Witch goddess-worship "Anne-i-Han-Han-Some" is returning to the museum, historically, to the British attack. (If you do not believe me, then James Fraser's "The Golden Buff" is referred to as "The Golden Buff" by interested parties in the actual old-school pagan practices.) It creates an isolated material that spreads in the context of the film, which is very different from sleeping hollow legend. So we completely wind up with a completely different story. If it was Burton's idea, then he would warn us in advance. Nevertheless, he would bring a better story than a pedestrian I wanted here. And he could also completely exclude the evoking projection as well. And, at any rate, movies are not scary. Not once definitely no. The war criminal tree came closer, but it was relatively more by the ridiculous effect of the French comedy of Hessian. And finally, yes, I wanted Kristina Ricci for Christmas, but God never wanted to call her blonde.
