After his career as romantic leading man ended in the late 1960's, Rock Hudson acted on various projects, including TV shows and short films. However, I believe that the "fetus" is his only turn as a crazy scientist, and perhaps it is a good thing. I think his job was needed. <br /> <br /> During a dark and windy night driving, bright Dr. Paul Holiston (Hodgson) hit a duberman, which he returned to his lab (which seems somewhat Midwestern basement dank). Then he managed to raise dog dogs outside the dog, so naturally he decided to do the same with the people. She raised Victoria (beautiful Barbara Carrera) in the same way from the embryo. Victoria grew at an amazing speed, and soon blossoms in a fantastic young girl. <br /> <br /> Forecasting, things go terribly wrong. At the start of Haliston, Holstein's sister Martha (Dean lad) surprised the young man from where he came from, and Victoria himself began to show signs of unrest and violence. The final sequence is a long car charging directly from "Smoky and Bandit", after which Victoria? Are suddenly adult in just a few minutes ?? A deadly attack was carried out by Holiston, who failed to destroy his perverted creations along with his unborn child. All of these are along with screwching tires, roaring engines, a car fire, and many sirens. Suddenly while working in Victoria, a cluster of paramedics ended, Holstein expressed regret ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These sets are quite cheap and very old to today's viewers, Hudson's relay to relay tape recorder is about the size of a fridge. Most of the work is done in a weak illuminated laboratory. Hodgson has been sleeping with his sordid roles, he thinks he's really a clean movie star, Lade and Carra more credible. Surprisingly, Rudy McDowell popped up briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> Passport video transfer is very low, although it is made from a bad VHS copy using the home appliance. If you're nostalgic for the year 1976, then say it once only after seeing it. Otherwise, instead see a football game or soap opera.
