B. Kennedy tried to create a signal by exaggerating and broadening the extreme left-wing Western (not as G. Kenny Siegel as leftist, it came later). <br /> <br /> This is the most rude movie. Two sequels ?? Looking very ugly. It is slapdash. B. Kennedy made it amplifying ?? But without that for talent. Hundreds of pawns, hundreds of Mexican _compadres, hundreds of women, a desert, woodland landscape, a storm? The largest scale. <br /> <br /> All this tedious series is weirdly liked, <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie looks very bad. Brenner, who played the best part in the first film, does not look good on this film. <br /> <br /> Rehi plays a priest; In the next sequel of the franchise, he will be a political leader, Quintoro. <br /> <br /> It is true that you do not need very interesting stories when you have too many characters; sometimes. For example, Brenner met McQueen; Then they pick the other 'compadres'; Or, B Spencer fills the cobbler; Etc. .. It is fun to see where and how they meet with other groups etc. But you need at least some of these characters. Unfortunately, Bart Kennedy's installment is not very good. <br /> <br /> Return of the Seven (1966) starts with a bulfitting. Bin and Chris will meet there; They decided to retain the original Magnificents third alive ?? Chico, belonging to a huge group of 300 pennies abducted by Mexican bandits. Do we find the name of Chico's apple wife? This is Petra. Will Chris again have to form a small army? And here we have a dough dosage treat ?? Chris likes his men from the perpetrators. Commando is a member of the other women, husbands should take good care without husbands. Sexual humor is particularly annoying and annoying in this film. It tries to think smart and spicy; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the first sign, the names of the three consecutive crews according to the name of the Magnificent Seven are combined. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A deadly attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a big plan? He kidnapped 300 pions and used them to build a village and a church in memory of his lost boys. (These insane Mexican revolutionaries are not saying the same wallet in the first film.) Kennedy only bits over the camp ?? Top things: ugly landscapes, lightning, dense wind, a desert A huge war between the soldier and revolutionary vaqueros. Of course, Return of the Seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the film McQueen. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, this genius came very fast after the original movie ?? Ways to create Western <br /> <br /> Both cricketers feel weird.
