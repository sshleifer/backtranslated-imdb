I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and I can not believe that it will be considered for Sweden's 79th Academy Award Best Government Film Award. Last year, producer Ana Anthonyo formally submitted Sweden's best foreign movie to Djozou. I'm not personally a fan of Joso, but at least there was some production value for it. It can be shot as a high school film project. It worked as a small film but lost as a feature film as a character. It has five prominent friends living in a small Swedish city and have no aim or expectation or ambition for their future and prefer to live in their long-term childhood. Actually Falconberg is not like some remote North Swedish village. It is the popular summer resort of nearly 40,000 cities and towns, and among the two major southern coastal Swedish cities of Gothenburg and Malmo. Characters A lot of boys are preferable but if they have an absolute or misguided attitude about what senior students of high school plan to do with their lives, I will definitely take care of them more. Long before the point where they should be planning to deal with adults. If they want to stay in Flaknerburg, they must have some work in the tourist or fishing industry, instead of cycling, drinking, smoking pot and sometimes a house. Perhaps, if they wander with their two friends or two of their friends, then a girl is not entirely absent from this movie, which does not understand. Jasser Gansand created his director early film, and along with the film writer wrote this picture, in which I am using the term Frederick Wenger. Acting is not very bad. I give 4.5 out of 10, but I would not recommend this despite considering the Academy Awards.
