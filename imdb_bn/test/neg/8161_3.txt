I would say, I found this movie very frustrating. Yes, I know Multin has given it 3 1/2 and others think it too much. Well, the opera sequence was God-awful. I take it an acquired taste of Jeannete McDonald. Yes, in short sequences, I saw him as Nelson Eddie, he is very fond of him. But his own ... God, I dislike opera and despise opera, and he is basically helpless. At one point I was covering my ears. Gable is okay, and Tracy is throwing away. Just because the plot is not boring in the JM, he loves Gayle and Apara and why can not he both? Instead he ruthlessly (or not so) he suffered with compromises. Supporting cast is definitely abnormal. Apart from star three and Jack Hollt (and I guess his mother), all of them are just backgrounds and forgotten. EQ sequence only stores movies. And only Yes, it is fairly spectacular and moving. But "Oh God is great" seems very arising. I like the "old Chicago" as the old time disaster goes sightseeing. Expand yourself one of these.
