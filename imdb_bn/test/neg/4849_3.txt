This is a movie that asks specific directors about your past gratitude and reminds you that there are few parts of the work of very few people. <br /> <br /> Casting of Leloch is very important because he keeps the audience in such intimacy with the audience. Actors have brought real screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it is just hollow. <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no screen magic for any of these actors, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Cass became too young. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. Lovable rogue does not match her energy. Charm struck his brand here a false note for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the role. Many of his songs have been so closely linked to Gaibandha's Americanity that songs that sing songs are so close that Jeremy Irons seem to be boring to show love - although it does not really matter in a logical way. It still screwed up the flow of the movie anyway At least for me <br /> <br /> Of course, it must be the right American. I think George Clooney's part has been great. And he will bring magic to the screen in spades. Brad Pitt has done a wonderful job, specially charming and lusty. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Patricia Kash. As I read about him, I learned that he has successfully successful career like a singer and a lot of fans, so what I know, but his screen appearance as a singer is very annoying. He was a singer of the scene, for his interpretation of a song and selling it, he was actually a very good actress in his conversation. Nothing he moved singing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is mention that there can not mention that stunning French genius. Patricia Cas screen shows its fold when it has many charismatic French actresses, who have been replaced. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And since Kash had become so weak in this honor, the film was never a chance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
