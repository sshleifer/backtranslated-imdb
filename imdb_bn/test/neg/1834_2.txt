Trashy is an endless supply of horror movies. It seems that people are not tired of trying to be frightened and thrilling. Alas, this effort is rarely successful. This, unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. The story is highly anticipated, most actors are too stupid, or simply in general, very few special effects. We tried a lot to switch the DVD and not go to bed. Anyone in the world wants to import this drill with a limited number of foreign films issued in the US To top it all, there's seemingly an "Anatomy 2", for those who have good things. I'd rather see the paint dry.
