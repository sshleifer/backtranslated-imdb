I do not see why everyone loves this film so much. True, it has good purpose and meaning, but you can not compensate such a poor script. Woody Allen is a bright filmmaker, but I'm afraid it's just a piece of garbage. It is highly expected and the subject is very visible at all. I love being a huge Woody Allan fan and most of his work, but I can not reconsider it.
