Actually, I do not describe the main plot in this comment, but with just 2-3 sentences I can make it a mockery. Well, these are- <br /> <br /> 85% conversion of Hollywood Flick cellular speed is used by Bikram Bhatta, the Bollywood software. There is no similarity to the title with the title, only the direction of the thriller. Yes that's it !! It does not deserve even a single star for its imitation, incomplete casting, poor standards and predictable stories. Undoubtedly, now I can say that Viraam Bhatta is gradually going away from his director post because no mature listener will praise him for his recent work. Next to him, Aftab Sivdasani made his views like cartoon-comic type. Who knows how long will he remain in the film industry? Sometimes performance and cinematography have less value than C-grade movies. But Jeff Khan played the most helpful role, which was somewhat similar to Chris Evan's role as cellular ryan. Sanjay Suri has no contribution because of his innocent face in the film because he has no influence. That is why people who have already seen cellular will not waste your time again with this imitation bag.
