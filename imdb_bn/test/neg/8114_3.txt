I'm sorry, but for a movie that has been printed as a semi-classic and a scary movie, but seriously, I think that when the manager smiles me unconsciously, then this is not a good thing. The characters of this photo were just so top and unbelievable. I could not stop laughing at Ishkak's voice, it was a loud thrust girl's British voice. Maliki's dramatic status is not mentioned above on his butt character. <br /> <br /> Chicken is a city where all children have killed adults and worshiped any deities who ordered them to dedicate their 20+ age to the children. When a couple has a bad car accident they come to the city for help, but of course they are caught and trapped in the trap of the kid! But other objectives of Malicea are when he is sick to follow the injection order. <br /> <br /> The children of Karna could have been some great, but the top movie got worse, which you could easily have fun. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure it's not his intention and it was a pretty paranoid story, or at least the actors destroyed it. Like to say, to look good, see this, but I'm warning you, it's very kind. <br /> <br /> 3/10
