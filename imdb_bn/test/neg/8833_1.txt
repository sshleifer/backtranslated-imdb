I am sorry but I can not really see why anyone would love it. It is nothing like stereotypical and real homeschoolers they had this show !! Personally I'm glad to be rejected after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of program would be right if everyone knew that the homeschoolers were not really like this and the whole story was only for the show, but unfortunately not everyone was aware of this. If someone sees that this looks, it really seems to be going on in the life of the homosexual, then I feel sorry for them. This reminds me of pictures of homesteaded children in "Minar Girls". It's sad, really, people think this way. It's totally rubbish, IMHO.
