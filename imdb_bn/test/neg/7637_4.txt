This can be a breakout role for Valeria Galino, but the film has decided to draw its attention on the other side instead. The image is a woman known as Grazia (Galino) who is a fisherman and mother of three children. She is a free spirit and exploded trends so the rest of the village and her family sent him to Milan and decided to see a doctor. This story takes place from Sicily on Lampedusa Island and it shows young people competing with gangs in everyday life and tries to do something on the baked stone of the sun. Grace's oldest son passed away (Francesco Kassisa) and always tried to protect him during his depression. Girl Marinella (Veronica d'Agostino) is a fountain girl, who is confident with a local police member and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Puilo) is very naïve and accuses the police. After learning to send him to Milan, Gràcia escapes and hides him in his cave in a passcale, and everybody looks for him. This picture can focus his attention in Grazia, but it can actually have more impact. We see some explosions and illogical behavior in his part, but they do not follow any of these scenes. Nothing comes. Director Juan Cruel gives credit, but the story needs more attention. This film does a great job to show us what life is like on this island and how it is going in the three children's lives. The character of Galino indicates that it is a mermaid like a creature and that is why he is facing problems in the country. I also believe that the island hopes to behave in a specific manner to its residents and if you do not, then you can become victims of the harsh reality of its rules. All the ideas but I think the attention of the film might be with the character of Grazia. He has really nothing to do after he hides the cave. In a sense, the character becomes stagnant. I wanted to do more to the Galino because I always loved him and you can not just close his eyes when he is on screen. He is a bundle of rash, passion and raw power! No shameful crew did not write a more complete role to do. When your left feeling is empty from the incomplete story of the film.
