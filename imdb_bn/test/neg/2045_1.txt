What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you've got yourself when you rent this. Movie quality reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are they always shot to the actors? And why are they always centered? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors that are looking great is so hurt.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue is just plain awful. The role scene with the British Guy, ridiculous. Just try to listen to these words, they rarely make any sense, just go around the circle. Like the lines of the rest of the films, they are coming out of romance and novel novels, as writers do not understand what they are doing. Characters definitely have no idea what they are saying to them like sound. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors acting with this project. Boring!
