De Snyder is the kind of overacting this film in Villain and its bad acting and destroying it for me. The whole movie just took very seriously. It tried to achieve "seven" dark atmosphere without acting well. This movie highlights urban art art / tattoos / body art "subtype" and can affect us in the form of a nose ring (Fear?). I'm not an expert in movies but the script and the acting of this movie are just awful. De Sister watched the villain's part but her acing violin horrid. Until I get anything else I suggest not to waste this time.
