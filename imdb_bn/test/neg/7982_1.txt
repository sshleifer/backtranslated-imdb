Desperate black black humorous about a woman (Mia Faro), who invented her house on Christmas day before discovering her husband (Tony Goldwin). She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically, they keep moving and constantly meet strange people and continue to be seriously ill. <br /> <br /> It was announced as a good movie when I saw it very short runs in an art film during the Christmas season. . I found it sick, unfunny and just depressed. I like black humor but it was too dark for me. Was the character of Parker particularly awful. To make matters worse, Aileen Brainnn was cast as a nun (!!!) and later chewed cheesy with glosses. <br /> <br /> The only save was Faro's performance - it is a much better picture than that. Also very talented Stephen Dorff finally had a relief to see the pop-up. Finally, it was as beautiful as myself, but what happened before was not removed. <br /> <br /> Ill, Meribi, Black "Comedy" in the Peach. A 1
