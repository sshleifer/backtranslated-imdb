Nevertheless, director J. Lee Thompson combines actor Charles Branson for a violent and incompatible activity. In fact, it is probably Brunson's most brutal film (Death Wish, Ten to Midnight, and a credit for a person present in Chattore's land). However, atrocity does not make itself a good film, and The Evil the Men Do, finally frustrating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In order to run his brutal trade around the pit, he was persuaded to find out the doctor of cruel torture and retire to end his life. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are dealing with some graphic torture scenes that are a painful act to show us. <br /> <br /> These themes are really quite serious. Torture escalates into striking Latin American dictatorships, and everyday people only experience some frustrating painful experiences to break an obsolete viewpoint. But people do evil things - for their worthiness - this is not really annoying about the misery of poor people. It is completely annoyed with an excuse to blow up some unexpected scam-bells to Charles Birston. This is simply a drying worker who hangs his coat in genuine problems. The persistence of persecution makes you feel like the viewer, a dirty, sick-in-the-head wizard, but someone who enjoys seeing "sniff" movies. The script is full of horrific dialogs, including some excessive details of horror conversations. The man who fails to explore his annoying ideas is evil ... it acts as entertainment for them and wants to enjoy them. Sorry, but that's just wrong.
