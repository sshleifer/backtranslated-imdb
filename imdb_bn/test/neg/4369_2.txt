I have never seen the first Kilojo film, and I did not hear any good thing about it. So I can see the Keyzo 2 in the local blockbuster and look back. String Trent Hagga and Debbie Rokon are proud of it. Now there's a huge trompo-fan which I'm in there, I'm not going to break this movie in any way, how can it be so bad in both of these? Oh how wrong i was Even Trent and Debbie can not save this excuse of a movie as a real bad one. Trent stumbled like a few kilograms, but perhaps the writer has blamed some of the worst one-liners in the history of the film. Debbie keeps a solid performance but it's not enough. Killing as a woeful effect is terrible. For example, check whether the person is stolen for a while or stealing from others. And it eventually ends up in all the worst I've ever seen in movie history. Even good layers of the film do not do it a bad job. Avoid like clips. <br /> <br /> 2/10
