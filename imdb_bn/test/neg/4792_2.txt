Another horror movie from Hollywood. This time a woman helps revolution in a central American country. Yes yes yes Hey all these realism lets you do a movie without any sense. I'm so sick of movies like this Actors and actresses are lousy, influential cheesy and the dialog is horrific. And suddenly I saw John Rice-Davis as a bad president. From Gimli to Hugo Luis Ramos I bet it's very proud. Well I did not expect much of this movie and I did not. And I'm glad because this sucks big time. I wonder what kind of people who love this movie. My guess is 12-16 years old people. And I guess some people like due to Kristin Dattilo. Well I am not in that group and I hate it. Ratings: 2
