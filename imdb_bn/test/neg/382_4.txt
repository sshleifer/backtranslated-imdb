Playing a version of herself starting with Fulci, writing some ideas for how people can die. Perhaps a brain that is followed by a fake looking cat. The copy I saw was dubbed in English, which I always hate, but I am particularly disappointed that Phulasi can not hear her voice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ghostly movie. When his stomach saw the effects of his movie, his stomach turned into a stomach and he began to intimidate that he was watching the scare. He visits a psychiatric patient, who hypnotizes him and unfortunately has mental health in his mental health. The psychologist, directed by David Craneberg, was reminded at Clive Barckers Nightbride (1990). This shrunk is played by David El Thompson, who is quite bad. A real life friend of Phulasi, when he killed a man, he made a big tooth green, even though this work could be the black humor of Phooli which I was very bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is about to clip many clips from Flachi movies, such as Flachi to set it, watch the recording on TV, or watch the activities. I was not a fan of the TV series clip shows, and I think things like Charles Bond's Full Moon Entertainment are overcoming their old movies and spending three together, like new stories, is pretty cool. I think they want to earn money? <br /> <br /> This theory of cat-infestation in the brain refers to violence in movies that maintain violence in real life. One of Phulchi's colleagues said to have been a documentary crew and followed her to see how her life was. Lots of self-referential stuff like this. Finally, some letters escaped to the boat called "Parvaran".
