Although Channel Tatum is beautiful, the whole film does not have emotions and was boring to watch. Generally I enjoy good romance but it is just a waste of time, despite having tragic materials, I did not tear a tear. It did not work as well. I'm not a film critic, but I would not suggest only girls to avoid it until you see what Chantytul Lall will see, the rest of the film is garbage and if he does not have it (not his acting), then I will stop watching him very fast. Will be. This is really embarrassing because if the right actor is selected for this movie then this could be a real tier jarger. .. If you are looking for a good tears or a film for a girly night ... to miss this one !!
