Wow, what is this video rental store in front of me? 8MM is nothing but a suspicious "sequel". This was not a very good sign for a movie which was a lot more enduring and emotional depth than this film. <br /> <br /> Originally, from the outline of the plot, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his maternal grandmother, Tees Harrington, is suffering from Sorded Underworld of sex and pornography in Hungary's Budapest, it is blackmailing a video with a prostitution, Reese Know whether it is. The whole story has evolved around different characters who make these sexual clubs and strip joints across the city. This mystery is solved when, finally, Tees said that the meaning of the release for the video and (after the story) of his motherhood meant that his trust fund came out of money which is basically going back to his future husband as a story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the only thing to the original is the thriller type, which was really that David ended up with a captive compression on him and he saw him as a strange world of film and the entire movie has emblazoned sex in almost every key scene. Otherwise, it's a completely different movie. It was made for a strange love story, even before the end, which ended the possibility because I did not believe in coming out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was lying on a number of issues, which could make him suffer. <br /> <br /> Most of the pictures were "frustrating" moments of funny humorous scenes, which tried to provoke emotions, encouraging the audience to find Tisha's plot so that she could leave this "brutal" sexual repression. I was at least 11 ridiculously counting the sequence shooting when there was nothing to show in gender. Even in DVD, the menu screen is not only with nude women, but the DVD seems completely provocative. <br /> <br /> There was no heroic person around David's film. You can guess that he was the main problem before long last problem. The actors playing each role were new to me, which they could explain how many of them could resign for their performance. Plot hole was done (how did David and Richard finally find the trail to Tees's father when they tried to investigate prostitution and tried to find prostitution?) There was a moment of Chasey technology up like a bond queen), and the character of a gay brother Nothing has been done but the director was not trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line for this video is complete BS, because it did not even last breath. Someone really died. But they did not have a good car crash order that came out of nowhere ... but it was 10 seconds long for one hour and 3/4 long movies. <br /> <br /> rent (and maybe buy) the original. This is one of the better and more original genre of Joel Schumacher. Everything from the film is good about it. I would not recommend to see this until you want to compare apple from orange.
