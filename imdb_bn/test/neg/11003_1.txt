This picture is terrible - honestly. The act is terrible, the script bothers me, the effect is completely lauai (which I usually do not think of old movies, but it was created just two years ago), and everything bothers me about it. A few friends go into the wild on Halloween and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, it was before it "You really believe? Ha ha, it's just a story" The routine has exploded for a while. The son of the wizard's cancer was rotated (I did not know whether or not it was for comedies, but this image failed in both cases). It has less cows and no nudity, which makes a bad movie worse. Hack, the only good thing about this movie is the leg-eating scene, and even better it can be. <br /> <br /> To be honest, watch your time on cable only, and of course not to buy or rent this, otherwise you may spend some time doing more harmful or entertaining which will be kicking yourself to waste time.
