I was curious about how the issue was handled about being a gay man living in this annoying documentary. Unfortunately, whether the filmmakers can have an energetic and insightful opportunity to create some stir in our collective gay history. This movie is only related to the time in New York City ignoring the rest of the country. When I spent a fair time at NYC, I can assure you that there was a homosexual life outside of Manhattan! Here interviewed men think the same "A-list" queen who was better than anyone else in 70 seconds, and here they again, nostalgic and still throwing attitude. The film has tried to include at least things such as race, body image, and "clone", race, adultism, growing gay "race system", and the ability to increase a decent torch (based on the community's sub-community discrimination (which is 70 It was very important!). Well, we do not have such a presentation, and the memorabilia of the interviewers is no different than my own memories. If you were there in that decade, you would enjoy pictures of verandahs and great home-movies that we were afraid of. If you are not there, this picture will undoubtedly feel dull. It should have been a lot more, but sadly, it's not. Two big for jogging my memory ... I still miss to go to Anvil!
