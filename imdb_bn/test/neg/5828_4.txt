All in all, this is a movie for kids. We saw it tonight and my child liked it. At one stage my children's tension was so impossible that sitting was impossible. Anyway, I'm a great fan of AA. Milne books are very subtle and hide behind an intellectual intelligence behind the child's quality of its leading characters. This image was not fine. It is a shame that many more stories on Disney Pages do not see the advantage of making movies, although it probably does not have permission to use it. I would like to greet myself in the theater, instead of "Winnie-the-Poo and Teger too". Character voices were very good. I was just bored by the corpse. However, the song was twice higher than the dialogue, and the picture was incompatible. <br /> <br /> For the story, it was a short preacher and dictator in the voice. Overall, I was frustrated, but I again went to see the same tension in my child's face. <br /> <br /> I like lumpy smiles ....
