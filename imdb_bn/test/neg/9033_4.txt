So Seagal plays a DAE named John Dachar, who lost his associate on a drug investigation, surprised, Colombia! Braggie or nothing, but my father was born in Columbia and was born (hence my last name), and now he is a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies will believe, there is something other than a medicinal dealer. Cocaine that comes out of Colombia! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Before or after that, he watched him go before any movie. It was actually quite interesting. Segal often comes in an almost impossible way that he is not more involved with women like a plot device and sometimes tries to tempt, with a stripper or boyfriend, there is little to no interest. Him He always got all-bad guys <br /> <br /> He confessed in confession booths to lie, sell drugs, prove false evidence, and even get the information needed to keep the bad guys behind bars (even I hope) to sleep with informational people. Do not get hurt with Allah by saying this ??) The priest tells him to go to his family, so he is not saying that he is retiring from time to time. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is a thin-character feature of an exercise-seagull movie on paper. Marx for Death is against a band of Sigal's mysterious Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no idea about imposing their products on a broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hocker visits his old high school coach, Max (Keith David's short concert), and in the middle of this is the horrible divorced cacad, where some book seekers Blanchers are sitting in the trap of high school girls. <br /> <br /> I may have had harbor experiences in high school, but I do not know the cricketers and crackheads going to school in the middle. At any rate, hatcher these boys do not know how bad they have long ago. They are not only victims of high school children's cracks, but coach football players regularly lose their medicines, they are associated with Max's Stevens with stair-downs, and since it is not enough, their 13-year-old nephew dies and their crackhouse. <br /> <br /> Ah, okay. We get pictures. I'm sure they torture dogs and beat old women, and steal candy from babies, just for accurate measurements. Is it really hard, those bad boys? 13-year-old nephew died in their crackhouse. Wow <br /> <br /> Anyway. The film does not tell how the movie does not encourage only movie calling, where movies are badly organized with them, but they do not even know how they should work. <br /> <br /> The drug dealer is known as the screwfish, and I think you have to say something about this kind of movie alone. The screwfish is a cartoon jamacan man with this bright, weird green eyes, which I guess is an important part of its character, because he spent most of his time with half the hole through his eyes and spent most of his time. His favorite way of being awesome is to shout with a loud shout, shouting with his Jamaican accent, shouting, 'It's an inch away from what he wants.' This man wants to face so many people that he needs to be made to his head so that his nose is not touched. I used to think how poor people will deal with their breathing. <br /> <br /> People, they do not want to forget you that these people are Jamaican, on the way. Their pronunciation is so exaggerated and very fascinating that in most cases they are impossible to understand. This is not important. It does not matter what they say, it is necessary for you to know that everything that comes out of their mouths is of any kind of drug-related issue, it is only a fascinating psychological disease that kills people by drug addiction. The film is a huge hit in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in my movie is that, especially bad guys, as I have described, the theater is spectacularly hidden, even for a seagal film. They are so cartoon and weird that it is impossible to take anything other than the creation of Goffball B-Movie, they move together to supply the sheets, through which Shigold can distribute smack-down retribution of its reminiscent brand. <br /> <br /> But there is a strange mysticism in the movie which seems absolutely strange. For example, a mysterious, I think you would call him, at one point in the screwfish (if I remember correctly) a slight curse (if I remember correctly), then bakardi mask is pushing a live dog that is warming up before heading and Screwfish is a picture by pressing his blood. Hmm Fun Sadly, this same woman has warned Hutchi that her family has been "marked for death" by these people, which means they have some ODO hex. Do not embarrass anyone, but if I was told that my family was cursed by such people, I would only laugh at it. The hacker does not hit me, like a lot of people taking a lot of stock in the fog! <br /> <br /> But set up, you can see, excellent quality for a Seagal film. Unique villains, I could guess, although you might say it's not very impressive. Sigal's first carrier strange pictures ??
