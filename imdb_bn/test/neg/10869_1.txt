When a movie called Hell Ride arrives, you expect a bike check in a certain amount. With character names like "Pistolor", "Commons" and "The Gent", I made myself worse and ran face-to-face. Dialogues, soundtracks and shooting styles are ideal for biker movies. When playing the "CC Ryder" and talking about sex and violence, when the roads are breaking down the roads, the dust in the dusty desert blurred. to yawn! The three lead was just ridiculous and incredible. Old men like Busch and Madsen (in a scary blurred shirt) while driving around the desert road dust, reminds me that two men are trying to survive their youth. The poor Eric Belfor tried his best but lost it with such poor material. Dennis Hopper's appearance could not save the entire Easy Rider swing. And let's talk about the tan bought shop? Many people compare to the work of tarantino. It is not even close. The work of tenantino makes it so bright that he knows that it is at the top so that he can just play the ball and take it as far as possible. Bishop took this image so seriously that it is nothing but a poor copy of the exploitation section.
