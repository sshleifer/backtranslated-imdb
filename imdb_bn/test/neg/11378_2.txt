In a harmful key, Gaud√≠ Afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Grey Harden and Judy Davis took a good cast photo (Juliet Lewis's new age strange character is incredibly taken from reality, I know an American young girl who squawks like her !!) But the GA does not look much beyond its past plots. <br /> <br /> Although everything in film making is believed, there were some notable screenplay disagreements. Two samples: You pay 14 euros to enter Chapel where Casandra and Frankie meet, at 7am, and you can not leave a roof without paying the bill (if they do not recognize you, they will charge you on the spot) Close a taxi That's fast (although they do not expect Americans to always cabbies tips, but sequences illustrated in the movie were ridiculous). Do not believe me, reader: wait for yourself and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not live here, you will have a concern about these things. No, but good movies should be ignored about your origin. Nobody here knows about GA, and I'm sure that will not change in the future.
