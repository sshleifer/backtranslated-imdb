Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from the outbreak of a deadly virus. This movie has hit me as stupid kindness, which has become a classic (best type) of an unknown camp. Memorable lines include "Knowledge is like deer. Chase it and it will flee from you" and "Drink it." It will make you better. " It's so bad - if they tried, they could not do anything worse than that. <br /> <br /> Segal tries to convince you that he is 1. Sensitive - saves a deadly Tony; 2. A good father - by the view of a saccharine cooking for his daughter; 3. A man of science - by looking at a fake spectrum; 4. With tone of nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. Politically correct and multiculturalism - by having Indian friends; 6. An Iconoclast - A National Research Laboratory started a rural practice after a former life; And 7. The hero of an action - really being fat but can still fight. ROTFL <br /> <br /> Good night is a good night to see people on Flickr, especially (but not necessarily!) addicted to friends.
