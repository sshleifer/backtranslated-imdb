I saw this on the wire because I had a big lily fan. Big mistake What a horrible film You do not care about one bit for any character in the movie. Chris Klein plays a man who has jumped completely into the film and stole Josh Hartnet's longtime girlfriend. If the authors know what they are doing, this film will follow the proven formula and create Heartnets as a donkey and a girlfriend sticking to Lilike in a bad relationship, which he has saved by Klein. But Hartnet is a really cool guy, who looks a lot of passion and love for the lace. <br /> <br /> You hate Lacey, because she cheats Hartnett with Clean, who is blurred and really stuck for everyone who is trying to help her in the city. <br /> <br /> It's really a campie, and characters do everything but surround kitchen dancing and lip syncing and using hair brush and kissing and mesh microphones (although they come very close). <br /> <br /> What horrible horror movies. You do not even care about the characters because you do not care what happens to the end.
