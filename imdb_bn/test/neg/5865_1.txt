Why we are sitting in this movie, why this scene of this movie has to do with this plot? We hope that everything will be clearer until the end. It was not. <br /> <br /> I think the director has firmly dropped the script in the air, and after that some small (and retractable) underlining is not randomly related to the scene re-collected (perhaps with scissors and glue stick). <br /> <br /> Movie idols include: Communistism is bad? Nahilism is bad? Poor parenting is bad? Bad? TV is bad? Suitable scripting is bad? Deconstructionism is good? It's not really clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, there will be no German water taxi, a staircase stairs that allow the passenger to enter the water. Throughout the "achtung" signs, this is the true credentials.
