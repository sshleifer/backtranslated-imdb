Many times the "words and sounds are not meant to be full of words" description is used and the goal is correct. Unfortunately "code 46" lacks both the word and the anger. A bit of anger has been widely appreciated. Tim Robins' character (William) is so emotional that the idea of ​​being in love with his mother (feudal morton) seems almost helpless. These people are so emotionless that someone might start thinking that possibly the future of this water supply has been dosed with Thoragin. A "brave new world" is an atmosphere that is surrounded by atmospheric atmospheres that are exposed to around 2-3 stops over each scene. Unfortunately this technique gets tighter on the eyes and rather difficult. Cutesy mishmash of languages ​​is also tired when there is no objectionable reason for its existence. Many futuristic, cc movies are criticized for all flash and any substance. This photo has no flash or substance. This is a code 6 all the way.
