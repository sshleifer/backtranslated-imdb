This picture was given to my uncle, who got it free with the DVD Magazine. See why it was so eager to get rid of it easily. Now I understand that this is a B-movie and it is not a budget budget like a big movie, but surely they could spend their money better than making this garbage. There are some fairly good performances, such as Jack, Beth and Huq, but others are ridiculously bad (for example Assassin Dorod). This photo has the worst battle scene I've ever seen. It seems more like a pornographic movie than a science-fiction movie with the amount of nudity in the film. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Great movie
