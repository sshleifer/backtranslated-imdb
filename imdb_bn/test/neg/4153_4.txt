"The beautiful country" is a big disappointment. It does not come up to my expectations. Bihar, tall muscle man, an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that in Vietnam in Vietnam in the early 90's it was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam, so he went to America to seek his American father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe, but this is showing in the picture. I find myself having a tough time connecting myself with emotion, because the film is completely full and I simply do not understand or believe it. Total failure to write this photo The plot is full of holes. It works hard to wake the audience's emotions and keep some events in some of the events necessary. We do that stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the picture is trying to do. So, you do not feel the feeling of traveling in Bihar's boat (yes, he was in a boat!) Is difficult enough, storms are created at night and let the ship down a bit. Still not touching? Fine! Hungry hungry, hungry, sickness, drink a little to tolerate adult violence in the boat, hopefully touch the viewer's tactics. Still not touching? You're disappointed SOB, let's ... All right, I do not want to give a spoiler to the film, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The film is really long and slow. He never used to say that why Bihar could not find his mother and father until he went in search of his mother and father. Did he go to Saigon in search of his mother a few years ago? And guess what? He has fate and everyone will tell him where he is looking for, and he can find someone without a scratch. I really think the Homeland Security Department would help him in Bihar who would have to hire him in Vietnam. Beautiful country Which one? Both the Vietnam and America are hellfire
