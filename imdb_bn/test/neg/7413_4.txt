A rich scientist's daughter goes down in a flat thick desert carrying her. He goes and joins a group to find another and find him, but the rescue team is soon suspecting that something is stalking them. Then the harmful purpose has been revealed for the operation and it only adds to existing tensions. <br /> <br /> This film was a modest idea and very soon it was playing in the film with popular Saskatche legend. However, the direction of film breaks the basic rules of the Horror / Thriller and it is being shown soon. Of course, the audience knows that some characters are running, just read the title! But it should be shown how the movie should have been occupied, which would soon destroy suspense and make so much fun as a direct result. This film also lacks a good atmosphere and almost does not have a landscape shot that shows the expanse of the desert, but a lot of monster point-view shots that do not add up. They were really ashamed of the 'Prideator'. The low budget horror film 'Windiego' tried to make the film even better. <br /> <br /> Some excitement of excitement and a lazy finish will lead to this growth on this cuff pill, but it is still poor and premier and possible, very frustrating. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Some R ratios for violence and superstition, but it is much better than most R rated horrors.
