Like the previous commentator of this movie, I also found myself in tears sometimes during this movie. Sometimes one wonders how this awesome inspiration comes from the horror of the existence of a film. From the very first moment when our hero woke up from the dream of the train with all the traveling horses (which was not of Irish immigrants) in the New York apartment, then we are obviously in trouble. And it's not much better. <br /> <br /> Come back to Ireland in the 1950s, we enter a world where everyone will talk without condemnation, and especially about the Irish Civil War. School students go to school to learn about civil war. Pabor drinkers split themselves on the basis of their civil war loyalty. Those who died in civil war are remembered for them. Those who think that the city is divided between them, we should remember and those who want to forget ... civil war. Every glance and conversation has fallen into meaning which comes back to the civil war. <br /> <br /> The blogger of Broken Harvest VideoCover recommends that this is an example of modern Ireland's problems. The only parallel that strikes me is that the conversation in Dublin is really influenced by a matter: house prices If Ireland wishes to offer some insight into Ireland's obsession with the past, it unfortunately fails. The Irish civil war and its succession have hit several Irish films, which are striking. But it will take a movie with a lesser and more intelligent than a bigger thing rather than telling us about the lasting impact of more horrific events than the nation. <br /> <br /> This film has been released in Ireland's atmosphere in the 1950s, which advised the American audience: This is not. In the 1950's, Ireland was a horrific, poverty-stricken sexual violence and teenage youth who escaped their droves. But the conversation had more than one thing.
