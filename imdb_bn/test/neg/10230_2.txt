I liked the first movie, the second one was just right, disappointed John Cleese was no longer bred as my favorite character, Jean bob. But the third one ... what happened the animation ??? It shows low budget like a bad morning cartoon! Without the flashback taken from the first movie. They should be really closed after the number 2, this just makes the appearance of the rest worse !! Derek's voice has changed but not recognized as gene bob ... the diseases are also very weird. I do not understand where Rothbert came from. I thought he was dead! This movie wants me to stop it, as much as I love the first, I was very disappointed with this health. They never came!
