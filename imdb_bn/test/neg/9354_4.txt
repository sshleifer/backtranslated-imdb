Helen of Troy follows Helen's story and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is Helen and the love story in Paris, who is in the ship with Helen and falls in love, she did not know the queen. The film will be more like a couple lovers and illustrations to be together. (Other movies and books have different illustrations of the letters, but they are frustrated only in love.) This image is moving slowly in some places, but the battle and details of the scenery are well done. There are some good performances. I thought that the slave girl was especially good, and she was one of the best favorite characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good adaptation, if you can look outside of the story slowly moving and look beyond some of the cheesy romances and dialogue. In my opinion, the film version of a perfect Iliad has not yet been made, but it is a recreational and some good bits.
