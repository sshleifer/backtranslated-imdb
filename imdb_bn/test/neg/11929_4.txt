Before the screen is released in a big way, it is a bit inappropriate after screening a screen for the screen. Sucking many movies does not surprise you, but when the studio itself accepts over time, the process of filming becomes a kind of emotional game. Consider the gift of the first Christmas in Hollywood, then, "Eon Flux" is not penalized at the top, expected taste and tranquility. Although eventually overwhelmed by its flaws, there are at least (sort of) an idea which is near the toy. Very bad manager Karin Kusma thinks how it can execute everyone. <br /> <br /> This is the future. Has a plague. There are dictatorships, and there are rebels. The latter are known as Monici, and far from a civilization of bits or tennis rocket worshipers, they try to overthrow the former known as the Goodchild regime. Governance Sometimes the meaning of citizenship, which is more than Ion Flex (Charlie's Theron) and its companions can stand. Through some types of biochemical virtual reality technology, Monicus receives orders from their beloved leader (Frances McDormand), who seems to be cross-line with a cow, a mysterious priest. It falls into the up-ups to get some form-fitting, future spandex to carry high-cow orders, which must "destroy the regime". A few years ago he saw his sister searching for Goodchild's, he needed a little firm conviction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good chills do not seem to think about them, and Ayane himself may have an unexpected history with them. Occasionally in the mobile phone, the central imagination of the film (which I will not reveal more) has some clear idea about the existence and survival of humans. There are rooms for many more tests that do not take advantage of the film, but there are at least some of the concepts. Major problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has made annoying decisions about closing the picture of almost all activities which we can rarely run. To make matters even worse, it has been edited in our storm completely jumped jumps. This results in some serious sensitive illusions. The aesthetic of "Ion Flux" is a sleek costume, one of the weird-finger architecture and flexible character. Most of the tasks are at the very least, open spaces which request for some continuous long shots which may express compassion and sportsmanship as described above. Instead, we got along with the split seconds of flying organs, broken glass, and sound effects. <br /> <br /> "Aeon Flux." There is a great movie to try to get out of the atrocity. Put this thing in the hands of Wachowski brothers, tell, and the results can be quite different. Although, I think, "Ioan Flux" is pushing me out of a movie that I want to enjoy. This film is unattuned to its own power. Similar to a young poker player, the royal flush is confronted, it finds ways to lose despite its chances.
