Just saw this movie open at night. I have read some other user comments which are convincing to see me ... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so disgusted that I think of writing this comment to give some money to some of your people. <br /> <br /> "The messengers" for the first time are very expected and not just a thriller. It can be terrible for anyone under 13, but it does not really do anything for me. Climax was ridiculous and most of the viewers went before the film's resolution. In addition to <br /> <br />, the acting was a little transparent. Some emotional arguments in the family were less credible than the sub-purse suspense scene. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the preview of this movie you have seen the best parts and the strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth watching at the theater.
