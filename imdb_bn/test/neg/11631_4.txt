O god! After such a promising start, Critters 2 revolve around what the employee goes around. Obviously, there were just a few things to think about when creating this film and what was the point of ear with Scott Grimus! These were the last raid in Critters Saga, but there was more rubbish in her way. That's why I did not see Critowers 3, and why is there an episode of every bad movie series? (Critters, Friday 13, Space in Leprechaun, Hellraiser, etc.)
