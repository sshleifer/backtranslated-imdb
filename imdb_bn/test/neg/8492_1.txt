My wife received a ticket from our employer for free to attend this movie premiere. I am sorry for the cost of the popcorn and just two hours of my life in this garbage movie. <br /> <br /> I own and enjoy the original mask DVD. I originally expected a remix near the price of the production or the origin of the writing. But this was not ready for this porn stack of trash. Poor acting, poor plot, a bad CGI baby gas lift and hyper "mask mode" urine .. a woman turns a giant nose, spewing drying .. Hah? My eight year old boy likes movies like Lord of the Ring, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this, I asked him what he thought. Its exact words; "I hated it, it's like Scooby Doo, they do something good and keep the whole thing in it." My twelve year old girl and wife hate it as well. Then my wife told me that if we leave, my son will ask him twice. He never did that before. I'm proud of him. If you think I heard from theater, cry and lack of humor, I think most of the patrons agree with me. <br /> <br /> This image represents something bad about children. Today, and no positive reviews will definitely be financially related to the people connected to the film.
