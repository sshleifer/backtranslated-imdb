I mean, nothing happens, 5 fools marijuana goes to Oklahoma to find a witch forest ... it may be fun if it does not have 5 bad actors in the world. And the dialogue was not even half-inch fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth was, when the stupid police stopped thirteen kids in Oklahoma or Kansas ... the plot could have been fun, was it not for an unreasonable explanation? If you think about watching this piece-off-the-burf movie, do not do it. How foolish it is that the police go away from him as he considers him gay, such as his friend (not just that he said ...) and that fool's word is "gay". I laugh at my hair. ...... no ....... anyway ... the whole movie I've ever seen !!
