I was very concerned about this movie, it was planned to be a Jewish film festival, and using clever humor and mockery, Israel was considered very hostile. <br /> <br /> I was not a diatribe that got released from the movie, but as a work of the film it was deeply frustrating. The film was full of random events, which is nothing connected to the end, most of which do not. Some incidents were very clever and funny, but some were simply free and vain. <br /> <br /> In the two lovers, they play visible scenes, foolishly, and some handheld games. Perhaps it is loving in some cultures, but it is like watching thumb-wrestling. For the third time, it really got tired. <br /> <br /> I have always used the strange stories and pictures to think that David Lynch is strange odd, so that the audience thinks he is so sophisticated that he does not understand his work; Actually, there is nothing to realize. Here too, stories are not joined in any way and political views can not be made (on one side a brilliant Israeli soldier blames Palestinian driver on checkpoint.) What is this news? <br /> <I do not understand why this image has been controversial, because it Why Attention Attracted This is an inferior work and it was wasted time.
