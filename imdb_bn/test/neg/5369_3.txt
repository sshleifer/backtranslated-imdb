"Unusual state" is an interesting show for the most unusual believer. I enjoy watching what "team" has to say and what they want to find, but I know that the complete show with its build up and story lines is fully set up. They go to the real spectrum and I suspect they speak with the actual witnesses. I have generally seen it that I am not seeing non-fiction, but actual movies that are contradicting reality. No one will consult or recommend to anyone personally watching this show until you personally find a basic scare. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. "Ghost Hunter"
