Deepa has again tried to find out a matter that nobody wants to talk. The story lines are okay, cinematography is outstanding, the way down the screenplay and the average of acting. I think the people of Uttar Pradesh in India lost their original collection in 2000. As a result of this, I am in a completely different cast, I am surprised that it was Shabana Ajmi, Nandita Das and Amir Khan. Current Actor Lisa Ray (who is better suited for moving to the Bombay Dying Bedsheets) and John Abraham are sincere, acting basic lessons needed. Seema Biswas, Raghbir Yadav and Kullubbaan Kharbadada preserved the movie as much as possible. The child did an outstanding job. Film editing and the flow is nothing to expect from Deepa. Great matter, a strong message about a practice that still exists in rural India, but Dipa, a human rights organization, has set itself on fire and on earth. Watch it once ... When it is on DVD, do not hesitate to pay 10 dollars to watch it .... It hits the average Hindi film any day.
