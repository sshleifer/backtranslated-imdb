My husband brought this home from the video store, so I could see something while I was sick. Like illness, where you can not concentrate in any book, but a fool, light, romantic flick seems right (a bowl of chicken soup and a bowl). Well, he meant better. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as the others post here) that the house should be fake ... it is not only isolated on the beach, loose sand, and go straight to the surf wave home that is very close to the ocean! It is obviously apparently dangerous (in the country of decline, in fruit), so it is likely that filmmakers have used the whole thing for CGI (or movie magic to tear a beautiful B & B into the surf). <br /> But I'm telling you, thank you for "Teh Interview", I can say that the house "serendipity" is very real, in fact, in the film, and in some cases except dressing and discharge of some windows, it is seen in the film. You can stop this season for $ 1710 (or about $ 3850 in the summer)! Go for it! But ... interestingly, there are serious problems at home. What about river hydropower / electricity in the "Surfend"? "," Serenity "was condemned for a break in the sanitation, which caused a second blow due to disappearance of the ocean (they were rebuilt.) <br /> <br /> and the house is not from" civil war. "Villa Davis Not to mention that "Clive black best friend" (the extraordinary role of the performer actress, last seen as "suspicious") is not enough in a remote age that his grandmother's civil war Well, that's 150 years ago! Try great! (Actually, "Cerdipti" was created in 1988, ridiculously recently.) <br /> <br /> A typical Nicholas Sparks of the original movie is designed on shoulders, Which means many capsular and hypothetical hypotheses. It is very annoying to "women" - you know, our women who love B & B, fusty antiques and knick-knacks ... those who dream of romance and who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Our plot is not development, thinking is not a development; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, of course, he died in excess of Anthhetiaia, So you are now wondering why the surgeon is guilty and not anaesthesiologist! Hello! Where is that man? Why are wrong doctors feeling guilty? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diane Lane! She is a lonely divorc√©e, with nasty kids, and a former husband who wants her back. Although he is trying to make a decision on this, Beach and Bea has his sabbing as a wonderful black friend. Now, in the real world, if this setup is also done, then the doctor can see Ernest Burginine ... and solitary divorce, such as Rossi O'Donnell. She spent 22 years of her vacation on beach beach, while she sulked and thought about moving a diet. But this is not real world; <br /> <br /> Every couple admits, love falls, hurricane hits ... they love, fall in love, they have to go away, she dies and she cries a lot about her. The end <br /> <br /> I saved you from here; Now do not torture yourself or any male contact (husband, son, boy friend) through this tripe. <br /> <br /> Anyone else asked why, Diane Lane, a perfect little woman (which filmmakers love to cast, because she is beautiful and thin that most women want to look like her, but she is not 45ish and higher , So he is not threatening) is continually covered in large tarp-like shawls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So we will not see it. Conclusion: Until you get too sick, read a book. If you are very sick, go to sleep.
