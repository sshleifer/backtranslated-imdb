First of all. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to work again? Call that a bad performance will be an insult to bad performance. That was a historically awesome performance. Any small chance that the diage can be a serious actress is now fully completed later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two movies were very annoying, and there was no great idea. I can sit around and think of human nature without seeing a terrible actor, can play a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there was not a liking character, even worse, it seemed that the design was done. You were not supposed to like, or felt sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted to die from them all honest. Aliens include. Include children. Everyone was just a big mound in this movie. Everyone literally just moped around, and they called it a movie. You could just make a zombie "employee", only with regular people, because they were all like Jumpy. <br /> <br /> To the end, nothing really does not understand. From the letter's response and emotion to the literal story line, it seems that all is just random. It has just been added as a bad movie, an incognito, and a "movie about thoughtful movies" which can be confusing. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
