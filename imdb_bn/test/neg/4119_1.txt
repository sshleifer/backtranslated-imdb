I can not remember the movie is so annoying that I went out. Both Weatherman and Island were so bad that I thought about it, but I even lived to the end. This movie was not strange, it was not funny and started moving. Like some other commentators, I was surprised that the parts were not only French which I did not get or letters were serious. Finally I gave up and tried to addiction because I did not want to annoy my husband while enjoying it, but he noticed and wanted to let me know that if I wanted to leave the door then all right. He wants to know how it has ended ... if Dengo survives or dies, etc ... (I do not care too much).
