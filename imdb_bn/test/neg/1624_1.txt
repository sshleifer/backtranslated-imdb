I have read an extra review on the first page of this movie on this site and fully explained that this movie is simply the television show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" Viewable at. And yes, I find that advice really helpful! I mean, a movie which is good and this tries to be exciting, really the movie wants to be what !!!!! So yes, watch this movie showcased in this movie and instead of giving this solo star a single star from ten stars, you can give it ten out of ten! After that, my one-star review is for the original, pure, unread version of this movie only !!!!!! Now you understand?
