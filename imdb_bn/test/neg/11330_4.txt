A criminal is alive, and Jack takes everyone to the revenge for the film Django - all the distributors named it "Django Kill ...", which can store some more seeds from the more meaningless people.) Here's a little bit below the Western West Enjoyable that is very enjoyable to be enjoyable. And thus I can not really recommend all of this, but most of the hardcore spaces are Western fans. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> Blue Underground DVD Extra: Beau's Spaghetti Western Collection Part. Unct; "Zenzo Tale" (20 minute documentary); Poster and Stills Gallery; Prima Bias for Gilo Questi and Thomas Million; Theater Trailer <br /> <br /> 3 Easter Egg: Highlight the hidden gun on extra pages for trailers of "Jinzo", "Run, Man, Run", and "A Man Style Blade"; Highlight the hand in the main menu for the interview. How the rock hidden in a rock group structure and language / subtitles menu brings the story of how to kill Thomas Million as a communist.
