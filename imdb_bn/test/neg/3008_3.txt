I do not hate movies anymore than ugly, and it is one of the most proven movies ever made. It seems that self-consciousness is clear within each frame: "See what we are making deep, sophisticated movies," directors and screenwriters tell us, and say to ourselves, "Let's see how we can get distracted and confused, even more so." Wood or Edgar G. Want to see Umar's worst movie. At least they were giving us honest trash, and at least their movies were their own nasty entertaining. This film is often as recreational as a route canal without anesthesia, and thus becomes victim of torture. <br /> <br /> Have these screenlists ever heard the word 'story'? It does not appear so. Their idea is, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they have been able to gather a nice cast and have been able to abandon good performance from them. And for what? Our burqa for one hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this film. The only thrilling part, and it lasts for about two minutes, when very soon the exiled homeowners start shooting for the employee who tells them to leave. But nothing comes up. Too bad he did not hit the screenlit until shooting. The only release features of this movie are played and some beautiful photography is finally visible. 3/10
