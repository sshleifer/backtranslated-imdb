Usually when I do not see a show on a main drive, I find it on the wire later and it feels like a gem. "Gimaro Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad that I missed it. <br /> <br /> I hate the real show that the actor's space is full of horror, stupid, annoying banners every minute. This is just an hour. Mother, Lorelie, hesitated me and stopped her lithium. He does not stop talking; Every minute, every second, talking to the person he has talked with. Bad, his pillow pillow and soooo, like, Valley Girl. He talked about the boys, his hair, his mother, his clothes. Like, sitch what ?? (For the situation). I saw this show thrice and still do not get the point of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's no point in seeing three generations of women in a family as "girls" of planetary wars. By comparison male displays smart and somewhat watchable shows. If Lorelai never tried to meet me in conversation, then I would like to bend him for getting rid of him. He definitely does not know how to stop talking and take a fine indication for someone else to listen. He does not even know how he will look at others' existence. <br /> <br /> <br /> Within a day, Lorelie returns home on an hour at 10pm. He got the date after following a guy seen in an auction. She entered the room of the girl, where she asked, how did she go. He dithers about how boring people are. He got some words in the same way in his date. Lorelei complains how people do not stop talking (complaints). I hope he knows how fortunate the date is. <br /> <br /> Another person commented on how a child works like a teen and she is an adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her baby. This is probably the 40-something mother's dress and it looks like she hurt her friends with her high school. <br /> <br /> I think this show should follow "Just hit me," because that's exactly how I felt.
