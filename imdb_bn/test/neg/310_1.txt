The film did not make any sense to me. Good actor (SergioCastelitopterkeller's favorite; He was great in "Umo Delelstelle" / "The Stormmaster" but it was created by a great Italian director Zeuspe Tornore, who made this effort to oppose the medieval man), but awful, inappropriate scripts, terrible edits And a director who said that he is trying to say what he is trying to say Ona idea, and ended up not saying anything. Loads of overwhelming greed, but some of the pictures that some Italianos-intellectuals, who were unfortunate, were frustrated and known in the distant past, they unfortunately liked it, and unfortunately there was no monopoly in Italy, they could be found everywhere and perhaps a great These are acclaimed as masterpieces. I have thought a lot of Bellochio as a director ever. It was first shown 50 years ago when I think of the first picture in Rome "Pagniniala Tasca" / "Fish in the Pocket" (or this type of title) (I was comforting that time). All the usual disguise raved about it, but it left me quite cold. I do not think he was so much a director and he did not do that yet. The age certainly did not improve him, and this image must rank as the worst of him.
