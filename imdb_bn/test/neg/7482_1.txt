Carson Dally hosts the only late night talk show, which is not a comedian. What was the thought of NBC! She is not funny Writing is awesome! All skelet watches are painful. The current new karao is not funny, especially since he tells you that he is going to sing! Escalator interviews are not just funny, it's just fools and inappropriate He has always kept the jokes, especially the boredom time, at least tricky, cruel, funny jokes! I mean, at any time, he joked Jessica Simpson and said, "She is stupid, because it's a fool, which annoys the fun of any fun, which was already very few. For any 3 year old show, you can bring any joke and sketch with this hair of excuses. Seriously, do not see this show, unless you are on the verge of suicide and want to impose what's on your side.
