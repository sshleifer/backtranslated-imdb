I am discovering that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are scattered throughout the entire alphabet of all possible beliefs, that a charity and Guruji's eligibility (as a charity, he is exceptional, he is not denying his special There was a gift, though he suffered for the increase of his arrogant arrogance Pride and the welfare of the neglected child rearing sheep) could inspire such extreme loyalty and faith. This film is based primarily on Gurujee's own fantasy and its formation and "Awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery, how much he can make his mind sad and sadly, some kind of innocent person's will). See, if you are sadly deprived of the religious leaders, then how dreadful it is that you have the courage to read, if a jungle like Gurujee can inspire such a worship and if your blood pressure medicine is in hand, be careful. Those who still hope to get out of the ruins of Christians in the hope of immediate religion, as the highest example of cinematic photography in protest of the entire service of restrictions and an effective god.
