I really like this time that I was more interested in Clive Barker's literary screenplay, because very few things seem to be worse than being able to fully understand this stunningly visible 'worthy' movie. Based on the novel "Kwibal", the story of "Nightbrid" is filled with huge and malicious animals and settings in the underground soccer underground society. A common man becomes addicted to the strange world, which is called the media, through his dreams, and his psychic believes in him that he is responsible for the continuity of the killing of families in recent months ... It is true to believe that he goes back to the media - located under a rural cemetery - Where he is reluctant to take. Shorter, however, it is okay to cure Knightbrid's people for the treatment of Halloween ... <br /> <br /> If I wanted to love this movie, I was very surprised for a long time. I have not read the story of the Barbarian Fantasy world and its purpose, and these monsters were terrible misleading and its foundation was painfully disrespectful. I realized how the final cut was dashed in hell and even Barker's show dislike moderate for overall product, but I did not get "get" it. Even if it is important to read the story, I think it should be translated at least in the film so that it is still understood for strangers in literature. If "cable" becomes firmly similar to Barker, it actually milk a dead idea. After a while, I could not feel a little bored, especially when things became somewhat ridiculous (somewhere around the prison I realized how bored I was) - like the police department, fearlessly going to fight with the media as it happens every week! Nobody thinks the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a strange thing ... strange. I like the crazy words that are in visual effects and media, especially that porcupine lady and that big lead SOB ... an epic flick when I consider the effects of huge amounts and firmly morbid decorations. David Craneberg fills his cold jeep's head with potato sack mask with his frustration, but we all wish that he has worked behind a camera to help save this hip ... <br /> <br /> <br / > So, if you have a large band for Clive Barber element and fully understand what the media is, then why are they It shows the time of opening title sequence (terrible idea!) And why these creatures are there and how some punk kids share a teleicotic link, you should probably check "Nightbreed". I'll look for a "cable" in these days and hope to gain some perspective ... or maybe I'll only forget this twee ... Until then, it's a poorly made and roughly tedious mess of a movie. See "Hellraiser" instead
