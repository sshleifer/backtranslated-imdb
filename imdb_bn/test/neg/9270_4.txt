It's a very strange movie, no name cast, and it almost does not know anything about the web. It uses a method that sees the Creeposh's preferences so that it introduces a triangle of the so-called "horror" shorts and combines them into a connecting story of people involved in a closed bus. There is a narrator who stresses the relationship, but his conversation does not add anything to the mix, and simply adds confusion. My own stories are good, well ... I swear that why I got 18 pieces of UK certification, I have no idea that it will match Elm's road and exorcist with nightmares. Nothing is distractingly disturbed here .. There is no word for any pregnancy, sex, nudity or even stuff, this is the thing that you can publish on TV and no one will bat in a pavilion. I can only think that if it is truly qualified (PG) a serious horror fan will be shown dead with it, but the distributor has confiscated the BBFC until it is delivered. However, there are three stories in the summary: 1. A person pushing his fianc√© in a dangerous way with his telnetatic car. 2. A man living in an apartment in an incognito is understood to have been born from his six-month old Tuna Kasserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through computer dating service .. That's until she starts working strange and there you have it. Many of them are quite funny due to their miracle premises (my favorite number 2), but you've got their feeling that they are frustrated and b) ethics dramas, unfortunately they are both angry and frustrated. Then the sum, this flick is a vague curiosity .. very good reason.
