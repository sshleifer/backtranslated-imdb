I think I've finally made the worst movie ever, and it hurts me to say that. As a big fan of indie film, gay or otherwise, I had high hopes. A few minutes in the film, however, Sheriff appeared and this or any other century's worst actor had my vote. Her performance, and the dialogue that she forced to perform, is unusual for me to break into her track of DVD. After a few hours when I became quite brave enough to hit the playing button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Sheriff and his cartoon-racist deputies, the film has a fascinating cast for which I genuinely feel sympathy because they were such a sad script. The idea behind the movie is fine - criticizing the gay men of "New South", keeping the old South Black people likewise leaving "strange fruits" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With a successful author and director, we may have had a movie. Instead, we got a cliche with fake intelligence, background on homosexuality, and a good white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I doubt that racism is still progressing. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver behind Lewisana who forced black kids to go behind the bus. But this city is a cartoon and it is difficult to believe what you have seen or heard. <br /> <br /> There are some concerts trying to make the main character more 3D in a weak attempt, but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe that the authors / Managers must pass an exam and they will get the license before creating a film. Although I would like to see several cast members in the film, but I am pressed to see something else from this director.
