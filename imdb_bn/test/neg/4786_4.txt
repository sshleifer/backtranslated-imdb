It seems that people are attracted to the show which shows sad life, which has no purpose. Give me NBC my sincere efforts to make a new change to television, track free tracks. They always remember big successes like office, think. When I first started showing up, I thought it could be a destructive hit. But after a few episodes, I felt like going to church and feeling like giving grants to the angry people in this low life, poor, disrespectful region in my entire bank. And in the end where they show a bed together with Earl and brother, I think this show is trying to show the bad aspects of life, like street beggars or people struggling to pay rent and it does not have any meaning like in the real world of normal people in society. When I see people at this show watching this dirty watch, I always think it is hateful. It's beautiful like the Venice Beech in California but it'll be a lot. Believe me, I'm not a rich man, middle class or clean, a little rural, but it seems to me that this event can not be exclusively solved from all the horrible, schematic people. Have one leg. I just want them to show more classes, all the filth, obscenity and trailer and just below the average life, it seems to me to be depressed. Do not do this program to me, nothing but a showcase, what will not happen. It also shows me that education is the most important thing to you, because apparently one ounce of these two is not smart. It is a schmuck-u-mentary.
