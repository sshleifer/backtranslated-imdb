Well, at least this blockbuster was the last of the series, because this film was rarely awesome. I mean, I understand how difficult it will be to get rid of the evil temple. We're starting a horrible fire, bulldozer, wild, but a mirror? How difficult can it be to get rid of a mirror?! This was the most horrific movie that kept MTV title in the picture! <br /> <br /> A group of friends who are many beautiful from the beginning, bunch of fixes. One of them is buying a scary mirror from a photographer and a homeless vague person, teach me a valuable lesson, do not buy things from homeless vague people. Of course, this group creates terrible deaths and chaos, although I can not imagine anyone in the absence. <br /> <br /> Please go to Amitivel: A new generation, I have already received some complaints about my generation, so I think it was a predetermined. So do not sound crazy. : P but believe me, this is acting horribly, good thoughts, and even not scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of Amityville Harare, they must cry every time they witness this film. <br /> <br /> 1/10
