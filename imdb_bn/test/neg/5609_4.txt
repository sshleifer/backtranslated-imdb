The romantic comedy film is certainly the "most refractory" movie for the film and the source of disappointment for visitors. This one is a perfect example and got a place in my "Top Ten Bad Films". <br /> <br /> History is far from creative and Jokes weak. I did not find any reason for the solo smile during all the movies! Character plane and actor performance and just fine. History gradually develops, it is tiring and forecasting. The ending is also predecessor and coated with sugar. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you see on rainy Saturday afternoon when you do not have anything better to see my modest view.
