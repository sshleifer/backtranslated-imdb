Written as an attempt to drag the mysteries of Charles Dickens into contemporary tales, Rydadell was written and operated by Brendan Fellie, but this effort failed due to being selected to use two periods in a timely format. Puzzle 'is unveiled. In spite of having a cast of well-known actors, DVD films try their best to stop this film directly, the last product is long, tedious, amateur chaos that can only be considered entertainment if viewers are excluded from others. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who is limited to reporting on dog racing events, when he dreams of important reporting assignments. A series of similar killings can include an old friend of Mike - Sadi (Vera de), who runs a pub on the banks of Thames, only invented an old precious unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens and has a heart. Sandwiches pass away to such an awful creature as the old tram beach (Derek Jacobby). Sadi's assassination caught Mike in the role of detective journalism and with the help of the Police Lady Kette (Julie Cox), he began to get involved in the investigation of the Dacens manuscript formulas. Disrupting this simple story flow Dickens (again Derek Jacobby) describes the personal story of extraordinary murder as the use of Flashbacks during Dickens. The parallel story of the story and cross casting of actors has worked in others, but the enthusiasm of such an initiative escaped from the author Brendan Felli. He painted a close (long end) of his story with a tired Hollywood ending. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jakob, Cox, and Day, the film drew attention to Vincea Redgrave, Jason Fleming, PH Mauritius and Mel Smith: Their contribution is brief but deliberate confusing. A radioactive bit of abandoning the viewer is surprising, since the audience could never find funding for these funds. Grady Harp
