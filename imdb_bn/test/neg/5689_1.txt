All right, please believe me that this is a terrible, terrible, scientific-film. It is so weak that most of the movies are unknowingly supernatural and waste at least 100% of the time. Terrible, but somehow deeply unfunny. With "ReCon 2020: The Caprice Genocide" I saw it as a dual feature and although "Batspace" was an incredibly high movie, which is not saying much. The plot of "Batspace" is so completely integrated that it is impossible to follow. The look is mysterious, often unrestrained, seemingly endless, and thoroughly tiring. The literal half film looks like a female lead similar scene, which looks like Brian Bosworth, walking in the desert. The film actually starts quite nicely, but then pops in the town of Nakovis and somehow deteriorate, minute minutes. Absolutely terrible and really an Absurdist Endurance Test.
