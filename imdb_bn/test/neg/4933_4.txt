The start was good; The end was okay. <br /> <br /> It is sad that this movie is full and silly exposure of characters, unrealistic conflict / war scenes, lack of intelligence outside the shuttle. It makes for a terrible middle screen. Staff for Search: Foreshadowing too much clear, quick healing, burn excessive smoke, fun seatbelt, delayed response. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4, or a 0, because at the beginning of the film there were some nice elements to develop happiness and basic character. The relation between the main, dark-haired girl and her drunk is touched briefly, and the presence of the influence of the blonde friend on that relationship is strange, but it is oddly present. Eventually the discovered business is becoming more mainstream and is being done with modesty, although it is not unexpectedly mentioned as another commentator. <br /> <br /> <br />
