Norris a Chicago Police game who stumbles on Chicago's spirits? Who wants to make Arrayeddon. He finally killed the soul, to get it, throwing a 24-inch spike hard gold, it is not very intense, it is hard enough to enter the chest, about twenty feet. Unlikely? So the rest of the movie. Most of it consists of CN and its Sidekick driving cars and nonsense. Israeli (or Arab) child can make the CN publicly visible. OK. Does not work, does not give any knowledge, and plots advance, so-called, not a bit. Also, no police is invited outside the country for interviewing other police. It's ridiculous as an premises. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately, it's not as bad as being humorous or camping. Just plain bad. But - someone can see how Norris is trying to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Rangers series.
