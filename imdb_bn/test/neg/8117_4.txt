Stephen King seems to have almost turned everything into a film or TV series; Actually, I am surprised that there was no attempt to create a small series from the grocery list. It should be faced, if they did, it could not be less attractive than chickens. Based on the many short stories of a King, this 1984 horror was seen by a couple of long car journeys while walking around the city of Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton Gatelyn in Nebraska, where all adults were hiding in the murder area. An old evil worshiper is killed by children. <br /> <br /> While director Fritz Kiercoche managed to make the atmosphere fair enough at the beginning (after Hummington's silly song and dance, but before we meet wounded wolves wolf wolf Isaac) with unlimited unknown scenes in Hamilton and Horton city Half-pins are hunted by Courtney Profits, as Marte Redhead Malaichi, truly reflects appealing, but the rest of the children do not face at least some threat; As a result, many 'terrible' moments in the film failed to work. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when we finally see the brutal power residing in the surrounding area of ​​Gatlin, this film turned into a spectacular visual effect of the horrific 80s, which had seen beautiful ropes for nearly 25 years, but today is positively ridiculous Look. <br /> <br /> Krishna's fans may be interested in seeing how the author's work is translated into the big screen, but your average horror-movie fan will be the most unimpressed.
