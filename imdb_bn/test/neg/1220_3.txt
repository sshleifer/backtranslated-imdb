Javier Rip's All Italian Generals' Trashstest and Director Joe Di Amato Trash Film Production Stakes, Jesse Franco's second place. Keep two together and you get what? Of course, a giant piece of trash. Unfortunately, it does not trash the word's good feeling, such as Deep Blid, distributes more in frustration than annoyance. For the film's achievement, it actually tries to do something on the border of a plot; But take away credits from the film - plot garbage. It shows a shark with friends taking oath and then with some Indian curse. Or at least I think that is happening. However, most of the film is padded with boring dialogues and plays, and shark itself - which can not be forgotten, only what we want to see - it only finds the role of a kayoma. Or even as shark is actually stock footage! Despite the fact that there is a trash, actually there are fun fun rip offs; But with this one, Joe Di'Amato makes it clear that he will not even get bothered to try and consequently the worst Italian shark film ever should be. Avoid these draws.
