I went alone to see this power of Albert Finney alone. She is one of my favorite actors and she rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure whether the plot is attractive or stupid: it's about a little boy who is going to be born, but after leaving his mother's labor, she refuses to come out! It sends God and the whole human into a crisis in the factory and is called Professor to try to persuade Albert Finney to change his mind and decide on the birth of a child. So Feni brings Big Apple for an adventurous so that she wants to show her all the reasons she wants to live. <br /> <br /> In spite of the ridicule of plot, I did not try to turn this into film if you were the director of your ideal Hollywood-sensitive ethics message. Directly, this film made the stock-sensitive song intolerable by a terrific soundtrack, which the Hollywood directors thought impossible to resist. <br /> <br /> He destroyed some unusual story by putting his hands away at each moment. The twists and crowns in the plot were given away in the way of the store, however unraveled stories. The director said that viewers are only a bunch of cats who can not see the obvious indications from one mile away. <br /> <br /> Even Finni seems to be somewhat weird and out of satisfaction in his performance. Little boy with space and curly lock, although he was supposed to be cute, was actually rather dull. <br /> <br /> I realized that this film has failed to deliver in the United States, which seems surprising. I think this might be a possible hit of the box office, interesting to both kids and emotional adults As far as quality goes, it's not a terrible movie, it's not very good. (10 out of 4)
