Jerry was not Bobby Westie - Bobby was a Sky Terrier. A highlights of my childhood day trip to Edinburgh was to go to Bobby's monument. Like every child of my generation, I grew up with a story of a brave and faithful little dog, and I remember that slowly and slowly my mother goes slowly and slowly - many, many other dandy kids and their mother - wonderful Disney See movies. For Heaven, a movie can be produced using such a wonderful story using the Westie. For example, making a film about the life of Robert Barnes and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, return Bobby to his caste!
