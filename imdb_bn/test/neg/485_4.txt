It's better than Crunchy's horror movies, but nothing more than your basic key-story. VideoJem Theme has been told earlier. Nothing except the strange Krebenberg atmosphere (which is not strong here), with strange sexual references and dark scores. The story does not grab your full attention. It just flows ahead of event after event with annoying motion. Ratings 4/10
