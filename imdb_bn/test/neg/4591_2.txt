I will know better I have seen Rob Loay's very basic work to expect something good from this movie, even if it is about hockey. <br /> <br /> Here again there is another tired game theme. There is potential for child's greatness, if his cocky attitude does not screw up the thing, there is clear going away. And, Bom, he comes out of it as champion of the Kindle player type. What about sports movies? Of course, other achievements of the athletes must be present. <br /> <br /> However, this film should be one of the biggest pieces. Everyone's interaction is not just stupid fools, and in a stupid-funny manner. And I can not think of any helpful qualities that can illuminate my position. Not the actor (who certainly does not play the unwary advisor of Loose), nor the story, nor the music and the skating sequence very little. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm not hungry for a movie of 80, even if they are a little harmful (i.e., north shore, karate kid), but it does not make it to trash less than 80. . For a good 80s sports cinema, check somewhere else. There's plenty of them there.
