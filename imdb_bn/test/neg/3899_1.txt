I know Jessie Franco is responsible for a variety of films, and I mainly go for his horror movies, as they are sometimes shy I think it was an intrinsic interest that caused it to me, and I was not weird enough to finish it. Maybe it's good at the end but if you are not in the lesbian sex scene (which contains lots) you can take a pass. So what can you say about such a film to a woman in a kitchen counter (when standing) in a bowl? You never think of what you use later, probably you do not want to know. If it seems interesting to you, it's your problem but you can still like this movie. I myself, no prude, I saw lots of hateful movies in my day but at least they have been doing well, and this is not so. Sometimes it is too much. Bleah
