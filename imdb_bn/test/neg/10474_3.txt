I rented this picture courtesy of Netflix, thinking I would get the 1972 edition. I'm sitting silent, seeing this new version, thinking: G, the production price was spectacular! I firmly believed the soundtrack was a little 70's word. I was more convinced that it happened to me when it was a 70-second film (about five seconds) which was a thing missing between the gene and the Finnie, in a tight hug, a loaded sensation, a passionate kiss. I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself pointed out that it was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, it was exactly what it was. When friendship of people of the same sex (usually adolescent) is "intense", it means love, consolidation, desire to express sex, all spread. These boys had to contact, but they were never allowed. Also, despite the performance of Bobby Moore's encouragement, I never felt that any emotion was real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was this sexual feeling for each other. But I said they did - at least they did the book, and in this movie, Finn was almost painful for the genes. John Knolls believed that the "intensity" that existed among them was that of grave homosexuality, a hero worship, an idol worship - which would be expressed in sexual situations under normal circumstances. Even if these guys suppress it, it should have been crystal clear, but this film does not even indicate it. Finally, an incredible moment is when Finney, who breaks his leg, is played by other boys during the game. As long as they had a bunch of hijackers, they knew that they could not possibly throw their bodies against them. Clearly, the bone-disconnected moment lost both director and producer.
