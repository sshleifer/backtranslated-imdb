At the beginning of 'LorgerHeads', we presented three pairs of apparently irrelevant characters. To make matters even more confusing, we (through the headings on screen) inform that the action is taking place between three separate timing (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a great time, but finally we can see how three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a young man at the age of 20, a gay and HIV positive, refrained from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Reverend Robert Austen. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a drifter and reached an inshore city in North Carolina, Kurse Bichi, where he meets George (sensibly played by Michael Kelly), the owner of gay gay matro, and eventually gets involved with each other. . Meanwhile, Mark's mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt), came to the time of her life, where she decided to find the boy who was released for her to be adopted at the age of 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother has decided to track as she missed her absent son (despite her homophobic minister husband misgivings). <br /> <br /> We are called 'Loggerheads' based on true facts and probably it is Achilles Hill. Director / writer Tim Kirkerman tried very hard to create a strong view of dramatic tension that is rarely found. Take Mark and George? They are both sensitive spirit who almost disagree. Grace has shown a somewhat annoying tension in front of a development agency manager, who has forbidden him to give any information about the missing boy and has refused to give a slight contradiction to his mother, who refused his pregnancy when he was a teenager. . Since the beginning of the good Rev. has been emphasized that there is no intention to reconcile with his son, then there is no surprise between Elizabeth and Robert. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The biggest lotdown in the movie is Mark and there is no interaction between his mother (and so dramatic contradictions). Before birth, there is the opportunity to be born with the dead or to be born with the soil born. <br /> <br /> The Kirkman theme is an application for tolerance and enthusiastic to express their enthusiasm for family members, before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are mostly intended for good purposes but they are not well for drama. Loggerheads move along the speed of a snoop without providing a new revelation (or suspension) about topics like AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Finally 'Loggerheads' fails due to lack of basicity.
