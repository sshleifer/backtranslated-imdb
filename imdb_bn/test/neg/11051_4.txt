By Jove, what a messy mess! Vengeance, cruel love, mechanical play-such as fighting, permanent, and completely irrational violence, some primitive "music" threatens violent victims, big "surprises" (which are actually considered "adopters" as the title of National Enquirer). Add shoddy camera movement to pose to be stylish and creative and you've already affected the crowd. The absolute unreasonable popularity of this film indicates that very low pop pop culture has not only succeeded in achieving in the last decade, but also being impressed as a dominant taste on a cruel audience. (Without the ambiguity of "Oldborn", by the deepest insight of human suffering under mental illness, I recommend an old Dutch / French film "The Vanishing.") <br /> <br /> Do not believe this movie is good to say There is nothing. Actually have (In) the famous scene where the hero (really a "hero", who is asleep with his daughter, who is asleep with his daughter and then forgot to forget instead of release?) The living octopus benefits from the most well-attended presence of a lot of actor: Octopus itself . At the festival of cancer, the poor animal was very poor after eating one and only work to achieve another perfect diploma for "Best Actor". <br /> <br /> If any of this festival is disqualified for a festival, Murray's campaign is stupid and some strange oddity, then it has become a festive and ridiculous festival festival. <br /> <br /> Sisi Transit Gloria Mundi!
