I found this movie, I have seen behind my head. I wanted to tell people repeatedly, but never remember. Now I found it. Now finally, I can tell people that my worst, most painful movie that I have ever seen in life, there is no one. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete trash, and incomprehensible for a junk dump. All print and other copies of this movie should be loaded into a big rocket and should be started in the sun. Only refinement heat and sun pressure can be able to purify the material to save the film, so that they can be useful for the universe again. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies And yes this is an opinion. But let's name this movie pure trash, dirty, and deflation of some animals that should never be seen by humans. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch the movie Cinema Murathan rather than watch the movie. And I hate the movie of Uwe Bowle.
