I can not believe it This picture was the last time of my life. Title is suitable. Love does not beat the hell from me, this film did not. I look forward to watching and watching and waiting and waiting and something to do, to keep something. Nothing happened! Nothing !! Terrence Howard could not save the work of a piece of Lam which is called a movie. It was dark, and confused and I did not kill the girlfriend who eventually. Tone and penning of the film was about building a dramatic climatic end. It was only served to confuse the viewer because the film was plazed immediately after it went anywhere. If you want authentic torture, see this picture.
