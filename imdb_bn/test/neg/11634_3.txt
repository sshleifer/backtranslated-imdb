Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend because of facing the Crowettes, Brad Brown spent time with his grandmother during Easter. Meanwhile, Crite's eggs begin to walk. As they cause problems in the town town, brown and dude, as well as those alien monster hunters who are back for the end of the foreign war they must fight bloodthirsty furballs before erasing the city. <br /> <br /> The original Critters was a minor attempt to rob family-stark "Gremlins". This became a favorite of the video Gulf culture and it was successful enough for a sequel. This signals play down horror and instead makes the whole focus comedy. Unfortunately, the comedy section is extremely painful, as well as childhood. Acting is equivalent to the rest of the picture. It's just suffocating the film from a weak script. The visual effects are fairly good. <br /> <br /> Grade: D + review by MKJS
