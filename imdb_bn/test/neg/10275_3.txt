I know my summary heard very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average joe would be a tough time sticking with this film there. Animated loggers work on dancing in their work and floating logs throughout the film. All of these are done with very splashy and artsy colors and can be great to show an art museum patrons. However, if you do not really love this type of art or you are not a Canadian who likes movies about your home country, then perhaps it's impossible to finish it. I have rather a high tolerance for such things and even I must force myself to watch myself after a few minutes. I can respect the work I went in, but it is not only compulsory.
