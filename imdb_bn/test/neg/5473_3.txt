Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing together a horror film; That always sounds like an awesome plan. The most versatile saintly actor of his generation, who has already played horrible series of novels such as "The Flesh and the Endeavors" and "The Bind of the Cobra", is associated with the storm of the devil's theme-themed exploitation of the 70's. How could this probably go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can do. For my deepest sorrow, the "Land of Mintoor" can very rarely be called medium, and in spite of the shield, external setting, attractive headline and potentially magnificent glossary. A remote area in Greece, especially near an archaeological site, many tourists disappeared because Baron Peter Cushing and his perpetual followers fed their fire-breathing feed to the Minotro statue. The ugly, who had never played before, did not look indifferent and unwanted, it was a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek. This means that you also own supplementary archaeological ruins and underground networks of caves. The fact that your hobby is random campus and amateur archaeological abduction is certainly quite easy. When his three young friends disappeared mysteriously in the same area, then Father Roach - pastor of several cities - decided to investigate. The "Land of Mintoor" is a boring and extremely slow endeavor that does not take any major effort to create a devil's atmosphere, and is not disturbed by the details of all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan triangle details. For example, the famous Minotaura is a fascinating creature of Greek mythology with a calf's head and a person's body, but for some unreasonable reasons the script does not emphasize significance. Instead, the film converts into tired and over-the-counter conversations, and the higher inappropriate music with experimental words. The only reason to consider this big disappointment of the picture is due to Donald Plusance. Critical criticism of the modern young man, and his screenplay is always strong and reliable.
