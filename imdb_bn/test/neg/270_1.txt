I did not expect much when I went out to visit this, but my God disappointed me. The original was funny in its genre, but it was so bad when I left the theater. There is no plot, it's not funny, it's not enjoyable to watch, it's just embarrassing. After an hour, I hope my patience will be rewarded but now I am not going to leave the theater. Please make yourself a favor and ignore it, see it when it comes to a small screen. Or watch it budget DVD, whatever you do not waste any money on it. I do not say I warn you.
