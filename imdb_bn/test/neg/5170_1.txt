COCOADA TRIAL Australia's brave defense against the brutal brutal Japanese army in the military history of Australia illustrates a truly wonderful event. There is no doubt that the film failed to consider the story of "Fiji Wizards" or New Guinea Natives. That Australian used to help run their military operations. The film failed to give a reliable account of Australian soldiers and its behavior. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is arbitrary cinematography, bad scripting and dialogue, no character development and clich√© film making the worst time with jungle battlefield scenery . <br /> <br /> The Japanese army failed to influence the audiences in a meaningful way other than brutally. And the brutal killer of a poorly dressed and poorly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle The film failed because most Australian movies have actually moved to Drove to attract important Australian audiences. <<br /> <br /> I'm not going to join normal parochial rubbish for Australian film's sake. I do not say a great job or just how anyone knows how to leave it. This official funding film is another failure by the richest and richest children of Australia. <br /> <br /> I give it zero because it's really an insult to the descendants of these great Australians and their huge sacrifices. What a shameful humiliation and disrespect, and I know this review will stir up more negative feelings from the movie show crew and most critics but I have the right to my opinion and Australia has fought for our independence and has an opinion on lecture and public opinion.
