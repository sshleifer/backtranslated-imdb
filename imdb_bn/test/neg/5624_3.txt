I have seen this picture 3 times. In most cases I was thinking about seeing it, "Did I miss something here?". Are there any reasons this picture has been created? Was it trying to say something and I just missed it? After looking at 3, I failed to answer. <br /> <br /> I think what I can say about a movie is the worst thing that bothers me, and I did not finish it. Will there be a movie that will accept but acknowledge there is plenty to draw my attention through poetry and fast editing and hip music? <br /> <br /> I'm not against the extreme violence, it's almost stagnant, but it seems that there should be some inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The ineffective word comes to mind but it is bad in any way. In the first part of the film we gave insights into character motions. And yes 3 policies are very good in their roles. But the role is absolutely incredible. So in the first part we can learn the characters, and in the second part most of the people die and sadly use them to kill others. That seems to be the whole movie. And in the first part there is nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. A nice smart guy like Zed could be willing to join a bunch of junkies and amateur to do a job like this? I do not understand it. She is portrayed as smart, yet she goes ahead in this suicide mission. The survival of him is totally inconsistent with exaggerated violence and maya. So are we happy to see here a Hollywood romance or a super-real, super violent blood bath? Remember that I have the same reaction to two other films related to this director: true romance and reserve dogs. <br /> <br /> Unwanted Drake!
