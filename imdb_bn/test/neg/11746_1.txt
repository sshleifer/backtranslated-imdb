Okay, first of all, those who rebuild Hitako in their true mind and second, who will shoot for the shot? I admit that I did not have any intention of seeing this movie. The real psycho is one of my favorite movies and it seems to be a harmless photocopy of it only. I saw it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it with the original and we were both terribly frightened that the frogs agreed in less than five minutes. As the first, mentioned, they shot for shots. Where is fundamentalism? Why is a movie that is almost perfect, it is perfected for the first time? Why rebuild with a movie start? If you are going to rebuild something, rebuild something that does not work and makes it even better! Second, they used the same script from the 1960s edition. The dialog no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect in the 1960s edition, but seems to be coming out of the strange and stilted modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Do not write hit scripts, you may be rewritten. <br /> <br /> This film had very good talent and they got lost in imitation of the original actors. Acting actor of a car salesman believes that he is acting as the salesman of General Anderson only as a salesperson. All actors believe that the only direction given to them was the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn seems to be a bit more fanciful than Anthony Parkins, but thus reduces the sympathy you felt for Norman. While watching Marine's clothing, Norman's masturbation was too far, and Tony Parkes lost the innocence of her character so well captured. Viggo Martensen's pronunciation was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Patricia Hetcock's performance was rather disappointing than her young and funny lines. <br /> <br /> What I saw about this picture was the only good thing that could hit the hit hit hit with Gass Van Sant Shoot. Whitch wanted to open Phoenix with a tall shot, but at that time he could not sit together for a series of cross-dissipated shots. This image fills the shotgun with the holipeter on the hotel's window. After that, the film became a waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you're passionate about how to destroy a wonderful movie, check it out, but do not watch any of these situations before you see any of them. It should be a pale photocopy of the root and never green. Master's film stick, do not imitate.
