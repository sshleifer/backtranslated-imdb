Any film school student could do 1,000 times better than garbage in a film. Anyone who could read the book, I hope the direct reuse of the book will even make it a fair film. There was an opportunity that a talented director could overcome Woodward's story and create a great movie. <br /> <br /> Director Director went out of Woodward's story. He added a hip Hispanic angel named Velasquez that he was not in the book. He gave Bob Woodward a dead belusi interview for chicken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
