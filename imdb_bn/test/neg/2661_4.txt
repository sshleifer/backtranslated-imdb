Unusually cool and shameless play director from Sydney Pollack. Soapy intrigue revolves around the damaged adultery couple in a plane debris, their spouses find each other and connect their own close-level level. Although romance-novel writings get lazy treatments, I think Harrison Ford and Christian Scott-Thomas Lead's performance were fine. The slot is interested in production, although the plot keeps the cover of the same place, and never creates any mental momentum. As a result, Climax at the airport is a big 'so what?'
