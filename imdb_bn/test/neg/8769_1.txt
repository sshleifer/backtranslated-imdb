A person is trying to keep an eye on Christian films as a bright fan and for the development of Christian filmmaking, I was excited to have the opportunity to watch this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> The scene is wonderful at the beginning, though Leon's a little rip off-corner professional, it first shows some great cinematography ... after all it was <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, incredibly terrible. But then again, the problem itself was the screenplay itself. The dialog was worse than what I saw, and even my amateur pornography "The Awqening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a hitcoach-thriller beside it. (Which is not saying much.) The bright side of this picture is that it was featured on the brand new high-definition 900 cameras on Saturday 24 Pi. This movie and Star Wars: Clones of Attack This year the first movie to use these new technology cameras Unfortunately, the camera's performance seems to have been damaged by bad light, poor angle and painful handling. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < ; 4/10
