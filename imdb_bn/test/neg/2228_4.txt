Those who criticized the Sternans for Stereotypical images of the Italianians, all of them did not see anything until they got a good look at this Conchong Gangster film, which makes a family so annoying, you almost want to rotate around them. <Br /> <br /> This dynasty's parents are not so bad, but their two little boys - one of the total brat, one cloessy cutesy-poo - impossible, for their old good-for-nothing son and the insulting listener of the daughter of Pollyanna Competition. But all of them are granddaddy, good, granddaddy. Activated by Chic Sale (in complete "Dag-Nabit!" Mode), he acted as a moral compass of the film, throwing huge amounts of directories for good measurement of "Dan, dirty foreign". If these are good guys, then the actors of the wonderful actors of that era have become big stars. <br /> <br /> No star is available in actors of criminals, but at least make yourself better than griding Leeds family. Unfinished police officers are not given enough screen time to take down some more things. As a district attorney, Walter Houghton has only highlighted the clich√©-ridel component in his failed attempts to breathe in some levelalides in these dolts. <br /> <br /> This film is proven to be a very popular seminar-winning source of credit for getting an early entry, and it does not illustrate the hard-cats underworld lifestyle, but it's very easy - and less Genofobic - example in style
