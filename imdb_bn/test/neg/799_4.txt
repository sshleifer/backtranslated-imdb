In 1976 a mother named Soft Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). In one night a box is kept at their door and the next morning they open the box to reveal a button device which must be open with a key. In the late afternoon, a terrible man from his mouth came to his door and came to give gifts to Softa. This guy is Arlington Steward (Frank Langley) and he has announced that if he puts the world button on, the family will not die and they get one million dollars in cash. If they do not pressure it, nothing will happen and the proposal will go to someone else. Soft and Arthur were not allowed to tell anyone along with their son about the deal. The encouragement for families to push buttons is increased by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, failed to accept the new job he applied, and a teacher from Narmo who learned that his faculty was being cut off. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the opening of the movie, it is particularly problematic in the feeling of realism with the family. Richard Kelly's previous film, Donny Darko, used to deliberately use the condition of schizophrenia, which justifies his travels in unusual activity and parallel universe. The idea of ​​a device that can shoot any box like the boxer and any other person in the world, like a dream, is completely impossible. That Norma seems to be equally converting, believing this offer and scarring the same as two faces from the dark knight around that someone in his house will take. <br /> <br /> If it seems unlikely, follow what is even more irrational, involving conspiracies about someone hurt by electricity, alien life or something else is being godly affected by this situation. Scenes of open gateways in public libraries, randomized blood circulation and ruthlessly run drones in the Louis family, became almost ridiculously ridiculous in their absurdity. At one point, the film can be called completely stimulating to see where it is going. Kelly is smart in the ability to maintain our focus through most movie competitions. In one case, Narma is reading a class and then asked by a strange boy about her legs. She taunts about her because she is missing four of her legs. Afterwards, at the dinner of a rehearsal for a wedding for Norman and Arthur, this same student appeared as a waiter and it seems he was running them. Yet, for the sake of these oddities, the Creator has been recorded in a highly compiled science-fief manifestation that many are impossible and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> This movie is most frustrating that once the button is mounted surprisingly, initially committed moral effects can be reduced for a number of photos. The end, which will not be lost here, again revives this moral question in the hope of countering the Greek tragedy. Likewise, at this point, there is little reason to care about the incompatibility of film and unfinished performance. Cameron Diaz's southern accent might be irrational, but surprisingly the most disappointing in Langley's film, with a vaguely written role, as a mysteriously harmful person, who thinks the military base is hiding, that would make Evil proud. It really is a shadow of his great performance in Frost / Nixon. There is not much for the other actors in the film; Especially the names of both Narma and Arthur are considered as characters but Kelly's ideas could not be considered spokesman for ideas. Low and brief conversations, such as Norman sympathizes with Arlington on their distortion, and when Soft and Arthur questions whether the button kills any of them, they really ask each other if they are familiar with each other. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to produce a movie that preserves Donny Darko's quality and imagination. Although the film may be confusing for a short time, it is absolutely absurd and it is impossible to fully enjoy, and it certainly does not guarantee multiple views by the rather illogical statements of the film. Fans of science fiction may be able to appreciate a bit more and may be able to draw their own decisions, but Kelly is really trying to say the bottom of the page is a mysterious one. The box this year was a movie that should have been printed.
