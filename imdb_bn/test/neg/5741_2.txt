I like the vampire movie, I like B-movies, I like the movie B Vampire. But this one is not going around for it. Acting is something awesome, especially by 3 men. The story is not particularly interesting. It seems to be still very long in less than 88 minutes and you will find yourself fast forward. Kung Fu Vampire has a lot of terrible attacks. The sound cool? This is not done in a low budget. It gets repeated very quickly. Some small blood and gore, nothing gets excited. Some good telegram works where you can see the cable. It has some good landscapes being painted in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> There is no rental price
