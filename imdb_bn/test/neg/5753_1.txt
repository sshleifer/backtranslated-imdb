This game is a good looking first-person shooter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, The choice of drugs, which creates a super soldier in the murder, Nectar. <br /> <br /> Great, now just give us some interesting, challenging missions, some of our great new weapons and free landing vehicles that can be driven at our leisure time and I will provide a lot of content. <br /> <br /> No !!!! <br /> <br /> The creator of this game has decided to create a campaign, a military-based game that tries to take our fears of terrorism and adopt democracy. The game has turned against the ideology that we re-apply the morals we have learned while we were in primary school, we are not told anything new, but "drug bad ... mmmkay". Then push one push ... Yeahan so nunijojajaj! (Join Navy) How to stand for general answers, Normality and abnormalities, Correct and wrong rats have been given ... Goodwind we found it! <br />! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You are not able to do, you are being forced to endure a long gap to complete the bullets! The objectives of the title "Run in Helicopter" ....... "Go to the group of Troops" ... ... Once it is done .......... Sit down here for at least half of the play, see the little scene by the letters, you can not skip one, but sit and wait, sometimes when people are not even talking, we sit and wait for a helicopter to give the land! <br /> <br /> Bad game, ridiculous team of programmers! Do not disturb anyone else because I'll watch movies instead!
