"Korako" is a foreign conspiracy theatrical titled Caribbean Island, a retired sea captain and bar owner (Scott) and resignation of a CIA operative (Pietersen). This movie contains a lot of bad guys, foreign agents and ghogs, which are not going to say anything about the pair of charmers who want what Scott wants, and they're ready to kill. Use a low-budget TV flick, "Curacao" with some kids and use some carnival street parks as window draw dressing. Bored couch is a bit more than the sheets for potatoes. C
