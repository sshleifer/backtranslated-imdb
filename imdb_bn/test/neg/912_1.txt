The first 4 episodes of season 6 are only to throw, expected and I saw the worst scenario. And hopefully I will not buy it. Seasons also show that the steps they made about the places they suck more. I want to tell everyone what I want to do: Do ​​not make a full episode of space, because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the season before. The season gets worse from the season. I was very frustrated and season 6 watching the first episode 4 episode that I just had to write this. Only people in the brain who can see this bad watch. It seems that while writing this scene people have been out of thinking for a long time. My two-year-old nephew had a good idea for the episode than this guy.
