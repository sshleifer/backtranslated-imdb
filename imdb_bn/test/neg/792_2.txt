I thought ID was about to create a movie about this mystery box, so it would be nice to see how this movie has developed and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. I had high expectations from this movie before I went to the movies. With actresses, like Cameron Diaz, you expect to be great, especially his performance. Acting is a kind of deterioration for the film, the pronunciation of the characters throughout the film has changed, making it incredible. <br /> <br /> The complete concept of your strange box that can make your dream come true, but can destroy others. Such a brilliant story but I feel the director gave it down, this image was likely to be much better than it could have been. <br /> <br /> This image was in no middle. It was very confusing and needed a steady story. Nobody wants to go to a movie and started thinking that 'I did not find it at all,' sometimes it can be exciting and people want to see it again, but this movie never wants people. Want to hear the film again I've seen the whole thing that the audience has ended halfway before. I think every single person was showing this film because the high expectations and how slowly the film was part of it. <br /> <br /> Let bad points keep aside ... but I like the scene where the son bathroom is finished. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie, and it was done together as I imagined it and how devastating and horrific it was in that position. Lights and effects seem to be great, this view shows a bit more than the 1990's, compared to the 1970s. <br /> <br /> This image was confusing because it had a lot of different bits. Some parts that you expect to end up in, where everything goes clean but it does not happen, it goes completely against the expectations of the audience, even though the film is released without a mountain fountain, why not give viewers the chance to do something that can happen Work and really good, but not this one, it was a creative, unusual unusual movie that I thought, it Might be better, it would not have been disappointed, to be honest it's not on DVD.
