And now from another point of view: I did not like it. I did not really end it. I know that "Unforgiven" is sometimes transferred as one of the greatest Westerns created by. I know it was different and managed by Clint Eastwood, an icon of American movies. I know it won a bunch of Oscars. Yet, I did not like it. I do not like Westerns, and it's definitely a matter of taste, but I do not appreciate Eastwood's performance. He did not and has not been a leading man. He is not a bart lancaster, nor Paul Newman, nor John Wayne. Alone in this movie he is sinking by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; They are both actors No, Eastwood is a tall guy, who usually plays solid boys. Here he plays a retired strong man. When I saw him on the screen, I saw a man working in his acting time. Then there are anti Western Western plot. It is very evidently intended to stimulate contemporary values ​​- respect for women, black, negative Americans and the role of single parents; An insult to violence and drinking; Marital discrimination that comes with marriage, including interracial marriages, and small adorable children - in a century, in which prices are not acceptable at least in this way. These values ​​are publicized, if the film is not broadcasted, then it is seen as a manionia. Yet there is a stereotype of the deer film - Prostitution in the heart of gold, the child can not shoot directly, the city gets destroyed in the wild west, Rishi brush girl matches the music in conjunction with the big words in the afternoon on the afternoon of pregnancy. Finally there is pence on the side of the Eastwood. I leave it after an hour. Eastwood still roamed north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the goat could not shoot straight, with a prostitute slash-plated plot placed at a speed after 60 years. It was very slow way. Nobody was finding this element uncompelling. I fear it was me.
