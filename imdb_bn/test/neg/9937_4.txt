The first thing you should know about "ZipFreeze" is that it is shot in the video, so it is such a great "home-video-ish" look that is very confusing and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" movie. And "ZipperFace" actually shows that a bunch of amateurers gathered together for a "real" serial-killer thriller attempt. It's not good at all, but it seems like it's not bad, is it. Two detective detectives in the case spin a continuation of exploitation of a woman. The role of Donna Adams gives the performance of a relative amateur - in front of the camera, its obviously inexperienced works for him. Plus, he eventually puts a great war against the killer. The red sphere first appears ridiculous, but ultimately they work - I assume the killer correctly. And you have come up with the idea of ​​"The Jackpot" for "Pip Fiction" when you probably have to think about seeing the person in the Tarantino Zipperface. (* 1/2)
