I really hope the film is much more than what I actually received. Acting was just terrible from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It was something I could not even follow what I was going to do because it was pretty disgusting. When Pacton's character, Van, annoyed the Colonel of South Vietnam when he was an example of acting, so he threw some sand from "sand map". It was impossible to find any idea what he was feeling and his work was robotics. To do something bad, I did not know how I felt about the van. He is apparently presented as a playwright, but as soon as he goes to Vietnam, he starts a relationship with the English teacher of Vietnam. It was not particularly annoying that the film was just what it was going for. I give it 10 out of 4 stars.
