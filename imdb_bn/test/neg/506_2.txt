For this Hollywood movie, which is mostly the death sentence From 40 million rupees, the Gates of Heaven are so weak ideas and executed that will lead to life in order to break every area of ​​failure. What it really is about most galls is that technically it's too bad, it's an inappropriate sin for money that went into it. John Hart's initial statement in Harvard is unheard of as a conversation between Chris Christopherson and Richard Masour at the train station. Some people think that Simino called it "style". He is not It's just bad sound recording. Characters are not particularly well drawn apart from four or five points; In the view of the climatic war, it is difficult to say bad and who are good guys to say. Even at that stage, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. Hashtert's lid city is a joke as madam, giving a fraud to his entire French character of French accent. Acting is generally hard, without any range or depth of feeling; Even Christopher Walken is bad. The character of John Hart is the only one with any quarrel or animosity (though at the age of 40, Heart is playing a new face in Harvard grade with a bag under his eyes). <br /> <br /> I said that the overlonga is too high. The roller-skating sequence could easily be cut, the cock scene is quickly becoming a movie cliché and the final scene of ocean fishing is outside the titanium zone. Rod Serringne could finally appear in front of the camera and explained that what we saw was perfect. Indeed, those scenes are not bad in themselves and in themselves, but Simino did not have the right to include them, because he gave us the "meat" of the film so bad. The poor, especially the Grand Wars climax. At one stage, the same blast was used three different times with the same wagon wheel from the blast. I can say something about this movie - a great scene, a great performance, even a memorable line of dialogue, but I can not. It's just a big disobedient mess. The only thing that I liked was the Sinametography and Montana location, which is stunning. Even Cimino could not screw up that. It's a long, annoying, bad movie by all standards. And those who say that it is only going to jumpy because of expensiveness, it just makes fun of itself. 1/2 * out 4
