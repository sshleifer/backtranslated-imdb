This movie is a smile and half In the first scene, where a big, bad Jaguar Drew in the Smurfs 'Troubled Gang Leader' (and it is a glove-fest myself), in the final film of Mamie Van Dorren, now the rehabilitated angel is out of the prison prison (errr .. ... run the women's house run by non-iron fones), you can not stop shaking your head. The custom of this movie and the silly Paul Squeak from Mammy (I just wanted to stop it for most of this movie!) And Pilly Yard, Old Tinx, King of Dick Canton. Gloria Talbot, playing a humorous teen girl with several chops (Judo, not acting) I finally saw the terrible misogynist's 50-year-old romp leek Um, so bad with a hairstyle it was squashed by a Mac-like truck that looked like a dead woodchuck. <br /> <br /> Mammy is a bad, bad girl - she smokes, swears, drives wild, hits a teacher, and wanders with gang leaders. He saw his stupid Jaguar driving lover Chip (who is trying to rape a blond girl before raping a rape at the first mountain), and instead brought Dick Contini. Whether this is a step-up for someone's guess. Mail shows at a party with its new bees, and its accusations to push the sticky chips off stiff. Although I'm sure he loved it, he was not there. A stupid battle scene between Contini√≥ and his gang and Mail and his jazz freaks brought some viciously bad steps on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mummy is finally sent to the city, a reform school..RR. Love the house for girls ... .. The Iron Pants and his colleagues corrected the Creator. He nuns (and us) by tossing off the sullen one liners, by scatting annoying, and usually usually shows how bad he is. She quickly ran into Gloria Tabbot, playing one of the humiliating girls, who gave her a thick skunk to give her that she knows her place. She met a tall noodle in a girl obsessed with Paul Anka's character (WHY?). This short trip became his 'hechchman'. <br /> <br /> There is a long diversified movie where nothing will happen, on the other hand, except St. Paul, it does not show how tender he is. In this space, he has sung too much, until you want to shave him in his huge snowshots! And Mammy's younger sister, who played with the best fame of the Prince of Father Jan, called on her to tell her about the trouble. She came face to face with Chipster, and now she found out because of Mel's blackmailing. Girls girls out and break out to save her, with a weird fight scene between Mail and her boys. It's a race between mail and dick, which is so stupid that it buggles the mind. Most of the filmmakers in this lady movie have found an excellent time for roaming through a stupid, badly written and morally caged film, which if no one achieves its goals - unless its purpose does not make you smile.
