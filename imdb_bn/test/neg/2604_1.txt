I must admit that I enjoyed the previous episodes, but perhaps at that time I was small and stupid. I was excited about returning to the family guy until they saw that their "new" shit was out putting them. No surprise, it was just like the old shit. All hair jokes with flashbacks were, apart from this, they added a joke about an old vague piedfil which everyone seems to be on a single EPZ. These are just annoying gags to keep one family guy close to life, and observers for some reason. Its more fun, it's just boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! If you really think the family is funny, you must be annoyed or stopped the borderline.
