How nice. This storyline was just incredibly stupid. I understand that this movie was supposed to be a comedic genre. But still, fools should even make sense of at least some vague kind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . And to make it pretty easy. Glomp hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and volley, water together <br /> <br /> The water should go after pirates, instead of the diethium crystals or some things that should be used as a conspiracy device to annoy the creature. The water was just stupid, stupid, stupid as a plot device. <br /> <br /> "Comedy" likes and conrived and forced. The comedy of the TV series "Red Darf" was hardworking and strong and compulsory, but it was really fun. Instead, I felt like saying, "Ha ha, it was very funny, I forgot to laugh ... <br /> <br /> Sai ... That's all the money sets, dresses, actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I got rid of "comedy." Some of the actors were really good at it. The film will work as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br / > A clear intention of the authors was to make a satirical comedy, Buy But they did not stop it completely, it probably would not have to see me again. This is a total hack work too much.
