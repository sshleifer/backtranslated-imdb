I'm ashamed of myself that I was actually released when I first got released to watch this movie. Although I think his thinly illustrated illustrations of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy's story have been done quite well, this is not a film that should never have been made in the first place; Therefore, my low rating. <br /> <br /> The picture describes the story of a wealthy Greek business shark named Theo Tomasis, who defeated and won the lovely American widow, Lease Cassidy of a US American. Sound familiar? Yes, everything except the name. <br /> <br /> do not throw. Anthony Quinn played the fullness of the Greek Tycoon, and at least it got some comfort, only Archie himself asked Queen for this role. Jacqueline Bissat is definitely one of the finest and sophisticated among Jackie (for all purposes and purposes), and James Frankies has a fantastic look in all the United States. <br /> <br /> I did not see this movie later, it came out, or I want to see it again. I think I feel a fair bit of bad language and some general prejudice. Otherwise, I think it's a breathtaking and convincing close view of jet settings jumping on rich and famous, jets, beaches, pools etc. Yes, the views of the Greek islands are spectacular, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Its type, OK, I think. There is no end to TV movies about Kennedy, which I sometimes admire and do not accept. This is basically just another. Aristotle and Jacklin Kennedy Onassis are much better to allow rest in peace.
