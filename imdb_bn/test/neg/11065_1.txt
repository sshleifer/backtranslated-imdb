There seems to be some money behind this photo, but it would be impossible to work really badly and ruthlessly if I do not see it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Since the actor is wearing helmet lights, that means what we see illuminated in the light of the darkness - we can not see what the characters can see; So when they shouted "Look there!" We have left to ask "what?! Where?!". Eventually the film has an annoying, confusing strobe-light effect, until we can reach the end. <br /> <br /> And I do not want to tell you 'last' - but if you've ever seen the smiling festival of the old beginning '60's arc, accept it then "Eegah!" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> But no crazy person ever "Egha!" Want to change a theme like this, sometimes remembered as one of the worst movies ?! But that's where we are, folks. Also, "Egah!" In contrast, "The Cave" is not a funny topic. It's unwanted. (I could run it in x2 at normal speed, just to finish it, hopefully I'll actually see something at the end of the film, but when I do it, it was just stupid.) This picture gave me a happy moment though; After coming out of the DVD player, it spent only a few quarters, I was able to destroy it with my own hand - what relief!
