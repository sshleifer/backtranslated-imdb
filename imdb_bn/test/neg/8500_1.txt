I do not understand who received more than 5 ratings. I think this is a terrible movie from a point of view. Plot, acting, art, dialog, music, whatever! I do not think of a low budget ... however you have to get some points. Crying out of fear, amazing .. Unless .. Then the two boys started kissing in bed. Awful, just awful I love the indie film, do not remember slow. But this movie disappointed me from any point of view. Not even graphite, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I was wondering how people would like it. I am a woman of my 30 Is it for teenagers who have no loneliness in life, or have I found it? Then what do I achieve? Time wasted! Please go for some others.
