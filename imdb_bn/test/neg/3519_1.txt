I've seen this movie recently because I'm a big Kinsky fan. But, my God. Do not make me wrong I love this person But his entire acting in this movie is just a negation to work! But luckily he is not the only blame. The first complete storyline is dealing completely with the gunmen looking for the killings, but he did not do that, but Kinski was trapped in prison for no crime. Here's the end. All the conversations and letters are so loud that it is screaming to you. But perhaps it's all fun If you know Kinski-biography, it is clear that Kenniki did not think about these films. Especially all his Italian-Western role He just took the money and it was there. Again, this whole movie is completely weird. For general hardcore fans only.
