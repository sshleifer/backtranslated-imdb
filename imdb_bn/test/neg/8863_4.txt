It can be called a good movie, in fact it does not even stop. But I have to say, some things that made me ... do not laugh, do not spell, but something like that. Resovoir dog parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to remember. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell on the ground. The whole thing was just dirty and the actors were not good for the characters; Most of them simply overacted. There was complete overwhelming sequence, it was a complete film waste. I understand that it will make the movie smaller by 20 minutes, but it will only make it better. <br /> <br /> Now let's line up with good and bad things, two out of six toilets seats for this one out.
