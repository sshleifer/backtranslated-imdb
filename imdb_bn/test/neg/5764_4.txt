A group of friends discover deep gold inside an old mine. But by taking gold and thinking they hit big, they awaken a long dead murderer, who is hell bait to protect his treasure. "Miner's Hases" Extremist B-horror movie. You close all your acquaintances, intellectuals-your group of weaker young people, strange voices, some pop-fears, mysterious Sheriffs, old ladies who everyone thinks for nuts, their own characters. Black is not black), and so on. Despite this, it is a funny, unwanted fashion that makes the film shamelessly "so bad, it is good" entertainment. What characters and dialogs do you expect from this kind of film ?? Known, routine and irrational Although the performers all work well, but considering? I actually saw a big budget movie with bad acting (what did I do in the summer?) And added some of its credibility to the film itself. Villain (The 49's) of this film evidently evolved from the crystal crystal crystals, brown overcoat everywhere, hats and long white hair. He never spoke like the crypter, and for boot ugly boots. I think it's a little frustrating. There are several fairly good moments, but very off-screen and death scenes are often funny (spooler!). An interesting moment in which the girl was frustrated by that villain, and to achieve this 'effect', filmmakers hide the actress's body under the wings of villain, with her head leak and put some fake blood on her neck. Seriously, you could see his shoulder outline! I think they could work a bit better even if they were low in budget (and I was sure, but still, ??) Special effects are inexpensive but quite effective and, in most cases, moderately well-worked for low-budget movies. Both effects guys or directors seem to be a thing for explosion and fire. At the end of the film almost every scene is burning at death (always slow down in motion) or some explosion, it is a car or old mine cave. Seriously, no one can hear the word; "Stop, Drop and Roll!"!!?! <br /> <br /> Peanut and Fool, though entertaining, and as long as you do not have expectations through the roof, you will be adequately entertained by "genocide of small killers" (or "forty sailor curse", which you want to call it). <br /> <br /> I'm feeling liberal, so I'll give it 4/10.
