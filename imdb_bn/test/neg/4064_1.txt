Perhaps the film originally wanted to be ridiculous as 'Biman' but it failed unfortunately due to its failure as a 'thriller'. I do not understand why they could not give a few hundred rupees to the actual pilot for a little technical consultation. Hell, I will make it for free! This witch plane was operated in an hour from 757 to 767 to 747 hours and the power liver worked behind. And the dialogue sounds like it came in the last part of a 'telephone' of a child where everyone had said different languages. I actually rewound TIVO and it first saw it a second time to see if it was really bad as I really thought. It was there.
