As a movie "Yesterday", the rate is hard. Cinematography is excellent and 9/10 deserving. Shoot the story and do real and compromise. But the story translation by the actors on the screen did not match the camera work. <br /> <br /> As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I lauded the film's appearance and honesty for honesty. But this camera work is not enough to make viewers recommend watching this movie. It only realizes the love of movies in order to see the purpose and power of "Kal Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Contrary to the 1980s film "The Gods Mystery Bay Crazy", which was a playful character facing the modern technology of an African culture, "Yesterday" there was no intention of appealing to a crossover audience. The film is not only suitable for the general western mind - and I doubt it was intended for the Western mind. The scenes are not packed for the world of long and gradual, 60mph + instant gratification editing. The dialog is not cleaver or malicious, it is real. Movies do not give the best entertainment about the health crisis, and this movie is not entertainment, it is education. <br /> <br /> This movie is best viewed by those who know the way of life, culture, praise and love. Sub Sarah Africa For the understanding of other cultures, especially African cultures, if you lack a wide spectrum of visas, then this film has to be omitted. You do not waste time on it. Instead of viewing your cross culture, see "Talladeg Knights" or "Larry the Cable Guy". <br /> <br /> I can give it a 4 for those who might want to watch this movie, but there is no correct idea of ​​African culture. I would give it a 7 for the audience with gratitude for movies about human experience anywhere in the world.
