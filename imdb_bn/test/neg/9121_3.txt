I liked the first "American graffiti" with my first heart and soul, which I have ever seen, with the best teenage flick, considered it the best film about Rock N 'Roll. The first film sparked the career of George Lucas, who later released the BlackBuster epic "Star Wars" two decades later before precllexing before the previous Recharge Dreyfas was created as a star on Joses, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other movies. <Br <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> And Laurie (Syndi Williams) are protesting against the Vietnam War, when their friend Terry "The Todd Fields" (Charles Martin Smith) is in the war and is trying to escape. John Milner (Paul Le Mate) is still in California's hot drag race, where he never left home. The rest of the film's supporters from Candy Clark's Debby (Terry's girlfriend) do not really do anything to Harrison Ford and others with forward gang members. The original movie shows the youth walking on the streets, showing that they do not bleed with Body Hole, The Fleets, Chuck Berry, Fat Domino, Bill Helly and Comets, the rock music of rock n 'roll of body noses, and many more that bring back to the nostalgia bug classical music . Soundtracks of "More American Graffiti" have rock, soul, country, hippie music and the mood of protest in the late 60's, drug abuse, sacrifice and much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" It wanted to show the audience members after the title epilogue of four main characters (which excluded Dreyfus's character), where it was not needed. This picture was not needed because I was happy to see that Lucas or Dreyfas did not come up with big and better projects.
