The most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-j "film". Mary Warner, Rock 'N' Roll High School, Eatful Raul, and Miss Tougher's best-known actress for her role as Mary Blond, there are many good things about this trio. This film is too bad for MST3K - really!
