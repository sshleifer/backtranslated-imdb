Title I do not have much knowledge I'm not sure any door in the movie should have been opened. <br /> <br /> The image begins to strangely, a conversation between a man and a woman which looks like plenty of decorated train cars is complete with the train train word. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and his casket is on the train. Woman's page, and call a young girl. The young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that she told her grandfather that she is sick, and that she should go back to her home town. He is not there for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Flash back thirteen years ago. A galaxy enters a house. He hates the sleeping girl, then goes to another room and the girl's mother runs away. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's house and finds her dead with a knife. He shouted, and one hand did not come out of there and put his hand on his face. She is afraid. The opening scene of the assassination movie is spoiling her scream, and some effective shots in the face of the girl. <br /> <br /> There is not much for it in the visual section. Sometimes the word has some strange use and there is some weird light in the atheic scene where many of the glasses are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Return to current day. The young woman reached her grandmother's house. He does not believe in the city's old doctor "judge" and a person named Operation Carnation, the city's museum. He does not believe any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire any faith. She's rather crabby across the whole movie. She wants to check her grandmother in a hospital. The people of the town want his house, and the museum operator wants it (its museum is already filled with the majority of grandmothers). Undoubtedly, the woman wants to keep the room <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He creates various threats, and wants him to do something for his revival. Such views often repeat. Unfortunately, there are so many characters in the movie, which may limit their chances of it. Even worse, we are calling the phone from the beginning to the right. So, when the youngster does not know (though Calcutta sometimes falls into his natural voice), the audience always knows: there is no doubt. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
