Probably could ever be the worst film ever made. At least 9 planets were fun from outer space. I can not believe they can really make money to do this thing. Full waste of celluloid. I had some respect for Kristophersson before I saw this shit. I guess someone close the tax code. Please, in the name of all those who do not suck, whoever makes it, stop them before they suck again! This film will have to avoid people who are not LSD, or my crazy cousins ​​who call it Native American. If you are in wood and an owl starts talking to you, then see a psychiatrist. It is not necessary to make a movie about it.
