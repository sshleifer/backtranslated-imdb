In order to find a batch of green bears known to be completely absent, a Delta Force Army unit, in the fight against survival of a cloaked skeleton, which is the supposed soul of an ancient Indian warrior, when the archaeologists bothered his grave when revived. The skeleton man appears to have wrecked a horse and is able to use a type of dimensional portal and run it and is influenced by bullet-fire and explosives. Skeleton Man's Horse leaves no hoof print page and he can silently ride his victim behind and around. Skeleton looks at the man's eyes with different colors from the point of view of the film. In other words, he is not an ordinary man, so can Captain Lewy (Michael Rumah, because of the sharp and sharp sharp) and his gang commandos can stop this danger? For some reason, Skeleton Man killed a nearby chemical plant worker. Finally, what is the purpose of the skeleton man to kill people? And, why a complex is living in the jungle, our command can save people, if humanity's Skeleton Man kills his own group to prove himself? <br /> <br /> It sounds as utterly stupid. Just incredible horror. It is a film that can cause brain cells to die. Caspar Van Dean receives second bills on credit under Rooker, but a very ridiculously underwritten character coming out of the movie quickly Rooker deserve better than this. If I'm an actor, I do not want to make this movie my resume. The Sketton Man rejects Templar Knight from a film De Aashouri. He can hit only certain people while exploding the effect of a woman who has a spear. An arrow shot from skeleton man's bow actually destroyed a helper player propeller. For almost 99% of the film, the bullets were shot in Skeleton Man and he can still go inside and outside the portal accessories, eventually, suddenly he becomes weak for the attack. Oh, and horses also change because Skeleton Man freely goes to the jungle from that portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are considered experienced professionals, make this really bad decision across the film. The mind boggles with this film. Good for some sunny, and some gore scenes make this alarm lookable pure crap as a trash movie.
