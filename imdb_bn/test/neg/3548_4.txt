I usually try and assume a crime thriller second, but the cleaner was just completely expected. Samuel L. Tom Cutler, played by Jackson, initially had a striking twist on his career, but it was his. Apart from even worried, I wanted to know where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I had already understood who was the killer. Then I saw the ending of several films that I believe and have changed. What a disappointment, I was right from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She did not play a credible character related to the script from the beginning gate and it soon destroyed the whole plot Does it. Perhaps this was a story accident or story weaknesses directly. His role as Ann Norark will show more passion and trouble for the situation that is built around him. It will make the build up more compelling and ultimately dramatic. Nevertheless, the cleaner is not memorable, memorable. I saw the CSI episode, which was even more exciting.
