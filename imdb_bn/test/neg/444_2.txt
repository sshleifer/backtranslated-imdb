God, that sucked You can not finish a horror movie with a happy-after family setting. Yeash. I was going to work on the final ambivalent kind. But, my God. He will not have to kill the girl, he did not die, the father of ghost has come to healing (which does not have any meaning, because his soul was released after all the breaking of the liberation war was broken). What a crack in junk This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen so many horror movies. In London, all the other people involved in the Weowwolf of the United States face it. Blegh. I hope this bar will ruin the career of Jelly Dalefe Barr. And CGI: Like new and cool back in 1997, but today it only shows brighter than London's casual artificial / makeup work. However, I did, hopefully I was afraid of a few. Instead of getting the root, or failing to do the housing. Or that fails to watch American Idol reruns. Do not just watch this mess.
