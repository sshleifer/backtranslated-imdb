I'm scary to see that this has given positive reviews for "film". There are no freedom fighters in this movie. The song is not good, the actress is sad, I can understand that anyone who enjoys this movie can have a hard time singing "Praise" alone. The idea is terrible, some scenes related to plot (such as moving love stories, though a romantic interest in male romantic interest) was so bad that I wanted to do physical harm while watching them. The scenes that fly in a shrinking head under the girls' shirt, "she can pick him up" and liked it as a reason enough for everyone related to this film. The West Side Story link can be just a joke, since the only ground to destroy all copies of this movie is to mention such a great movie. To make a long story short, this picture is awesome all the way. And if I had my way, everyone who loved it would go straight to hell ....
