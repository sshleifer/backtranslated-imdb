I saw all the dogs go to heaven that I went to see the seagulls in the theater, and I can not seem to be more frustrated than the movie. The story groove stark worse than an older age. Come on, come on! Perhaps the car might imagine being able to take bigger revenge than this, despite how angry he was. Plus the devil pictured as a CAT?!? How can you get it? A lot for the story Is not it surprising that Don Bluth, Bart Reynolds, Melba Moore, and Vick Taeback will not touch it by filling 10 feet of feet? Animation was absolutely rogue. I was not able to count all of the colors was washed, and I was able to see how many times through the supposed object to be difficult. It will be the worst animation I ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but this is not BOMB!
