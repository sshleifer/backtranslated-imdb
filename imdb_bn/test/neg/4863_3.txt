Would you be surprised if I told you police with this conspiracy in this movie? Any? The ringleader was a shadow doll if I told you. What? Do you believe me ... OK. Yes, I set up. It is very bad, this movie can use a sense of humor. I realized Charlie Shane was doing this time - another movie equals more money - such as Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... Why? Even Stephen Lang does not start. He had so much fun working on the 'Hard Way' party, and now this junk. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. Everyone involved should feel ashamed. If you want to make a bad movie and be successful - it is bent - but I seriously doubt what they are looking for here. Flat out, story stinks and we are actually supposed to take this Yake seriously. The movie is also thinking about the light of hope. Seriously, I suspect it and tighten the purse strings in an art so that it shines green in the light of the first light. Maybe it's more horrible that what does this dog's pills do to get to the theater? <br /> <br /> Oh, Sam Watson, how great you are in law and order. Why are you here? Expressing itself to the President's role in the United States, which I can add, it is shot in a remote control bylap controlled by the Gonso killer. Then again George P. An excellent composition by Kosmatos's work, which includes "certification" credits, Rambo: The second part of the first blood consists of other gems. Hmmm .. case cases?
