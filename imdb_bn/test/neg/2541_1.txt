First off, this is the worst movie I've ever seen It might be you want to see it, but it's not a good way to get bad. It's annoying, impossible, poorly shot, ridiculously scripts, and the lack of cool disaster effects. <br /> <br /> It's a bad idea, it often goes into the feeling of patriotism, Japanese uniqueness and hunting, without a sarcastic or funny sign. Everyone abandons Japanese every hour of their need. Especially the Koreans Select the most noble character seppaku - their ships are going down with as their favorite island sinks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stop making movies like this.
