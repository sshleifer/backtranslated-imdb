In contrast to other spaghetti Westerns, these characters make sense and some degree can be identified. It still has other spaghetted Western's secret gunplay. There is no plot for Western, there is no plot for Western, no plot, no character that you can take care of, and intelligence ammunition which does not make much money for the era, and the audience rely on the great music to remember some. . This one is more light-hearted, like that made in Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill together. They were even better than junk produced by Eastwood and others, if Saddam-MÃ¡lkovist gives them the opportunity to see their friends. Looks like everyone has made fun of making movies. It was good to see a giant actress like Gilbert Rowland who did not even mention in the movie rental box, but it was obviously the biggest name. His character was very enjoyable. At the end there is a three-stage stripe, which is definitely much more than that (The Good the Bad and the Augley), because the letters are at least a selectable and some detectable. Not a good movie, but it's a fun thing to do.
