ZoE 101 originally a girl named Zoey who moved about a boys boarding school in the first year that they integrate girls. That raw plot line, I'll admit, is a pretty good idea. Although this show was for the children, a five year old could possibly indicate his serious flaw. Firstly, Joe is a clich√© character, it's very popular, super interesting, super smart, and there; There is no mistake with him; No girl like that This event seems to be spotlighted at Jamie Lin Spears and enhancing her fame. The wings, which appeared at the beginning of the first season, are simply common. However, in my opinion, he was probably their most realistic character, which is sad that the grain is never beautiful. Nicole is very sticky and works like an entire airhead, but the mysterious gets straight A's. Lola seems capable of making some fools with her emee-worthy acting skills. Quinn is supposed to be super smart, and even though she is able to create most unrealistic things, she is considered to be weird, and she does not find any person both beautiful and smart, but Joe, Lola and Nicole are talking and they all have beauty and no personality Be it. Chase and Michael are very similar, and I sometimes get confused at them. Logan is unreasonably rich, and like millions of dollars worth of dollars. Anyone rich? I noticed that the character of the show means Stasi girl, who does not do anything beautiful for them. It's not funny! This means and it only affects young girls to work meaningfully to young girls. Finally, the school offers an infinite cake with 5 star facilities, such as a beautiful location, sushi bar, free soda machine, pool and jacuzzi, decorated hot lounges in the movie theater, and allowances for boys and girls. Freely go into another sex's dorm room. In most boarding schools, if a boy is to go inside a girl's dress or is thrown upside down, then they will be expelled. Finally, the win was lost 101 and there would be a few years left to prepare the draft. Process
