A dark, yet ludicrous story that a police enjoys first experience with vampires and decides that to leave these wicked people, they have to leave their job. This movie contains mostly suspicious acting, intrigue, props and filming. War scenes are as hockey as the genius of the WWII war in medieval schools. There was no motivation for the actors to stay there in the delivered line. Props were bad because they could even do even the slightest quantities even they did not see. Most of the film seems to be shot in some of the bases (in some scenes you can see a roof overhead on a scene that was not supposed to look like a basement). There was no motivation to move behind or behind the plot, it still stands, without any reason for some character action. I felt this horror type was the place and times out of the bars for more of the cartoon series. It's like a movie blade, an African-American vampire hunter. However, where there is a similarity, and the movie shows Saturday night closer to Night Live Spoof.
