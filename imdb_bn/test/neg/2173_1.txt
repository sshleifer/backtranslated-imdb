I usually do not write reviews, but this "film" was special. I can not stop it. I do not believe I've ever seen a bad movie, but I'm sitting there watching it. It was like a horrific car debris flowing all the blood on the highway. It was hateful, but I could not escape. Where do I start? I think the movie is a thriller thriller, but it is so ridiculous, it can be just a comedy, but it's not funny, even in a fool / stupid way. It's like to try to do a skit work in conjunction with your cousin's family. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. The second string has gone for one hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was involved with this movie will not work again. Writing, direction, acting, and everything was terrible. I can not describe how bad the problem was; You just had to see it. And I'm not sure that it will show up again, so if you do not see it, you're out of luck. I mean, that it was enough to show some appreciation for almost every "bad" movie of my life. And in the future I can see for every movie that I can not stand, I think myself, well, at least it was not as bad as the second string.
