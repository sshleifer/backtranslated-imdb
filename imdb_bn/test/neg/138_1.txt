I Button IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Published by bKash and no limited film <br /> >> Process: absolutely anyone <br /> >> Dangers: I <br /> <br /> Summary of Plot: Master P shows a drug dealer who looks like a live-action cartoon character, talks and works more. Review: When I was in the ninth grade during the liberation war, I remembered and praised this clan by Master PK in my class. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, when the audio is heard only when the audio sounds, and the movie appears to have been videotaped on a public access channel. Thankfully, I did not buy this other film like my other inner-city classmates. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My judgment: Avoid this video as it is a sexually transmitted disease.
