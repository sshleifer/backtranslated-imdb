You live in the suburbs, are economically better and you really do not have much contact with England's city life, but it's a comedy for you. The public audience can not be anything, but if you're like these characters, they will truncate you. Overall it is a comedy which sits in the BBC at the back and humor for their pleasure and only a few selected publishers. Like BBC comedies, it only compares with flowers and horses, fawley towers, black adams and other classic, this series shifts away from the BBC's regular product to the viewer and offers a few people in culture.
