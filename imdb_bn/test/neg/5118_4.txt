Bear Winters Another software parody of Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen things there). There are 5 interesting women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith, and Julie Strein), and a dark guy whose only purpose is to provide Comic Relief. OK, so I wonder, "Cool very beautiful woman, having sex with each other for 10 minutes or more, it should really be good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, , The producers have published it, there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. There are some at the beginning of false, but most of the work is only made for the camera. I guess once the producer They spent more money on women and spent more time in removing their clothes, they did not have any money left to do something, and I guess they used their allotted nudity very quickly, because at the end of the video, There is a huge amount of meaningless conversations which are being used for some reason for some reason. "You are lying Ladies! You do not! You go in the cave! You do not go! I think we will go home! Well, I do not! "This goes on and on and forever. <br /> <br /> There is a better thing than this.
