MGM tried to connect and the youth tried to meet them with the Divine One and to find them as the leading men. Gable and Garbo were chemistry at Susan Lennox but it was a shy film. Inspired here there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the script is poor. What did they think? Modern, fast talking, wise-crack-snapping Montgomery and long sad Garbo? It's a story like Camille. Young students fall for the woman of the world and are repelled by learning his past, rejecting him, recalling him, rejecting him, .... you get the picture. Garbo is a top Parisian model and completely trustworthy as the house, although his artistic friend and his loose morals had his indifference to his life at the top of society. Suddenly he was fascinated by this innocent. Finally he gave up his life for him and drowned in poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in his own house. Wickedly, he wants to marry and keep him aside - so long ago for his pure moral principles. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly dust and annoying and nothing happens. Like Lulu, Marjari Rambo is also "the poor appetite of poor women for the Garo fans" and "the update, where is your sting?"
