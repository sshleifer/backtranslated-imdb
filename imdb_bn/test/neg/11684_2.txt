Well, after seeing the DVD box, the first thing was "best screenplay" and it seemed to be a good hiring. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure once there was a good movie here, but after the incredibly poor performance and production value of "video games" it ended, like the annoyance of Tron's half-brother. The first scene set up the entire atmosphere of the whole movie. Five minutes out of it, you ask yourself, "Do I see hell?", And it will be snowball from it. A horror soundtrack that makes every song like Rob Jumber's "Dragula" a piece of this naughty piece in a ridiculous bad movie. A note on the side, # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you are the final destination."
