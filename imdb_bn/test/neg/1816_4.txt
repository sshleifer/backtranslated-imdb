This is the first and so far I can say, the only ending production of "Heart of the Darkness". Before launching "Citizens", some test footage was shot for a version of "Aurson Wells" "Test of the Darkness" which will now be portrayed as "Pov", where we will see everything from the point of view, the main character Charlie Marlow's; The film will never be seen fleetingly only in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film is ever made. The "Pov" strategy was not used very successfully in "Lady In the Lake" in 1947. Robert Montgomery starring Philip Marlowe. Probably, the coincidence of two "Marlow (E)" characters is correct. Of course, "Heart of Darkness" based on Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" <br /> <br /> The short novel "Heart of Darkness" of British author Joseph Conrad was first serialized in British literature. In 1899, his favorite change in the magazine, the ship captain Charlie Marlowe, who described the short story "Youth" and implicitly described the story of "Lord Jim". Marlowe, temporarily out of work, decided to take up the work of acquiring a boat for a Belgian company involving the cruel exploitation of King Leopold II's personal militant resources, cruel exploitation of the Kongo Free State. Marlowe travels from London to Brussels, signs with the company, and it is said that his mission will take a coastline to a remote inland station until the Congo River, led by one of the company's most fruitful agents in the colony, whose name is Cartage. Ivory, latex (for rubber production) and other commodities from the cartage station were closed, and for some time the noise did not come from the cartridge. He has rumors that he "has gone native." Marlow is taking any necessary steps, investigating, and making a report of his return. He passed from the mouth of the Congo to the West African coast, was delayed for a few weeks and was forced to repair his boat at the company's station on the coast, and he was finally encouraged to find the Kartez station. River, heat, plants, wildlife, insects, people, everyone takes their toll on their patience, imagination and their mental resources. He Kurtz gets sick, half-crazy, and near death. The final face and cartage death is almost an anticlax, especially since Conrad is so obscure about what can really happen that we have left the blossom for ourselves. This is a novel where you are obscurely unhappy after finishing the book, but you are saving the story of its great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of the Darkness" was illustrated with Guyana in Central America standing for West Africa. . This novel is best for the greatest losses in the world where: In fact, we are the first global city dweller to travel on a tropical river. But the rest of the pictures are forgotten. Tim Roth did her best work as Marlow, but there has been a change in the relationship between plot, character and character, which makes you wonder why they bothered. If Conrad's story is made for the screen, why do not they leave it alone? It is unreasonable to expect the book to be compromised in a movie, but I did not justify a movie that you are thinking about whether it is working with only incompatible screenlines and filmmakers. Most disappointing was as John Malkovich Kurtz. She had complete miscast and simply role-playing flubs. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his pronunciation, everything. It may be a very good choice, like Bruno Gonz√°lez (opposite Malcolm, a real German, character). <br /> <br /> This is a very frustrating product and you would recommend it after reading. If the book wants to rely more than your imagination to get a visual image of a visit to the Congo River in the year 1900.
