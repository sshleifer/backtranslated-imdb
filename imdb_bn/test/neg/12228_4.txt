It was only a matter of time that a film will be made in spuf! And there are lots of movies that are fun. But my biggest problem was that it recognizes the film. How the director and writer of "The Comebacks" forgot to be creative. Although I must admit that I was shocked to see some scenes, "The Comebacks" was so funny. The actors forget to give their lines seriously and look straight into the film. A fool claims it and why stupid joke works in such movies. Because of the customer's failure, jokes do not hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and usually in spoofs that do not have to be a problem. Take "naked guns" for example. There is always something happening on their screen. In "The Comebacks" they did not even bother to let the stuff happen in the background. Just a few reasons to watch this movie! It's still fun to spot the movie that is fun. And Jeremy Williams as an iPod. Cuba Gooding Jr. was ridiculous as his parody radio! He began to be the only one to throw the idea about what a spoof is. Not completely bad!
