There is only one word to define the whole movie, which is: Awful How "rebuilding of most heads" was awful. The movie title is awful. The actor is awful. And the combination of good cooking and blend in the US is awful. If you've seen "Bela Martha", this is the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", it's a punch in the stomach. Mrs. Jones's performance is so poor and irrelevant that Jessica Alla is considered the worst actress (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp). Not to mention cooking, those who will play a good role. And little girl ... not important. Bella Martha is a very beautiful movie, a authentic one ... Why was it rebuilt? There was a story .... here they took it. There is no story ... what will it represent? In one way this movie was perfect. Do you know when all the components fit together? Well here in this case. A perfect crane ....
