I was not sure that it was definitely a very, very adaptable adaptation of Eka de Quiroz's work and I must say that this free adaptation makes the book as a possible good idea and character. The problem is that without any tastes, without any taste, only bad taste of cyclone everywhere This script is so fake and these characters are so outstanding that the little actors like Unus, Brianer, Morgado, LaTarto and others look down on themselves, without any cinema or story lost themselves on any net. For my surprise, the new generation of George Currula and Soraya Chaves have kicked their performance bravely, but you can lose them like a dried boat without any direction. And talking about direction, is there something missing in this movie ?? Where is the director? Everything is bad taste; Whatever the frame, and whenever, using a hand camera for any reasonable reason, the light design to create the environment does not exist (and any excuses that are not real dark stories). This "tries to be a film" is not as a whole problem, as a taste, or very bad practice. George and Soria are sad to see such melodramatic and gratuitous sex scenes being melodious, portrayed here, and movies to be closed are used as tearing or fax transit purposes. Probably Carlos Coleho da Silva will see the adaptation of the same book of Carlos Carrara in 2015, and how the actual film will have to be collapsed.
