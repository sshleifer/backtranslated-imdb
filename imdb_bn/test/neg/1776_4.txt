I acted as Eugene Morris Jerome in my high school adaptation and the film does not live up to the imagination of the script or Neil Simon. I know this game back and forth and I can honestly say that the acting was off, the production was Chess. Changes to the game script are poorly executed. If you really want to enjoy this game then you see the real game, not the Hollywood movie adaptation. Eugene's character lacked the spirit and he said that was too annoying. Other characters were off as well. A general disappointment, dirty, dramatic, dramatic execution!
