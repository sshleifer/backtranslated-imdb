I was hoping to see more absorption styles of the film but unfortunately it could be a poor low-budget action flick that does not have talent for it. The story is a beautiful woman named Toy Marshall (Heather Thomas) who works for a boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combos) secret organization and has discovered a bullet proof motorcycle and shoots lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can fire lasers. The agency has sold a major $ 500 million contract to Basriyan (Martin Landau) and sent two tenants' thogs for killing Rick and Teri and collecting bicycles. A long blond named Rolf (DAR Robinson) and his partner Hannah (Don Wills Myth), who was able to kill Thug Rick, survived. When he discovered a video tape at home that Rick left his invented explanation what helped him to do next to the star. <br /> <br /> ***** Spillar Alert ***** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [ No need to talk about it, but he gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martin Bassiwick), where he ends up using a motorcycle <br /> <br /> This photo is directed by Fred O'Neill Rai. He has been brought, who has done his career in making very low budget exploitation films, but he made a serious mistake here without leaving the point of exploitation. And try to make an action film. There is no nudity and normal title in front of a quick shower scene, which is used to watch the audience in the movie, where they can not be found. I do not think anyone was expected to get Thomas nude but he does not wear a sexy outfit. This tight jeans did not prevent me from cuddling him with respect to his perfect form, but really he really did. Like all his movies, it is fun to watch the cast and with many familiar faces Robert Kuey, Hunts Hall, Trow Donohu, Tim Conway Junior, Michael Reagan and Ras Tamblin play the role. Stantman died soon after Dar Robinson and it dedicates his last acting effort and film to him. Why should I wonder why London au will spend time with this kind of junk, but I was interested in a very romantic role in blanket castings. Thomas is good in this film? Who care! I think if he wanted, he could have become a popular "B" movie starlet, but it never happened. The verdict in this attempt ruins everyone, though Cast is fun to watch but he goes out of the material that makes him the best film producer.
