Only the front can be seen? In TCM (UK) it's really a terrible film. If I could pay the money then I would go out. <br /> <br /> A photo messy mess. Bears (Lewis) and his comrades cut out the uniform uniforms of an Italian science-film 1960. What was the CNND / Peace symbol badge based on that uniform? The sets were pure 1970, I was sure that a Hollywood TV backlot could provide a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> This film is with racism. The film takes the old Mikey. It is not funny that more than Luis can make another movie.
