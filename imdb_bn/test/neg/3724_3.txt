I do not remember too much about this movie that Luminary (Lamp) was a unique unused destruction. Almost every battle scene involves unnecessary and unexpected destruction of useful light capsules, even if Chess, '70s style, cylindrical shades are kept with the timing of the story. At one stage, the fictitious lights in both the living and dining room of their mother's house were destroyed by the fictitures of both rooms, in the case of domestic war. Nevertheless, the most malicious destruction occurs in a chest office in a moment, and it involves reducing the level of firmness with the Seramic horse-head base, which ultimately isolate and a cylindrical shadow fits badly. The guy comes back into it while fighting another fisticuffs. Later, when the lamp is shot, it is also scattered, plastic shade shade more damage. <br /> <br /> While this movie encourages a particularly brutal attitude towards the lights, it should be remembered that the light, their cheap construction or gauche, regardless of the top heavy appearance, is still valuable for the illumination that they provide. However, if you ever feel the need to break the lamp, I would highly recommend this movie.
