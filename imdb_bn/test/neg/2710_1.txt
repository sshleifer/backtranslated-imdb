For those who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. It only includes people who do not like this film, but who made it. Perhaps they think? Madonna Judi playing Holida? Please, he can not even play Madonna (if there is a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne is giving well. He deserves every penny, because this does not kill his career, nothing will happen. I'm sure that these few people who actually paid for watching this movie have felt picking their pockets. Madonna apparently went to the point of embarrassment due to her virtually completely talented lack of actress, but you can not feel embarrassed for her. He has no connection with the left cast; Looks like he looked at the set and said, "OK, I'm not here, I'll never make myself worse, anyone who has ever seen someone from Judy Holiday, now stay away from my way" and then proceed just to do that. I know the word "rotten madonna movie" is void, but it certainly fits it. It's a painful and talented "actress" painful to make her own fool, but apparently she does not bother her repeatedly. <br /> <br /> This "trick" she actually managed to find out who gave it money for making money. Now that's funny.
