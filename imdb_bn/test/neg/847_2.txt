I was actually looking forward to watching this movie. After reading several reviews before the release, it is like a genuine film, beautifully portrayed and an interesting custom (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hart.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything can be done, but it is so annoying that I often deny almost everyone to sit and keep it completely. Also, Cage's attempts to talk with Italian accent are shameful. He is such a good actor that I went to Crawling while talking to this movie. <br /> <br /> "Dispinning" seems to describe the movie here in which the reviewers always use the word, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I think it will not take a long time for the word to come out of how bad the movie was, because like the accent of the carriage, it did not work well.
