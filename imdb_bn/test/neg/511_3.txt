Attention, potential spoilers <br /> <br /> This picture is so ridiculous that it's actually fun. The director has kept all the injuries that have been hurt by B-series films. The stupid bibo (excellent rack) is bad guy, the main villain cheerfully and his plots are repeatedly revealed and captured, so that they are destroyed and those who, in the dark past, kill / kill the father of the hero. Sidekick beside a policeman - Short, cold and the only preparation for the last war (another clich√©) is returning its baseball-cap rim-backwards etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is really top. When the main villain dies, the protagonist throws ten heights above the panelsized Stoneface Jack or the roof of a house, leaving the building outside. That's out of the extrovert, just three stories are high and your regular city hall looks like many. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the sidekick can not walk because their right foot is injured. No one can say how: Ten minutes before he shot his shoulder and his legs were fine. There is no further explanation for the visitor's intimate mind, who would be interested in such trivial issues as "Where is the body of villain located near the building?" And "Why are the police or even the weird people involved in the round of body involved?" <br /> <br /> I could go to the list forever. Why does someone of the bad people claim to have developed martial arts when he kicks his ass at any time? Why do bad guys usually make aggressive movements when attacked? Why does the protagonist look so faggy? Is anyone really thinking "yes, these characters and this plot can remember this movie"? And suck the actors. Our hero and the Savior of the day wear the same expression in his face. Whole film Also, think that 12% of the film's rating has given me 10 out of fear of it. They could be serious and then we were destroyed.
