This is the most terrible movie I've had the misfortune of picking. Do not make mistakes, I like a good Jimmy Flick, but it was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... as well (from the beginning scenes, at least) TT was called external zombies' zombies. This is another movie or video game (as long as I can say). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best aspect of this picture is how the two main characters are so bloody Can be covered. And so remain unplussed. I definitely give it to you and after '28 days' or 'Do not live dead' (a rebuilding, of course, if you miss and stay safe with Jimmy Appa without any serious cam action).
