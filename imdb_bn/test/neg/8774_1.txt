I waited quite a while until I was able to see this Lone Ranger movie. I finally found it on the Lone Star channel and was very disappointed in the whole movie. Claire Moore and John Hart acted like Lon Rangers and J. Sylver Hills as Tonto, compared to two stars in the film. This movie was played very poorly by everyone. Even the plot was bad and many were fetching. I believe the best actors throughout this movie, portraying horses, silver. I am glad that I will not go out and this is the first time a copy of this movie comes out when I think it is a waste of good money. Clint played the role of Moore, John Hart and J. Silverware and took life on silver screen, so I'm really sorry. In the future, as long as they found eligible actors to portray characters, John and Joy played well in the past, I will not spend money to buy the film. I will not watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davis
