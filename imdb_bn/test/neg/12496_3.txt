Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who halts the death of a senator, even though he finds conspiracies and has a trace on his tail. By the way the tracker is billed over terminating Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheeseball action flick, certainly Robocop and the film had some imagination and real power, it's just a real-life kickboxing champion running away from a robot. The movie is not so awful that it is just empty and iterative. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set up to cut by various gunfire. Don Wilson, naturally, is terrible in the main role. <br /> <br /> * 4/1 Out 1- (Poor)
