My Tech: Steven Sighal is certainly very annoying for an action thriller, even a completely neutral. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Sigal? Do not you Do not worry, there is not much to catch. After acting on admissible crowd-pleasing movies like CJ and Executive Decisions, Seagal's bad movie hits the troubled lowest ground. Now, he grows up in low-budget B-level action vehicles, of which there are some "Week of the Week" entry-to-TV that has lost the way to big screen. In this half dead past, we will say, the dead action movie. A loud and lousy action film, sloppily guided and written lazy (and worse, played badly). This is one of the worst movies I do not need to see until it gets worse. My mind was not bad at the time of my brain losing my time with me. It's a bad movie that you realize that the other movies you hate are not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Plot (and locale) has been completely taken from the same image, Michael the Rock of the Rock, although it can not describe the similar word. Both movies are not meant to be taken in summer movies, and so taken seriously. But comparatively, even the rock (which is not much of the lights and words in the writing section) has good character, more attractive plot, better order sequence and overall, more entertaining environment. Although there are half past action scenes of death, none of them are exciting. Which is sometimes tedious and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability in summer action movies seemed to be a welcoming resource, predictability has never yielded much more unrefined taste, and half the dead is really fun, many times it is just a headache (throughout this film Repeated repeat music repeatedly and encourages me every second for appraisal ). Actually the medium, the plot derivative, whatever compelling or interesting character is. There is nothing to be excited about Seagal's character, a secret agent, a criminal mastermind (Maurice Chestnut), sending Alcrase to stop a very annoying villain. Sigal's character is also a sidekick (played by rap star J Rule) and amigo is also provided with a bunch of prisoners and no chemistry is going on here. <br /> <br /> If one played another series of forgotten action vehicles (what were those pictures again?) for better Seagal's career killed, half past dead death is overkill. And the audience will be warned: you are invited to feel pain. Tip: Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 0
