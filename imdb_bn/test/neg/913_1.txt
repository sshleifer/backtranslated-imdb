People, get a formula! I mean, there is no one of the writers, so I want to expect you ... this show is a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at! And the sixth show is one with cheap cheap impact, and B & W Fer Chrissakes are! Nevertheless, the mood of the old show and the writing before the MILES is more than this drill. Get Hype kids! If 98 degrees or Brittany ask you to see it, you will! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends with 'view' in 'before' it became very quiet!
