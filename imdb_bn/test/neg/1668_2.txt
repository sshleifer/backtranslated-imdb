I was well known ... these indications are IMDb.com. This flick was written and directed by the same person who has no track record. A bunch of unknown to throw is Joe Estevez potentially bad exception who specialize in the movie. I do not see any reason for wanting to see this terrible, amateur effort of someone else making pictures. Turn on a broadcast channel at 3am and you will see a better movie. Naph said.
