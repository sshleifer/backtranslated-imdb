I've seen this movie so you do not have to! For Kris Kristofferson I have great respect, but what was he thinking? Is he doing this for scale? At the same time, the title of the movie is practiced in the advertisement, because humans and objects regularly disappear throughout the film, add confusion. In his commentary, Kristoferson mentioned that Genevieve Buzold's character did not really exist, but he was not sure. It is not well-suited for the viewer to be able to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "created" feature was much more interesting than the movie. Despite shooting the film, it combined the problem of collecting funds for Indy. <br /> <br /> For its achievement, this movie is visually pleasing and not like a movie created by any means. Very bad money was not spent on a good project.
