This movie is my time wasted. I saw only part of it and I was crying about the waste time that I could spend something productive and useful on this earth. For those who have seen this movie more than once, I blame for global warming, because this part of this nut was not required for the amount of black balloons entering the earth and if they come from a different movie, I forgive them. Robin Williams redefined his film for more than 10 seconds in this movie and Tim Robbins, how did he go to release this movie to the Shawwares, I have no idea. Do not watch this movie for the safety of the Earth. Stop publishing a black balloon from a film that never gets funded or released. Burn all copies before someone else has to see this shit.
