Showcasing a new wrestle never paves the way for the most fantastic wrestler, Giant Zeus. Unable to draw WWF Champion Rip to the Square Circle to face against Zeus for the Network President Braille drowned in the battle for the drowning forces. But Zeus can not face any rival rival. <br /> <br /> I usually give Hogan a bit of a wrestler to overcome the role of the movie, but this picture did not ask Hulkter to do too much. A stretch, it simply Hogan asked to play himself, which he sadly failed. 'Little Leicester' has worked well as brave Zeus, but his work is even acting in the film, there is something left to act in. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you want, a grain of salt and a comedic Feelings, otherwise you probably have to close it in ten minutes.
