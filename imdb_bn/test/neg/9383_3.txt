When John Savankazar lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You are in dark, lost movies like "Alice" and "Little Oatik", or small gems such as "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwauki". These are all excellent movies that represent the best incompatibilities, great movies. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when you try to give any kind of political statement to your spouse, you are advised that a room in a room. Cinematic films of these veins can be both teenage girls and preachers, to demonstrate their inscrutable insight, to present stroke-man character in repetitive fashion. <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately," unfortunately, this next type of movie. Cartoonish ideas and letters are stretched thin to paper for a sad hour. There is interest in a few moments, but these oases are separated by boredom's broad desert. <br /> <br /> If you are a savvy, tropical little movie "At Sitter" that is bright and funny, you probably love "lunacy." If you have never seen a movie before, then start elsewhere.
