Perhaps I've missed something, but I found Govts of Goa to be a tedious costume melodrama. Trying to tell the story, I saw a misleading mascara that has gone from all directions. And perhaps it is not compatible with the appropriate languages ​​by the Spanish director, but the appropriate version should be subtitle rather than English. I can not judge the historical authenticity of the story, but it continues to be like a paralyzing girl with a similar "tragic fate of the artist's model" plot line. What is film justice, religious lies, torture and torture now, or what ??? I could not be able to think that one. Natalie Portman's various characters seem to be ridiculously stereotypical. And finally, this movie was wearing a unfinished bermaid head and a crown with the Mukundram hanging on the edge of the cart running towards the sunset of the body ?? As well as the picture with INS and Goa, ?????? Mills decree can not do better than that?
