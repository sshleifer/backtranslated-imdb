I was somewhat optimistic about the movie, I saw that I got out of the rubbish after seeing the garbage (going to the night). The actors, especially Trivola, have to be ashamed of themselves for their participation. Obviously their mind was the only paycheck, do not remember their talent and our debabement. To do Trivalta again to go further, see "Talking to the movie" again, because she has returned to her pre-tarantino job level. There is something better than the LW documenting seagulls. Travolta is no longer cool king but king of corn is also. Michael Caine admitted filling up the bad movie for himself pay check, the case should be followed if Trvolta has respect to his self!
