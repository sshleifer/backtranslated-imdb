Jeff Fahey cautioned such a cautious and seems like a smudgy, shocking smile that every character he plays is villainous; Therefore, it does not really work to throw him as a good guy in the piece, the audience is cracking his character and waiting for people to start running away. Drew Barrym, who played his acclaimed role as "Pius Ivy", must have played the role of director Paddy Papamichael (he was "Ivy" cinematographer); Daisy Drew (!) Stopped playing directly after playing a character, which does not have any to see us, but Jeff Faye and Shan Young (who has not left the camera only "blade runner"). This intelligent script of Michael Engel involves the concern of a police sketch artist, who draws his wife's face from the testimony of a murderer, and it is not a bad idea for a plot, but it is more suitable for an hour-long TV series. This cable made short of movie inspiration (starting with casting) and surprisingly short. * ****
