I can really take this cart's baby so Ralph can retire happily from Macchio Series, and is very good to play the role of Hillary Swin .... The film's plot is just awesome. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old friend dies from World War II, his widow leaves her father to care for the rebel lady when her father dies in an accident. She has no discipline, yet it is coming out to get the hero because of local rote ... which I will explain in a minute. You know the drill ... Miyagi takes her under her wing and eventually they beat the bad guy and everybody lives happily. Its <br /> <br />, its Chess, its 90's .... but it's even long and it's not short. My first case is "huh?" Why is there a "military department" in high school? I thought that the thing was gone in the 1960s, especially in a public school. Does Michael Aranside take prey to her role as Chief Hill, since the military is involved in a high school? Suddenly I saw that militants' bogies are scared to come out of the scene during such a scene ... why? The thing that I noticed across all 4 films is that the heels suddenly turn that they keep the main character through all the characters (delivery in the middle part, part 2 in Cato, 3 parts in Cress). This movie is no different. Ned and Cronis originally stripped Eric's car after hijacking senior promotions, and Hillary swimmers threaten the whole movie ... Irananside tells them to beat them and they are like "um ... no" if you're going to turn toward the sad face Stay, at least make sure that the characters do not do too much at the top, like blowing a hot stick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... drunk but melody Yamyatika nothing, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage. Ralph McKee pulled the first 3 movies. <br /> <br /> I'll tell my movie after watching the first movie. , I can take it off at least a spin ... but I can not take full military things, it's very great to take seriously. Now if Iranaside and the crew were a wrestling / football team and he was coach, it could have been more credible. <br /> <br /> Provides erosense and morality products, the gold is okay ... the rest of the same, as a bright, when they blow hot stick, that was 10 out of 4 cold
