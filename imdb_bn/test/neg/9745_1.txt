I am not worried about what someone else is saying, this film is the worst part of the film's artificial trash. John Lindis thinks <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but come on! Even kids hate this movie. It's point and annoying. Tom Arnold again revealed that his only talent wasted production costs. <br /> <br /> The only reason I think Stupid does not appear in 100 bad films all the time is that only 20 or more people accept this junk observer. At least Hogoblins has created MST3.
