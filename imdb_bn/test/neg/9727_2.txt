I think this movie is very generous in 2 of 10. Okay, special effects are 'OK' and Ronnie Harleen has created my favorite genetically-modified-shark-attack-a-research-station film, which you can know as a deep blue sea. Also, opening credits are fairly well done with a remix of "more human" in White Zombie, and it can play fairly well with whatever is in the context of this movie. However, the reason for this film is appreciated, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh and for some reason, all 17 of these descendants go to the same school, all swimming parties and all, for some reason or for others, sitting in bed with their shirts, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. I have nothing against Gay, Gothic or Thirteen boys, but what is the purpose of this movie? At ... 13 year old Goth who questions their sexuality. Yes there are girls who sit on their beds or whatever their beds, but how do they stop their shirts? However, the characters of this movie are said to be able to climb at the age of 18 and give new deep, almost God-like powers. But before I go before, I have forgotten to mention that when they use their power, they are gradually getting older and they add more to it. For 17-year-old players, they explain why they got late in the 20's. Oh and if you need to explain something, do not worry, someone will explain it all in a huge part of the dialogue. God sucks this movie ... Where I was? Oh yes, the part of the ascension <br /> <br /> Well, apparently there was a super secret alpha family that forgot about others or some # #, I do not know, I was dozing off at this time. But how they wrote that how the school and the new child are friendly, it is secretly one of the 'fifth family' descendants. And I say 'secret' because anyone who has seen the preview of this movie knows that this new man is a bad guy. It's bigger than that because he's older. However, Bob Lobla (say aloud) is happening and we can get the final war in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had all the games for a witch war. You know, because of knowing about these witches and elements, because you know something along the lines of Gandalf or Saurmon versus the astronomy battle. Now, when these two dikes are thrown down, much more ... how can I keep it ... a very, very rotten version of a Dragon Z-type war. They throw each other stuff, speak, throw, talk, throw, talk, etc. When I say 'string strike', then I say, because I do not have any question that F #% is throwing each other. It looks like a big gob of thin water. God sucks this movie, however, when our chief witch 'ascends' he is not very powerful. He threw big gobs just thin water. The facts happen and it ends in such a way that as a visitor you know how to end it. Good witch wins bad witch <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Yes, I acknowledge, thinking about the robbery of war, using the power of the modern day quietly cool the word, but while executing this bad, I did not really want to make this movie. Perhaps it is R-rated, sharp and runs out of death by gore dash but it can work ... maybe it can work. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing it, then do not buy it or even rent it. Wait for it to arrive on TV or borrow it from a friend of your friend who bought it. Do not waste your time with this hack just a movie. If you spend any money on it, then you have a good chance to make a try for a vacuum made by U Bowl, Agreement 2: Alone in the dark room in the dark
