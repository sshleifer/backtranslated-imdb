*** Small Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I must admit to having a soft spot for Owen Crowford. I know very little about him, but his talents have the crowd encouraged to meet his lack. In his film, he usually performs multi-action - allow a lead male, director, producer and script writer - 3 - tackle story lines from sub-basements. Despite this, the last product is generally enjoyable for non-conscience. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Bello' shows Crowford as a down-on-fortune captain of the rainbow boat, there are some bugs 'and there is no' - but it ends here, though it is combined in movies. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a water scene, in which two diveras before exploring a debris, before being attacked by invisible creatures - somewhat like the 'Gauge 2' start. The debris has become a 'El Diablo', which has passed centuries ago. The billionaire of the ship stolen was manned by traffickers to run from Spain with a freight vessel. It allows the introduction of links to natural forces of light with both Lucifer and the Armageddon. The title of the film refers to this dreaded devil ship instead of a brutal sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever the error film has (and there are many) fun to see it and create skills. You can not help but like a movie that, in the last 5 minutes, the famous beach scene in 'From Your Toe' and copies the final line from Casablanca.
