As a professional poker dealer for more than 25 years, I am very hard to see this movie. Very irrational It seems that the producers of this movie have not worked or did not take care of little or no research. Card tricks are something you will not see playing in a real poker game. Is common sense correct? Plus it was as time to spread the film and cut it. Who could not do this? There was cheating amateur stuff. Palming, identifying cards, etc. Will you play a high limit where they use the open deck card? You sit in a game where players will push their chips (slowly) in the middle of a bowl, then what exactly will they bet on mixing them? Simon! I have given it a 4 because twists and turns can be interesting to some people but those who know about the game will find it quite painful. Later they will have to use real players and get some insights on how to do it properly. SHAKE !!!
