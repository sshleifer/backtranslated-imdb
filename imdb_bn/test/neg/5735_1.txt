sdiner82 For decades, the film has not been clearly seen, and its memory is scary. His attempt to draw Mark Lester Shaving's scene as a suspect is completely wrong, such as the bad guy "his wrong remarks about peeks sneaking kids body". Lustar is sitting in the house for a full time and the man gave him a glance. <br /> <br /> This scene is a worthless effort to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the human body. <Br / <br /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, but it's nothing else. <br /> <br /> Sdiner82's comments about the character of Sawalas, who "spoiled their family in Germany, sent their trailer to their death." The Khilafat is meaningless (it was a single woman, she had already died, and she was a car) . <br /> <br /> I recommend that the review of sdiner82 is far away from its own, liberal mentality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is an undisclosed part of 70 trash, but it is the worst slander in the review of sdiner82. He wraps up his review in the pseudo-intellectual "events", but the only reality he talks about almost every "factual" matter is he wrong. <br /> <br /> I saw only sdiner82 exactly what he saw exactly what he looked for, which is boring. Now he can go back to the burning burner copies of the verdict.
