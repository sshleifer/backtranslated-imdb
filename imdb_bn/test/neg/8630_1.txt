Man, what a terrible film. With many terrible movies, its horror structure is in the script. This is a kind of heartwarming effort of a psychological thriller that gives it a bad name to the whole genre. Okay, here's a main problem: The character of Sandra Bullock is abducted by Jeff Bridges in a wide-ranging convenience store in his car. Somehow, his boyfriend Keef's Sacharland is not found to be the sole witness of this law, and later most of the films spend their time completely whimsical. Come on! Personally, I am even dimmest of audience members to this completely insulting. Yet we are forced to buy in this dirty. The same frustration is a poor interpretation of Jeff Bridges's work. His character is a bit of a wonderful academy, to be sure, but far from the socialism who will do this. He has performed his cruel action, why he goes through about ten minutes to give or give spilling, spinning his beans to Sutherland. But the explanation lacks the most basic concept of logic itself. Therefore, no intelligent audience member can really believe in his evil prospects. And if you reduce that element from the story, the whole thing is different. <br /> <br /> The main concern: -Wefe bridges use any strange, pseudo-French accent for no reason. <br /> <br /> - The whole annoying sub-plot involves Nancy Travis, especially by removing the bridges to the table and saving the day. <br /> <br /> The name of the character Sandra Bullock, Dean Chevr, easily scratches again to make the word "invisible". Are you friggin 'doing me fun ?? - In 40 minutes (man's bridge is specially added) A person's logical impossibility of drugs, kidnapping, and vomiting (very remote place) <br /> <br /> It is a movie which made me remember the character of Donald Kaufman in the myths of fantasy, impossible fools (still very successful). Many screenshots are bright, inspired artists. Some Boose only satisfy nitatives for running the studios to run their vineyards. This special script has fallen so surprisingly that Donald Kaufman will be able to sell himself. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graph actually did.
