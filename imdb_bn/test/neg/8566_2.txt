The only good thing in this movie is its final turn. In the 9 7 minute film we can save only a single concept, which is completely lost in this movie! For more than 90 minutes, this film is only a collection of clich√©s, bad acting, stupid ideas and expression, complete lack of mystery, stupid death, terrible special effects; All this is a kind and unoriginal plot ?? Until last three minutes, until finally, a good idea appeared! This is not an original or original idea, but at least there was a "decent" idea, the whole film was the only one! I will not waste it, but I must say that I think that a good plot, good FX and, of course, a good performance, that idea will turn into a good movie. What do you know if you can see this movie and eventually decide it?
