Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I do not know, because Snake Jamie Lynn Spears is its premiere or what, but I just know that the list is heard. It is a girl and her brother who goes to a boarding school. Jokes are very neutral and weird in this show, and I hate every single character except Chase and Lola. Hack, the jokes of this show are so weird that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is right with Avatar and Danny Phantom in a disgraceful hole, without a doubt, among the worst shows of Nicholodio, and if the show was a person with respect then he would be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> 1/10
