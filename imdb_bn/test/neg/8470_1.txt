Forget about what I said about Emeril. Rachel Ray is the most worried person on food network and television. If you have never seen 30 minutes of food, then you probably do not understand how uncomfortably annoying he is. I really really mean that you can even start to be boggled by even until you've watched the show even once or twice, and even thinking of all the words and knowing you will fail. The problem is mostly with its approach as you may have guessed. Ray has a secret face and often imitates parrot. Just tell it if you love something or think it's "awesome" (the word that uses almost 87 times on television). And he is constantly using "Evo" (extra virgin olive oil!) Using horrible, irrational caffease. shut up! What is worse than the rail network! I think terrorists are making a big conspiracy to drive us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray lam
