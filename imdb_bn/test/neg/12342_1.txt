This is the worst movie of my life. Until you get into masochism, do not see it. It was an overwhelming, top-notch, eye-harmful, depressed movie and was top of my list of bad movies forever. Anyone who wrote this movie wrote a sadist. I cried almost to the end, that it was so bad. I want to give it a null big, but since it is not an option, so I'm one of it.
