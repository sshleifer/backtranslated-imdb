Before I start, let me get some chest on my chest: I'm John Eyre's first film project: A huge fan of Shadow Chase. A B-grade cross of film timinator and die hard can not be the work of a cinematic genius, but it is a very entertaining action film that has become a godly hit (and two episodes and a spin off). <<br /> <br /> Judge and jury begins with Joseph Maker, a convicted murderer who was sent to Death Row after his capture after the so-called "bloody shootout" (which seems to be a bad name for the killings?). Three were killed while trying to loot a convenience store), led the electric chair. Marker talks to the priest about living for sex but meets a real love (who was killed during the shootout), a funny scene that killed him, protesting against his revenge? Michael Silvano, a washed football star, who saw his son Alex playing football with his high school team and ended up disappointing his son's coach. But once the execution was executed, the maker returned as a Reventant (or Kelly Perry is called "Hamburger without fries"), whose sole motive is to take revenge, which basically makes the life of silting sad. <br /> <br /> The judge and the jury point me not to be a real horror movie. This is a supernatural action film, through which the maker uses the ability to change the Chilling Silvano form (the amount of everything that David Keith is, which is Elvis's incognito, French chef (with his mosquito pronoun), drag queen, a shoe and a stand-up comedian) , A shotgun that has explosive rounds and an infringement of death (though Mart√≠n Kovic in the desert eagle Does not prevent Keith from shooting), returning Silvano to kill Micker's wife. <br/> <br /> While director John Irres does not seem interested in the role, the movie is focused on a lot of action scenes instead. But it's the main drawback of the film, because there is nothing to add action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly well, Keith provides the best performance, alongside Cov, Paul Koslon, who played the police to wash very well. Kelly Perine is boring as a cab trying to help, but makes the situation worse.
