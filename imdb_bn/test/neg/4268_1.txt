Keep away from this one. The worst thing is the scary stories. It seems to be an intention to reveal some subtle spiritual / love / friendship messages, but it is ineffective in terms of any substance that you can not help but cringe. In addition, most common stories related to most of the thieves, criminals and some strik artifacts of our hero (Spanish) during the screen I know you are asking for trouble while dealing with time, but the story is full of holes than usual. You also have: some of the worst musical arrangements in cheap sets, bad acting and moving pictures, excessive power, cheap, casual and controversial history. What I can say is, "People are alive! This movie is bad!"
