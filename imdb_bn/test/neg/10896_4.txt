In the X-file, under the direction of writer John Shinin, there is something going on in this movie which I have enjoyed. You do not think everything is going on in the film, but I do not think so, but I think the film fails to provide you enough to really take care of it. It's about perception. In the film, the heroine Nicole (Jaimi Alexander) has joined the film that she got up and disappeared. It may seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only draws attention to the filmmakers' part. We feel weird about whether we should believe Nicole is not watching or they seem to have fun with us. It does not get a correct answer and I was once a divers to the point. A movie comes at a time when ambiguity can only be frustrating because the viewer is directed towards a wild cannabis that ends at the end of the death, which is a little explained by what we have seen. In the end it seems like a tedious exercise rather than an exciting exercise. Soul drama Now there is nothing wrong with ambiguity, but let us give it a bit or you will avoid us. I saw how I felt "rest stop." This image is a young girl named Nicole, who has grown to Hollywood, and decided to go to California with lover Jesse (Joey Mendisino). They seem to be a little slippery at the rest stop, so Nicole can urinate, but when her Jesse is completely absent, it comes to terror for him. Some people in a crusty, dusty yellow truck seem to be having problems with Nicol, and soon we realize that he is frustrated at the disappearance of Jesse, when you have the signs that you want him to, he will have a way to find a way out of a very difficult situation. To do Nicol has kept himself away from any existing city and limited organization with self-defense against such patience that proves how bad he is. <br /> <br /> This is an easy part. When a female character starts playing, the film really gives a rare leap from the argument because she is sure where she came from, how she came there, and more important, where she once went, Nikol tried to free her from her supposed imprisonment. In the utility cabinet of the restroom. He is a police officer (Joey Lawrence) from another area, who may feel like his savior, but when he is on a truck driver, surprising things happen again, if the questions can really start. Truck driver tortures Nikolay (as he enters the house and that wire lock surrounds him gets a nasty bite). Then he left the shower to leave the sanctuary without a permanent place to set fire to the rest. <br /> <br /> It is shocking to me that during the truck driver's attack. Perhaps he just likes to suffer them, but Nikola is well-off in certain circumstances during his escape or preparation. It does not make much sense, its motives, which drives the film as an irrational idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow him to prepare? It seems, I'm going to an area here, there is a strong belief that they can only find out the way to their shelter when it comes with its next deadly attack. Still, why Nicole's experience decides to play with the audience with a huge meeting with such people? Is Shivan and the writer trying to say? And, a family of an RV caps off the unhinged curiosity of the film. They play a small part in the planning of things like religious diversity themselves, but visitors do not work enough to explain why the film should be in the film.
