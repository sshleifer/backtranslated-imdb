A failed attempt This is a common disaster film sponsored by: We are involved in some people involved in the big event. However, this script is so awful and so much about the background of characters in the conversation that we think we're behaving like dead. How did Sesame Street not even explain the death of Mr. Sphulipagas or Mr. Hooper: We can do it. Some thought that when Enron entered the script, it would give the currency in the power company's discussion. The performance is big and bigger than the older actors (Randy Quayed, Brian Denhey), and after the first hour, I do not care less about taking the storm. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is a special effect. Sorry, no. Can I even make a tractor and trailer computer even on the 20-year TV set ?? Maybe there are budget limitations, so I can forgive that one. A plane's view was very real to try to land, but I told myself that I had seen it before. This site confirmed: This is an earlier movie, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> So in summary, only good bits from another movie and when you see the best action sequences in 30-second compressed, second network promotion, it looks very good in section 6. My suggestion: Depending on some good 30-second clips on your network, show them, and save yourself two nights.
