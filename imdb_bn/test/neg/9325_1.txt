One of the worst movies I've ever seen! "Startup" was better than this one but not better. This is not a good way to move to the original movie. It's just awful! CGI Hinas was so fake when watching both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed this in the old syntax movie better than I was royally disappointed! What I can say about this waste of film is cinematography and cloth which has been well-crafted in that era. I understand why this movie has been renewed as "getting started". That's right, in my opinion. Where does the money come from? Give me one billion budget, and I'll show you how to do it!
