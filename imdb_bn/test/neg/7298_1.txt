This picture is far and away without any doubt, the single worst and most abusive movie in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> It's really bad. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the blight of a terrible movie, and for this rent it seems to be one of them. My extraordinary frustration, it was not. <br /> <br /> This script is distributed in such a way that it seems to be directly reading the playback lines, the story does not give any sense and the actual movie looks like it is shot in a home video camera. I could not even finish watching it. This is worse than "Witch Academy", and it has several achievements in itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the director can shoot this film and even then I can not believe that it was suitable for release. <br /> <br /> painful, horror, terrible.
