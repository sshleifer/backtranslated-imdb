It is very sad that Schwarzenegger is good about this production, especially considering that he has not yet come into his own and his card is strong like a cardboard in delivery. <br /> <br /> Some critics say it is not bad, but it's not good. It's funny, and plays like a cousin in a poor country of Canaan, it's a conflictless, uncivilized, poor job. And not talking about the poor, the quality is terrible because, this is not the only reason why this film was taken in this age. <br /> <br /> The story here is less than the lawn line, but less than that, "Red Sonazah must be influenced by strong strong Schwarzenegger", and loses itself if he forgets his motive completely. <br /> <br /> This is an amusement, but less budget-prone - complementary "B" kind of way. <br /> <br /> it rates 4.2 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br />
