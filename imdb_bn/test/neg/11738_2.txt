This is the least idea for a movie. Shot-by-shot is a classic film remake. I hope someone tries this technique again. In 1998, Gass Van Sant, Hitler, "Good Will Hunting", tried it again by reviving the 1960s classic "Psycho" and unfortunately failed. Think of Van Sant? This rim does not even come close to the original topping. There was no help in the few changes that were made here. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is clear. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (Four out)
