Recently, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was shown this horoscope of about two and a half hours at 10:10 pm. After that there was a scheduled 1 am show, but if someone was waking up to watch, then I could see it till 3:30. The opening scene is a man walking in a man, and it lasts for four minutes during the movie. It's an embarrassing sign of what's coming: 144 times more beautiful. A man and a woman have a view against a wall standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times with very clear dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences abruptly stop with astounding status, such as the closeness of women genetics, shown for a full minute movie (the audience is laughing in the last 20 seconds, "What is the message?"). The story is similar to Dostoyevsky's novel "The Karamajav Bhai", where a slave loves a woman of simple morality. A rare event where the crowd was smiling (there was more to despair than trying to justify it two hours before seeing anything happen), British tourist's statement clearly did not see the Eurostar train traveling 180 miles per hour, the English system by translator From the metric system measurement unit was translated with a single automatic switch, "the train is about He could not clearly see it while traveling 300 kilometers per hour ". What was surprising about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that it has spent a lot of money. It was a 8mm test of any film in the kitchen. It was carefully designed, structured, played, montaged. Yet, I got it very little. Some comments have been complained as stimulating detail, such as open a door, opening a chin key chain minutae. OK, it was noted, but what was the purpose? Some mad people of the audience have gone away after the first hour. The rest came out of curiosity: at the end something must happen. Not there. And maybe that's what the film is about. All theaters in the theater are action-packed. This one wants to be different. Nothing is happening.
