And it's just boring to fix this show. <br /> <br /> Four men sit at the chair and look at the other two and try to take women to have sex with them.

This is not true and you should be ashamed to think about yourself. <br /> <br /> And if I like it for those who say it, or I'll be jealous. Go to the screw yourself, because of her obvious that a real girl must not be.
