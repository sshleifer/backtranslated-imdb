Yes I bought the blood of the camp and this painful daytime of my life and about 5 pounds of money has been lost, that means I do not expect an extraordinary movie, I'm actually judging by the front cover, I'm not really expecting a great at least in the first 3 seconds do boobies (I'm not complaining about boobies ..) Am I complaining of something that's going to do with that? This image should have been kept in the cameras in the copper .... They sucked ... Why was the blood bloody and hard like blood? ... I said cheap colors they were just yellow color, and another thing that laughing at me on this sad excuse for a movie, it was that they tried to protest in the jungle, always a woman, though it was clearly a flat chest Black-haired people in black If someone else noticed that the only special effect of this movie was a decreasing jump .. It is also poor and the dissipated effect that you can find on many basic PC programs such as PowerPoint ... Hit the film
