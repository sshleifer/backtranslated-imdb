Seeing its cover before I saw it, I did not expect much, especially in Blockbuster (as well as films like Junior) among other unpleasant horror movies. <br /> <br /> It's not just that the movie has brainless stereotyptic characters (rich dunk bags, bitch, Sheriffs, locals who know what's wrong in the town, and so on), but such a God-awful Dialogue, acting, direction and CG effect. Jeremiah Stone Dude was delightful. (* Spirir *) I can not understand why she stopped her finger somewhere while holding the chick up. <br /> <br /> The basic foundation of this movie is just as unreasonable as the other errors. What can I gain from this, Jeremiah Gold digs a gold at Gold Rush and is an infamous criminal He had a gold, (* Spliler *) and cursed the person who received his gold, before killing the local girls before killing some girl, but he did not live, he closed his finger and ran off. So, today, a group of unknown miracles about this gold mine is found, and of course, they warn about the "curse of fifty-ninar" by the locals. And what do they do? As expected, ignoring the warning and seeking for greedy gold. They get gold, and all kinds of ** go. Thankfully, (* spliler *) anxiety can cut his head. <br /> <br /> About it. You can tell what kind of movie you are going to be looking at the cover of the film. It's just terribly awesome to have it fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 of 5 out.
