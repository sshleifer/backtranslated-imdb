I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this one is just a kind effort. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be in need of solidarity and survival. This movie discusses one more topic, "Let's Make It Glorious". <br /> <br /> The film was full of bad roles and more bad effects. When the bodies come from the floor and the man goes down, the blood just spreads out of the hole. I did not know that the hole in the plane's floor was so elaborate. And the original Jimmy lady, Kelly or something, when she woke up and started feeling sick, I saw the worst performances. I was quite hard when I died. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused why Dr. Kelly could talk after Jumbo, but then there was nothing to say about the other zombie, because the annoying screams and the roots. And they told them to kill lethal lethal killings by shooting them in the stomach, but when Benit is expelled from the airplane and in the engine, when he removes most of his part, he can still survive till the end. </ br> <br /> I felt that they made some changes to create a "good" scene. One of the rebellious friends (I did not take time to know their names. They played a vague role) in the bathroom, they were attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Is it a two-minute mirror to see the miles-high clabbers? I have ever broken a mirror of the plane (no bad luck and everything), but I suspect there are many rooms behind it, actually the bathroom's limited space and all. <br /> <br /> A few passage attributes were very sorry, it was too late. This was one of the things smoking movie flight attendants, but they felt the need to kill each other. And I will admit that when I kissed the very scary lady Frank's arm, she was very disappointed and she said, "She is pushing me to death" or something of this degree. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sorry. This movie is not my $ Dollar Dollar. I bought it that bought a low age but still ... it failed at many levels. Dawn of the dead and stay stuck after 28 days.
