I was given so down by this film. The tag line was something like 'A girl's sex realization' story. You can just imagine how frustrated I am. At that time I was seventeen years old and saw my girlfriend. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie, which would leave my girlfriend gagging. Sad that the case was not there. I guess we were not only prepared for a deep and meaningful film, for which an element of sophistication was needed which we did not have then. I am not sure now that I am entitled to it, and I have been in the company for a long time since the partnership with that special girlfriend (gracious really ... my first love). We left the movie halfway through the movie, my friend, who knows well, lived for the whole thing. I still got the necessary results with my girlfriend, the film just did a lot of help. It will be interesting to see again so that I can make more informed criticism, although I think the experience has made me mad for life.
