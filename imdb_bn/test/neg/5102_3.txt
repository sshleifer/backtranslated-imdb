This was one and only a very beautiful concert by MJ. Dances were nice and the costume was decent. The voice was right. I must admit that there was a shit on his vocal Human Nature and Billy Gene. You can not hear him half time. Made for other singing. Highlights of the show are: Smooth Criminal Jam I just can not love you. He's out of my life Thriller Billy Gene (without music or singing) Mirror Black or White Man Concert is almost perfect. It was someone who was 9 but it was 9. It must of course be seen. If I was born, I got the best concert ticket for 1992.
