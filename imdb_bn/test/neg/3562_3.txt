This movie tries to say something deep; I'm not sure exactly what was. To find the main points I have many pending finishes. Wondering what a couple scenes were really left on the floor of the cutting room. I do not think the wall has developed very well, I've never really found what's going on there. When the mother finally released it, I could not relate to the boy's silence. What is the boy saying? Was he just confusing or did he gain some power? What was the scene with the burnt girl? Is there another power boy? I do not understand any characters that improve or move the plot. I got a blame but what happened to dogs? Did the dog come back or the mother got rid of Fida? <br /> <br /> There were many additional plot elements that were even more confusing than they used to be. Discuss the Iraq war and choose a radio talk show in the background. I think that comparison should be compared to sadness and uncertainty, but Mother and Edison, but for me it was misunderstood. I do not buy link links too much. I'm getting the teacher Edison and there is nothing to say about "Roll Call". The doctor was vague to see the doctor, how did he plan? Can it show how frustrating the soil is, or what about some medicines I did not get? Did the father return to the last scene, or just some people? So the wall work was not written? What happened to dogs?
