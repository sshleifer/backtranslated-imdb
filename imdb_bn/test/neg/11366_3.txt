A large amount of wire-fu and the supposed Sholin monks have talked about pride about China's plot about the Kung Fu and the playful Japanese plot. All of this would not be so bad if not completely fake for Japanese sword fighting. If you have seen a samurai movie or two, you can say that the "Japanese" war in this movie works only in addition to "Kung Fu" (Actually circus acrobat) men doing the same thing as the Japanese sword. However, some funny moments such as a Japanese woman Nizama closed her clothes in mid-flight to suppress a beggar and catch him with fishing nets. According to the story, it seems that somewhat sizhophrenia should show Japan as a completely hateful or have an exception. The "Japanese" play is mainly shown as honorable, but not beyond illogical cruelty, as he killed an oppressed beggar so that he had a conflict. Very frustrating with the very stupid end. The concept of an epic war for a moment is not even similar.
