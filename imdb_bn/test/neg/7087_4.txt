I could definitely confirm this movie because it was a 1950s science-film-one of my favorite styles. Unfortunately, I look at the aliens or the power-crazy conveyor in the bug-eye, the film's aliens were frustrating! First of all, you only see one at the very beginning (and he looks quite normal) and you only got a small glimpse of a spaceship! Secondly, the alien was not a demon or a benevolent friend of mankind - but a real weird force. And finally, the plot itself is so stupid, preacher and heavy elephant that it has got more JavaScript than the thriller. <br /> <br /> Five people (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the United States) are kidnapped by an alien in five separate parts of the world as soon as the film begins. The tribe gives their every device through which they can choose all life on the planet, if they like - because the alien admits that its nation will love to live on the nation's nation but they will not be able to achieve it. Then, he returns them all. Although it is 100% obvious that no one wants to use these devices, the next person announces five identifiers on TV, announcing that the weapon is powerful! So, all the military forces in the world want to find five and force them to express how their weapons work. There are five hidden in the rest of the five films and one is being tortured to reveal how the device works - for example Soviet wants to use it !!! This part of the film seems very stupid. Of course, the USSR is a bad and corrupt nation (sorry, but this is true - especially under Stalin), as they did in the movie, they did not think of using it! Later, five (German scientist) one, these devices can be used in any way that can only be used to kill all EVILs who hate independence. So, he was able to remove all evil deeds and potentially those who were in freedom and all over the world, using it to make the world heaven! Preachy, stupid and full of plot holes - although this movie is not worth your time, it is an interesting resort to counter communalism - in particular, tensions between Nato and Soviet.
