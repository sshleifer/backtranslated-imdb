The plot of this film revolves around the submarine builder, who is a real crater and wants to launch his new sub-satellite, which can travel thousands of feet deep. Unfortunately, he could not. Oh yeah, and he was scared by the memories of his mother and the father was eating a baby when he was eaten by a megalodon. The man warmed up a number of scientists, and they and this crew killed their motherland by killing the same MegLodon in the main character's submarine. Now, the shark of this movie is actually a fake CGI shark. Originally it is frustrating, shark attack sorted as 3. I do not understand if I do not understand, listen. The opening credits of the film show the main character's "Home Movie" when he had a child with his parents before he died, and the background contained really sad and sad piano music. You will expect to see a shark or something, and you do. A short shadow of CGI shark floats around every few seconds but that's just it. Also, I do not remember a happy face expression throughout the runtime of the film, most of the films take place in the dark depths of ornaments, where the story gets further bent and all the letters (sharks) are eventually killed. I was thinking that Sabatoto would kill sharks and lead to save himself and the girl, but not everyone will die, and the film will end with sharks, all will appear, and the submarine (there will be a body full of savory and burned)) laziness in the lazy. If you are a happy person and you do not enjoy being depressed, avoid this movie. If you reverse, then congratulations, you found your movie.
