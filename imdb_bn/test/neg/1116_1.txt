Even with the low quality of a dedicated horror fan, I got this film to go terribly terrible. It was a huge disappointment as it featured as one of HarrahFest films. I hope the other seven were good. I was really embarrassed for the friends that I was willing to see it, and this same friend I saw the Wiki Man's remix. It has every cliché in the book. In fact, it went out the way to include them. Let's start with the letters. Instead of a sad girl, we got three: single, hot mom's two daughters ?? A blossoming is still a cute teenager and a cute yet cute little girl that's just going to have 'special' skills with the ability to communicate with 'supernatural knowledge' and dead. The little girl was the same, which was an amateur hare rimakake. He was a little annoying but almost did not accept Dakota Fanning as annoying. <br /> <br /> Overall, these characters looked like escape from Lifetime. I thought maybe the horror films were removed from a scene where the female character went to bed in full makeup, and in turn darkened their ears, declaring their presence, but this is not. I can not even think that none of them can be annoyed for deliberately opening the front door from day to night and night. To give an idea of ​​how disorganized I was with these characters, I spent most of my time cooling the set, because everyone was white in their house and their teeth were white. <BR> <br /> Despite all the formative plot machinations, there is no doubt that the film will end when it is over. There is more atmosphere of local giants in the middle of the weekend than the mid-afternoon meal. As a conversation, I could sample excerpts from ten other films and would be able to welcome good, more credible lectures together. Gore level, the eye candy for a horrible fan, was the lowest. Without their small arms, 'zombies' was not always annoying at all. You can kick some people in their house. <br /> <br /> how it actually kills. Horror movies, more than any other type, unknown strangers can not survive. Give me a horror movie, which is sunnyly obscure or unkempt. I can even bring newers to their crooked persecution. Every once in a while I'm truly a terrific one, nothing without this would be grateful.
