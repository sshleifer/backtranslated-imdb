Incredible Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot <br /> <br /> But there is a graphic error in this movie that is not exciting or thrilling, only purely boring Rumor. <br /> <br /> * Spiller * <br /> <br /> Everyone can see Fakk coming back in his habit. And that was Robert Englund acting (he was?) Like a donkey; Your daughter does not want to sleep with the football player, but she is trying to kill a donkey and kiddypr0n is okay? <br /> <br /> The girl's daughter was kidnapped - did anyone think he was a policeman or actor? I do not This movie is dragged to the end and at the end, which we see in other horror movies: if the income is correct then the part can be made. Bad, really bad thing. Some inspiration can give creeps ...
