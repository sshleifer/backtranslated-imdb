Just once, I would like to see the work given to a decent artist, director and producer of the contease! OK! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I enjoy the novels of Choice, but they never give their attention, support and talents which they deserve. They have the same meaning in Quantz's work that they fill the barrels in the king's kingdom, Quantz will move quickly. But alas! Strong people who do not believe in his work, I'm afraid that he will never get a chance. <br /> <br /> As the adaptation of the novel, this movie was a total suction festival. As a single film, it was not so bad, although it was very weak with many weak plots and terrible, harsh, irrelevant dialogue, which could never end it. This movie failed to live with its potential. They followed Quintz's original work, a little more closely, and invested enough money in production quantities, it could be a very good endeavor. <br /> <br /> However, I can see it, how good it might be, and it was not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
