Well, no one can really think of how great this movie is, so beyond me ... I do not even know how to find this movie remotely funny, this is the only character for it, this is the Super Supper Nerd Game Designer, And that something gets old after. This movie is so predictable, the Panchamals are not funny that they are forced, you see good acting in the red light district, and the story seems to be expected, you know exactly what's going to happen. Even the characters do not react like them, try to go to the hot dog of your boss and tell him that you saved 2 crazy girls at the same time, there will be no response to it (laughter)) "OK let's come back". I did not smile during this movie, and I did not see it or spent 3 dollars to rent it because it is not worth it. Adam Sandler created this movie, I lost all respect for him. All his movies are the same, his comedy style was old since Waterbull got out, if I knew Adam Sandler made it before I created it ... I could not waste my time for it. This movie is so bad as it might get from every aspect ... Ace ventura was not a smart comedy film, it was not a killer plot ... but it was original and it was lovely. I'm not spoiling the movie because it has 'low level' comics, I'm wasting it because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood shit. If this film is presented to a production company and does not have "Adam Sandler" behind it, it will be thrown into a rubbish in a condom use. If you want a good movie about Cheat and Chong, or Whitecastle Clock Watch Pat Culture Watch. If you rent this movie, you will get a generic comedy that targets the ages of 14-17 years, with every possible exposure to Rock Music, your performances leak your eyes and your stomach and comedy that is equal to what you see. One hour of eating McDonald's throwing stones. Do not do it .... For love of God ... this movie sucks, use it for it and find the glory of all the Hollywood behind it ... New York's Hercules is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really bad So it's good. Instead it was a very expensive movie that was sucked even more, if not more.
