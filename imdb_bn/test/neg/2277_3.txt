Annoying, fully anticipated soap opera Mary Tyler is married to Mordred with Ted Danson, who is related to Christine Lahti. Moore does not know about friend and cheating with Claes. Donson died in an accident and Lati was pregnant with her baby. to yawn! <br /> <br /> I was ashamed to pay for seeing it in a theater in 1986. I like all the three stars but even their notable talent can not pull it. I probably knew what was going to happen. Similar to another poster - it's dramatic like a PG-retified Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The clerk accepts nonstop at one moment and even Moore gives up once! There is also a vain shot of reckless women playing football (!!!). It's TV-friendly except for others. The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs Moore and Donson's teenage son. Very handsome and pretty good actors. Besides that there is nothing to recommend this as well. You saw it before ... and did well. It definitely forgot. leave it.
