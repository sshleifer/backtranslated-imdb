I love slave boots. I hope for something similar with lines - a realistic fight film, both sides of the hard and civilian people are depicted with the joy and pain of the war. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, StalinGrade seems to be written by a third grade and operated by a fifth-grade student. The main pieces of the movie are missing, it is completely cut off. The dialogue is ridiculous in the translation, but there is no good in local tongue; To understand how bad this movie is, only the bad moments of dialogue will be seen during the actors' faces.
