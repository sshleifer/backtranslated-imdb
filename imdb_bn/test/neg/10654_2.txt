This movie is terrible, it was so hard to believe that KT has become a heart-shaped teenager with the power to forgive the people of China, who did not make any strong arguments to prove the film. And the rest of the plot did not make any effort to show us more than the cheapest sense ... <br /> <br /> This plot is ridiculous and we can find out the only thing from it that it can be seen as a proud person. Who has certainly inherited his arrogance from his mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Acting and scenes were ok, but the plot destroyed everything, with cheap clich√©s and tricky scenes, I did not expect to see this movie again in my life. Leave this one!
