Another multi-million dollar adaptation of Kongo Crichton's work. Like the Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Spear, etc., the film rape its true meaning and essays. I have to make this brief and point. The scenery is beautiful. Actors, the best they can do it best. This manuscript? Try to try one hour and half of the film on hundreds of pages. You get to finally get a mess but how precise a mess is and how to fall down somewhere in the Congo. There were some stupid moments, why the killer Gorilla decided to jump in LaVault? And Amy raised by people surrounded by humans, still can fear dozens of murderers apes around her? What is the key word wrapping? Which brought me this. If there was an annoying character in every movie, then I'm here a place. You can see Amie speak this innocent little woman up to a special backpack and her harness. Happy idea, but he gets annoying while listening to his lecture. Congo is disrespectful to watch, and not extraordinary, but certainly not a memorable film.
