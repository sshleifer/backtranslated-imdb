This movie contains a beautiful beautiful FX sequence of 1936 earthquake. You did not see it because the 30-minute viewers were "Janet McDonald's photo" in which the unnamed star hugged his way through countless songs, when the plots became completely stagnant. Very good FX Cross Time It's not good to have McDonald's songs, and the painful insertion of songs that show its only common talent. <br /> <br /> Two friends are given a second run through the machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Prepaid), a large machine for becoming a priest and a hoodlum. In the 30-minute mark, you've already heard the song 'San Francisco' three times. Entertainment in Thirties is usually a deposit of irritation. Due to the decade in Grand Hotel San Francisco, the Dinner in the 8th minute, Little Caesar, Stagecach, Western Front Al Quiet, Les Miserbel etc.
