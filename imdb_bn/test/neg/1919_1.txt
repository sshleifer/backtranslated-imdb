Where to start ... Hmmm ... how well can anyone imagine in the difficult, most irrelevant, incredible and camp-up performance? How about stereotypical "characters", the situation and location? Or an impressive, cloaking, completely harmful script? I could not see the original element of this movie which was original, was viewed or interesting. <br /> <br /> All of you remember Josh Hirtnet / Chris Klein / Lily Sobiski fans - enjoy their fifteen minutes together, people because they're not going to be more famous ...
