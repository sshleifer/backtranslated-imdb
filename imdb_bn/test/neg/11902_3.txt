This is a bad movie, because its central message is very annoying and the plot seems to be the result of merging several vague skippers. As a result, it often does not give any idea, and certainly it should not be a movie, or Mr. Houston should not be proud. However, if you are a fan of "pre-code" movies then the film is valuable, because it features a surprisingly lazy plot which is firmly telling what beautiful girls have done - even if they are not married and their partners too !! <br /> <br /> This movie starts as a social worker to help the soldiers to go to Europe for WWI in Miss Don. In this process, he met a sculwagh (Bruce Cabot), who finally convinces him to sleep with him. She became pregnant and then she goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does not want to return to her, she realizes that she is not worth it, but later she died during her childbirth. Although these controversial plot elements are used, they are always guided - often they wanted to tell the audience to the audience, but hoped that if they publish it properly or accurately, the audience's children are oddly (finally, the movies are not rated and the children are at this time Can appear in a movie). <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, this entire plot involving a complete baby and cabot is almost 1/4 and is not mentioned or mentioned again. It was such that they portrayed a movie piece and abandoned it - it was taken to another film. In this second phase of the film, Miss Don unexpectedly started working in a female prison (although we did not actually see him do anything). What we see is that a great deal of serious misuse and oppression, which is probably designed to be titled. And, as a result of all these violence, Miss Dunne went to a prison to clean the prison and become a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of blue, another type of film appeared and women went to prison reform business as well. Dune married a judge (Walter Houston), but he wants him very strictly. Now across the whole film, Dunne has been portrayed as a very good girl - although she had a unmarried sexual relationship with the cabot (it was less bogus than her). But now, the single Irene, a steady reformer and a good lady, started to sleep with a married man. He told him that he and his wife were married and were married only in marriage, but he never thought to investigate whether this is true, and with his assurance, he closed his clothes and they did business to the child! However, when she is pregnant with her boyfriend, she is accused of being a violent judge. He assured him innocent, but he was convicted and definitely he sounds a harmful - using internal information of people coming to his bench to collect his fate. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dune made a vain attempt to release him and wait for Houston until he is released. The image is over. <br /> <br /> So, there are three different movies and a wonderful 30 ideas that what a beautiful girl should be like. I became involved in a strong mind working girl who immediately became a stupid person in her personal relationship! It really makes all positive deterioration about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine someone who likes the film. The rights of a powerful woman can easily become disturbed by the weak and needy people, and the religious people can make her feel completely moral or at least morally! With a decent re-writing, it can be interesting as a good movie or at least appealing and well-crafted film, but it wanted to make it its mind, and it was another neutral picture of the previous code.
