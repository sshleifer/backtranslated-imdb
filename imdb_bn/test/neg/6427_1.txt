Wow, what a bad film. At least frightened, and barely understood. Plots are not hanging all together, and the acting is absolutely terrifying. What is that line from a famous critic? "He runs mental distances from A to B." It sums me up. The camp is not even good for the standard! I was not expecting the Oscars, but this? Oh, his friend is a ghost? <br/> <br /> <br /> This picture (and I am using that word very rarely) should be insulting to the public of the film, especially the stupid Molecule's IQ. If only someone is involved then know how to make stories together! It gets 1 in 10 because there is nothing less in it. On the bright side - at least it is not a full two hours long.
