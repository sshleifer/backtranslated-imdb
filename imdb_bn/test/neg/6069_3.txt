I was excited to see a music lover and this movie. Unfortunately, I was frustrated. I was ready to walk half way through the movie. I could not identify with any characters, which means I did not care what happened to them and lost interest in the story. On the right side, Ed Harris looks like Bitoveven, and the 9th symphony is always happy to hear, so that the film's part becomes portable. The bridges of the bridge also freed almost the whole film, but it can not last forever. They could do what actors could do with them, but the screenplay was not enough to make it even remotely interesting. The bit about "washed me" was completely garbage. I was surprised that how many actors did it (I could not tell the lines that were busy laughing.) However, so shame, it could have been so good.
