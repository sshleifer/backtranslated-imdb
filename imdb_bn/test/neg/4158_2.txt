There is nothing worse than science fiction that does not feel for it. Based on an idea that will not be so terrible by yourself (a future where cloning is fairly common that you need to genetically create a crime to reproduce it to you). The scriptwriter will allow his illness. <br /> <br /> When Team Robbins's character can guess the security password of a security computer, by only telling him something about himself, I knew that I was in trouble. This power was later released, with Robinson's "sympathetic virus", viruses were used to upgrade their users' immediate (or almost instant) efficiency. Robbins' love interest has been related to his own viral related experience - a Mandarin Chinese language virus, which lets him speak Chinese, but complains that "he does not understand what he is saying." Okay, first off, sympathy, how severe it is, not ESP. Without realizing the true mind-reading approach (such as the sympathetic virus actively releases viruses around, infecting nearby people, selecting their memory bits, then releasing them for the original host - which you might say, an inauspicious smidwood) " Listen to what you did not say "with just a password-specific statement Nati will not be able to determine. In addition to understanding what you are saying, you can not speak a language - the virus can not infect your voices and can not translate to the fly for you, because a virus can not * think. To give the ability to speak Chinese, this kind of learning virus will have to correct your brain. It must encode knowledge into neurons, and once it is there, it * your * - you understand what you understand, because you have to. To use your own brain to perform a task, you will understand that task (most part). Of course, the film indicates that the virus is deliberately designed to create some malicious multi-personality mental conflicts where some sub-persons work as your built-in and single translator. <br /> <br> The matching of the spoken languages ​​by the characters is quite suitable, although some of the other lovers are not quite good enough for all the love given to them. What's more, all the multiculturalism in the world can not be created for a simple, frustrating truth: the conversation stinks! It is slowly plodding it, and it is unnatural. Again, I am convinced that the followers have convinced themselves that lazy curiosity is simply an inspired gifted outcome that constitutes a true prediction (and therefore, under the language drift). I disagree. Good conversations are good conversations in an era - and it goes for similar trips. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will reconsider the film's original idea - sexual taboo with yourself. Extensive cloning is a nice, classic science fiber subject. So global warming is leading to environmental destruction (which includes code 46 also). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If there is an environmental disaster that's severely cut on your living area, you're not around cloning humans! You have enough population problems - you will not have to crank out issues again. Regular, old-fashion-and-birth supplies you the necessary population and any kind of cloning will be brutally suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the film was not all bad. It was some excellent cinematography. Perhaps if I saw it silent, I could have enjoyed it.
