I think it was the first time I saw it at the age of 80. Man, I read the reviews in this trash and I am surprised by the vote. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is not better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problem; Do not make me wrong This movie should not only be banned for its own stupidity. Many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so many poor dialogs. I can not think of this one redeeming quality of vomiting. This action is not / adventure. A bad joke in this movie. Like to see plan 9 with Kinda stock F-16 footage. This movie not only denies logic and general knowledge about military settings, it sends a boring message. Army is not going to save your father from the upcoming middle class house ***** DS So go there and hijack one million dollars and explode, explode it from the terrible closet of American American Arabs. Cuz can not cause you with those animals. It's a Bruckheimer flick without a budget. Bland direction, weak acting, lame music, stupid plot, equal ... Iron Eagle
