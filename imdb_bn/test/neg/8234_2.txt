I consider myself a big fan of low-budget horror movies. The more bizarre and fantastic movies, the more blood and throat, the better, and I fall in love with the flicks done cheaply when done correctly. Luther starts very well ... its source in the circus, a terrific run in a supermarket, the attack of the old lady, and a woman's ranch set all the good mood in its boring possession. A hot sex / shower scene comes when the woman's girl and daughter boyfriend comes home. When the movie gets worse by stealing Luther's boyfriend motorbike. <br /> <br /> Characters are presented with numerous opportunities: a) Save their loved ones, b) To help the police, C) run away, or (most importantly) D) Kill Luther !!! I can not feel afraid for sympathy or character that is too stupid to help ourselves. Luther is away when Chareters chances to arm themselves with guns and knives. A policeman was not at all equally effective to stop Luther and stopped playing Luther, even though Luther's rifle at one point intended the presentation of Luther and his Polish chicken dance. I saw myself coaching in my television: "Be sure he is dead!", "Hess has gone, get out of here!", Or "Just kill him!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can not outsmart this idah Deserve. Half of the film will be so humble in the fate of half-conquest that only Merbid curiosity will keep you on the humorous end. This movie is mentioned as one of the 101 greatest films of Fangorarii which you have never seen ... Fangoriya is halfway to the Ganges Luthar.
