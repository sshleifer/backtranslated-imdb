This movie is awful, I'm sorry. I bought it to get Star Worms, and in fact I was expecting how disappointed I was in Star Worms. Oh just fun, this worst movie I've ever seen turns out. Acting is garbage, there really is no, and the main character is attacked by a big stupid box like those, stuff or something. I can not really say Special effects are so bad that you can not even see war dinosaurs that do not fight, but standing and removing the face or anything else, and no matter what. The movie is a headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to establish a universe. Haahahahahah ... Really, this film is even hateful in trombay standards. The only good thing I can tell about it is that it's got a Lloyd Kaufman article, it is not appropriate to see anything that fits again for us.
