This is probably the worst documented I ever seen. It's so amateur look Chris Hegdas was the director of the Battlefield, who was a great movie (though a little aside), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it is shot in the basement of some people. The value was so kind that I could not see it. I've seen about 30 minutes or more and I have to get back to Blockbuster and get something else. I do not understand how some amateur from someone like Chris Hegdas How does this award start with a prize ??? Battlefield definitely deserves an award, another great documentary called Ameragosa (won both awards). This documentary saw that it was done by Uncle Joe, who got married on weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering light, bad sound, could make a good film than a guy that is 10 years old.
