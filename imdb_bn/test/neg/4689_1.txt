This is a terrible movie! I created it in about 50 minutes and eventually dropped the chapters. This plot is not something special, and the movie's dialogue is so different from the original story that your head will explode from anger. Many vain minutes seem to be jabs only about letters about something irrelevant to the plot, and / or something that can be said in a short period of time. The camera works shaky, and vase. Mr. Millenan closed the zoom button in mind! I noticed that sometime in this movie it seemed that Andy was detained, and holding the camera uncontrollably. The splits in the scenes were shocking and did not flow. The kill scene was nothing special - incredibly, and ridiculous. Recommended as the title, no gore as recommended. The film runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes and takes the scene of the murder scene for about 1 minute - if it is. This film was a trash piece of garbage. Andy Milligan is perhaps the worst director to attack human beings with its unmanned instructions and cameras. Generally, I can really make it through a bad movie, and then laugh about it. Bluthercer Butcher, however, I can not I'm very angry, I see my one-and-a-half hour is alive (I do not have to get it back). Take my advice, and do not see this movie until you are planning on sleeping. Terrible
