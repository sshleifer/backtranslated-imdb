I think this movie with sheer feelings. . . Anger. More than half of the film advertising (no, really!). A little excuse for a story can be easily said within 25 minutes (and almost!) The end result is a fairytale love story of predictable sculptures, perhaps combined with a fierce commercial effort to shake some more arrears from all contemporaries. Debian Boane hit! Yep, how fast it was produced ... The song that was "inspired" was still bigger in the charts when the film was released! <br /> <br /> After several decades of watching bad movies, it still influenced me to dodge among his extravagant, fake-ban, most tedious, illogical, and continuous cinematic evil. It should really be in the 100 worst IMDB list and never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
