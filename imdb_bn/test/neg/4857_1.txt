I say this movie was really quite awful. The performance was average penning the movie terrible and soundtrack and cinematography. I found that I was bored in most of the movie and the clutch lines did nothing for me. The two boys, who played a leading role, sometimes felt horrific and did not pull the emotion in the movie. At the little girl was wonderful and scary looked like a doll. The end was not satisfied with the end of the finish, but I did not think of letters. This movie is annoying and did nothing for me, I do not recommend this movie anymore.
