Eddie Fisher was just bad. Perhaps a spontaneous song and a dance center break on the piano and a few well-functioned employees, perhaps the worst scenario comes in the film. The song was completely stupid ... I think I can give some lines in a sheet of drunk paper that it will cross and probably win a Grammy. Then, the author could not come without any good way to get rid of the ridiculousness of the scene, so Fisher says something of the impact, "Do not tell (enter the man's name). He does not like music" and smile. I can not describe how bad this is, I feel a little embarrassed. And that guy Deby Reynolds works and is always hit on her is so annoying. I can not imagine anyone who wasted his time like that. This joke is distributed without any chemistry, which crawls the film. At least the baby had beautiful hair. For two-star Reynolds, those who were like a hawk in ugly ducklings. <br /> <br /> See instead of Bachelor's Mother.
