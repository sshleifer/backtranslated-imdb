This movie has made me annoying for the sole purpose. Films that I hate are already present: fake feelings, extreme pique, bad child actor and lots of features It disregards the image of American sports sports fans, and many imagine that football has a shape like lemon. What ?! This is a rugby ball. The story follows a group of optimism that they get a new teacher (who, in turn, teaches a small skirt class) that they like and they are interested in football. Naturally, they are all garbage (do not forget, they are not optimistic) without a kid removed from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc. And the kids still do not become good footballers, but good hearts ensues and no hopers are turned into a bunch of good round kids. Hell, even adults start to come round; drunks are turned to daddy, illegal immigrants are hooked off ... groan <br /> <br /> Steve Gutenberg star of this movie. Now, hold down for a minute before you close your local video store to capture your own copy. Guttenberg is garbage. No no; Let's face it, how does this guy get in the movie? I have no idea at all, and I have no idea about this movie. Steve along with Olivia d'Abo as well as not both affect. He's just going through the speed and looks nice when doing it. Although I have no problem with the next part; Its performance does not make any credits in the movie. Hope you get from such a movie as the child actor who created the rest is just as bad. Most of them are hateful and / or annoying and do not make it look pleasant at all. The goat has a goat in the picture and he does a good job; But you will not see a movie for a goat, so do not bother to see this movie.
