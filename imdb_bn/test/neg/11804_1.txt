The characters are annoying, unfamiliar, and flaky .... Madison is the most annoying of all. Oh ... a cold spot! So terrible threat! Any ghost defense in the house has escaped! To make a long story short, this movie is boring. A chair flying across a room can be vague to see, but it gets almost as playful as it gets. I saw it once and when my kids wanted to see it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat instead of watching this trash. If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, it is not! The only good part of the whole thing was "Roach Scene" and at the end of the film, you're feeling sorry for the holidays!
