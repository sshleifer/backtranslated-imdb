Unfortunately, I went through the limited information shown on this movie for recreational purposes in Fandoango. Since I'm a scientist, the idea of ​​a movie about me is UFOs. Instead of <br /> <br />, this movie quickly expresses itself as a publicity evangelistic promotion of Christianity. Suitable for audiences, but enjoying the view of non-Christian movie mall, and especially considering the cost of tickets and discounts, to enjoy the view of film mall and promote to obscure viewers. Do not be ashamed of you! At least the Da Vinci code did not hold its wildlife craze. So, this B-grade film (and I'm kind) will be praised with the same belief in those churches showing the youth group on Wednesdays and Sundays evening. But if you are a mainstream Christian or non-Christian you will not be comfortable.
