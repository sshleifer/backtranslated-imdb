After the general, Dublin's life of gangster was generally romanticized, due to such a heroic proportions that caused a common illness in Dublin that he got sick with Kevin and he acted as the successor of Mr. Lynch. This crime drama is a tragedy for a local comedy and a Kevin Space fan. In short, the film is a priceless look .... No, unless you're laughing 'bad acting with the correct Irish signs, make sure you are sure.' This story was closed from the commercially successful 'The General', which, despite the pride of Martin Cahill's well-known Dublin animal, has a view price on the domestic scale, because it shows the actual working class in Dublin and the international scale because it's true Irish acting and killer throwing with John Voight Did it. Above all, 'general modest criminal' is something other than a decent film. To avoid.
