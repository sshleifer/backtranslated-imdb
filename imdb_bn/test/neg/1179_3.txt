This movie was really bad. Firstly they did not even follow the events for it. Half of the film was made and it was more about the deputies, whose mother was the victim of Ed gene. Acting was terrible, except for the guy playing Ed Gene, but it is not difficult to play a strange guy. Although I think it was terrible, I gave it three because they stopped it with the actual crime photo. That was the best part of the movie. As soon as the end of the movie the movie went downhill. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it does not have to be. The story of Ed Gin is quite interesting without lying information.
