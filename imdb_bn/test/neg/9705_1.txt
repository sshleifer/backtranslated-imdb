Sorry to say but the film was frustrating. I think you can understand the length and length of the movie of Pride and Prizudis, and feel that only big scenes have shone to get the story. The film has spread so far, unfortunately you do not really know and do not feel too much for each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only this movie is annoying. I said that through capital B 1/3 I started to wake up and could not wait for the movie. I read the book and saw the BBC version, I knew how many scenes I had before I finally left the film. Mr. Darcy, in any of these movies, he certainly can not act. He is very young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like the need to get through such script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He's just weird! It shows all. <br /> <br /> Colin was not trying to compare to Fiuma version but if you like that version, you might be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Dresses absolutely frustrated. Where is the course? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I still know how she can dress in a kind of Ladylike fashion, and was not brought to a sculler. His clothing indicates that he can be the poorest farmer in England. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with some scenes in this movie, I do not think it will be considered right. For men to do such work in this society, honestly Mr Bingley has the resources to know well. There are some things that are said to be that this film is not a very modern term for the set time and is not like Jane Austen. Bingley's character shockingly donee, to me she is not a character to behave like a simpleton, likes and respect. What about that smile !!! I was rarely present in WikiHome's presence and there was no presence of Mr. and Mrs. Hart and some other characters. Keira is okay, but it's not exactly the same.
