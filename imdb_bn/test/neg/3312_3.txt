OK. Well, I think it was sitting * once * in my time * but I will not see it again. There's a lot about this movie that has burned me down. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I really hate characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I'm making it harder to spend a character properly, so that the letters I am not really concerned about, and can not be related to it. It was not technically bad to actors or writers; It was that the letters were written in such a way that I was abusive for them, and if the movie continued, I would almost like to see the sky on them. And it takes me to the second problem and I think a question that is in the heart of this movie: This generation of this generation and the purpose of recording such Bohemians simply (I guess) is to travel in Europe in the 60's? What was the purpose of criticizing them and making them drunk? Or was there any kind of caution in this picture? In response to this question, my final assessment (ie, to determine if there was anything saved here). Still, these characters are really unlike, and as a result, it's really hard to give a shit about the plot or what happens to them. If these generations have some such statements, the film will become more tolerant. It is clear that the scrooder is not a type of geriatric establishment square, so the amount of money that has been made here is born in 60 countercultures or over loads of unreasonable AIP movies related to it. <br /> <br /> The minimum, there are two things for this picture - First, the soundtrack (of course). I like how to use symbols here and others mention it because it moves forward in the movie. I suppose that if you are a penguin Floyd fan and want to see it because you can read anything here, you can prevent it from seeing it (it will not stop me too). The only curiosity to hear Pink Floyd in a movie can be found only through this. <br /> <br /> There are some nice scenery. Ibiza looks like a beautiful place to see. Maybe I'm sick of watching movies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, but European movies are always welcome during our Europe show (beautiful or ugly - here quite beautiful) always welcome. <Br / <br /> But I really do not see any special talents here. No revolutionary camera work, even moral, tone, message, sensitivity or plots that do not have to say anything new. Perhaps what was revolutionary about this came from a man like Shroder - a movie critical film that makes his movies marketable at least in part. The amount of it is an honest film; There is no pride in the overwhelming excess of 60, which you probably can expect. Indeed, the screenplay of the character of this film often reflects the generation of modern cultural memory (somewhat distorted, my opinion). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, nudity and sex are bunch here; If you see this kind of movie from this period nothing new. I think it is novel or exciting or something to think about. I can not find it objectionable or titled (I doubt you too); Rather it is an already exhausting tireless film running time. In her own way, special use of sex in the movies of the time (especially the Europeans) has become a bit of cliche. But I think you can not blame them in the dark; They were able to "move away with him" within just a decade and I guess (I guess here) the presence of such graphic sex was a very political or social statement and it was that sex was part of life that this generation is weird like their parents Not going to be) <br /> <br /> have you seen it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, sure ... I guess it's worth a watch. In any case, The Valley is a good movie. What I originally got was what hopefully went into this movie. If you do not usually see such aunty, ambient guard movies and do not know what to expect, but it's annoying like hell. This is a normal, healthy response :) <br /> <br /> If you are not a Pink Floyd fan then I'm not sure why you spend your time here. I noticed a comment who has enjoyed this movie a lot more than a comment, so maybe I'm missing something. I'm not going to need to run at slow speed from something like that to fireballs, special effects, explosions, or a movie to enjoy. But I need some kind of handle - I have to find out something about the movie, and generally I have to be sympathetic to some aspects of the character (except for some novel films work; camera-work and so forth). Here, there is nothing to justify the magnitude of Pink Floyd. To make this tolerable * which * is enough *. At the minimum, if you want to start with a Pink Floyd fan, you would prefer the bit with Symbolline, I'm committed.
