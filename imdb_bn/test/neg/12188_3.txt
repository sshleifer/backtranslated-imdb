The original scene of the 1933 edition, has this version apparently rebuilt a scene-by-scene with some scenes visible outside the scene? It seems to me less of a movie that it does, which shows the specific desires of creativity. With all fairness, I want to favor Catherine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems like a cinematic theft. The 1933 edition was beautiful and sweet, though sometimes it was a bit weird for presentations and contractions, and then the version adopted a fair amount of scripts, music and scenes from the previous version. I can not understand the point of making the film again when the rebuilding process was basically reloaded with the same thing as re-loading George Kooker's film.
