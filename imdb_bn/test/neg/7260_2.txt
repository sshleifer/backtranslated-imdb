This movie starts showing you a map and then explains the radar and you can see the deadly monts a little earlier. Perhaps a good film in 50 is slow to slow down and end closure to reduce this dated piece. Although Perry Mason's man is in his chest, so is his age when he argues with an old man and when he says, "I narrowed down the possibility of one's chance", but when you narrow something, you two or more There is no possibility of possibilities. If you take it down, then you have not compressed it, but you actually find out what it is. The giant is not saying 50 science-fire fairs, pallets at the beginning of the end. The acting sub sub par and heroin are the most unattractive ... actually some shots she looks like a guy in a drag. You see lots of warrior flat stock footage and other things, but you will not see all of the deadly mantis.
