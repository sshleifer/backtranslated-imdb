During the filming, did Venacea Redgrave take the mugs? Like he was reading from an autocue. I saw a wooden spoon more life. Or perhaps that was all part of the letter? However, it was very annoying, I kept her up early for the screen weighing. I had read this book long ago and did not like much about it, apart from that, the madness of Septimus was very good - but Rupert Graves did not look very well, his acting was on the page. The relationship between his life and Clarissa is not very good, but I suspect that people like Clerissa are trying to show the dedicated soldiers to continue their living life. The film is very diverse and it has no real unity. Dislike
