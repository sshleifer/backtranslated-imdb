The only person I would recommend for this film is both blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sodomoshist will come out of it. This film was nothing; No acting, terrible music, horror scripts - just the power to suck any happiness from your soul. You may now think that even though half or maybe I was able to sit through extreme turmoil and this is also a difficult concept for me. First of all, the film progressed with my progress and I feel very comfortable to be comfortable. Secondly, the plot, especially when I grabbed my own hand for a moment to hurt my friend with the help of friendly friendship on the phone, especially for the moral support of the plot, I created it. It was a matter of pride for me to finish it early in 30 minutes and it was a serious mistake for me. I usually like to spend a vacation with you, but all this was done ... do not see this movie for your vicinity.
