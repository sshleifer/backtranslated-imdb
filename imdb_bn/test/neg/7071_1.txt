This picture was a mess that I really reflected my friends, which I saw. I was the only reason to see that my friend Grew was an apprentice editor. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie was in the camp, but the process was so heavy and self-reactive it really turned flat. Jude Nelson as well as the Comedian Hack who is as big as an unused garbage man. His life was hell and his objectionable and tolerant partner Bill Paxton (which I was embarrassed - was worse - it was really a vulgar role for a talented actor). A strange accident changed the course of Nelson's career and disappointed Mahmud. <br /> <br /> Humor's efforts were authentic, expected and often base and transparent. Wayne Newton is an innovation thrown as a talent agent but he added nothing - ridiculously or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, it goes on like a lead balloon. Camp humor is a very weak and uncreative effort. At least you can laugh at outer space at Plan 9. This one makes you think who financing and film was a good enough idea. You will ever be the greatest bomb ever witnessed.
