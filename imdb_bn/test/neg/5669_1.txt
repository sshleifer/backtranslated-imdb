If you think Hannah Montana or Sweet Life is at the bottom of Tiwein sitcom but you obviously did not see Icicle. iCarly doubt the worst show I've ever seen. The low budget from the perfect performance shows that fierce shows like last week's Chinese takeout are swimming in your very hot car. <br /> <br /> The show is beautiful, perky and "supposed to be", the funny girl named Kareli, she and her friends make a live web show called Aikari. Curley lives alone with her older brother, who needs to do some advice or something, because she has some brain cells in narrow cells. <br /> <br /> The show plots are very funny and helplessly annoying. But to see Karlie and his friend Sam, making their little show-in-in-show worse. They basically show strange pictures and keep things locked on their nose like laugh-tracks over over. I would seriously say that every two-second laughter track seems to be coming for some reason. <br /> <br /> So, what is this review? You can ask. Just laugh iCarly? Well, yes, but I warn you to be cautious from this show. Seriously, if I liked seeing Aiker and Barney? There is no question about it, I like Barney.
