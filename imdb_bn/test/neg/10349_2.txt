I tried to see it twice, although I'm not able to do it through any episode. For me, it's not really fun. I can say where I'm feeling laughing, but I can not. I did not see the original, so I'm not comparing. I love the trick, including the comic of the off-the-wall comedy ... with children and family treats, but this show just does not do it for me. The joke is tall and flat, and the acting is mostly boring. Entrepreneurial look it interesting, but it is not. They are trying very hard to be different, and tying to force humor. That style usually does not work very well. I do not think the end of this show season. Of course, I could be wrong.
