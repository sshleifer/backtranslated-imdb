This film is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time ... if you enjoy insomnia. This is a fool-proof way to give a frequent guarantee. As the film progresses gradually, the audience falls into strangers and gradually sees the scene of any kind of plot that the film can actually hold. This effect is certainly made due to lack of sweet action / sweet babes. <br /> <br /> Also, Mr. Eisenstein is probably unable to dominate Montage's art. This is a major example of the Odessa step view. For no obvious reason, in real life, an event does not take second matter, it turns into a seven-minute nightmare for a spectacular viewer. This edit error has ruined any kind of reality in the whole film. Actually, I saw more realistic editing of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Some people who have commented on this title have called Battleship Potemkin "one of the greatest films of all time" and "really excellent composition". Well I am writing this comment to avoid the reader to avoid avoiding all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words on their summary. Of course they wanted to say that "one of the greatest graduation-festivals of all time" and "really an epic failure" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. If you are interested in watching a better quality movie then go to www.youtube.com and watch a halo 3 montage. When I play "Battleship Potemkin" movie in a game of slayer on guardian, I will shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then tebag his dead body. Salam
