Rumys is the story of a man who drops everything except his incredible girlfriend and a stomach dog that he plans to patent and sell. Immediately his uncle died and left him a house and a car, and got some roommates to help him rent and get a job. Then his girlfriend became drunk and cheated him, so he goes and writes a book about the roommate and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these descriptions of plot details are searched, the less you read above is as interesting as the movie, less or less. When his uncle dies, there are some breasts on the screen, the interview of his possible roommates is very interesting for about 40 seconds. Last I literally worst I've ever seen. I want another 87 minutes of my life! <br /> <br /> I did not seem to have made such a film with so much talent: Of course, there are rules to deliver such things to the people? This script can not be more than 20 pages and the entire movie has about 3 locations and a car, because the budget is reduced. The only sustainable use of Rumi, in my opinion, is that if you hold a hostage and want to disappoint them beyond human thought. If so, repeat it and you have a prepared gibbering ruins within days. <br /> <br /> Twilight out in 10
