I agree that Mary Warren (Murdoch's Secretary) is the only good thing about this film. She is always my favorite actress, every role she plays is always done so well. Her character is intelligent, annoying, cute, light-hearted, funny and cute. He really pulls this role well and you get a good feeling for everything about his character. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is quite bad. Music is the most entertaining thing left. One of these characters has this weird rounded radio that he brings with him when he worn the strapped tank top of his tights. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of a curiosity about the story that anyone hired these three college-age children spruce up an old abandoned theater. What does he give them and say - go to That would be really fun and I wish someone would give that opportunity! Think of going to an old abandoned theater with two people and you can decide how to decorate it and fix it. You have total control over the whole building. That would be so much fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not feel it as an exciting adventure, they think it's a big trick. They walk around with long face and fight the whole time with each other. It's kind of a bummer. But these people are also keen to think of the possibility of not being excited. <br /> <br /> The movie feels helpless or makes itself distracted by the theater. However, acting (in addition to Woronov and perhaps Murdoch, the boss - only a really good money hungry feline cheerleader business people who have no luck) are really awesome and you just end up feeling dissatisfied. Plus, a small piece of random slopstick and type of debris that tries to create the reality. <br /> <br /> If you digitize Marie Vernonov, the Fancy 80's Casio keyboard style is an electronic bit and if you think yourself a giant animated abandoned theater is all curiosity.
