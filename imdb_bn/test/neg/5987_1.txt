This film has given me a lot of laugh at the actor who keeps the film going on all sorts of crazy aspects. If you like the proposed language and sexy looking gals they all had pictures and gals and they all find out the burns even before they graduate from high school. There is a scene where Terris drives their car a very fake deer and then it throws it into the lake or sea, which is repeated over and over again. Apart from the terrible word for the whole film, there is no big deal in this film and Arnold is actually a sick character playing plastic police. Please do not waste your time while viewing these pictures.
