The most common, surface-level biography you can expect. Basi's Holi is correct in the disguise - but who wants to listen to the song "Maybe Baby"? Generally, the members of the Holis are used instead of comic relief and melody (respectively Smith and Straw) and humans or even characters. When using the Holy String section, older Jewish-looking boys who told him that he was using the same technique as Mozart. It is simply such a shiny statement that makes biographies of this film (and "Amedus", about the previous Mozart) so ruthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's excellent style and songs done in a B-change.
