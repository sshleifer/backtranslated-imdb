Historical films always take liberties - Conversations are fabulous where no one can actually tell what is said, customs are adjusted to understand from modern audiences. However, historians should have at least one short on history for historical historical figures. This film does not. The only scene I actually think when our hero surprised a murderer who attacked his chamber at night. He faces dangerous intruders with "Do not remember to send for room service". The main entertainment value is its evil; I suggest the story of my local video "turkey" look at.
