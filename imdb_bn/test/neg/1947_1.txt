It's really bad, the characters were soft, the story was boring, and there was no sexual scene. In addition, it lacks drama, the conflict is reducing it very gradually. Nothing happens in this picture, you will expect a sex scene, but they have a kiss. The plot revolves around three letters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they rise from the high way. Invite a newborn couple to stay with them because they are homeless. At this moment you will have sex with a newborn's wife? No they just kiss and that's it. Also, there is no action in the film, no comedy, no drama, even suspense. You probably think the studio does not even read this script !!!!
