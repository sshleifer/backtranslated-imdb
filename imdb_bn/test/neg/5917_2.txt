In the 1930s, Halo Roach studios were at the top of the world in Laurel and comedy like Hardie, Charlie Chase and Little Rascal. Most of these movies are exceptional and time passes. However, the lesser known Roach products were paired with Thelma Todd and Jasu Pittas (later, Todd was equally paired with Paty Kelly). I will try as much as possible, I just can not stand these pictures - they are not just funny. In addition to Lorel and Hardy, Todd and his two co-stars did not have chemistry. You just think I'm a crank, realize that I've seen hundreds of Rome films and many other early comedies and realized, so I know this style and style, this group is the worst. Because I think I'm right about the group that as a lower-level group of interests, they do not want any other scripts. If Stan or Olly hated a particular plot idea, it is often given to Tod and Pitts / Kelly - and it is usually shown. <br /> <br /> In this film, the team has their perfect minimum. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less smiles and more imaginative plots. Jury and Thalma started as a defense lawyer in Jasu. As Jasu, he is a completely annoying moron. Precious type moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a complete annoying and grating person who is pushy and offensive. As Thalma, naturally, he is rather soft "straight man" and does not do anything like that but responds to Jasra's shyness behavior. <br /> <br /> This plan protects a client who has been accused of selling explosions of food pills. When the pill is considered to be extremely dangerous, when attorney tries to consume Jasu, it seems just stupid. And, when they were called "goalkeepers", they were like big balls of black balls like black balls. To consolidate them only converted and made in no sense - even for a less comedy comedy. When they find that she has swallowed the pill and it is really explosive, everyone walks like idiots until the panic and movie ends. <br /> <br /> I said, I am not a fan of this group. However, even for those who like this movie, there is absolutely no short smile! When I talked about this review with my wife (who saw the movie with me), she thought that my score of number was very generous !!
