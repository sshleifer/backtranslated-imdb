Let's cut everything with the first paragraph. The newest movie "The Messengers" of Pangu Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror film, is deeply bad. And generally as a movie, a big disappointment. This is nothing but a reconstructed "six senses" and there is no reason why the world has to pay the money to see this turkey as long as the image is still available. <br /> <br /> Recent, horror / slash films such as "Final Destination" series, "Wrong Turning," "Boogie Man," "The Ring 2" and "The Grze," Growing Large Shocks Without Any Customs Becoming more dependent (for example, the screen jumping on some people, elicits a gasp from the audience, but activates to be a cat or a crow or something.) This is a real horror experience such as "Six The sensation, "or" sign, "or the classic horror became something of the 1940s movie, '50 and 60 's. <br /> <br /> "Messengers" depending on this old, tedious clinic, this new, very inferior film and old, tired and - for my surprise <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Opening Miller, "Awakening," "Kindergarten Cop," TV Series "Despair Housewives"), Big Sis Jes (Christian Stewart, "Jathura: A Space Adventures Tournaments ") and children Ben (Ivan Turner), J. Chicago has moved from North Dakota. <br /> <br /> This step is not really mentioned here, but there is something to do with the parents' inability to find parents work and the sorcerers screwed away driving. We know that there will be immediate problems because they have entered a big Gothic house somewhere in the middle; A house like summer houses in Munster. Oh, and some horrific events occurred in the first five minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> Jess hates this place (hey, blame him), but hoping pop hopes to increase sunflower enthusiasm (despite the unusually large amount of crows growing). But when he began to start the journey of Burwell (John Corbett, "Helen Rising" and Kevin Coster's "My Name in Earl"), a traveler and specialist in sunflower emergence, he started. <br /> <br /> But then strange things start to happen; Jesse has been terrified by the fierce invisible forces (of course, anyone else but the two-year-old Ben can not see it, so he has labeled a flake) and the cakra hangs around. Beno is able to find strange creatures, but he can not reveal it, he has two. The little boy is not saying that the man saw him and said, finally I want to shout at the screen, "He can not tell you!" Yes, the only hero who can solve all these things can be a silent child, real smart. <br /> <br /> However, we are going to think of Sanity; When and when Ben will describe a correctly described abnormal vision; If Baba will work sunflower things; If high plains drifter is a good guy or worse; What is the point of George Plimpton-Roltter Returns? Only ant meat can be a meat wound; What is the role of the mother of the family; And where all the crows comes from. <br /> <br /> Waiting and surprise time for all of this - nothing happens. The conclusion is really hair, as well as again it asks that any body of a physical body can harm a living person. Very neutral, vain and most terrible all, at least not afraid. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are so many crows in this movie.
