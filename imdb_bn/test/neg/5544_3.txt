Pumpkinhead itself was a decent 80s horror flick. No classic in any way, but fluff is an enjoyable piece. So, now we've treated the fourth film in this franchisee out of it. Like the previous episode, here's nothing to add to the films except the giant, magician, and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the conflicts between Hatfields and McQueus. The part of the film Romeo and Juliet romance as the son of a young MacKay and his hat girl boyfriend decided to run away together. Soon, they are separated and the son's sister died. The boy escaped to the jungle and got a witch to revive Pampinhed for some revenge. The best at the amateur, the worst amateur The title giant does not really show up for about forty minutes and it does not make a pale comparison between it and its original design. Overall, the blood fails to impress the enemy. It may be worth a clock once, but the collection is not an extra.
