This is a tiring movie. Real villains are violent adaptations (it can be encouraged that the source material was a novel) and intelligent screenplay. <br /> <br /> Considering credit, money was strong due to the intensity of war crimes, the appearance of the film is not bad at all.

Ms Calvert, which is going to go much lower, with Olivia de Havilland in the Gone with the Bound, is complete. <br /> <br /> One of the most complete helpless views of Grete Man is the awesome idea of ​​black. The son serving He was meant to be a sympathetic character. Black face makeup was badly played by a white boy, impossible to pass this example of racism impossible. <br /> <br /> Grim.
