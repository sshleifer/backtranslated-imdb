This movie was so frustrating. Everything looked energetic and I was fully prepared to have a good time. At least I thought I could stand up. But I was wrong. First, weird looping? It was like watching the "funny home video of America". Elite dad I hate them so much. Stereo-usually Latino family? I will talk with the person responsible for this. We need to talk one thing Was that little girl always hanging? I was just hating her and mentioning it. Now, beyond the final scene, I would say. It's so glorious and bad that it's a movie of itself. What crappy dance Together horrible and beautiful.
