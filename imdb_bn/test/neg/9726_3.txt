If I could scatter the idea of ​​this movie to big cats in Hollywood, I'm sure it would be good: <br /> <br /> "Four boys from a private high school are good friends, and they sink. <Br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, br>: "It still sounds like" crypt ", with boys instead of just girls. <br /> <br /> "OK, but this fifth boy comes to the picture and he is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... I'll make these boys a part of "crowd", they'll be rich, and the school will be on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "Now this is the real word. It's nothing like "Craft", here's a billion dollars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so clean and vague. Even the plays made between the brothers of Chess and Ipswich were very rich in wealth. The biggest problem for the kids is that I am not interested in the color that Bentley wants for their 18th birthday (and 18th car), even if they have the power. It seems like every child in this movie has come out of the magazine, and of course, it is surprising that you have to have male nudity and 80% nudity, you can run exactly the size of the house. I wanted to name the name of the film "OC Witch". Oh, rich children and their problems .. <br /> <br /> This picture was completely unfamiliar and predictable. The final battle was hair and pulled out and the last was very climate. It was the best movie of the Cutting Room. Floor.
