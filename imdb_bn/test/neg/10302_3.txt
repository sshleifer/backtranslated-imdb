This movie starts with a wrong foot and is not really going to do it. The first scene is a Life Flight Helicopter landing and outside of the window you can clearly see the mountains in the background. You have no height change for those who can not be Houston. The city is located above sea level and is considered to be a 5 foot high mountain. To go through those scenes, any shot outside the hospital immediately tells the viewer that they are not Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or pine trees, which are very much in Houston. Even in the hospital itself, outside is very incredible. Memorial Harmon Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the United States and Smith Davy is located in the middle of a medical district just a few miles away from the city center, but every shot outside the hospital looks like the hospital is in the suburbs or even even <br /> It is clear that the film's true tropical Anyone in charge was in the storm, because the radar countless K all wrong. Hurricane Hugo's first rattler in the movie hit South Carolina. Later we saw Chris Christopherson out of work, and one of his assistants told him that Ellison was returning to Houston across Houston, but the radar image showed Ellison clearly north of Houston in the north of the Gulf of Mexico ... probably the primary landlines Alison. <br /> <br /> for acting, it's not all bad. Jobworth Williams, Chris Christopherson and Rick Scrada all think that it's a direct-movie movie. The plot is appropriate and it makes it more entertaining based on the real story. One of my problems with acting is illustrated by the thickness of Houstonians' illustrations ... not all actors are from Birmingham, Alabama and Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> This point goes across the film and the general audience does not mean exactly what it is: Entertainment. If you are looking for a real calculation of what happened in Houston City in June 2001, you will be disappointed. One thing to remember before watching this film is that it is not only based on the transfer of the Memorial Harmon Hospital, and not based on the effects of tropical storm allison and Houston metro. If you search for a real account related to the effects of Tropical Storm Allison in the Houston Metro, then I can recommend storm stories of weather channels for tropical storm allison. <br /> <br /> * ***** of 1/2
