Everything terrible about this movie. <br /> <br /> In this five minutes you can say that this movie is going to be terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Does not get excited. <br /> <br /> Then one of two separate stories started. The first half of the film is often competing in medieval fights competing with other ethnic groups. Wogs always win, because they apparently lift the weight and "respect". In this scenario, we first saw this movie poorly performing, editing, scripting, and hating degrees for funding people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the main character and his companion were sent to jail. The whole prison area of ​​the film is not about what I feel, it's a plot. This includes a bunch of militants. <br /> <br /> Once from the fisherman (3 years to kill?) Combine with the main character and his companion wogs. Then they "go to the other side of the city" and try to stay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon gang members set up for rape of another gang member and run off to fight off the hordes of various gangs around the city. This point of view of the movie can be compared to arcade games, because the fog wanders around easily and in the course of the movies, fight against the enemies that are badly damaged. <br /> <br /> However, the film takes the view of some massive climate warfare which is the remaining body (two main characters) that they have fought each other. Apparently there is a problem combining other gang residual wogs (skinheads do not think Asians). About ten million people beat many of the victims, the movie ends with the main characters of the original title. However, they do not make the house because they are burned by thousands of angry movie critics who blur the set and send angry letters to all over. <br /> <br /> This movie can be like a computer then a movie, because it will explain how many millions of people can double their time to face two million million people. <br /> <br /> There is also an absurd story in this film, such as an Asian clash with his own gang and fight with head and head spinning. <br /> <br /> Anyone else mentioned, this movie is not so bad it's funny, it's just so bad.
