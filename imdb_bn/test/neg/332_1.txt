When I was 70 years old I knew Brad Lynovev in Florida State UK, when he was an inspirational, inventive writer, who led me to give more glory. <br /> <br /> And that's why I hired this video. Well, the time was not kind to Mr Linweaver. I think making a living makes the ambassador worthwhile. Another flower whose bloom has arrived and disappeared in the summer wind. Amen. There is nothing to say. And nothing more to add. As described above, once a sad epitaph in a blossoming career. But it is a price that provides for a firm foundation or life to follow the shadows without its own goal. Because there is no goal of this movie, there is no purpose, and I am telling myself, what has happened to Brad's creativity, once a burning flame? Gone, gone, years of negligence once broke his burning mind.
