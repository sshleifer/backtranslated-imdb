I do not .. If it comes down, I could kick a dog's ass, and for this reason this movie does not work for me. If it's against Alien or Jason ... or not .. Hell, I know ... there are no other popular movie actors, then there is no competition and I want to transfer my ass to me without divine intervention. A horror movie works because it keeps humans in a position more powerful or instant or intelligent than an animal, person, being, entity, whatever, and then people think 'if it happens to me better then'. They're afraid - and why this is a terrific idea for a story. I can not imagine myself being a terrorist by a dog, so I'm not afraid.
