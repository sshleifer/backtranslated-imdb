If Rammond Wallace's worst act is not for work, it could not have happened very badly! This guy was so bad that it was not funny! His character was needed in the film, but why he chose this man more than that. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some quality Chinese movies ... I can recommend "Red Lantern Ryzan" .... "Story of Qi Joo" .... "Red Tide" ... ... <br /> <br /> Anything else! I was surprised how many people really are very valuable! Really ... The harmful act of Wallace is so bad that it spreads to other good parts of this film. Last night we all agreed to see this picture! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
