I expected much of a real ride as I promised many reviews because I was so much disappointed. The scripts are very very bad in the hole and direction too. Director Thrills and Mysteries have completely failed to develop each violent scene. It tried very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. So, I used to see how every bullet was spent without any intelligence to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I was watching. Then I do not like that he smoked an aggressive cigarette after another, but perhaps this film was partially supported by the tobacco industry. The last is very frustrating. I do not understand how JD Foster was nominated for Golden Globe in the worst role of his life. Jodi, so I liked the panic room or flight plan. It's certainly the worst one I ever seen. 4/10.
