Duncan Ray's writing and direction really, and regularly, below par. In fact it stinks sort of. The AKA is almost as bad as the re-establishment of its recent (terrible, self-service) Dariyan Gray - often stupid and provocative, amateurs, hanging towards its roots, weird, conflicting dialogue between the 'upper-class' characters. Characterization and scripts - and sometimes played - are creaky like a school play ... But the bad, when the director does not definitely grasped, there is a spirit of rust that destroys the spirit ... selfishness is not just good. Diana must be quick cringing with embarrassing. DR You just have to get out of the photo ... seriously.
