I bought it as a "terrorist hospital" in VHS and when I returned home I checked the IMDB and it was like OMG "Nursery Sherry" !!! So here's another of Al Adamson, who learned a little bit about making films since the "Dakula Kassal Blood" day. Where the previous attempt is a complete or completely slurarotic wave, it makes the one narrow a bit, adding a certain element of different types and astonishment. Half of the movie is a blind postpipe football player, he is shooting air with his stacked nurse, but at any moment, we can spend on cutting the head of the devil's mastermind, or the nursery Sherry is running a farmer through a pitchfork. , Or the seamless student-film capturing faster with Pulsing-Blob effects in the scene, or the most unreal half-hearted chaotic bit, or God knows what else (I forget to be honest). Sh * t go idle as ass ass, run this one high toward the end. Congratulations, al.
