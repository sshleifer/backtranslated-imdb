This may have been a nice flick. However, many other people think so. Because of the language transfer I made it poorly done. If the whole movie is to be read, then it takes away from the movie and something else is happening. As far as I'm concerned, it has a great rating and I could not wait to rent it. But, once I let it be a real down. Here at Boardman, Ohio I could not find an English version of something similar. This film was compared with dark hours and we can not see it in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. So I guess we never knew how good the movie really was.
