I was really waiting for this movie but sadly it did not wake up to expectation. <br /> <br /> Identify / empathising / sympathetic with a good movie viewer with the main actor. Unfortunately it was very difficult to do this with Parantar Marton. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story seemed very strange and did not flow because it was not supposed to be done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's astonishing to wonder why she is a little more than dressing in the window and she appeared to be part of the bit. The beautiful scenery and Tom Morrison and Cliff Curtis were the only pluses. <br /> <br /> I probably made the bar higher for locally produced movies because of the Kiwi. Maybe the director has been favorable / favorably convinced my opinion to work with the main actor. Maybe I'm trying to make excuses for a movie, which can be great. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in this movie, which still does not explain. <br /> <br /> This could be great, it was not.
