This is not a new film. It was a remake of 1994's "Emmanuelle, Queen of the Galaxy" and it was significantly scattered. Warning: A lot of characters are included in the movie's enduring credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to see it in its original form, then select "Queen" - to avoid all costs, such as cut it originally and even choppier.
