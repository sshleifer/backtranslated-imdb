This is a movie that reminds me of Avatar-actor Rajesh Khanna in the 80's. The issue of division of parents and children was interesting, but was conducted in a rather formal way. The letters were not fully developed, and due to being utterly stupid due to the children being stupid boyfriend (the first 15 meters in the film), the transformation was not believable for at least speaking. This sld has invented this more. Amitabh and Jaya were wrong as these helpless old couples. Firstly, Amit was not very convinced in this role, because he did not think he should be helpless, I mean why he will not return to where he wanted w / children who do not want him. Hema was not believed as 60 years old. .. he could not see more than 50 years. Then the whole book of the book won the prize of the books of the book, the credibility of the book. Everyone, a movie that handles an important problem, but the CDD makes it even better, I can give it 5/10
