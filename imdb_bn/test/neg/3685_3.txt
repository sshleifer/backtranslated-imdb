This line is a good summary of this movie. If you read this and have watched 20 minutes of film, you can know exactly how the rest of the film will behave. Some researchers (pronounced cigarette), known as sergi, are looking for hell in Moscow's undergarments. But he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Oven follows with a team to find him. Could they find more annoying plot? Some bad actors looking for an old man underground Acting is very bad, romance really sounds vague and untrue, there is no good reason to often play characters, nothing scary and most of the majority: not being attractive in some of the whole movies. They walk on foot, ask some gang leaders and other people on the street, some walk, complain, finds old people, then they run, and finally find the underground way. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the lowest ratings from this movie is the atmosphere. If you only want to see a movie for that, it might be a good choice. It's dark, and it's mysterious and scary. However, the rest of the movie is really dull. You just sit there, wait for the movie to start or something to happen. It's actually happening in some things, but they do not perform very well. For example, I did not really notice if one of my letters disappeared and I swear I was sleeping or not. And I do not understand what is dangerous with these children ... They just roam in the underground area, dig the walls with the stick (I think it can be scary in some way). <br /> <br /> If you need immediate crooked environments then just watch this movie.
