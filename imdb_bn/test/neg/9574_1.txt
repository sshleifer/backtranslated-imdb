Old bat is transforming the girl looking for a young liquid after drinking a liquid. This movie was awesome. Acting ruthless The camera work made me head spin. And it's sometimes the longest, most annoying annoying strip teasing feature to make in the film. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to point out this. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should be blacklisted for just writing something so awful. Do not rent this movie, I can be the only exception to this, if you die and have only 90 minutes to live, then watch this movie it will feel like an eternity and you will begging to the Grape Ripper sometime before. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
