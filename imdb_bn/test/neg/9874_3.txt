I am about two decades old people who are reading the most comics of my life. I'm not a huge fan of Fantastic Four, but I'm fairly familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Chrmanan (B-movie legend) was the first, I think the feature length creates four films in Fantastic. The result was such a true sculpture that it was never released. Still, copies mostly exist in the net and conventions. If you are trying to laugh and find a copy, please see this for yourself. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a FIFA source and a fame with Dr. Doom and a reputation for the name of Jawaharlal Nehru. , Joke Man with a joke for essentially chic larceny. In this comic book movies, everything should be kept in everything, so Dr. The FF plays an important role in the creation of Dumey, and he and Zaheer play an important role among them. <br /> <br /> First of all, I just want to say that despite the bad things happening in this film, I really like the man playing the dum. He will not get many decent lines, but when he hurt them The armor looks very nice. <br /> <br /> For the rest ... it's a dirty, messy mess. Bad plot, bad acting, bad effects, basically everything bad Especially J O'Dondoug's Boas, Johnny Storm, has come up with the new meaning of the word. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For one thing, they have no reason to go in the place of Sue and Jonny. In the early section, Ben and Reid went to see both, Johnny's 8 and Suye 12. It only connects their romantic romantic with the Hellouva lot champion. Theing dress shows more reptiles than any other, not very rocky, and the only human human torch is actually a human torch. She looks like a silver surfer red-red look. <br /> <br /> I can type in a few hours, but I think that the best view compares to it, it's a climatic face by combining the human torch mentioned. He is racing a laser beam, and he finally destroyed it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam With a punch. Then he flies around and goes "Yippeee!" A whole lot tilts down the camera, and he flies back to the Earth back. Clearly, read intellectuals have forgotten to tell Johnny that there is no fire in space vacuum. These and many other scenes work like Lonnie Tones, if the character is not on a mountain, they do not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was happy that it was not released.
