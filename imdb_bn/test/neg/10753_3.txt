I found this film completely and completely unconscious. I knew some information about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The pictures were fantastic, but I was looking for more for a biographical and / or critical accounting of Curvagio's life and works, not LSD type drug trips. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping time with train, calculator, typewriter and cigarette was very annoying. If it was labeled an "art film" then I would buy DVDs; Now I have a DVD that I will not see anymore and who will buy? I do not like mainstream films that require translation or precision. Thumbs down on this one for me!
