This kind of movie out these days a lot. Unlike many more polished dawn of death and unlike the day of the dead, this zombie falls into the main "Cheese" section of Flickr. Those folks in all 2 movies had major studio releases with their big budget behind them. But they were good movies. Low budget movies may still be good if they accept it and stop using the worst scripts. Anyone who wrote this movie must have been drunk full time. <br /> <br /> This movie had so much effect and there was an unknown plot line. One of the major differences between other types of films is the time of transforming people into a corpse. This one takes just few seconds for their death, and then looks like turned into a zombie. Even with this "infection" spreading, you may have zombie blood and may not even be susceptible to infection and I believe these people are covered with blood. <br /> <br /> The main problem was that we had two dozen jumbo walks and not getting bits at our two major stars. When everyone else actively turns into zombies otherwise it swarmed by 2 zombies when they were even unarmed and able to come out of it without a problem. Our hot chick star survived a missile strike in the building even she was. I was laughing at that time. Submerged, ten dead bodies and a missile building on it, but could it exit without any scratch? OK .... <br /> <br /> It also advises the army about how this army behaves at any time in the military. They might get an idea of ​​how to behave in at least one battle before seeing a movie like Blackhawk. <br /> <br /> The weight of a soldier fat was particularly personal. LOL that was a good one. Another jumped to Jumbo, it seems that they were alive, even at one level they also threw weapons. These guys had to fight zombies there and they were acting like soldiers from the stripes. Special forces, lull ... <br /> <br /> Then they try to explain the jambi girl in the rubber room and the whole thing becomes very confusing. The explanation is muddled and even does not follow the first movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, at the outset, the military lady told them that the order came down from the Vice President to the President and finally it The order provider from "indefinite location" was vice president. That was the best part of the movie for me.
