When I saw this movie my brother was working at the movie theater; I saw it for free and still walked out. I saw many movies in my time but it was the worst. When people ask me that I've never seen the worst movie, I mentioned this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from setting up a plate plot to the next, it becomes vulnerable to the tendency of blacks and the flow is horrifying. Read this movie if you want to cry and vomit the baby at the same time. OK, this movie is "bad" but not terrible bad. If you are like a man who looks for horror movies for fun, you will not be able to make it through this small movie like me. Destroy all copies of this movie for the love of God.
