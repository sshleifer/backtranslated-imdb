Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was surprised to see that this wonderful "woman picture" was a hand and I mean the way to the worst way. The problem is that if they exclude Zanei Irie Staff and were stuck in the early 19th century with more interesting scenes involving Spanish / Portuguese Jews in London, it was so good. When the soundtrack is better than the music film, you know that you are in trouble. When you move the video fast because you can not stand the film, be sure that you will not miss anything, you're getting worse problems. This movie will end on the romance TV channel where it is properly related.
