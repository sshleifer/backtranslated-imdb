Okay okay This is an awesome piece of television. Camera work is frustrating (I remind you of Krki Cristal, so you can rarely speak to actors) The lady is the most annoying voice around the world. Anna Messi is acting in such incredible fashion. And beyond the lack of chemistry between Fanny and Edmund. Also bertram girls are not enough enough, and Henry Crowford playing guy is awful. The camera is an understatement of dodgy to say the work is done. I saw this adaptation on Christmas, and under any other circumstances I could not bear it and certainly could not justify the vain time. <br /> <br /> I'm faithful to a fan Jane adaptations. So I can not afford film adaptation or recent pride and bias movie. But instead see any other adaptation, even better than MMA.
