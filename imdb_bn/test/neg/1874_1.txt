You know that when you get older, you think of any movies that you did not like in your childhood, because of your youth and inexperience. Case-in-point, when I saw The Godfather at the age of 14, I thought it was boring. After 20 years, I find this an incredible movie. In other words, I grew up and started praising the great movie. <br /> <br /> So at the age of 14 I paid my girlfriend last night to dance with my girlfriend and at the same time I hated. Age But I hope, because I was young and stupid at the age of 14, probably it would be a new experience for me. So I was sitting to see him, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> I feel violated by night after seeing a great dance. I feel like someone comes to my soul and loses 2 hours of my life from seeing me on this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze plays at the age of 20, but he seems to be 35 years old. The movie's beloved loved him, seducing some destructive teenager, wooing him with his dancing drive. Really unclear <br /> <br /> However, the movie is a clich√© plot where people with "wrong side of track" and "rich smart girl" fall in love with each other accidentally. Of course, the "romantic girl" can not dance to a sizzle and burns her romance, so the "poor hero" teaches him a week as a skilled dancer for a big end of the holiday or something like him. <br /> <br /> You have guessed it: Abusive parents soon enter and forbid to see each other and the film progresses in secret lessons and dance lessons. All of this ends in the final scene where the whole resort rallies with two young lovers, once the opponent's father took the 35-year-old dancer as his new girl. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend was crying to the end, she thought she had nothing in mind. I could not hit him, but I did a little cheer, and put the Godfather Part II in the DVD player.
