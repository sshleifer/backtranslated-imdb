Hi, today I saw this image because of medium (5,6) IMDB rating. I think it will be valuable The comment here was also good but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly realized that this movie is not close to 5,6! It's just boring. You can describe the film with some words, it's just a standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I do not know why people still like these movies or why they vote for such movies, then 1-3 in IMDB Just some examples <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Then a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone is not working Oh my mine ... it is weird but we do not need them, so enjoy our journey ..." Our weirdest person is a weird psychopath, we all are back Come and scream for a while until he starts cutting off from us or killing some of us. Shortly there is no chance of getting rid of the hooliganism or surgery, they can never think of fleeing or even if they get the chance, they can also kill psychopaths, unless the psychotherapy works with any surgery. They've got the films and they're always running naturally ... screaming ... to do something more ... Oh and in the end it really goes out. Sometimes the bad guy will win sometimes some hunters can escape the great movie. ... Okay, if I do not see such a movie, then I would say it is a movie that can be seen but if anyone sees it in any movie but it should only be an annoying waste because almost everything about the movie even before you even saw it Because it runs every time like the standard horror movie Cemetery. .... mmm there is probably a Windows program there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can just drag some combination buttons and get new shuttle, S4564574, Jeepers Creepers movie type.
