I have to read all of the reviews for this direct video movie. I agree that the film is not "Armageddon" or "deep impact" quality. However, if you look for a way to pass ninety minutes or more, then this is a movie that is enduring. <br /> <br /> I started working as a gimmick for several hours. Staff. It was very nice because I was able to go back and behind in what I was doing and watching the movie, a beat was missing. This is an anticipated movie, and the acting is not the same as for some older actors (for example, Dennis Hooper). <br /> <br /> I must say that I have just given $ 2 (US) and goes as an old opinion: what you pay for! If you are looking for some deep sense movies that you have to show it again then it must be a long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, Tycus (which was eventually known as "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video), there is nothing wrong in this.
