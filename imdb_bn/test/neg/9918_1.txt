Without doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. Without laziness and structures, tension or story, film "putting putting a show" is located on the thin premises. Their beginning of conflict is fixed in two or three seconds and the dialogue is random and accessory. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often "stopping out" seems more than an actual movie, like a deleted scene. The film is only available as a showcase for lazy and completely random Liza music numbers. Shell Winters can be seen as the higher Oct.-epic "Tantra", and Real Liza "Queen Dock: The Movie" can be found in the Showtime release.
