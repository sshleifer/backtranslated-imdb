My girlfriend and I are really cheesy in horror flicks. Especially the ones with lots of unnecessary nudity. We saw the cover of this box in Blockbuster, we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We started to see it, did not expect it to grow, but it seemed that it would catch us at least. 20 minutes in the movie we realize that the motion will not be finally picked and it's an incredibly annoying movie. We tried to enter it, but after reading over the DVD box again, the plot made a very small idea. The film shot very dark and it was quite boring to determine what was going on in each shot. It was very difficult to create each violent scene and you will not see the violence you actually expect. It is definitely a film without any purpose that was shot down and very drawn. Each scene had about 20 minutes of the same thing and I felt I got the point after the first one. Skip this movie and see another Freddy or Jason Flick again and you will find more content.
