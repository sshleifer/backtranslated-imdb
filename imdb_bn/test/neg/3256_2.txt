A meritorious entrepreneur was rejected from a respectable country club, he started a fight among the members and eventually bought it from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turned it into a theme park / golf course where everyone can join. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but it's still a little fun. Cheap slapstick and bad joke without almost all the comedy Gear Chase. Chevy Chase plays her greatest role as the Ti Web for the second time and it looks great. He is not the most funny character in the film, the only funny character in the film. Even Don Oct. failed to bring humor to the movie, which wants to be a classic in a classic comedy, but it is also spotted with others appearing in the comedy center. The film might well be good if the web (Chess) had a big role, but instead he was reduced to a small character and became the star Jackie Messon (who ??), to bring all Castes back and to the right! This is a perfect example that will not do while creating a siggle in a great movie already. Overall, Cadachec is second ridiculous but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
