Ingullius Basters is the worst movie in Tarantino, which he has ever created. It is full of its usual elements, full of conversations, brutal and casual violence, but it is all about Dijo-Vi. Instructions are usually tarantino and nothing seems new. Almost as she is just copying from her only masterpiece, Paul Fiction. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new or exciting to be true to Ingliassa basters, it's not just a war drama that's not funny, or bright as a fast fiction. Basterds think Leon's Spaghetti's tribute to Tarantino's Western but seems to be mis-jedish and finding places with false sub-titles, continuous use and throwing the balance audience.
