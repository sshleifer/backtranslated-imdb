Someone wrote that the child has done a good job or has deposited money in this god-awful college exam. It was disgusting, slow, and painful to see. It's been around 84 minutes, it was felt for three and a half hours. The only accuser, the person who does not know anything about the direction of the scene, where to set up the camera! 95% of this awesome movie is pictured by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame are talking or screaming forever (or seem like forever), no closeup !! No medium shot !! There are two so-called war scenes that a brain-based filmmaker shoots some close-up or medium shoots for them. They look very amateur. It would have been good to have a parent or a son acting or reacting to each other by screaming at each other when the father or son shouted at each other. Tri-C will be very dangerous to appear at any of these places. I saw a bunch of bad movies during my time because some of them funny because they are very bad, this is not one of them.
