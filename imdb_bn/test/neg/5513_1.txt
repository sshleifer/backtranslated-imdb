Combined for what appears to be virtually zero budget of a Roger Corman Rip. Special effects were originally used in "Star Bounce of the Stars" and I suspect that the fair amount of props, dresses and sets is used again from other sources. The story seems to have been written around this element, so it's not really a reusable project as a movie. Third rate "Star Wars" junk was not needed then or now.
