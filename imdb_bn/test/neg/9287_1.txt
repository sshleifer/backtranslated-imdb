I usually like Lawrence and I live in Australia. I did not see much of that stand up, so when I saw it at my video shop, I thought, yes I'll look at a look. I wish I did not see it now. Clearly, Lawrence had a deep experience, which opened his mind and I think he wanted to share it with others, but this time or place was not there too. <br /> <br /> This whole experience looked like a motivational statement in hell. , It really did not. I believe the word grab of the night will move towards "until the wheels are closed", which travels around sex and sexual organs. It does not seem strange humorous, but Lords Eddie Murphy, Richard Pierre or Robin Williams lacked the gift to classify it in fashion. Lawrence was just plain, I laughed only when he got his experience with the law and his recovery experience in the hospital. If the minus points were, I would give them ....
