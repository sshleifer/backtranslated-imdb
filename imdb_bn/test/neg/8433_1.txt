I have seen many movies in my time and it has really stood as the greatest film ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. I had to take 3 attempts to watch this movie. For the first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of annoyance, probably because I was tired before late in the night. I got the second attempt through 35 minutes, but I still fell asleep again. I can go this way but I think you're getting points ... this movie will never happen. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. See it and you'll know what you're talking about. If you shake your head for 40 minutes in this movie and wondered how it is a dot, then you are actually a mascot. The only reason I gave this movie 1 out of 10 is because 0 is not provided as an option. I thought I should be careful before the world rents or worse ... Buy this trash. Tomorrow!
