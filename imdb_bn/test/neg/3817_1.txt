Is it just me or "horror" movies that are nothing but titties, slapstick, and top villains who can not be killed. There was no point in this movie. What happened to a person who was able to flee from the hostels like the killers? And at least killer make a little more realistic. Winner Crowley was the worst killer ever seen. He reminded me of a giant sponge between the costumedo and the head of the skin. It was at the top that when the winner was in the fire there was a lie, no one thought of ending the job. And in the end, there was the biggest disappointment of the last memories of the snake's memories. I had to agree with my back drop when he blurted ... what f ***! If I could give the movie a negative score, I would have taken care of it.
