Maybe it is wrong for me to review this movie before I ended up well. This is strange because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I once enjoyed the dream of Madame's Night, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage. <br /> <br /> I think the two things have happened to me: the sticky Shakespeare's name, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Fifher, sitting with a huge clam. Well, I think you might have guessed it's a comedy - but when the visual is not funny and the actors are, I'll say we have a bad movie.
