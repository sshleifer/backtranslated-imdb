This movie was one of the most annoying films I've seen for a long time (and I've seen a lot). Personally I liked to take it that it was pretty all but the other that it was quite unwatchable. I could not stand to see De Snyder as an actor or singer. I thought that he was trying to do what he had said, which they were not memorable, which they were not. I could get the movie for free and I still did not have the time value to get it.
