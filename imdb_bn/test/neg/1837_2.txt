First of all, this film is really annoying. I've really seen all these scenes where people are cutting alive etc. Curiously erotic introduction gives a sense of necrophiliactic wonder. It's a bit ... personally distasteful to me. But the film really works in that respect and it seems scary, so I give credit for it. Yup, a few points for those scalpels and ... well, fearful thinking of living discoveries. <br /> <br /> But the lack of this film is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprise. The whole tin-flick horror genre usually goes into a very simple, expected way. Many 'black' moments, insane people who are insane, and all big questions: lovers killer? This movie is included in the "Scream" section and countless numbers appearing in more than 90 numbers. Well, I will not waste it for you, but it's a killer who is not attractive enough. We find out this half way ... and from there, the movie is trying to fill a bit ... but rather trying to say nonsensically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A detective who thinks everyone is insane, but he really knows what's going on. And the police? Ahh, they just smile and eat donut. Highly anticipated, flat, occasionally boring, and most, annoying and dull ... it's an American movie company to shoot a movie like a foreigner to take a flight to Germany Germany ... Hmm ... or did they? <br /> <br />
