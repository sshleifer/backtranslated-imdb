This movie I have ever seen is a bad movie. I only saw about one and a half hours and I stopped it. The cars of this movie break together like the front of the Geo Metro. This movie is not even good for a smile. When I laughed, the dancer said, "No one can kill Danta, Muhaa". I said the holy God and closed off. Bad, bad movie 2/10
