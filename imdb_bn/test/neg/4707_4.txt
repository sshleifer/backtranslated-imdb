I'm finished watching the observer and I'm ordering from my library. I wanted to remember it vaguely years ago and see it with my son. However, the movie is under 2 hours less and I saw it first when it was much more. The VHS box says that Goliath "released a Nazi file, whose mystery could destroy the world forever." Diverts are supposed to recover a secret mission for the recovering of Dantic Documents. There was nothing even narrated about the recovery of this document. Also, the box says that "the best ships provide food to the blood of the insane boiler." This will create a horror film and nothing has been published in this movie. I saw this year on TV when I can not remember the details ... but can this be true behind this box? Maybe the 3 hours movie has more details? <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be surprised about this.
