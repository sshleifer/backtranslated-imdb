This movie was obscure and anticipated. The scenes are badly written and played worse. Following the terrible scenes, the terrible scripts are filled with vain and weak thinking lines. I will never recommend this movie to anyone who has no idea how to look good movies. This film was not only with the same ideas as Bachelor and Bachelor's program, but there are so many parts in it that you know the next movement and what the line will be going on before watching the movie before. The welding was right but the performers played horribly with more plays, should have been used and said that the lines wanted to change the channel faster. Please do not see this movie as a note.
