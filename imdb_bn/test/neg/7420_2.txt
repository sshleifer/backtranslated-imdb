Developing movies based on real events related to cryptology or miracle has always been a challenge for directors and screen litters. You need to adjust the report testimonies, conflict data formulas, and Hollywood creativity to produce something you can get predominantly in the audience. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of these things seem to be happening. <br /> <br /> The film's silent image starts when a movie crashes somewhere in the cascades by plane. From there, the research team disappears, and despite the efforts of law enforcement officials and the local rescue party, they are absent for some time. While one of the passengers is walking, the below-red-like images are splashed on screen (a La Pridettor) which seems to be the reason for fate of the legendary Saskatchera passengers. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Nows (Henriksen), CEO of Bekkamp Industries and father of crash victim's father Noules gathered his own search and rescue team with a clear mission to find his daughter and other researchers, as well as lost precious technology during the crash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep myself literally to fall asleep during this movie because it tried to frighten me from my wit. Henriken was the only member of Henriken's own cast, which is not made for lack of depth in all other letters. The effects of the above words were annoying as well; Basically, I do not know whether I was watching a movie about Bigfoot or Greenery Beer. <br /> <br /> There was no big plot line. The audience mainly influences some of the common horror songs of style, because it was very helpful. Obviously, you will cut off all their clothes through film, or you will not have to be a genius to determine who will be the first unfortunate soul to slap with Mr. Saskatcheck. There is no one as good points, and so I gave this movie 2 out of 10.
