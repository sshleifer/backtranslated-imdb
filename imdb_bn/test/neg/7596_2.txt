There was a isolation in many ways. The location of filming in Ireland, though sometimes quite beautiful, can not save this uncertain flick. Greg Evigon and Alexander Paul, married couples are trying to return to their marriage and those who are heritage palaces are not just interesting characters. Paul became incredibly annoying at the end of the movie, and one wants that he just kept silent and silently, as if he was just shouting like an Olympic event! Other problems in this film are diverse sections that do not have anything to do with the origin of the film, such as the order of surplus with two clean women and the woman in a bed on her shoulder, with a new-knit hand on the new body. Although the woman is doing it in a fair amount, it is nothing but storytelling. Someone thinks the production team needs to finish out a brief running time pad and the rest is padding and tossing a bit at T & A. CGI Impact Cartoon as well as flamboyant Finnish protagonist, including executive producer Roger Corman's much earlier and much higher film, the Usher's House collapse in its void. Any effort to pull the truth and the mysteries, and consequently cool, these are throwing out windows in the low budget bust. If you like Ireland's images, you can find something here, but you'd better rent or travel. Leave this until you are arbitrary and the plot is secondary. Hire another low budget ghost story (if you can find it) in The Woman in Black and see how well and scary a movie can be. It was a waste opportunity.
