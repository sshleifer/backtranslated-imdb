"Snow Snow" is a playful start. A traveler has been told by his old fianc√©e, who thinks the prophecies are surprisingly correct. The movie has played like a swollen "Twilight Zone" episode from this point. I mean nothing except car trips, phone calls and parania. William Finkner has given his usual lucrative performance, but Guy Pierce's other sympathetic character by ignoring other people's love for his sympathy. The last long suffering is absolutely weak, especially with no payoff for the audience. Avoid yourself on a bigger side and this one. Not recommended. - Mr.
