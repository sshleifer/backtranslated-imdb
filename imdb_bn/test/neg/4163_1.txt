I just finished watching this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is very annoying that I have zoomed it on my X2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. I was not just frustrated, but I wasted my money to get angry. I have ever seen it among the top five of the worst movies and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. Before I could not read the DVD Slave cover, I could not read it first, I was completely lost throughout this movie. I did not think that Tim Robinson would agree to appear in this film after making such a good film "Shawshank Redemption".
