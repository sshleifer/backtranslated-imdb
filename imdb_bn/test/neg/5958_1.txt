One of the latest (disaster) movies from York Entertainment, "El Chupacabra", wants his audience to die after two hours of watching it disappear. This movie generally appears to be depicted with an extra camcoder used for birthday parties. The only reason it was not because of the cameraman's shadow frame was due to some scenes. <br /> <br /> This film is very painful about every aspect of the movie and I'm sure that the film industry is set back in another ten years. Actors are outlined in length, they often break while waiting to change off-screen cue cards. Actor actor in Nervo does not waste the word in his conversation and avoids the word, but Swiss-cheese makes a quarrel with the plot line and sees a shocking look on his face. Other actors break the wall outside and show a performance of twelve-year-old kids as a whole, a science project outside their home. <br /> <br /> My friends and I intentionally find the worst possible movies and this gave us more bargained more for us. The ridiculous part is strange and the other is riddled with terrible clich√©s and plot holes. A friend keeps it so humble, this film is an extended embryo of the industry. I highly recommend for these movies that deliberately search for these movies, but beware for everyone else!
