"Shadows and Fog" is definitely one of Woody Allen's weakest films, "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (though none of Alan's "other things" is equal to the horror). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" Allen's German expressionist-style film making style, stark and stylized light and shadow ... and you guessed it ... a lot of fog. But you can catch Allen in technique and parody and forget about caring for any movie. Thankfully, he created "husband and wife" in the same year, so we do not have a total washing system for him. <br /> <br /> Grade: D.
