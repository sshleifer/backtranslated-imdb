I think it will be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content, but for the "funny comedy", it seems to be laughing thrice three times during "Green Checkers". Hilarity is a bad way, which is centered around cancer and mental disorder, is just sick humor. <br /> <br /> I should walk away from this film and I'm not kicked myself because I do not. Actually, I did not see this movie in the first place. The only good that came from this image was that Bijene and his brother finally corrected their ugly past behind them. I suggest a good meaningful person for running this clean out flick out.
