Hey Jessie Jive, I saw it straight straight forward comedy skit but I saw it and it's free and clear? Did i miss something If there is any racist comments in the black community, it should be done if you should do it on TV shows and if you read my previous comments, then I am not easily guilty. The basic plot is an African / American movie next to this white man and they create these racist comments such as a room price will leave only black neighborhoods and White Gaya references will be preferred (if you are easily influenced by ethnic sluras) Non-Nog Junky Boy Sambo Not there. (I apologize but actually a guy who happened to be on this show that I'm fine with the black community) People may say that has brightened, but even when you accept ethnic slurs, it is not funny, new jokes have played poorly. In one episode I swear by somebody that some of the unconventional issues with the situation. In all the awesome comedy.
