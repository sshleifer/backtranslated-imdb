So, you've seen Romero movie, yes? And you saw Jacob's ladder, right? And the next heliher movie? All right, now let us create a movie between three, just jam everything together and make a whole big mess, sounds like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Of course God-awful. Yes, this is an indie flick, who gives a shit? Is that a passage to the filmmaker separation? Attempts to establish credibility by focusing on film character interaction, that is much clearer. Unfortunately for the authors, they do not have good character interaction. This is not the death of living; Characters scream and shout each other with their zero lines in an unsuccessful attempts to catch the strangers by microphones. Dialogue is not interesting. For a film that focuses more on the character's interaction, you think that "what we're going to do" would be to say something of the character "I do not know" "We're going to do something" Well, what are we going to do? "" I do not know. "" We must leave. "" Just accept our fate. "" No, we must go. "" Well let's leave. "" No, maybe we have to stay. "< br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture does not have an exchange, there is a lack of exchange in this movie that reaches the level of laziness and immorality. <br /> <br /> This movie It's half a dream, and it really has zero purpose. There is nothing in the dream anything in the rest of the movie. The author can not decide whether to create a junky film or giant film, and so both of them have made it, it's ridiculous, the book's steady tactics, and it's funny humorous, especially I'm sure they leaked the idea from Jacob's stairs. Which has managed the concept of hell with much more skill than this joke. <br /> <br /> And then there is an edit.   মটিভি পর্যবেক্ষনের বছর এবং ভয়াবহ-থিমযুক্ত ভিডিও গেমগুলি খেলতে অবশ্যই চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাতাকে অনুপ্রাণিত করতে হবে, তবে অবশ্যই এটি একটি দুঃখজনক বিষয় যা তারা বুঝতে পারছেন না যে মিডিয়াগুলির সেই টুকরো টুকরা সম্পাদনা এবং অস্থিরতা কীভাবে প্রথম স্থানে কার্যকর হয়। In this picture, you will often get confused, not good, on the path to David Lynch, but in the worst case "I thought he was dead, did not he?" Then who was this? Wait, where is that guy? Did he come? How did they come here? "The kind of way it is constant and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This movie should be a ridiculous piece of trash and only if you want to get a trash with just a few friends. <br /> <br /> And a final note As: "Humor" Since people are talking in another review, it's all unrecognizable, not only the comedy is the only deliberate piece of the film, because it is supposed to be a great serious character, because the film The manufacturers want to have credibility in their awful idea. Unfortunately, they did not match their power pretensions.
