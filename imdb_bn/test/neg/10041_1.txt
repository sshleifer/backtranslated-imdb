Bell Witch Hunting (Wake the Hunts) is an American horror film based on the real events that took place between 1817 and 1821. <br /> <br /> It's not confusing with Bell Witch: Movie, based on a similar incident, Betsy Palmer starring the movie. However, I can say that I saw that I saw this other movie! I enjoyed Batsy Palmer's cool performance on the 13th Friday. For example, I believe that even on a bad day, she will stop her performance better than any person involved in Travelogue known as HAUNT. <br /> <br /> This movie is not painful about my title to see the annoying reasons. It's painful to see because it's simply boring annoying. <br /> <br /> I can only identify three possibilities to read the positive reviews of this movie. The first possibility - this author was involved in producing some ways. Second Chance - The authors were not directly involved in writing positive reviews right after the completion. The final prospect - these authors have not seen enough horror films and are therefore inexperienced with the idea of ​​successful attempts. <br /> <br /> Robertson County, Tennessee setting up the plot. James Johnston received a visit from two journalists interested in Bell Story's story. The story is called as a flashback series. There is a supernatural incident in John Bell and his family home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While the brightest concept is concerned, just go wrong about everything that could go wrong. And then something! <br /> <br /> First, acting. Almost equally terrible rights across the acting board This factor is the biggest loss of the product, reducing the possible credibility of the viewer's share of faith or interest. The voice of vengeful attitudes sounds like a teenager more like a teenager than a girl, but a strong giant force expresses an insulting intention. I almost heard some of his lines when I laughed. Unfortunately, this voice started to become very annoying very soon! I was not living in the 1800s, but I believe that any young woman living at that time will do this "ghost"! <br /> <br /> Second, directive. The direction is suddenly and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but are potentially squandered by inexperienced directors. Intensity can not be added to the scene with the help of the camera to be awesome with a word or skin. The atmosphere is flat plane. A vengeance spirit is supposed to be behind the supernatural incidents. Yet these effects are so incredibly unknown that none of the real horror movies they will be bought in them. I would give an example. One scene, the soul attack someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost <br /> <br /> Third, the script. Although it is seen that the programs are faithful to accounts of actual events, it can not be denied that most views are incredibly flat and annoying. Two minutes of small scenes, much more thanks to poor dialogue - dialogue failing to provide depth or depth of the story. The story of this movie is very much dependent on the progress of the conversation. In the 1960s and 1970s, British films from the British horror of Hyderabad had this style, it can not be denied that in exchange for dialogue, they were always more attractive in earlier works. Peter Cushing, for example, could read a telephone directory and could capture the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " A fat boy is a lot junk butt. A special horror scene saw the boy go outside to the toilet. This scene was never supposed to be included - but if you fail to understand what you're doing, it's done with sound effects! <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of the movie is location and clothing. Some authentication has been added to the decision to shoot the image near the original location. Clothing is also well selected. <br /> <br /> Overall, HAUNT is an insulting movie. It's not even "good to get it so bad" in the league. It's just boring instead. I advise to save them money and avoid this movie like plug-in. Do not even bother watching it for free! <br /> <br /> I have never seen another movie about Bell Witch. But it can not really be worse than damage. What could it be? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A good place to start the Legends of Hanghouses, Changing, Rango, Grudge (Japanese origin) and a Missed call (Japanese origin).
