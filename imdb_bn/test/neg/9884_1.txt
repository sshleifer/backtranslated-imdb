This movie was boring. Just like the underworld, even less interesting. It's not much of a Verubob film and is not close to a horror movie. The lead couple was annoying. I do not fully care for Vivian and Aiden. And the development of such a small character was that I was not concerned about any character in the film. The plot paper was thin. The conversion was essentially nil. I liked like wolves, as well as a wolf documentary, I liked it well. I would not recommend this movie. I do not find it fun or interesting. It just drags and it's an annoying drag to everyone. This film can win a prize not to make a variant film.
