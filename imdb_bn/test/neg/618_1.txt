Lance Henriquesen is known as the top name of a B-movie, even in this case, alongside Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Biker. Always he has done a great job of being a bad guy, but the plot is very bad (do not even start me with even ending). And performing so horrible it can actually be a thing of beauty. Is it just me, or do I think Joe Dawn Baker was split in the movie at the last moment? Also, the glass can be broken at any time in this movie, the edit is anti-wonderful. Finally, after seeing this, I think David Warner is going to finally get green light for the train 2.0. Unfortunately for Faluny, this third movie will give me a rating of 1/10, I'll join Iron Eagle IV and no mercy.
