An extremely pompous and full of ridiculous spectrum-filled horror that Ana Paukin refuses to fight a neurotrically "things-in-the-in-the-dark" war, which has intensified her and her family in front. Spain in their new home (?!) "The Shining" and most notably "The Darkness" is much less than the geographically re-wrapped off-the-counter, poorly-plotted "dark" is basically a matching B-horror feature with your predecessor. It is seen by the audience that scares a mile off (so to speak)! In retrospect I think that I should not have been as good as my personal expectations for this film. It was actually famous that it was blocked for about three years. Last year was released throughout the American movie throughout Christmas. Till the end, what was the country of ticket sales and the critically criticized critics. Will filmmakers ever know that there is more to filmmaking (this is awful or otherwise) more likely to have a little financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Star)
