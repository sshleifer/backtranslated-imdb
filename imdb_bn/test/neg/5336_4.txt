Prior to "34th Street Shining", Maoriin Wahra and John Pane created this picture. I'm going to describe it, but I can not find the word for how bad this movie is. The issue of childhood and Maureen's illness is both very serious and sensitive, but it can be done much better than this. Its screenplay was so extreme that it did not come in real terms. Probably his problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a painting takes a novel and creates a weak film. (See the review of "a stranger in my weapon.") The beautiful waah was often saddled with such clunkers, another one of the Britannica Mews, which I can finally review. <br /> <br /> If you have any such emotional connection from your childhood, then you will be kind to these harsh, colorless and lazy movies. But to do something like that, maybe you can find his TV-movie remake. It will be good. Car
