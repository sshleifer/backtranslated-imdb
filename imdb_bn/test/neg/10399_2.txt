I was not surprised that Michael Moore or Bill Maure was involved in this "movie". Democracy in the hell on the list of an American leftist ferrous laundry grinded with a distinct spareness. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not make any appearance in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps for these California spin doctors, Paradiso will have to wait for coupons to show their children's political personality. <br /> <br /> Good shots in religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyist, Fox News, even SEO. All fundamentalist leftist conversations were completely covered - although there was no conscious effort - except for mentioning the wrong actions from "the other side of the shoots". The single exception in one and a half hour I noticed, JF always has sex with Marilyn Monroe: The propaganda pieces include a kind effort to share partnership partnership.
