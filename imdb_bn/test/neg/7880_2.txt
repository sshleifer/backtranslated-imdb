I'm sick of the "open mind" argument. I'm usually quite open, but this type of line basically produces people who should not enjoy it. You know, for that reason many are hateful. And since there is not so much any reason there so much. Always, the reason for the existence of hate feeling, and no amount of "open mind" or "crushing" should not leave that feeling away. Otherwise we are not better than foolish things. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Another argument is that this movie generally plays a protected role for women, which is why people do not like it. But it proves rebellion for more people than others because otherwise it does not look great. Should not be made by people who influence the film industry, but do women have the same answer? Maybe, if you do not like so much sexual orientation in movies, TVs and entertainment, then do not see them so much violence. <br /> <br /> And if you're a manager, don '<br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
