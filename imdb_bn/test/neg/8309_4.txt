I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the lady villain in this movie had lots of hair. Whenever he was on screen, I could not concentrate without his hair. Take the stage of attendance! Many people thought of hearing the problem in this movie. A traffic warden wrote a parking ticket, some of whom had somebody else, some of whom had none of them. Then there was a guy in a phone booth, who could not hear his coming up a huge bulldozer 5 feet away. All Hitman in this movie seemed a bit deaf, nobody could tear on them. The hero of this movie was so ridiculous and ineffective that it was funny. Bar Wars were quite funny. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend have just been sexually and judged from their expression, it was not good for one of them. It smiles me out loud If you want to see many bad films (with some decent people), then this film has 50 movie pack martial arts sets.
