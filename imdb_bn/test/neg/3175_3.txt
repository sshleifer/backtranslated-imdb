For me, this is not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. However, it is annoying in n.d. There are a few reasons for this, in a special order. First, the most pointless and ever annoying character, Batmite.This character is no objective for the show, none. It is intended as a comic relief, but it does not work as it does. Joker.ixt up, Joker.i was thinking that her really ridiculous character would leave her with a ridiculous smile after almost every sentence. Tell me about the repetition. It gets old old. Even that does not seem to have acted as the right actor. It's not like a joker, sound.lastly, they look like Robin's whole dark. Even more than these problems, the show is not bad. But big problems to reduce this background For me, "Batman's new expedition" is a 3/10, the best.
