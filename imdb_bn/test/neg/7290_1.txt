I want to find some good things about this animated seagullle (but not really a sequel) "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" but it's a very small comment. The first magician found is not available here. Animation is very poor at all, the letters are not very well drawn. Backgrounds and forums are also not good. There is very little attention here. And instead of an engaging and engaging story, our three short stories that are annoying and do not make much sense. I swear, even the letters disappear and they can be anywhere else. They say that the voice actor wanted to be disturbed somewhere else, at least this is the impression. Some performers come back for this neutral effort, but Michael J. is an integral part of the first success. Fox's main protagonist Milo Thatch. I threw this movie together. Many thoughts or care for achieving first success. But at least the Krym summer comes back as the word "kidnapper". Probably the only good thing in this movie, and even its heart does not seem completely completely. You think, I guess you can not blame a cast for considering what work was going to do with them. Rather do not work with it. This is a direct video movie (and I use this term) which went straight to the nearest landfill. For example, the shame on Disney consumers deserve much better than this. This is one that gets 0/10 and a good fit one.
