It was not a good movie !! Why are you talking about this? A nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then left vampires !!! Why? Why is the vampire? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! All of these are "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random boys influence them all. Very fast There was not a long battle scene with many struggles. Only three people died from bars, such as a lean man died, killed the skin! The next thing is that you know, the clonies and fools are rescued by the chew, and in the middle of Mexico, families leave less homeless. At the end of the story. Literally. Oh and Strip Club were the Aztec temples which are interesting because it is not the southern Mexico border. Why are you lying to people and people this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or even watch this movie in a friend's house. You had that time in your life back.
