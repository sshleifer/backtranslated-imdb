If you do not see the first one, you must tell at least one person and tell you that it was painful. It was not good to say anything about this. So what's different with the second? Why bother making a sequel for a movie? Do not take this one very seriously. It is designed for TV and does not try to influence with great or serious dialogue. The moments where it tries to be 'serious' or 'intense', these moments are so ridiculous that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, there is no material on the left and it comes from any source video game (of course without title). Do not go to this movie until they expect something remarkable from your friends until they are interested in building camps, lam zombies, or a beverage game outside this movie. Whenever Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother, take two shots! Instead of pumping three pumps into the chest, take a shot even if the bullet is a good place on the head of a jumbo! Etc. etc.
