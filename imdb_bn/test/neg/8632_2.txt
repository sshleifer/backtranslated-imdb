If I have to choose the most sad movie, then I have seen it that I want to see it. If I know the real thing is good, then it would be better. The film is so dark and depressing but it is not interesting to watch - I have seen frustrating "Thriller" type films which were preserved due to dark quality reflections and mysteries for rolling. It was not the vanishing, it was so annoying to see at the beginning and it was not a positive thing to create a classic type movie. I think another IMDB poster correctly states that this series has only seen the thrillers at a great distance. I totally agree - I would recommend avoiding it - maybe I'll come for some time but I doubt it. I have a 10 out of this 2.
