The title, though singular, will undoubtedly remind the real fearful fans of Todd Browning Amar Klassic about an army of circus friction and how they misunderstood the outside world. But I can assure you that there is nothing to do with this "thing" "Freaks" or even the film making industry in general. This film was recommended to me, because it is worrying despite the raw, annoying and low budget production quality. Yes ok The person who suggested this to me may consider myself as my personal enemy! The low budget factor is accurate, but that's about it up to me. "Freak" is made horribly slow, created badly and undoubtedly impossible for each character to be introduced ?? And there is misunderstanding in it. On the way to new lifelines, two siblings face a disturbed mental patient, who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and killed his mother at the age of 9 and returned home. It can be an attractive slash with well-cut painter locations. But, instead, Tyler Sharp decided to make it a boring and unmatched family drama. The limited actress' emotionally devastating appearance is quite ridiculous and suspense and total lack of action can be limited to restricted budgets. Total failure!
