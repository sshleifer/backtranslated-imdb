I grew up in the 90's; Therefore, you certainly understand that I have seen the greatest DCOM's premieres. When I was brink! Appearance, Zenon, Holienutown, Johnny Tsunami, etc., this movie constitutes my childhood. When these movies came, not only to me, but to anyone who I saw them scared for 1h30, would talk about it for the week and catch it again the next weekend. I do not think the words Disney can bring the amount of excitement that can be found. <br /> <br /> Even when I see them, the dialog does not seem to be bad (actually, I remember the conversation part of the conversation that I saw ten years ago). The characters have been credible, interesting, a little bit of stratipype, but it creates Disney's elegance ... <br /> <br /> I tried to try my little vita in front of Disney Channel and realized my feelings. For DCOMs. Put the suburbs stuck ... My brother looked at me a little surprised and asked, if I am always gay I was more frustrated and betrayal from now on, could I compare this? When Han Solo found Lando sold him to Vader ... <br /> <br /> half movie, and I did not have too much, among these young actors of flashbacks There is no talent (which is bigger than anything else). The plot is ridiculous; It seems like a group of old, rolling corporate people in Disney are sitting around a table and ask themselves, "How can we think of these young people a hip?" All right, maybe all DCOMs were like this, but at least they do not think that we are completely fools. <br /> <br /> And apparently this movie works ... The stuck in the pedestrians is almost the same as the Ginone or Airborne. How is it possible? DCOM got even cheesier and people like them now? (Although obviously lacking of curse words it is enough to provide 10/10 for some people) Christ, this is a completely different generation.
