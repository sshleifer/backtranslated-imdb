I thought it was "the finishing thriller". But the thriller like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. They want to take it very seriously but what is the importance of child behavior or the thriller's plot? This special child is being seen - I mean ... Thriller - I understand why critics refer to it as a "Hitachchian Thriller"; They may be called "idiotics" for it, which means "Hitcchian" in the dictionary of the movie (it will look me if you do not believe me). Soundtrack Even Old School Hollywood is a mistake: It does not fit in the film in the late 70's and it looks harmful. Along with this, how did they change the idea of ​​stealing from Hitacho? The story is weird Scheider's wife was killed, and her assassins are not a problem. Instead, first his former employers followed him closely, and later decided to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? There is no explanation. Probably because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-files"), which is very tricky to stop its former workers due to pension funds. Or perhaps it is a fashionable reason to kill the scanner in this movie; Everyone seems to be after him. And poor vague visitors are reasonably trying to discover this mystery through the notion that there is a main conspiracy, actually the killer ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman who occupies the fourth quarter of SkyDream; He briefly hinted that one was "depressed". Why does he go behind SkyDay right after the assassination of his wife and she follows her ex-employer - and not a few years ago or a few years after the murder of a wife? A pure hitchcockian (look at it again in the dictionary, if you forgot what it means) coincidence. And its bright purpose ...! In New York, a 15-year-old virgin girl was forced to prostrate to her grandmother and then syphilized with a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of whom - ta-dah! - Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin plays a hukur for his spare time (among other things) to kill all the descendants of a man who ruthlessly syphilize his single-grandmother. How is that hitchcockian (look it) that? Mount Rushmore's view is "shamefully ending" from the "last northern northwest", except for a killer of love and he will not live. <br/> <br/> The film gives some suspicious / off-offers - the KILTER dialog and some not so great acting. Check out the shameless and obvious ways to follow the skydays in silent graveyard. Come, do not forget the moral plot to reach for the Napier jacket and hold his hand very doubtful - but it was not a gun! How bright! Napier in the tower: Now, there is another string of unreasonable behavioral patterns. J. Dame was there, and always without the styling director, without the fliers, and the person who managed "Philadelphia". Give him another Oscar!
