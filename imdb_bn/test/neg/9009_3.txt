I have now tried to write an intriguing summary for a few minutes and it does not seem to be. But with a bad film as Blood Best Night, the plot is rarely important. An astronaut is believed to crash land and dead. His body reanimates after, but some strange alien life forms are found to carry the embryo. But how do they get there? And where is the migration of Mizan John Corcoran's body that is strange to the alien? <br /> <br /> The IMDB lists the nighttime runtime of Blight Beast in 62 minutes. Is this right? 62 minutes? That would be no longer than that. It felt me ​​intermediate. Even the MST3 commentary (which was very funny), the actual film was felt a lot more. And it's quite a snoozer from the beginning to the end. I liked many of this 50's airborne attack type movies, but this one. It failed to grab my interest at any level. The baby Alien was too stupid to take seriously, the famous bloodless man was unfortunate, and no letter did anything for me. Add to the normal low-budget Roger Crompton Trapping and you're actually damaged by a movie.
