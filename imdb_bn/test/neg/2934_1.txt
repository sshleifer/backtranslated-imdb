I want to vomit in & out. I have not seen such a shameful movie! It used to say seriously that some homosexuals are remarkable and joyful, but there is no idea how to say it. It was not a comedy for me, as long as the rude, sick joke laughs for a little to laugh. <br /> <br /> From the movie I have seen, this film is four (4) a) The character of Matt Dillian, as he has gone to former teacher, Howard Braket (Kevin Kline), he announced to the world. McDillian's character won Oscars as an awesome role, it is not an incredible thing. But why would he say that? Finally, it was not a problem with Howard's students, his friends, family, or his finances. Someone Then why would he say something that was not true? More on the point, why did not the movie give us the answer? Because there is no answer, because no one is provided for the benefit of the plot. The second (B) error is that the movie seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relation of the same sex members. Barbara Streisand being gay in this movie is passionate about music and literature. It is based on all the stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these errors are filled again that must be-displayed-credible graduation ceremony. Matt DeLion asked about the tension in this little town and the film is excited to show him what he said. When he attended the program, he did not say anything, and I wondered why he came here on earth. She does not solve anything. Then the audience was standing in front of all the announcements when they were gay, I was so moved I wanted to throw! These people who stared at the stereootype to make Howard gay. Did the film forget that it was used to show that it was gay gay. They shot only on the feet of filmmakers! But wait even more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (C) Howarda was facing trial in losing his job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. What this picture meant to say that homosexuals never employ, and he will not affect his students. But did we not see Tom Seleck's character repeatedly pressing Howard, even when unexpectedly kissing him, while coming out of the cottage, was there no coat in my mind? From that film, the film clearly shows that eligible for homosexual recruitment. The image shot himself again on the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) When Howard came out of Colette, did anyone see how the scrappall stopped him for the rest of the film? I counted the following three lines: "Yes!" To his parents, "Hi there!" A student, and "are you ready?" Tom Selleck before the last reverse scene. I could be less by one, but the point is that she is not allowed to tell us what she decided to be gay. I wanted to know what was on her head, because I sometimes did not believe that she was gay. <br /> <br /> There are several offensive scenes in the movie as a bonus. Howarda admits that a friend (who) is involved in a confession, asking for a priest without consulting his or her fiancée. "Does that make him gay?" He questioned. The priest responded "Oh yes, he is definitely gay". Ohhhh Or what about this scene when all elderly women are gathered to Howard's mother that she will not have to be sorry about her son's deep, dark secret, because ... everyone has them. Then a female woman admits that she never saw "Madison County Bridge". Ridiculous? No! The film betweys that it is anesthetized and it can not be announced to any member of a member that he is gay I know. A few of my friends are gay, and none of their families have accepted it well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , The camera slowly stood in front of the church ... when you did not think! I was totally disgusted with that point, and I could never forgive the ill joke. There is nothing against my homosexuality or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" what they said were very honest and true. "In and Out" is just screaming for political holiness, but its core has no idea of ​​corruption. What I collected from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% is gay, which means that you have little doubt, then you definitely go. It's becoming an influential feature of genetics like homosexuality. In fact if everyone tells you over you that you are worthless and stupid, you will finally believe it, so do not? Howard Barket's case of homosexuality has happened. I leave the theater sad and angry. In fact the whole weekend anger This is a seriously ill and cruel film, the world of 1997.
