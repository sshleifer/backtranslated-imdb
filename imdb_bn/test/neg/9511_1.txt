Shakespeare's delight is that there can not be any specific performance - can there be any single performance? Right ', but something could be wrong, and it's one Hamlet has at least two things that can not be expressed: 1. The inability to take his unwillingness and any kind of action. It ends until the end of God's request. If Othello is in place of Hamlet, then Claudius will die at the end of Act One. Why is Hamlet delayed, why any production has to try to explain, why he is not eligible to be operationalized. 2. Its sexual hatred. His mother and uncle raised his entire rebellion with full hatred for sex in wake of wake up to bed and that means no relationship with Afilia is impossible. At the slightest indication of gender, threw Hamlet. So, does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty action-man If you try, you can not get more from Hamlet's character. Hamlet can play in many ways playing, but it is not one of them! I do not understand that they could get good actors for other parts - Chlodius, Polonius and why did they not play Hamlet? Mark Reliance in the part will make this a great film. what is this? Mel Gibson, whoever he left, completely cast. And to face it, the princess without Hamlet really does not work.
