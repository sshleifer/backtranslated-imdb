First off, tell me I wasted the Halloween movie night by watching this garbage. Secondly, I would like to inform you that current DVD available by Shookk show is not invalid, so you will be very annoyed with the holes. Third, this scene is the highlight of the film and even after spending it, you see where you are going. <br /> <br /> I know that many ghost fans dig this movie. It's atmospheric, some very beautiful scenery, waterfalls and such as in the jungle shots. But after the initial murder, a hunter has got a very serious shot from a masseur, after which you do not kill a real barbaric. And, with a slash movie, you like that kind of. At least, I do. Director and co. Most of the kind of movie was created at the same time early in the detention in the jungle, with nothing new with the murderer. The only thing for this is that you do not hate actors in other movies. They are the desired sort of. There are reasons for having kids: one of them works on some of the hill property. But it can not be explained why his family has the property. If there is no cabin or house, then why buy the property in the Eastern Isha, especially if you are not a hunter? Well, I'm sure some people have bought land for camping, but it seems unusual. However, two squealing backwoods begin to show inbred and stalking campers and start picking them one by one. And, as I said before, you did not get much on the path of a beautiful death after killing Moshete at the beginning. Finally, the wall of the Kenyan wall has been destroyed, but it is a completely forgotten movie, The Forest, which is mind-charming. It is not enough to save it to be almost equal. <br /> <br /> This review may be forgiving if the Shayk Show is able to get a really unauthorized print, but it is like the day and age of the ineffective / unauthorized DVD release of old films of cine-hounds like me. When you get us a little, you get crud review. Sadly, the presence of the great Father George Kennedy was the only brightness of this movie that was separated from the other trash of the garden and brought it back in the daytime.
