This saw and was just disappointed at the Madison Horror Film Festival. Some disappointing, funny moments (Hollal Kara, Dreamland's Piss Harry Phishing) and two competing attractive premises (heading a mythological character with a belief like a new nightmare and heading with a fiction about him at the Lost Highway) but did not have long movement Movement and development of intrinsically plot. Using the dream framework or mental fugue state you are not only making it Lynchian. You need interesting visual and weird performance. <br /> <br /> Positive topic: Dr. Mightland had a real sunny time and all the girls were very nice. Karla's father, Chalmaar and Ingrid Pitt felt that they got some fun. And Tom Savini seemed to have seen at least that his lines were memorable and he could not see if he was just getting a coupe card. <br /> <br /> I got the reference to Hammer, but it seems that the director realized that the script was a snoozer and he could keep together whatever footage tried to smile something out and added some shocks. But they do not work because they make very little and far away and inconsistent tone. Condense it in all 30 minutes of fun activities and you can have an exaggerated fool short but leave it on the length of the feature. It's "very bad it's not good" it's simply "annoying so bad".
