There is nothing real, human or insightful in this movie. Acting averages, images are amateur, lack of writing and scenes are very basic ... something close to a soap. <br /> <br /> On 2: 37, a suicide is used to launch the film, a mystery drama. We partially see because we want to know who dies. Each character has problems with each and the film shows how bad each problem is for them, but as a way of transferring them to a place where you think they can kill themselves. There are no other ways to view events even though the cameras offered different views on what events. So at 2:37, arseholes are arseholes, angels are angels. This is the simplest thing. Without this complexity, the film appears as a visual story of young sex and violence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Still, filmmakers and distributors use a friend at every opportunity to legitimize the movie, but they never talk about Gass Van Sant or elephant. IMDb's positive posts can not be avoided by avoiding any mention of it, or simply do not value fundamentalism. If you want something with heart and voice, avoid this part of youth exploitation. I was surprised to see the filmmakers' age when I went out after watching this movie - I made it 13 years old. I have always known that 20 contemporaries are engaged in lifting the work of an old man to try to reveal something real among them.
