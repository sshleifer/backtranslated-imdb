*** SPOILERS *** *** SPILILERS *** There is not much that can be said about this early-talkie flick. (I'm not hesitant to say "Simron" to "Film", because I think the term is very clear.) But what about it ... mainly talking about it. <br /> <br /> For example, excessive use of Indians to portray as bad people. In one scene, the little boy from the main character of Flickr - a man of very high and ambitious family who wants to set up a newspaper business - just playing outside his father's office. Kneeling in front of an Indian child. "Hello," the boy tells Indians very kindly. Indian gives him a feather, standing up and walking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Mummy!" He shouted, hold the Indian gift. "Look, what an Indian has given me!" <br /> <br /> "How often I tell you!" He snaps at the boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, at the beginning of the story, he has a specific plan to give his family a better life. But, we soon discovered that he is not even better than achiever - very few moral people are humans. A slogan of his slave, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a spoken language. <br /> <br /> On Sunday morning, during his family's first trip to the church service - <br /> <br /> Strange, crazy lectures are offered - Isaiah tries to come along, such as Cravat, long tail suit, holster, gun and All Crave tells him to go home. "Yes" do not everyone want me to come with the Young Church? Isaiah said with a jute. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat corrected him, patting him on the shoulders. "You do not understand! I want you to stay and watch the house and if anyone comes along ... you shoot him off!" <br /> <br /> Characters - Not to mention the actors - "Simron" <br /> <br /> Despite their obvious efforts, the barrel can come out of sacks. And the script was nothing, very appreciable, too. (Approved: The strange Adna May Oliver - the infamous for playing Red Quinn in Alice in Wonderland, released in 1931 - looks really good, a poppy shows the old woman's screenplay, which she is also known for her best.) But, far away from her, well ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He and his wife (Irene Dunne) are helplessly walking to decide to stop the white hat of the craft. In spite of his anger with the bullet expelled man, Cravat just took it completely. <br /> <br /> This story is not only "Shooting for the reality" but it was too <br /> <br /> Some important areas are lacking: For example, Crawet's magazine is not really seen. (Bulletin and poster, yes - but there is no newspaper.) <br /> <br /> Probably everyone is weird, though it is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > For some reason or for some reason, Yancey Kratz <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Clive Westerns, Dime-D-dozen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shame. <br /> <br />
