Where do you start? Some people have some Indian dishes that they clean, and suddenly attack the scalar. She hits a woman in the neck with an ax, she falls down, but then she gets up and is apparently uninjured. She runs in the woods, and there it is found out there is a shopping center basement there in the woods. He met again a utility worker and skeletor attack. Thankfully, like a good utility worker, he guns and shoots the guy. It does not work, everything starts out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " They probably do not meet when they first? However, they are members of the Delta team "secret" (secret, I guess, because in this way they do not have to wear them in uniforms). Cute girls have different things such as a sniper school trainer and, oh, I can not think of the rest. It does not matter. Eventually they all take their guns and immediately begin to notice their various things. ? However, they are sitting in woods who meet an old Indian. She wants the beans. You know, like pork and beans? She mumbles some things, I can only assume that it demonstrates the movie. I heard the prizes from advertising, because he did not understand what he really was saying. <br /> <br /> So, they wander around some jungle. All the conversations have a group of military, macho BS I mean it all, as every single word. Like "It reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "When we reminded it in Laos". Skeletor attack again Let me give you a rundown of basic attack. A woman is walking behind a tree in her character and on the horse she sees her gun. For some reason, he does not fire but yells several times for anyone else. After reaching Schlatter, he jumps from behind the tree so that the scalter can stop him with his spear. Then everyone started shooting. Because the bullet flarks to fly from the tree. Apparently those who made this movie never shot a tree with bullets. They do not make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then the Caspar van tried to run the skater on a van, and was suddenly running a semi-truck. She missed, and a stop slide on the truck. Van Dyhem was injured, apparently he made slides across the seat and tied his hing with a window or something, so he left the truck and it exploded. After being killed, wild people and everyone says, the military, Macho BS They meet some wooden people and immediately identify their "secret" status as a military force. They beat the boy for some reason, then they went away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, <br /> <br /> My theory is that it is becoming annoying with everyone by severing their films in the Saifai Channel, so they show us how to remind us that bad movies can really be. Like, do you think our movies are bad? Well, you did not look bad. Bad here! Okay, now that we've come out of the way, our remaining movies are relatively good, okay? <br /> <br /> Well, it's a theory.
