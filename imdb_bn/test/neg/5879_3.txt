I picked this movie because it was caught in my eyes as a film with a Jewish comedy focus - which I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> I contacted this image with open mind, and I was interested initially. The opening was done well, and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh, and it is good. <br /> <br /> However, the humor soon to be repeated, the plot became confused and intensified, and I realized I was not enjoying the film. I tried to avoid it, but the film has become rather "cheap" - it is not bad for comedy, but it did not happen even if it did not. I acknowledge that I've missed some jokes, not a Jew, and have had a little experience with Jewish culture. However, considering how comical telegraph was in this film, it is unlikely that I missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This idea is good, and perhaps if it is thought a little bit more then the movie has been able to make all the way watchable. I hope the movie will be able to give high ratings, but strictly saying it has been as good as a TV series or as a series of skit. There was not enough material for a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to talk about casting - the main role seemed to be mind-boggling with Ben Stiler, but I do not think the film was better than it.
