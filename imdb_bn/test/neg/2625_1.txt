I was forced to watch 'Changi' in 10 years of Australian history last year. Looking around the square, 40 students were sleeping in both classes, all the 40 heads in the table remained silent on their side. I believe that because I'm only 16 years old, I do not count my views, because of studying World War II, I just do not feel embarrassed and ashamed to see this Australian piece of this annoying television. I was out of my mind trying hard to apply this mini series using the film material. The performance was poor, the script was very wrong and the score was horrible. Please do not see this movie, it is favorable and very racist (Japan).
