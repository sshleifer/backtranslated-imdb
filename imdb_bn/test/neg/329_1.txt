I've always loved horror flicks. Some common well-known "The Exorcist", like "Black Christmas" or "Just Door Doom", are some of the more common undergraduates. But those who are curious, even this trash is being called a B-movie. It's straight down-the-barrel z-grade. The worst in acting is the film. Really, I've seen better on an episode of "Young and The Best" ... Spell ... when the lady comes to tell them about Jack-o legend, hiding. He sometimes pauses for a few seconds so someone is thrilled with his cou cards and he is struggling to read his lines. A riot! <br /> <br /> Oh, and without bad acting, absolutely no Gore or F / X. And Jack-like looked like a plastic butterfly pumpkin. Look at Liena Quigley in "Night of the Demons", or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", many remote flicks.
