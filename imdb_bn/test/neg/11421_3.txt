Many front stories did not have much thought in the line. This is a good action movie but it's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film says that the lectures were kept to protect blood pressure during the day. Yet they keep in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can not become their wolf or do any other slave work. How does this day protect the vampire? They're protecting from prison? Uncontrolled lycans? Slaves are nothing more than slaves of human beings. <br /> <br /> - I understand that animals are immortal and not age. Even the age of the adults from the age of the golden age of adults. Do they just stop becoming adults in a certain age? I understand that Victor was older because he turned out (explained in second film). But children of vampire age? Weird <br /> <br /> - I did not understand that vampires need to look at the night. Yet we all bear a torch across their movies. <br /> <br /> - Silver is the only thing that can damage leaks. Yet wooden sticks fired from the huge crossbows also killed Likan. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that show the lack of stories.
