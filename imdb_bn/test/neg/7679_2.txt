The main airport (1970) was a classic and the first two B-movie follow-up (airport 1975; airport '77) was the best spectacular fun; But this cross and inactive final entry shows no lack of entertainment value and a frustrating insult for its audience. It's impossible and even good for laughs. All the three "airports" signals were theatrical releases created by Universal Television Wing, but it was under the general criteria of a TV movie of his day, Sultax production, extraordinary casting, visible ugly and tasteless, unfunny "comedy". The project was clearly eliminated with the creative "effort" of "Universal Executive Jennings Lang", which was created personally and gave "stories" credits. <br /> <br /> Everybody starts somewhere, and there may be author Eric Roth (Forrest Gump), an element of self-bureausac was provided, such as previous movies (especially the notorious airport 1975), but Ruth's Troubled, Incompatible Scripts Even the comedy airplanes are not worth the spoofing! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Worst The victim is one of the greatest gifted Sicily Tyson (son of Ms. Jane Pittman), unfortunately, because of her involvement with frozen heart transplant tolerance, she is undoubtedly turned into a barbaric subdivision. Despite being buried in a miserable list, there is a special miserliness of the true leadership of the wonderful George Kennedy. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actress to play in four movies, Kennedy was more than her acting role, and her run of captain's seats could be the only possible reason for this entry. One last buck Kennedy provides the only warmth and original humor in this mechanical makeup, for a short time the Bravo machismo and reveal a truly sweet and flexible aspect, and expressing her lovable and heroic character "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately, we can not forget how much fatty and old and high mountain Kennedy are, and the supermodelous beautiful boy Allen Dellon calls him shamelessly as "the park pig," which is completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this flat-debris, has been set up to make a joke for Petroni, Kennedy and the expensive joke of the horse.
