A wonderful example of what happened to the comedy center after leaving Dave Chapel. Here is the problem of Carlos Mensia. First, his birth name is Node Holence, and at 18, he switched his name to Naden Arnell Mensea. He was born in Honduras, although he worked like a Mexican. She grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> I can forgive all those crap, but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. The concept of stopping some DJs from Miami was stereotype Olympics. He stole jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole the material of George Lopez in his HBB special (13 minutes). <br /> <br /> She thinks that what she's doing is very real, but Dave Chappell and Lisa Lampanelli are cracking the race some years before they become stupid. (Embrace others). <br /> <br /> This event will crash and burn. The term bourgeois can not last long before it is old. He did something new from the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Want to hear a joke? Jumping on a fence in a banger !! It's fun for 3 seasons!" <br /> <br /> <br />
