Star Trek v Star Trek achieved the most discreet differences in the series. Despite the good acting efforts of the actors, it enjoys a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount pictures were not very concerned about this picture. <br /> <br /> The enterprise crew started as an expression to protect the holidays with their extended shores on the world's overall environmental disaster. Intergalactic Peace Planet Nimbus III, when it is a disturbance, the holidays are cut off on their coast. Captain Kirk and Enterprise Nimbus reached third only to hijack their ship with half-brother talk of the speaker. The crew brainwashes of Sybok Enterprise and it sets a suicide mission surrendered with the Great God of the Great Berera "God" in the center of our galaxy. Captain Kick will have to find a way to regain control of his ship and stop the enterprise's clugged fan. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot acting and direction of film. William Shatoner, Leonard Deyyyy, Dofest Kelly, Lawrence Lockinbill, and everyone else gave good performance. William Shatanar also did a nice job to manage this picture. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffers from a lack of enthusiasm and funding. At first, the part of Sibok was initially given to Shan Kanani, but he refused. So, Lawrence got the portion of the lockinbill. Second, the special effects were severely cut back ... reduce the amount of entertainment in the movie. Thirdly, the arrival of the Great Barrier scene is very much visible. Finally, in this film, the romance between Scoti and Uhura was not so sensual ... considering that such a romance never occurred before this point in the star track universe and it has never been explained how such romance can be implemented suddenly. Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a very weak film. You probably skip this picture and go to Star Trek VI. After all, stars and crew star participants partnered Star Trek VI to host themselves after their frustration with Star Trek Vie.
