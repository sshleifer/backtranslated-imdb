Like other critics, I really wanted to like this movie. I went with my father who was the greatest boyfriend and classical musician, but none of us could stand up to this movie. I do not even call it a movie A good story can be a record of a few chamber concert pieces. I think, the camera was not even moved. Rather, I sit on a tripod for the completeness of each piece. The only attempts to dramatic effect were to hide at the end of each piece when the movie was playing in the air in a small wave of sea beaches. I'm sure the director liked to use footage of some big crashing waves, but several inches high lakes nearby and using a stable camera again. Really kind. I can not make this movie more than five When we went out, it was completely mysterious that my father was able to make such a bad film. I do not know any good movies about the batches. The world is really one of the needs, but it does not exist because it is not a reason to see one. Someone will be one day one. Then just keep removing _add_us__.
