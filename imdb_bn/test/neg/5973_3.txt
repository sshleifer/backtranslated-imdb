This documentary title is very confusing. At no time during the documentary, he shows how to introduce blue nail fish in Victoria Lake, there was no problem facing the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to establish Tanzania's problems for environmental reasons, but the fact is that external external energy problems are there. The documentary is very slow with no details what ever. Instead, it relies on the smallest amount of text in any related segments to display some bit or expanded information bits related to the subject. There are only two attempts to spread the environmental impact of the blue parch fish. A small segment of one ten seconds long, where factory managers were interviewed during the fisheries process and he briefly mentioned that 50 years ago blue nest was inserted into the lake and it had eaten other fish species. The filmmaker does not try to take any action on the matter or it does not get deeper into it. The second attempt is in this document when no other effort has been made to illustrate the film showing another documentary showing the blue nail environmental impact, and to expand on how the problem has been devastated. <br /> <br /> This documentary will not have to do with nothing more than nail fishery and most of the problems in the African country will be confronted. The film tries to connect Tanzania's adhesive fish with poverty and pollution, but does not connect directly. Since any intelligent person reads well with African problems, the problems shown here are not unique in Tanzania, but most of Africa is affected and they have no relation to fish. Filmmakers used to see how the local economy or life was before the fish were created and how the filmmakers could have a negative impact, but they would have been better without it. The fact is that in interviews many people say that the fish gave jobs and opportunities for many. Yes things are BAD located in Mwanza town, but they are worse in other parts of the country and the continent than that. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentary makers is disredited by the documentary quickly by connecting famine problems in Tanzania. Tanzania is a very large country in the first and only a small part of the country of Victoria Lake. Most people's interviews really say that they can find jobs in the fishing town of Mwanza in Lakes and feed their families because they were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no description and they do not try to link any link to any blue nail. It plays the role of people's emotions by displaying devastating images of poverty, famine and AIDS, which does not make any attempts to show that none of it relates to Tanzania Lake Victoria region or directly related to fish. In fact, most of the problems are more than fight, globalization and ecological impact of ecological fisheries.
