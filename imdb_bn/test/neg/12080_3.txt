<br /> <br /> This image was released and released as a successor to the Liberation War - although it is fairly popular - the Hollywood beach called Sea Beach Comedy, but there is little or no connection to the previous film, and it is fully evaluated in its own right . It is certainly better than Hardbuds 1, and more closely related to Friday and summer lovers, which were portrayed in the summer of the Greek Islands. The blue beel with beautiful bare bosom creates a combination of delightful beaches for seductive care (except for the trips planned for your next holiday plan), even if these movies have to keep the audience's attention, they need enough stories for a few minutes. On Friday, the Venus was funded by the legacy of the Goddess Rising, and the summer lovers had the effect of "Managed Treas" as their theme. In my view both of these films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which have a very short story line and are very much dependent on the simple semi-snapstick comedy. Slopstick usage quickly becomes tedious, it is usually difficult to integrate into the lines of the ongoing story that leads to a series of very small customized camio sequences. Mel Brooks has achieved this impressively with silent movies, but several other films have also been successful in the same way, and hardbud 2 is not unfortunately. There is also the problem that the slopstick sequences do not merge with the pictorial and peaceful scenes to establish the film. The final airport order was no doubt the purpose of a sunny end for this film, but in my opinion it is one of the worst snake-comedic examples of pseudo-comedy. They are mostly too long, so I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. This is a film that can be more successful with a strong story line, and most of its slopstick sequences spread very heavily. It does not guarantee ratings of more than 3 viewers after it is released. <br /> <br /> A little memorable for acting, but it does the best in the limitation imposed by a short story line and the poor side - this failure in the next area has happened. <br /> <br />
