I had suffered three times through this movie, when I was an additional zombie in the director's new film after the superhough. The first time I saw this movie I was standing beside me and obviously the fake and chessy looking hands did not come out of there and hold one of the characters. I could not stand anymore, laughing in front of the man. There is no direction in the film and one thing that can make this movie beautiful (female nudity) is not available. I was a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was too much for me. The worst part has seen me many times. Also do not expect to be good at the new movie.
