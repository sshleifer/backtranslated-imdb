I usually suspect the benefit of the signal and go easy on them. But this ?? Very poor The same thing happened in the first movie. The exact same Only they want younger kids to see it (this bugs are for the presence of buyer again but why they threw in a 'f * ck' out of it). <br /> <br /> They have not even bothered to change the character of Jackie Mason of Daphffeld. Explain to me, cadmitted Rodney Dufferfield is an ex-real estate owner who has made the upper house of Buschood Country Club mad. Jackie Messon is an ex-Real Estate owner who excites the members of Buswid Country Club in this film. A big effort they have been to modify the script content? No, I do not think so. A very inappropriate Dan Aykroyd is shamefully copying Bill Murray's character. He even went to the same fashion as Murray even after Garrera (now more like a gramlin). <br /> <br /> There is no smile. Sammy of 'Comedy' in this movie: Jackie Mason is preparing for a hot date with Diane Canon. She is in her dress in the bathroom. When he broke the door handle, he went to the door to wear his bedroom clothes? How nice!?! That's the best they can. Eight years to think of a new signal and what we got !! I might have pulled a good script from my ass. <br /> <br /> If you original a die hard fan only see it. This is the only way to get rid of it. Let everyone else clean.
