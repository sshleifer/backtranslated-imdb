If considered as an independent feature, I can not say that it is very bad, but where I stand on this signal and the real "lady and tramp" do not agree with each other! They are the only theme for sharing different styles, different voice personalities, two completely different movies with different details and each other (such as Jim Priy, Darling, Lady and City of the City of Tramp) and none of them <br/> <br / > <br /> <br /> If you want a series of consecutive years after the original release for memorable songs like "Bela's Note" and "Suicide Bites Music", then this signal will Do not give up everything! Just for each song it is a little pop and jag and trustees, such as Jim Priy and Darling and Anne Sarah and his cat who may well be seen in good old characters but they seem to be replaced by a new character Peg is not being displayed at all , Whose voice is quite annoying. Even the Lady and the Trump are often not enough and appear as for the scamp?! She is so looted! And his father treated Tram with extreme disrespect, and then he did not regret how much he was missing at home! And they called an adventure to his shameless getaway! I want to say that Scott Wolf folds out a truly intelligent Disney animal and brings out the bad boy from the humiliating scamp. Even the old letters just drive you crazy this; Sick sick, Joke (Jeff-Stupid-Bennett) in the restless bed - and his voice - Scottish, hearing-impaired! As far as possible, to free our poor ears from their voices and stop them for mobile phones, feather-brains, junkyard dogs to eliminate them !!!!!! Someone puts him down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! If you have not already had a hard day, it's not bad, but I hope for a more realistic attraction near a real classic - Scamp is Chavie, so there's a girlfriend angel and a weak story. Still, I think you should try it at least once because, I'm saying, there are almost more bad movies.
