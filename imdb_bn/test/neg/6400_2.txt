It was held on the island of Fire in the early 1970's. A couple of Peter (Craig Doodle) and Body (J. Will Dine) were throwing a fourth party party in their home. Unfortunately their relationship is going to be separated and they will get ready for a room full of very weird guests. The rest of the movie tells the partner what is happening between Peter and Badie. <br /> <br /> All right - I am a gay man, but 8 minutes before it was created. If this real scene of gay homosexuals is true in the 1970s, I am glad that I was not around. From captive opening credits, which shows the kids playing in Bali (???), the film slides slowly slowly. A guru (Robert Case) who is unaware of any importance. I wanted to push half the people in his first long lecture. For the first time there is a little baby Danny. There are lesbian couples (who do nothing - without any curves for no reason). There are queen of skin. The worst thing is Jimmy's name Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We came to get a flat tire for him and his friends (whom I never met). They basically scream and scream for 10 minutes and have no idea exactly how to make a flat. I know some people find this fun but I found it obnoxious and quite sad. The party itself is full of people you do not want to meet. This is a group where the sinking people are playing bad guys with bad actors. No one can work with the exception of doodle. <br /> <br /> This could be valuable as a portrait of the Fire Island in the 1970s ... but it looks quite dust. It only gets a 2 for some very nice body male nudity.
