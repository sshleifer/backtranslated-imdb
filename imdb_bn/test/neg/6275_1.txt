After watching the Steven Spielberg version of Theater's War of the World, I was overwhelmed with this issue. I could go back to my favorite parts in the movie, the people were evaporated, the people were scared, the fire, the explosions were so big ... <br /> <br /> So a few weeks later I entered my video store, and I asked David Michael Look at Ward of Wards version of Lat. "It could not come onto DVD, that fast, could it?" I told myself. I read behind the case and c. I saw Thomas Howell. "Oh, I remember him from the outsiders!" So I thought, it might be a try. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, wrong mistake. As soon as I saw the opening credit, I saw them forever, I knew something was wrong. I had some disappointment in this picture and it did. The whole movie is stocked like a cheese sauce, which has been frozen for 10 years. From acting, special effects (stupid search tips, when people become steamy, they become orange skeletons), and most of all, it did not come as interesting as the Spillberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there was only 3 scenes of destruction! What crap? I was so annoyed, till I could find something which seemed even remotely interesting until I had to go through the film. And there really was nothing. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Do not touch this movie, stay away from it 100 feet. Spieberg version is coming near the end of this month, buy one that one! But please, I request you! Stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!
