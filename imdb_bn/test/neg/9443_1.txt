Maybe James P. Le knows, if a director is under his supervision then what to do in the sound department. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)' he can not achieve anything as a writer or director. /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this picture, no stories, no character building, no events, no environment, no plot, no twists, no acting, that name is worthy. <br /> <br /> Among these categories, this film is behind a million light years of a small film, which has some thoughts, even more than a minute. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with anyone in David Lynch! /> <br /> I think it can be used as psychological abuse or can be used as negative campaign material against the West. <br /> <br /> Recommend it only for your worst enemies!
