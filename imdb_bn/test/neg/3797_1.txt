4 Oscar winners, Carl Malden, Sally Field, Sheryl Jones, Michael Kain Great character actor Tele Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour and 54 minutes near tidium, melodrama and terrible acting, a script mess, and a good lord's drowning feeling, what do they think? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The popularity of the genre classic disaster film with the Grade de Minas script, the actors must have followed the same way ... ... awesome, horror! <br /> <br /> Are you playing crazy Cain, Sawalas, Malden and the field? Which goes into a potentially fierce sinking ship 1. In the fire. Hot to steam 3. Waters and oil fired 4. Boilers are exploding every 5 minutes, etc. for money? Greed 5. They have very small tools, even in the eyes do not have a glove or work boot, very few rope hooks, ropes, etc. <br /> <br /> Fool! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Stop! And what is the deal with bad toupee? Also, there is no way in which its character was WW2 veteran. <br /> <br /> Cain, Field and Malden have found all the gold and money and they are happy - Hello! We are rich! (We can not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yes, this is the great character actor Slim Pix! <br /> <br /> living alive! Jack Warden and Charlie Night! <br /> <br /> <br /> The ultimate dramatic sub-plot of the terrible plutonium has never gone anywhere, as they forgot, how? There are many holes in the script <br /> <br /> This image is an illness that can not cure powerful pills. I'm surprised Alan J. Smith's name was not in the script, I'm feeling embarrassed to write this! <br /> <br /> O insane, hello humanity! Hey Way! <br /> <br /> Horror, the horror! <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a bad two hour TV movie <br /> <br /> <br /> At least the set was recycled material from the first movie. <br /> <br /> Compost needs a script on hip ...
