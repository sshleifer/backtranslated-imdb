<br /> <br /> I could not believe that the authors and the director saw that almost all the movies are like SF. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible to stop the killer's cold glue and get up early after 10 hours. <br /> <br /> 2. You do not get electric pipe as electrocuted tray like cinema. (Trust me, this is my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. You can spend ten of 10 pipes easily with a rock. The chains have been made from steel but tell the water pipes were harmful and it was made from iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to spend your foot with a fox, you will be disappointed before reaching the bone (Shin) (in the best case, your heart may die due to failure). <br /> <br /> Other examples.
