This early experimental short film, directed by William Vance and Osson Wales, is seen in Ububowb. Yes, you read that right, Orson Wells! A few years before the radio's "The War of the Worlds" and his first debut Citizen Kane gained fame, Welles was 19 years old and discovered his fun. Along with Vance and Wales, there was another player in Virginia Nicholson, who will be the first wife of Osson. She plays a woman who is sitting behind an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton on Blackface) and after some courtesy. During this time a man (Wells) left him beside him (continuous repetition of courtesy scenes). I will not be released anymore except to say how interesting the image was as silently as skip. It was not good at all, but it was interesting to watch the 2005 Guitar Score (by Larry Marta) on the print-i. Well worth a look for anyone with a taste of enthusiasts and avant-garde.
