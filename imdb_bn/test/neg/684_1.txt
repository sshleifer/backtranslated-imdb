This movie is really bad. I like to flip to TV while jogging and this movie looks like it would be good to sleep and the boy was wrong. My body awakens me from literally sleeping and said, "Hey ... this movie is terrible ... you have to watch it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. Something about the strange comedy gets me going. This movie is impressive crappy. I do not know exactly how to reveal it apart from it just to suggest it look bad. I mean, seriously, you should see this with the people. I was making the best joke during this movie and no one could hear it. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimon. It's that bad.
