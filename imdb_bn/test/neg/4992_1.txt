This is the worst movie I ever seen. Boring, irrational, terrible. Do not waste a minute of your life to see this pain! I hope the directors will not make any other film because the film captures them. The movie seems to be made in a day or two with some of the movie's friends (if we can use this term for these 2 people). They use only cameras at hand Many scenes in the dark and nothing is seen. Many scenes (80% of the film) are just about conversations. ! There are movies like Vampire vs Lomis, which you can smile but it's just bad, there's no reason to make a movie. Close Jason Horton and Shannon Habal. No more movies!
