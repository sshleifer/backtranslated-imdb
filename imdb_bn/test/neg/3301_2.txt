I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience) know how Istanbul is doing all those years. <br /> <br /> If you are still young (born in 1973) and look at Turkey, the great mistake of Oriental is falling (just like his other movie, Jeggen Dai Wang), this film is contemporary contemporary urban Turkish life and geography of audiences and Cultural Istanbul Spreads. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can speak Turkish can easily prove that many underground bands and groups (one for Sisyabadbod) in the film are so harmful and their members can not even speak the correct language that they can not contemporary Turkish music Will be accepted as 'representative'. Many Turkish listeners even do not know too much about it. <br /> <br /> We were accustomed to the 'extremely' western Turks who saw Turkish with some orientalism: fit the original Turkish image into the mind of their mind. What's new in this movie is that Turkish-born director (Biswas Akin) has made the same mistake: If he understands the good things he has seen in Turkey with some false western glasses and scambling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? ..And many others who actually have actually cursed the original music we hear today? <br /> <br /> Faith is a long long lesson for learning before festivities away from the absurd and falsehood of other people's mind.
