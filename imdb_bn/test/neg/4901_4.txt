A true story inspired by the story is full of the 1970's feeling but not saying. This is a black college swimsuit that ends in a mortgage reconstruction center in a bad neighborhood in Philly and in no way combines the swimming pool. The film revolves around half of us in the dark as Terrence Howard, our first hero. The boy gets the children in the pond. It comes up while being a bit compelling, though it is still frustrating. It's a good story, and why it has taken part in Howard and Barney Mac, but instead of remembering something for the story, we think that the script is poor and most of the aspect thinks like 197. <Br> <br /> There are no disasters that have made some reviews, instead of the fact that the latest stories of all the sports - Coach Carter, Injincible, Glory Road etc., did not at least know that you should only listen to the audience for "respect" Work with the story to create a movie to oppose the trouble.
