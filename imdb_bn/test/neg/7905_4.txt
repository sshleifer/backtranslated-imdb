This movie was not very funny. It was not very horrible. Just a fun journey to Soul Plan. It is a black-owned flight service with a kick-ass disk, beautiful bars and pumping stewards. This plot brings you a black (race or color, 'style') style with the same style of black humor and comes with a famous flat concept. Occasionally, some extraordinary scenes are seen when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory on the 'normal' plane. Check that out. Although there are Lulls, and I've played it as the highest pilot. See who's looking for it All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnad has added fun to his cracker attitude. Playing insect, when you are drunk, or just vegging it to see a movie.
