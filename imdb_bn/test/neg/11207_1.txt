What Crack Are You Smoking? This movie, when gloriously entertaining, awful! <br /> <br /> Action scenery is so obviously fake that it is tragic. The colonel's girl is painful, annoying. Nija Shibir's camp is so delightful that it is not worth mentioning. And when Joe kept a bucket on his head and beat another soldier, I knew myself. I could go ... <br /> <br /> Entertainment, so logical. Well, no Well made, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on empire in America, it is actually quite good. Joe is not all surprising as a general white winner, especially in the mid-1980s about the American film.
