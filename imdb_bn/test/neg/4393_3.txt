I and a friend hire this movie the other day. In the first appearance, it seems to be another teenage movie, which we hope to be, easy to be a horror and comedian fan. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie was designed to give viewers disappointment. Possible It accelerates into something that quickly holds a lot of potential. Unfortunately it does not quite leave the ground. We remember 1 hour for something like that, when I was finally sleeping half, I said: "Friend, this movie is bad" Actually it's only 35 minutes ... Dood agreed. The problem is: The movie is not funny. It was undoubtedly supposed to be fun, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me of myself There was potential I could have wanted, and instead I end up watching all the cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I am the creator of this film from the bottom of my heart. Her very sad That's all possible .. and nothing.
