Kindly give some kind of appreciation for 'Heliester: Bloodline'. It's actually full moon full moon out. It carries all the signs of your 'demonic toy' or 'puppet master' series, without your dope, oh, charm? The whole moon can go away with stupid products because they know it's silly. This Hellraiser thing, man, they never take seriously seriously. This growing stupid franchise (although I'm not nearly as stupid as seeing it) once composed for its low budget being stylish. Now it's right.
