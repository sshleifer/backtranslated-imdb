I found this movie to be promotional and unrealistic. It tries as a movie showing children fighting against the system, but it does not even offer a positive solution. I guess I do not really feel for kids. I fully understood their determinations and I know how poor the condition of the schools, but I have found their solution and the way out of it can be a big bunch of foil. This comes on TV, do not waste your time. See brief circuits for the 235th time again.
