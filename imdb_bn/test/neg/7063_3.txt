The school is not going to make mistakes for a good movie, but it's a memorable one. Do not forget about the experience as a hot-blooded gypsy girl as you nunabi with Murna Laoy's performance. When this picture is uniquely beautiful Miss Laay is considered as a foreign vixan, often in Asia and usually terrible. He must have a visionary here. It seems that his skin has become dark and his hair is curled. In most of the scenes, he is a little more than a barefoot and a skirt and is wearing a loose-friendly farmer blouse, in one scene he does not wear anything except a patterned towel. I think I pay attention to the look of Miss Loy, because this is not the only reason for the protection of the Cracky Antic and it is the only good reason to see. Hopefully you will not be attracted by the dialogue, which is hopeless. In a common passage, Nubi releases the coverwane window and leaves a poetic impression: "Always the Gypsies, they sing and they are weird and sad, when the big sun is a burning fire, and when the blue moon stays behind the clouds and cools as the death. Breathe the wind, they sing. "The poet, right? Purple prose lovers will have a field day. I can not help but, in the next years, if Miss Lai likes to not be able to withdraw her involvement with this project. <br /> <br /> It was recently adapted to the success of Broadway like Tokyo. The stage version was opened in November of 1926 at the 48th Street Theater and continued for more than a year. This play provokes a famous episode involving a heroist and theater critic Robert Benelayle, who expressed anguish over letters in a thick dialect or pijagine in English. According to twelve times many times, Mr. Benchley felt uncomfortable in the opening part of the ceremony. The setting of the Spanish village (moved to a Hungarian village for some reason), allows the performers to practice their pronunciation with different degrees of success, but the patience of the land reached its limit, when in the order of family dinners, a door was broken open and dressed as a Gypsy girl. An actress shouted, "Help! Help A U! He killed me! " Then he threw himself at the feet of the attendant and said, "My nun, my best daughter, I am here!" At that moment, Mr Benchlin declared his partner and declared: "I am Bobby, my bad boy, now I go," and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The photo version gives many examples of unreasonable humor, but never comes near Benell's intelligent level. Lunch Plot is concerned about the Lajos family: Father Joseph, mother Maria and Paul son Paul, the son of the nearest college. We will consider this rich family as "upper-middle class" because they are zamindars and zamindars with all the advantages of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly dropped into turmoil when a Gypsy coverwen comes to the village and attacks their homes, yes Nubi Noble Gypsy girl. He reached their door during the headline of the title - symbolizing the strong emotion, I fear. The girl is shy of a humiliating relationship and begs for the sanctuary. After considering the matter, the Lajos family agreed to hide him from an angry boyfriend, who soon looked after but went back. Nubi became a servant among the family. Kindness inspires him to make family decisions, but soon enough, Nubi's good luck to him started with Peter, the servant of Lasos, as well as turned them back by provoking every active man in the neighborhood, then working on his way. Son paul Nubi broke Paul's relationship with his Piano Ermera (Runaway Loretta Young, who still played at the teenage age), forced him to come out of school and then stole the savings of the family of Girl Lena (Jasu Pits) and asked to buy her jewelry. In her part, Lena is still mourning for her drunken Peter's loss, when he has disconnected Nubi by turning him back to his point of view. Finally Nubi draws attention to his forefather Joseph and I think if the running time is longer, he will go after the village priest Uncle Dani, Maria and know who God is. <br /> <br /> I guess a scenario like this lends itself to the parody easily, but during the first half of the year, the sculpture expresses the unreligious attraction of one day soap: we see, masculine, as bad girl works her spell on men -Form and harmful nature is an essential force (almost like - a storm! Ah ha, another metaphor!). But the machinations of machinations machinations like Green on fun fades. The following scenes have been emphasized in Nubi and the attention changes the effectiveness of the Lajos family, and after some time these people become real drag. The son behaves like an absolute heel in particular, but parents do not acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings; Everything is said to us, the fault of the snake, any good trams. <br /> <br /> Cast men are soft. In addition to Miss Lloye, the only actress who can perform a shotgun is Jasu Pitts, as awesome as usual. The Lazzos family's mother, Alice Joes, starred for a long time silent star, who is talking about her role and retired soon after. Loreta Young's new delicious Nubi provides a great contrast to the radioactive attraction, but its line readings are very unreasonable, it is well respected. No, there is only one reason to see this glimpse, and she herself is Nubi. I can not think of another actress who could play this innocent role and be able to reduce it by half. I'm not an objective observer, however. There is a great crash in my mirror and even you can see him on the square.
