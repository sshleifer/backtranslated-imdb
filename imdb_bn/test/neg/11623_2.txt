The worst sequel I've ever seen Really terrible song which is the first film to crush the scores and how pretty the story sounds! Also, which destroys the film for me, is not John Claes, so Jean-Bubo can not even be in him and the new villains are horrible. It's really annoying that the old woman type thing is a simple sentence string together properly without repeating her word over and over again. But the fair Uberta shut up does not have to be a little fun. But it was his 50th birthday: why do they think he is 80 years old? I'm going to give it 1 but now I think ... I could give it a 2. But there is still the story line where the first film is not as close as well. It is similar without humor to specific characters. As a matter of fact, I dislike this movie entirely due to the frustrating music, a serious lack of voice genre: Prince Derek and Jean Bob's voice changed, new villains, the story of disappointment is some of the annoying habits and very simple animations.
