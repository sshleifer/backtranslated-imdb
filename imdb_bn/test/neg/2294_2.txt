Once I like a good horror movie, so I think this will be a splatter and gore movie. But this was a boring annoying movie, probably because I saw a cut version, because there are only two things where a little splatter, one at a time where some people cut their hands and where some hit the arm, but where only a few Wismaster was an evil version for example, then more cool SENes, its annoying version than it's an evil Ed. And some actors where lousy to.o
