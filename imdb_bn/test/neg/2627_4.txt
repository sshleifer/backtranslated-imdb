It was a very good show. I enjoyed real time and flashbacks, recalls old diggers again and remembered the fear of their prisoners at Changi Pau Camp. The main problem of how the program was written is like the holiday camps rather than what the place should be like in the scenes of Chang. I am old to remember the footage of the films of people who are released from Changi and other Japanese pound camps. Any actor who is similar to the condition of men may lose enough weight. They saw the Jews of Belseen as Sumo Wrestlers. I have met several veterans from Changi for years. Many will not travel to Japanese cars, they will only own ownership. For men and women who suffered physical and mental torture, they were too terrible to talk to them. What percentage have survived? John may be entitled to write a comedy for "Ray and HG" (I hate him too), but a serious sugar cover in history that should never be tolerated. I'm happy to write the "Life of Brian" to Barriere, because it is a comedy, and some even consider it a bad taste. "Changi" is written as a real event screenplay and, for example, can be regarded as a true record of young people. Great performance by a fine cast this lightweight playlist can not be retrieved.
