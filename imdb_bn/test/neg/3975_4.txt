This image is a middle, low budget flick. I saw more bad at MST3K, I reassured you, but it's still a fantastic crappy film. <br /> <br /> Film clones, a secret government facility that uses clones to be part of politicians. It is almost the Orwellian society, in fact: almost (but not quite effective). <br /> <br /> When the movie was cloned (Team Connelly 'Emergency' fame) a female clone (Polleet Barin, who was present in this and four other films) and they are some of the suspicions. Find beer in a nearby river, the plot begins to unravel, the clones are from the main scientist ('Bechched' to Dick Sergeant) or 'confessional' computer. The computer, which probably knows everything, so that the main clones break into the building and (in the scene Mick and Bots) find the truth (with a clone video, sincerely, five years ago Dolly shows the correct method used to clone.) And this movie Was made twenty years ago.). About Clones He followed by two guards, break free. He has a hell of a time breaking through two ft high fences, though he has to climb up a stone more difficult time. From there it continues to slide. Also present were Peter Graves ('The End of the End', 'The World Wins It') Presidential Candidate and Kinan Wine (`Dr. Strenelovov ',' Piranha ',' Once Upon a Time in the West ') and Tutel (' Mother Barcher ' Murderer Bruce ',' psycho ') as an elderly couple who helped Clooney after fleeing. <br /> <br /> version of MST 3 was infinite; One of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the film; For the version of 10 MST 3
