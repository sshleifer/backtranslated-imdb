I understand that the time spent on pieces of this shooting (camera shuts off the camera, cameras running, wide aperture shots, washed out) allows such films to be made for pricing. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows you to piece more time. It has its protesters and supporters in a style - perhaps there are also people who have an artistic basis for such shooting. <br /> <br /> If only some money is saved then the script can be spent. No style is used, a film needs good writing and well-played. <br /> <br /> This film is mostly very good acting. So less writing. It is excluded from collections of bits taken from the book and many which are made relevant for the collection of seamless with little or no continuity relevant to the plot. <br /> <br /> If you have read books, do not watch it in any circumstance. If you do not read the book, there is no harm to be happy, but be prepared to be frustrated. <br /> <br /> It can be a lot better.
