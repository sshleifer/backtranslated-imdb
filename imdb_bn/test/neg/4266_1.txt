The worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie is pure trash. All movies are bad in this movie. Instructions, screenplay, art, cinematography, cast or anything else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Edit <br /> <br /> tries to save it, but the very bad elements in hand with them can not do miracles. <br /> <br /> I said, the cast is poor, the text is bad, it does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned how to make a movie "not".
