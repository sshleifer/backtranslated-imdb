It has been much better than it has been. Tom Pitman has given a good performance and some older actors work well to work with them, but it does not work. <br /> <br /> First, the oldest student to play high school in High School, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks almost thirty Second, it is difficult to be sympathetic to poor Marve, especially Betty is not so hot, to start with her. <br /> <br /> ******* Spiller ****** Finishing is so weird It looks like the director wanted Pittman's character to take a shot, but there was no gunman incident ... he pushed him into cement, where he was there until the ambulance driver held him and placed him in the stretcher (face down!). What was his injury? A leather knee? Stupid! Vince has died without regret, even though she easily mocked Marva and pushed her on the ground, even though she hides the subject that she hates the child. And to make the case even Silhouer, Marav asked the police to apologize to his father. (Oh Hey Marav, you've just turned around. It seems that your father will have lots of opportunities to grieve you ... personally). And this writer did not get Oscar nomination? Leave it, unless you see it on the MST.
