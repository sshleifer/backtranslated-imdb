This is by far the most annoying movie I've ever seen! And if you do not believe that you go ahead and see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the story does not understand in any sense. People do not have any idea of ​​war. I did not understand what they were saying during the movie (in most cases I was not even boring), it's nothing to watch the movie, plus point cinematography only. New Zealand looks great <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, "On demand", do not see it!
