Bloated, annoying, and racist "Seymour" selection is considered as the worst choice of the best photo of Oscar history. Actually played by Richard Dix (forgetled, whose self-centered and irresponsive Yanissi Crouch as one of the most brutal characters in the history of screen) and has watched leadership, this film is really a black character due to the frustration of racism Sleeping in a chandelier is turned on. <br /> <br /> Other comments from the IMDB critics have just abandoned the behavior of the date, but many of the films shown during this period do not portray blacks as snails, lazy mental obstacles that get great pleasure in this heaven. So the argument seems weak to say the least. But if you regard this disrespectful character as sadly bad taste for any person at any time, or only considering the forgiving ignorance of the less educated era, it is very painful to see it in the 21st Century eyes. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if the film is not an extramarital affair, it is. 1930/31 voted Oscar best at the Academy Awards when "City Lights", "Public Enemies," "Dracula," "The Do Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" failed to be nominated for a permanent classic, "Siemann" Oscar Until the panther join the worst selection.
