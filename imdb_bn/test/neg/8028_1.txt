<br /> <br /> I hired this movie on June 20, 2001 and saw it for about 45 minutes. I will be delighted by the comparison of watching an empty screen. I was not a single person in the thorns to open myself in hell and to swallow a whole bunch. <br /> <br /> So, I emailed all my friends and relatives are warning them, and I'm taking time to request everyone who saw this note! I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one is never as bad as ever.
