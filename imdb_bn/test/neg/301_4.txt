*** Potential spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read on a small Dahmah and saw a new Dahmer film on the previous (with the same name). Here the film focuses more on hunting and killing, much less on Dahmara. The movie "Dahmar" had the opposite problem, it was very little about his crime and there was not much about himself. <br /> <br /> I could not find my satisfaction, it was also a little amateur. , Especially the entering officer. Even acting in the competition against the acting officer actor Dahm became worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, OK - but I do not understand why, the person who ran away from his flat while drinking Dahma beer was not pictured as being naked, because it also Happened. This is not a big deal, but it just eats more on the quality of the movie that such details have been omitted. What is not shown is not even really indicative of sexual emotions with Dahmers dead. Again, I do not think they have shown it, but at least they can mention it or it can be made in movies in some way. Conclusion: I think the image of the burn is still good. He was also a film that included not only Dahmer's crime but he also did what he did. I think 1.5 or 2 hours is not enough to just understand its complexity. This movie was the only cutout of Dahrs' life and personality, and did not give insights into 'good things' in your life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
