How much the director can not become lazy with this movie! Rather than setting up scenery in a creative way, he relies on annoying at old junky clinics. <br /> <br /> Where two unarmed Leads forced college steps to take over the van, they surrounded them with jamims, but still no bite is bitten. He can not be disturbed for directing a decent battle scene, so we see that these steps go slowly gradually and gradually gradually and gradually gradually and slowly. This is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything without irritating hairdo behavior consistently. <br /> <br /> This film can be so good with careful planning and much more inspiration. .
