This film is a clear rip off of the underworld acting starring Clive Robertson. You invest a few hours and owe it to yourself for the original clock to watch. I found it difficult to disjointed one and to follow, many that do not have much knowledge in the scene. I do not oppose violence in the film, but this whole thing seems to be nothing but excuses for blowing a person after another, many of whom are only slightly connected to the story. Everyone else is dying, I was surprised by the fact that why not only did Frank blast Johnny's brain. She could certainly have it and Johnny could not be sure that nobody works like that. Another disgusting subject is sex scenes; Why do these people have sex with their clothes? Is that supposed to be introduced to us? Surely they did not think they had a shot at a PG rating. This movie started eating nothing naturally. As if someone was seeing people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy elephant and shallow manner.
