I give it a 2nd - I keep 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. Do not remember what we do about this movie. The only thing we think is a gun scene where the actor falls to the ground, rotates on a hollaway or other side and then goes back to the shooting. Trying to 'stunt' the broken leg of two broken legs after watching the 80-year-old man. Also, when the characters were driving a truck, then the engine (or radio? Can not think of) the sound when the actor was completely disappeared. <br /> <br /> And, like others, we also bought Sandra Bulk Front cover. Very sad, very bad.
