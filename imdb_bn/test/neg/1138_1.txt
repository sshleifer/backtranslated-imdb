I can not believe I bought this movie in DVD. I remember not being shown on TV last year. Why in the world can they never complete one real seat in the best Christmas movie? Like Jam Lewis, the same drug-like suppression and randie quoids seem like. I did not know about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I would check it out at IMDB how it was rated. Boy, I'm wrong. If you are asked to read this review, stay away from it and stay only for the first Christmas. Well at least I did not pay 10 taka for him. Maybe I can trade it and get half that back to Tower Records. Then not again PS I still did not see it, my DVD player is seeing another wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Radiq (Arrayed Director's Cut), tonight, Freaking Hoo.
