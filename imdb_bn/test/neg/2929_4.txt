Coming from Kyrstami, this art-house visual and sound exposition is a surprise. A man well known for observing his description and human attention for a human, especially children, the shortest cinematography for this journey asks: Why does he do it? Was he busy in the coast during the holiday? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" contains, you estimate it takes five long time. They (title names are my own and times approximate): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and wave". The camera still looks at almost a little driftwood, because it has spread to the small waves sea beach. Ten minutes <br /> <br /> "Watching people on board" The camera still looks at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People walk across the camera frame, their faces are very attractive and fade to make them attractive. Eleven minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> "Six dogs on the edge of the water". The camera stands still toward the ocean horizons with a sandy stretch of beach. At the far end of the water, not a lot of six dogs, just relax. Six minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> "Line duck, duck goggle" The camera stands still toward the sea horizon near the water edge. Dosages and docs flowing through single file from left to right. I guess the Kyrastami gradually released them. The last two ducks stop the dead on their track and suddenly dumples rolls slowly from a Google right to the left. I suppose that Kirstami collected ducks together and at the same time re-released all. This is not the first time that he deals with discrimination between organized and unorganized behaviors. Eight minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> "Shower Symphony, oh, I mean, for the stormy night". The camera stands on a pond at night. It is a pitch black, which reflects water as a reflection of the moon. It is a storm race to cover the night and cloud of the moon. The screen goes dark. What's left for us is frogs, dog dogs and finally roasters in the morning. If this unit is taking me hit me on the head. I saw this segment as a sound compilation put together in a editing editing room and by a simple imagination. Twenty minutes <br /> <br /> Except for light sunny ducks, this exercise kept me cold. An illogical movie for Kirstami fans <br /> <br /> I thought I would rate five "five", but the four deserve it. <br /> <br /> The image was dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
