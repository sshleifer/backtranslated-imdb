It is hard to believe that this movie can be really released. The dialog was irrelevant. Particularly poor was the boy and his future step-by-step screenplay in his father. I can assume that they succeeded in creating strange conversations, but what they said seemed to be false and artificial. The mystery was not just that. The music was as bad as it was about. The only reason I saw this movie was that I was in the Death Valley area and we were curious about what locations to show on the screen. Thankfully, this movie was on TV and so I'm sorry for a movie, no money was meant to rent this forgiveness! I honestly believe that most of the amateur can establish a more interesting plot than being presented here. It is very bad that the whole crew crew, such as time wasted! I think what I can say about the film is the only positive thing that was visible in something.
