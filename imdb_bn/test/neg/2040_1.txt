An artisan student in Rome ... or something. He has a cross nail and the devil is dreaming of raping himself. She possesses her (I think) and turns him into a sexual addiction. That is all I could take and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> Hijacking a pointless "Exorcist" I caught on the wire back in the 80's and was scared ... and well! Although this movie is considered to be a horror movie, a sex film disguised as nothing becomes more than a movie. Playing a few stupid women nudity and actress lead was to reduce herself once more. We saw him being raped by Satan (a warm look), rape, coming to his own father ... he would give his point of bravery. Add that bad dubbing, editing (raping scene looks like it was a bit cut), played lousy and makes a story which makes no sense next. A boring sequence (nailed to its cross) worked almost but lousy "special" effects destroyed it. This is one of the few horror movies that I was very bad at seeing. leave it.
