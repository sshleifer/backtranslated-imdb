There is a feeling of a college project on this film, it wants to do a Blair Witch project, which meets the theme. But it does not succeed. Cinematography is poor, and played even more so. Characters, in my opinion, do not close all as credible. The editing of the movie is not really working as intended. There are many poor effects which I believe have been tried to make a terrible impact there. But to me it gives me feeling of indifference. <br /> <br /> I'll be away from this movie, unless you're a dedicated movie freak, who likes to look "different" and Indie "Awesome" movies. However, I believe this movie is not valuable for watching, for the average person. You will not get any pleasure from poor influences, and Handy gives the camera the camera to the audience.
