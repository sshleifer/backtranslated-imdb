Look, some pictures have got worse. I think it could be India song. Seeing the movie in 1976, I was playing in Carnegie Hall, a place that often cares much about the film. From almost half the point, people simply had floods from the theater. My girlfriend will not let us go, but in the end, the theater was practically empty. I told people that "the good part has not yet arrived" And it was there. The screen that was at the end of the good part was "Fin." It was only a good part. I am still annoyed by this picture after 24 years. It was vain, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, part 2). To learn the difference between simply bad and simply terrible, you just want to spend an endless two hours to see it.
