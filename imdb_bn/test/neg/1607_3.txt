I did not read the book and saw the movie, but when they field it, I was kept in the USS John F. Kennedy. Needless to say, film crew and actors trying to do their work can try. Now, about the movie. As one of the carrier's navy, I was very annoyed with how I showed the air carrier. I can exclude mistakes throughout the film (anyone who has lived in a carrier), but pages can take. A scene in particular, when they were at CIC (Combat Information Center), they were watching radar communication steps across the screen. Every time the contact moved, it beeped. Unfortunately, that tool is not like beep (I was a technician of that equipment). The book was really based, the film was not. Following the TV series was just as bad and the navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad. If you are a navy, see which movie can be seen about the life of a Hollywood actor. If you do not have a navel person, watch midway or top songs, at least those movies are based on entertainment and reality.
