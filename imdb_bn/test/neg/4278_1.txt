For everyone to read this book, Fannie Price looks like her own woman, beautiful woman ... le Tougele medicine in the brain. Terrible acting, he just destroyed! Henry is a little longer for her character. She is very effeminate. Mary Crowford bright. Edmond is a little older. Mrs. Norris is violent - OK, this casting decision works. Rustworth is also perfect. Yates looks very effeminate. But, Le Touzel is just awesome. This is not a good character for him. Poor fanny! I would only recommend this movie because it contains a full text account used in the novel Austen language. The 1999 edition is much more fun but horrible incomplete. If they can repeat this version with a more appropriate actress for the Fannie, it will be fabulous!
