Dark Harvest is a group of friends who go for a holiday (for a friend or somebody of a farm) for a holiday. But there the killer has something terrible (there was something about curses but forgot what I forgot). <br /> <br /> The acting of this movie is awful, I do not know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses. The same story as the script "horror" acting (this statement is coming very clear .. But if it is well played and a good script it can be "okay". <br /> <br /> Directing stink too, I see no possibility of this guy's future. After all these negatives, the film still maintains a "fun" factor, which stops it until two. The last plus they do not use CGI! My overall thoughts in this movie are bad, really bad, but it's "funny" so bad it gets a 2/10
