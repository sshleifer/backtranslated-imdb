All pro comments about this movie claim that the film is balanced. Their main argument to give high rates to the movie. But during a Chief Criminal Analysis, a film is not balanced, in the end the world is given in every single subject. The director himself recognized the first exhibition of the San Francisco Film Festival. He supported this because he could not afford to enter Fujimorei. It may be true, but Fujimori supports the film with so many things about these issues - Fujimari and unfinished. I dare any other commenter to prove these wrong tips 1: Harvard professors, intellectuals and diplomats of Latin America agree with you that your argument (logic usage) does not help. Tip 2: Even if you disagree with the director, there is no help in your argument (the director says that he thinks Fujimori is a taxist and patriotic and so he has portrayed him as such)
