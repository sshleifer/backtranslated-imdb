Why the ability to cast Jennifer Lopez an incredible role? She was nice in Selena and was good in money train, both of which cast her role where she might be herself. However, the role of this kind is just drawing the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (look out of the scene for that extraordinary performance), but as a psychologist? Pause me <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez is a psychologist who is involved in the virtual reality exam, who enters the minds of his patients to help solve their problems. When he enters a comic serial killer's heart to help rescue a hunter, he tries to insane all his intimate minds and break all the rules. <br /> <br /> Lopez's performance is generally less than the average. I could not get on a voice that squeak high waves. He is not Julia Roberts, but he comes across the screen although he believes himself to be in the same playground. Well, he's not in the same stadium. Of course, she is a very sexy lady; However, that's not going to carry a film, and it certainly does not carry this one. It was wonderful to play with someone else in this role, especially if it was given to someone who could have more credibility for the character. <br /> <br /> This picture is apparently stunning. The color is fabulous, and story lines are not bad in half way way to a B-movie. Here the audio is pretty well as well. This film is a few points for roughly basic storyline and how it looks and gets major points for it. Unfortunately, acting and poor welding brought it down a few chunk. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
