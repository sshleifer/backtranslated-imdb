I do not particularly like the slideing door yesterday or twice, so I'm certainly not the poor second-rate excuse for these movies. There was an idea that could lead to death (which would happen ...?) And the script was unreasonable and unsuccessful, not only to mention the explicit attempt to add a rating and sexual / nudity to achieve some specific scenes but there was there to push the border (I really There is no need to see a fight with a baby urine or a diaphragm. Especially when they have no connection to the film or There yabahara). <br /> <br /> The acting was very poor, the only actor I found was his daughter was satisfactory at least bit; The rest were two-dimensional and quite incredible. I have seen that these people have left the room through about half; I could finish it, but its part was not without rapid progress. Overall: There is nothing new here, it's a generic and annoying movie. Some rather fun moments are outweighed by stupid or stupid ones. It will dull even if it is not done before. If it is not a rehearsal, then I would rate it five, but it was also lacking in indie film, and also lost as a reheash: 3/10.
