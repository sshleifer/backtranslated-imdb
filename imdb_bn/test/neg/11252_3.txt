This movie came as a huge disappointment. The Anime series ended up with a relatively stupid plot and came up with the role of a pretty lame villain, but I hope Shamballa will drag all loose ends. Unfortunately, it's not. It added more plot holes than solutions, and it is more confused than explaining it. Animation and voice acting were fantastic, but with a stupid plot, a dull setting (most movies do not happen in the world of aliqimi world except in WWII world) and frustrating (Ed is void for the rest of the world, there is no teenager in the world, and she Thrown out?), It was absolutely unthinkable. Do yourself a favor - ignore this movie as well as the last half of the anime and read the manga.
