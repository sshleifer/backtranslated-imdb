The only reason for this movie to fall asleep was that the seats were not comfortable. Hanif Booking> Borring> Borring and Borring !!! This photo is not just because of a violent or graphic distortion, it's just terrible. This is actually a joke in that case. The story moved at a lazy snap speed. I have a feeling that the director Reddy Scott just called it. Actors are all right, they need some direction. Music score is very annoying. This is particularly remarkable because of its ongoing film. It looks good but there is not enough reason to look at it. How did I say that it is Bengali? <br /> <br />
