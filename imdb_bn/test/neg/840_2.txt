I do not really know where to start when reviewing a movie as Ernest go to Africa. There is nothing positive about two or three good smiles spread throughout the film, this time and life is half of this waste. It is incredible that some people were able to surround a group that would like to work, film, and edit this section of the trash, and it is even more unbelievable that it is the unsurpassed installment of the Orstest series. <br /> <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the film, we see the poses of arnest beside various African objects, such as timber masks and creates heads, faces, and gestures of African animals that may possibly laugh at 3rd Graders. This opening scene gives viewers a taste of the taste of Ernest's frequent effort and shows that his comedy is rich in 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first movie that really hit me about this movie, how bad it is played. Each of the movies is an ordinary C-movie actor, but Linda Kath has been particularly fearful. He is the epitome of overacting; All its lines are suddenly distributed with inhuman encouragement which you will find only in a middle school play. Most high school theater students could probably be replaced by this actor and may have delivered a more powerful performance. Jim Verne always displays at least some comedic power, but in most cases, he works like a complete obstacle, stupidly and tries to be ridiculed by talking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest began to move to Africa, where an archaeologically stolen two precious gems of African descent. Gems then return to the United States, where an unknown man is seen running from various henchens through a torch market. He hides the "two dollars for two" items in the bucket, and then runs from the scene. Looking for a gift for Ernest Renn, he likes that waitress, so he went to the flea market and certainly bought gems worthless. After he returned to their home, paint them, and glue them together to make a Yo-Yo. He gave Yo-Yo to Renake and explained that they can never be together because he is only average shmoy, and he does the adventure. Rena and Ernest were followed by Henchen, and then detainees were kept as brought to Africa. <br /> <br /> Most movies do not really understand. Once Ernest was in Africa, he came out of the truck and was taking him to the river. In the next scenario, we see him as a Hindu slave called "Hey You". Her skin is dark and she is wearing a lind cloth. At first, I thought Jim Verne playing another role in the film, besides Ernest, but whenever you started talking, I immediately recognized Ernest's statue. <br /> <br /> Another scene that I feel is the ridiculous African Desert car Chase scene. Rane and Ernest took a farmer's farmer truck and henered behind Henchen. While running about 20 miles per drive on a fairly simple street, both heart attacks are shooting in Ernest on the back of the firecrackers farmer trucks. On the other hand, Ernest, Hennchen and his driver throwing dry eggs. Five minutes later the hecheners did not hit Ernest, but Ernest was able to catch them by facing them and their driver, so that their car went to the street and exploded in the huge amount of smoke. I'll add further that Ernest is wasting the egg from two big bras together. <br /> <br /> The set design on this movie is incredibly poor. René and Ernest walk in Africa in a large part of this movie, trying to find civilization. During their growth, we see them walking through the field and the jungle, which may be shot anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply plain plain grass, there is no indication of any place near Africa (they can at least digitally associate some African trees in the background), and the jungle, like the jungle of rural Connecticut, papaya, the cool, vin, and the thorns hanging from the trees. According to IMDb.com, the picture was shot in South Africa, but I still can not believe it. <br /> <br /> The film is going on and Ernest Mix is ​​followed by Ernest Tomasha. The rest of the movie does not actually give any idea; African tribes talk in English for some reason, and Ernest was later challenged as "the true war" of Hechenmann, who had suddenly been dressed in a ninja, even though it was similar to slavery. There is a table of axes, swords, knives and Messi in front of Hechenmann, while Ernest has a sandwich, teddy bear and some vain items. However, Ernest won the war and in any way would live that day. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's painful to watch this movie. I can not handle it sitting one; While praising Vernier's humor, I had to stop halfway for a few hours to damage the brain cells and had to make a little more productive. People must know that after they finish the film they should be slightly more annoyed, they must take the general precautions of the surgeons in the box. I would say that none of the movies I saw could be as sorry for going to Ornast Africa.
