A horrible, horrible, horror film. When I was a child I saw the original and gave me nightmare when I was 13. When I did not find a remake, I shouted. Oh why is a good film rebuild? Well, we can still thank the Dark Castle for buggering another classic horror movie. At this time they replaced some interesting stories with Gore, slowly and steadily moving slowly gradually. Someone said earlier that he could surprise Paris Hilton. Oh, are you watching this picture? She plays a prissy little tram. My type sounds like casting Half of the audience died when the audience shouted! It tells you why people see this image. If this is your only reason, then do a good search, because like this a black hole, you get more than your life. I used to stay alone, I had 10 minutes left to the boring exposition. This thing is like a mortal guide for filmmaking: An intelligent diktist, stupid but attractive Leeds, a lot of knives, lots of hot stock mensing trucks, I could go. After watching this picture, I really started to appreciate the Zippers crepeers, and I thought that this movie sucked. Protect yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.
