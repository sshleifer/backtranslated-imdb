Reba sucks It sucks hard. It's about this terrible country singer trying trick. They can call this program as "generic", because this is it. It's stupid and generic. Reba, you are not funny, and I'm glad you suck because your annoying show has been canceled, and Brock, Barbara Gene, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and 12-year-old who have knocked up. You suck all, and you are funny at anyone. Oh, and I've heard a rumor that Reba is actually a homosexual devil-worshiper who catches Hitler and tortures animals. And she keeps her mum on her show and her "music" so that children can kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. However, this is the worst show ever, Rebecca Gay, I do not like him, I think the office is better than this show, and this show is frustrating.
