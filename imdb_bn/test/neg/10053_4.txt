Warning Speaker: At the end of the film it was announced that the bridge was broken only after a few days of detention. The impression that the attack was nothing. In reality, the Remiguna Bridge was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was Rhine's crossing that the allies tried to achieve for six months. Because the Ramezen bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge will end after one day of being arrested. Americans had enough time to send war engineers and a large security force on the other side and they could start building a series of pontoon bridges. Taking the bridge was a complete success and it meant that the end of the war was near, and it would not end in the summer. Contrary to the brutal nature of the film, the winner is rushed by the soldiers with warmth. They knew how important the war was. <br /> <br /> This image has nothing to do with real history. It was a reflection of the atrocious nature during which it was produced.
