First and foremost, I want to target a big and medium finger towards the trauma DVD-delivery crew, who was stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer! Discipline only randomly mentions that for Christ, who is responsible for the massacre on the day of graduation! I do not care how awful or predicting how an 80's might be slasher; Just mention it destroyed the entire point! So, if you have purchased Trauma Double-Feature "Graduation Day" and "Dinosaur Hell in Nymphoid Barberian" then there is no word for advice ?? Do not repeat ?? Turn the box around and fall back! The movie is already a painful experience, but after reading it everything will be damaged. <br /> <br /> for the real movie now ?? Oh boy Personally, I'm the fan of the movie 'Work' of Herb Mukti. Well, I really do not know whether I will admire him? All Harb films are quite bad and amateur, but at the same time you can encourage his side and fulfill the good motives! In contrast to "Hunts" and "Bound Evil", he followed contemporary popular series trends and tried to make cash in general high school slasher movies. Just for the minimum fundamentality, all the victims of "Graduation Day" are members of the same track of sportspersons and coach George Michael's (great name! I think that during the opening of the franchise "Ham!" Fan !, we created 30 seconds of race in the drama drama How do we testify to death, his coaches and colleagues track team members raise his physical limit The debate does not raise much about it, but a particular person goes one step further and Laura kills everybody considered to be responsible for the death. What a demented short movie! This script should be among the most incompatible ones I have ever seen , Loads of red deer and sub-plots which are absolutely somewhere and the order of death, which is very much chessy for the words There is a focus leaked by a football attached to a gelline, others have been frustrated with the big sword silently, and the most unexpected blur of them, and even their death on Spike's masked bed! Herb ingeniousness and quick pacing of assassination concentrate so much that he is completely Prior to the movie he forgot about sub plot! For example, Laura's sister returned home from her military training and began investigating the situation of her death. Halfway through the film, however, its character is never seen in films anymore. Also, the daughters of their fathers are called violent drunk, but the immediate attention given is ignored. Instead of mounting cautious and confusing red spots carefully, we served disco-dance and roller skating sequences and ?? Of course ?? Extra 80's kids stripping off their tops Many pictures. Despite being really bad, "graduation day" can depend on a respectable cast! Most stars, known as Christopher George ("Grizzly", "Living Dead City"), starring Carmen Argeniano ("when a stranger call", "guilty"), most of the young teens as detectives and Michael Pataki ("Dead" And Buried "," Dracula's Dog ") has been emphasized as the principal principal of the school as a very interesting part. The responsibility of the teenage beauties includes Linnea Quigley and Vana White. Hack, for some awful fans, the presence of these two women is enough reason to count "graduation day" among the most impressive slashers of the early 80's. It is a stupid film, but the entertainment and chocolate are guaranteed!
