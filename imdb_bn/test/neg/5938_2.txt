Perhaps a government bureaucracy is not the most attractive way of living, but it is still a way of livelihood. However, after watching this movie, some may believe that every government bureaucracy is a lazy, bursting, proud, paper crusher who is specially alive to take part in his next lunch break. It's not just a beautiful picture, but it's a picture that the audience will have to endure when they are nothing more than a tiring, cryptic, acct action movie. Just the doctor's order ... all right? How many more of this Hollywood movie has been made? one thousand? Two thousand? The sources of these films have been so severely damaged in dust that it may be completely unknown to date. Locals change, plots are the same, and the development of the same shallow character and the trained actors are evenly asked to act in accordance with the shallow acting of pseudo-cartoon characters and work accordingly. This movie runs an intermediate run. "When will this movie end?" I repeatedly thought to myself Leonardo DiCaprio was completely unbelievable as an operator of the CIA, but what would be one of Misfit's great gossip, an overweight Russell Crowe played the role of a bureaucratic CIA. Please note that the on-site operator of this movie is "Fine and Average" but its Desk Junk Supervisor Fatty. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why does Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or does Nicole Kidman play Selvwani, a distorted department store? And the story is so surprising that no amount of literature licenses can carry this credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (MD KiPrio) is trying to stop himself as Arab ... Speaking clear Arabic ... all the hair is designed in the brain which has been destroyed for the failure ... thoughts and outfits are real Arabs who Its ridiculous Arab museum is completely stupid! They are trying to romanticize a Palestinian woman, while managing a very sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. Until now you get points. Next time try to roll a real Arab role. Even the most naive movie singer can even believe in all that. There should be a rough balance between the drama and the opponent. The playwright in this movie is so transparent and incapable that the stories spread. The next stop for this movie - DVD Land and Reduction And one other thing. Do not be disappointed with this movie to work for the government. The salary may not be great, but the benefits of the refrigerator are excellent, it is a critical fact that this movie is easily removed.
