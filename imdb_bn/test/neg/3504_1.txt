I wrote this as a two-part review. Part two have spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, that this car is not about sex with the accident. You know about racism in this LA, where everyone is racist, and the nation is always the subject of everyone's mind. Race. <br /> <br /> There is a tirt syndrome like its movie where the race constant theme. Race. Racist Racism Race relations Relay Race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggys created a movie that took the Magnolia Structure, which was used to disconnect the practically connected people, and then it turned around 1'53 "mental. Racism in America. During the hours we have 7 stories that are all connected and parallel to the nation. In the first hour, people say ridiculous things and In Meria, the attempt to become realistic about racism makes irrational work. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of Ludicas and Lornez Tate provides comic relief, very bad, the first half of their story is directly quoted from the position of Paul Fiction's Bonnie. The Quantin Tarantino division, where, instead of talking about peace and trust in the feet and religion, the character race and racism <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To make her invisible impenetrable cloak bullet. Extraordinary authors, but the writers have daughters and only to know what they will say in their place <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are very funny. Hindu reality does not work in any similar way. The scene where he is trying to correct the lock and the Mexican tells him that he needs a new door short and stupid. Why would such a person work? Is it realistic? NOOO It reminds me of the store-maker, from The Dome Generation, for my convenience. "Six dollars sixty six cents girly." I see the second half of the movie, I hope her head has been closed and her body's head begins to blossom. <br /> <br /> I did not mention the letter in the paragraph. Race. Racism Race for the sun. Good Then, the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has kept his shoulder chip against the blacks, Ryan Phillippe looks beautiful and does nothing, and other bad actors are acting poorly with bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon mocks the black producer's wife, can I help with cracking? When Philip was the second guess of his partner's writings for racial racism, can I help him? It's racist when the movie is so funny Racist I tell you Now, remember, this film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, thanks to Matt Dillon, who really tried to do a decent job. Who was off for that, I have no formula. <br /> <br /> If you are not preached to ethnic racism in the society, then there is no similarity between reality or interaction with actual society in any form or shape that is not being circulated by two white men from evil and illogical scripts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first half of the crash, any and all of the lines of the story take away ... and reinstate them, conclude, the earth A big compromise way And it's actually the worst way to do it. <br /> <br /> Take 1999 Magnolia. People were not properly tied together over again. They were just a weird way that happens more frequently than you think. You know someone who knows who did something that you know others were involved in. Crash This wrap takes in a deadly extreme. <br /> <br /> Stories have been aligned so that everyone is reunited. Are there only 5 people of the LAPD force? Do these people work odd pans? Dillon and Phillip were late the next day? And why would Tate be the killer of the kill? Was it not more emotional pressure, as well as realism, if someone were such a person, we would not follow it all day long? Just like a phillippe takes a haphazard hitchhiker and then freaks out. Finally, in the second half, the incisive camouflage scene was used to shoot the girl in Hindi. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Hindi did not fire the Hindus, but they created a beautifully sensitive scene and then it was the direct reason to kill people. It really ticked me off. To the authors, the scene is not. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and completely stagnant. Coincidences are much more and they require an extreme suspension of mistrust. Unlike Magnolia which was gently connected, it had links to connections that were just above the top. The only good part was in the second half when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. He did not die though. He must stay <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not just the framework, but it is a complete montage on The Deep song where You all are frustrated. Magnolia took it and posted a post-modern commentary with all the characters singing with Emmey Mans Wis Up. Unfortunately, in Magnolia came in 1999, Crash came out in 2005. It is difficult to comment on the film, which will not be made for 6 years, but it happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The second half: Never lower grade; Overall: F ---
