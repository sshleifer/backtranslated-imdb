A superb fast paced, exhilarating, interesting, rich book detailing. It is a huge shame that none of the images were there. Tom Hans's flexible screenplay or Robert Langdon was not funny, but the main character's name, a huge diversity from the main line of the story, and the poor Irish / Italian accent from Colognego to Karawenango, which was directed by Ivan McGioror, made for the worst book of the film. <br /> <br /> As a huge fan of this book, I hope to have a more profitable, truly high expectation for the book's detailed book, where the book will start and end as well - I would like more ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book, if Ron Howard Of course, I strongly advised to create another book in the film, but I would like to have KFC jigar food N 6.40 pounds and some chicken birds will be happy to save - much more entertaining and deeply satisfying!
