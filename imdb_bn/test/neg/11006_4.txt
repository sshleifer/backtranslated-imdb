Shakespeare in Love Fame Director John Maden gave us a bad film in the Ethan Frames. The plot center around a new tribute coming to the town of Starkfield City, where he learns the story of a once-romantic attempt with the sick wife and maid of the local sick man Ethan Frames. Adapted by Pulitzer Prize winning author Edith Wharton's novel Richard Necson, this film is not considered frustratingly poorly scripted and poorly thanks to the poorly humorous schmaltz. Still, there are other aspects of the film that works - cinematography is done well, Rachel Portman contributed a lovely score and none of their best, Liam Nisson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan worked well. Their role. But overall, Ethan frames are only a little convenient and easily forgotten.
