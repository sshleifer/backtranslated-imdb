Total disrespect! Really awful! A joke on screenplay and dialogue, and a director with a director who is a clear about the life of the Saudi Arabia. This is not a wonderful thing, most Saudi film O, director Palestinian-Canadian, writer Lebanese, major actress Jordanian, and the film is moved to Dubai, and these elements look very good to move the film away from the representation. Saudi society Yes there are some Saudi clich√©s in it, every day we see what we see on the cartoons in the newspapers, but everything is about it. This film had the opportunity to show real problems with the Saudi community, or at least give us something new and genuine about the problems and concerns of the young people in Saudi Arabia, instead it was copied and copied here and consequently it was a zombie. Even the story of the supposed love story in the movie does not exist or at least we did not see it. Some of the best performances from casting Cast supporting this only bright direction. The gentleman Khaled was funny about the poorly written role as Sammy, which he clearly misunderstood, because he saw his son younger than the acting actor. Also, the actor who played the role of a brother, Turkish al-Yusuf did well, he was actually the best actor of the film. Cast the rest, professional for long time, did a good job, but the main actor Hisham Abdul Rah Mann was just bad. He had a look of a little adorable Bobby for all the circumstances. She could not even tell her line correctly. His charisma which won him the title of Star Academy, is a famous reality show and he is good at interviews and TV shows, but he was the weakest link in the film. The main actress I did not mind a lot, but she also played badly in some scenes and unexpectedly crossed her sexuality. <br /> <br /> The movie was a huge hit, thousands of people came to Saudi Arabia's neighboring Bahrain. It was present in Dubai on display, and it created a tone, then it was provided in every scene, then there was a TV broadcast and it was in a few weeks. This house was cash-rich in entertainment to entertain, but was lazy; The film was not home, nor amusement.
