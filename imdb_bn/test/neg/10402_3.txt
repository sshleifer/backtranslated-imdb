Fear and desire are basically the interest of the Kubrick emotional, who can print this incredible clap trap for the signs of its sheer magnificence. To ensure that the film was not shown or made available to the legitimate video, the quiz was right on the right. She thinks it embarrassing and amateur, and she was right in her assessment. It's a weak and tiring movie - it's still more than "Barry Lyndon" in the 68th minute! However, there are historical interests and its real absorption moments. This is a tough movie to find (only "unauthorized" copies are introduced), although the Quebec Estate is released on the video and it appears, but it may change. Recommended for only Kubrick enthusiasts.
