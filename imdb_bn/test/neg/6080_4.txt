I'm always interested in seeing neglected films, which seem to be good credentials, but in this case, neglect of film is right. Based on some actual events during WWII, the film does not add anything to the viewer that it is not clear to me. One possible reason - in the print that I saw in TCM, no scenes where the Germans talked themselves were not given titles. The concept of this attractive directory - non-German-speaking viewers should guess only from "the background" which the Germans say to each other - help to complete a flow and lock the viewer in my book. Also, the way the movie starts - leaving us very confused without too many setup - it is uncomfortable. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the "Great Account" and "Stagg 17" reputations will not be challenged by this flicker.
