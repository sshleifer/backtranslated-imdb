I just saw this picture only Sarah and I'm giving these 4 stars for him, on the other hand I saw this movie as one of the worst movies. The practice was terrifying. The script was uninspired. This is a movie that was contrary to itself. The film was brutal and unreasonable. I do not like to feel like a good film. Just give something a jump or two. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, really a shame, I am sure that there was a hidden concept anywhere. <br /> <br /> I may have made it difficult for the film to be 4/10 but the actors are involved and again the genius of writing SARA clearly, this picture really should be distributed much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just shit, I can not keep it separately. Since the very beginning someone knows that she is going to be shit. <br /> <br /> Story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, mostly distort everything. I like the movie Vampire and I know they will never win an Oscar, but it's not worth watching, I can not believe how anyone created this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's about a dream / reality experience. The film's development is incompatible, the motivation of characters ... does not exist, everything seems to be a big joke. Probably what they tried to do, but I doubt sincerely. I want to know what they tried to pull but it just retreated, it is definitely one of the worst movies in my life (and I saw a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to it) Please make yourself and do not see it. <br /> <br /> PS it is full of clich√©s! Bad 2 bad script, bad directions, bad cinematography Freshly 3 I bothered to comment on this as the opinion of everyone.
