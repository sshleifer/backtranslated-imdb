I'm new to Argentina's work, and if this and Suspira give a hint, then the filmmaker's experience of much more than the Argentine story. In his films, the letters are placed in horrendous and tragic horror topics, which literally mitigate the world's rhetoric around them. Cameras literally flow through characters literally, such as running characters, running, and running their way towards a final horror conclusion. It's really good work in Susprio. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem I saw with this movie is that, when contacted by the police and seeking help from his friends, the drama "gets help" still finds solutions to his problem He refused "to get help" on the condition of trying to do so. The fraud of this movie is that he is trapped in a small game of murder, which he can easily overcome ... not set himself so easily? It seems strange that the character wants to torture the victim of murder, which is a way and it can work, except its whole psychology is thrown out due to most of the Argentines who prefer to do so. <Br /> <br /> As a loving tribute to "Open Phantom", it is certainly an interesting and unique step. For all its worth, Argentina is also happy with the operating movement, which best demonstrates the activity. It's not just a lot of nonsense, especially it goes ahead to the end of the stupid (yes, I know it's reference to Harris novel "Red Dragon." No, it does not work). Why the character director is going to go from a terrible experience to entrapment a willing one is beyond me. It almost felt self-service in the part of Argentina. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun experience, and I'm not willing to follow more Argentine productions in and between. But I do not want to go back or think about this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
