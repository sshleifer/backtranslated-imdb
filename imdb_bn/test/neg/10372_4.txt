I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once took part 5 in VHS 10 years ago, and I was frustrated. But perhaps it was because I did not see the fourth because they shot back. But finally, seeing a copy today, there was no better way than 5 numbers. My expectations were not high enough to start, but it's a direct video video from the video, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. Acting was not believable, the story was rather silent without any tension and did not have much effect. But the main problem is that there was no murder or no gore (the annoying child in his car should have been highlighted, but let's go.) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 -seekel-director Jeff Boond was operated who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainso Genocide III. I like Poppet Master: Legacy, even if it does not have anything other than to give respect to the best scenes from all movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, dolls are much like the master heliher series: a great three-dimensional but forget the rest ..
