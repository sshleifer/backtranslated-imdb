Please miss it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christie Swanson and the rest cast have done exceptionally well. Show flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Michael Madison allowed this on his plate. She does not seem to be working often and her performance was quite unthinkable, so you madison fans give it a miss.
