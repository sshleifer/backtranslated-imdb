People speak dirty with the fearsome 976 "line of party" and probably meet for sexual licenses. A scary, somewhat barbaric sister and sometimes Transvestite brothers use lines to kill people, usually married men, but they are not discriminatory! A pair of 16-year-old girls would like to call the line for fun, of course, to be old. One of them works for married people, who is warm for her (or anyone else). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, while finding one of the siblings, he was the first person to be assassinated. She teamed with a female assistant of District Attorney. <br /> <br /> Special nothing special here. Richard Rundetry is more than a como as a police chief. The 16-year-old dirty talk has acted in an actress who is afraid of the Peanut-proof papermint Patti! According to IMDB, the other person dies a few years after the film: sad.
