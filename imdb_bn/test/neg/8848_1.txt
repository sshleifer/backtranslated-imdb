Do not see these pictures. In most cases, the Japanese film as the Zoo-On and The Grud is infinitely better than the American rimak. However, this movie was terrible. Ghost, a lot like a comedy or a medical doctor, dressed as a sheet of ghosts and became scary due to lack of good makeup or special effects, and the act is very awesome. The story itself is incompatible and confusing, everything is not explained about the film going from bad to bad. Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure that more entertaining things - like paint looks dry.
