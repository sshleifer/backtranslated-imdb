I've hired this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most spent waste (and time) I've ever spent. It's stale! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Everything you want to expect, it's just a bad way. Acting was terrible. My dog ​​could do a good job Special effects have no effect - without fully inspire mistrust. And the Chess line .... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only achievement I can give is opening this section of sh * t. They were actually quite beautiful. And why I decided to hire this one. The graphic shown is probably the best and most realistic CG of the whole film. <br /> <br /> The total marking is less than 1 in 10, it is less.
