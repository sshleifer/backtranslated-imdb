Sadly, this movie leaves nearly 1% of the campaign created in 2004 and has a very tastier taste in the mouth. A video similar to video game enthusiasts, book pests, and movie fans depends on whether any original idea (on paper or on gaming consoles) is no frustrating and does not provide. And only that, well under the sign goes well. The video game of liberation war created a culture such as 2004, since it was easy to create a movie from the content and the gamers were swollen for watching movies. If you are a gamer that has played Far Cry; Do not see these pictures. Anyone else who did not play the game; It will still feel like a B-grade acting / B-grade managed movie. Uwe Boll, shyness hanging your head ... This should be easy to make a blockbuster. The story of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park fills Alien), and still you are able to accept it and immediately cast it into the classic classic junkies. Video game companies will be warned - if Uwe bowles a knife, then close the door. Oh and Til Sgager ... I look forward to making you ready for yourself in the Inglourious Bastar. What were you thinking of taking this one? Sigh
