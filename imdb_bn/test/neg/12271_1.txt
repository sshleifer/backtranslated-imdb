For those of you who do not remember the movie - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - It was published in '79 (I think it was enough time that Nunzi also thought that he can only repeat and wrote - yes , Okay!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Turns eyes. From the Sicilian perspective (Remember that it is under the 3rd generation line ... after the original "fog" war and reached my childhood during my childhood - yes I am an Australian. So "wogg softness" submerged a lot They've even sounded like true-blue Australian words - there's no glimpse of "Dougie Actin" (there, noon for others!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Sunnies (sunglasse with Maori) S) 4 o'clock in the morning In the middle of the night, the sun has to be cool to become blind and it looks like redfire ... at the tiring end of this movie.Nonzi tried to copy the warrior's flavor, but kept many holes in the story, how about recent events. <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Astronomers got a gang of baseball balls to keep the badge, train the white face makeup heroes Tangled in the train and fought with them - the Nungeoos gang was behind a railway station of a gang, wielding stick wearing white face masks. The fighters were wrongly accused of shooting / killing another gang member - Nungeos gang mistakenly accused Maori gangbong sisters of raping Accused A group of girls is fired in a room of the fighters - in order to attack them, a friend of Nungeys crowd roams around the house, which is crowded by a gang of women - there are many copies of the Warriors here about <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that people do not want to see another step from OZ for this unexpected - how's Mad Max - the commander and the world's master? Not all movies are made by so bad actors, there are their own movie funds. <br /> <br /> As far as the other actors of this event are concerned, it seems they have taken their quote from "Noon" because they are all bad as each other - do not get annoyed with this movie! I can not get my money back - so save you!
