Intelligence Sergeant Vince de Carlo (James Lucy) and the company is a deadly serial killer / rapist. Psychologist Carroll (Susan Sullivan) can help, or will she become the next victim of the killer? And what with the killer Sunny White Dood Afro? <br /> <br /> "Killers Delight" lawyer "The Dark Ride" inspired by serial killer Ted Bundy's case is not much less than the serial killer story since 1978, which does not offer much. If anything, it is much more than a sparkling system than a horror movie, because most violence has stopped the camera. Sure, we are getting explosive firms, but we do not get fairly into the exploitation section - especially considering that they are not from later, not in crime. Those who like "The Toolbox Morders" or "Manic" will be very disappointed with their expectations. Fortunately, there is an impressive scene that is trying to escape a woman from the killer whose voice is correct, and it is quite doubtful to boot. Also, John Carlson is quite effective as a killer, although his delightful hairstyle (white boys with Afro are always shiny valuable) but more than a little confusing. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Raid" guarantees a recommendation in a very routine and medieval way, because it lacks appropriate absorption factors and is dated according to the time value. Those who are looking for a good example, they probably will not "go home" and instead they have to move some, because it simply does not cut it.
