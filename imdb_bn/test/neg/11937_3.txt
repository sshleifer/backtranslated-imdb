When I saw this list, my film had high expectations and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Clif in many movies but I feared that other characters would call him Chris again and he did not make Yule Brenner's Chris a reasonable person. The movie may be completely frustrating - I tried it - the music soundtrack originally tried to illustrate the dignity, but it failed to bring the original as the standard value. Basically the rich texture of the letters was mostly absent from this movie. If you did not see the real I got it right. Very little depth of many clich√©s and letters. I miss the humanity and compassion and the original three dimensional letters.
