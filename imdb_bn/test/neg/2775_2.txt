It's a cheesy-film created by Al Adamson - perhaps a person who was probably the worst movie producer - perhaps probably worse than Ed Wood, Junior. Adamson 60s, extremely low budget horror and specialized in skin films in the 70's. And with these titles as 80 and the five bloody caves, the bloody angel of Hell, the drunkenness of Shatans and the fate of nature, he is clear that he is not making Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This journey was published in Dracula Versailles Frankenstein's previous picture. It's lucky because the previous movie was so awesome and blood could not help Brian but it looks so good to execute so badly! Of course, makeup is ridiculous, plot cell phones (this is related to the universal brain transplant scheme) and the acting level Z, but it's still better than their last movie! <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about this movie is the older actor, Midget Angelo Rossito was actually better than usual - more dialogues and more important role in the plot - and in fact there are some ideas of danger and tension. As Miss Carol, she still looks like a stripper and left to throw through this silly flick. However, bad film fans are bad enough to look good - you just have to look at the makeup of the age which is acid burn and the beetle gun that is made from the full tail!
