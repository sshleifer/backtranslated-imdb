This is another Bollywood remake of the Hollywood movie. Hit ... if I'm not correct then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A game in terms of comedy. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav! Who is ridiculous as the Indian icon 'Carn' imitation gangster. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know I have the messy word but it mainly has a soft spot for me because, she seems to be funny but it seems to be compelling. Her acting weakened ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is brutal, he tried to bring quiet, charming depth but unfortunately failed, he worked and screamed for any apparent reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not see why people think it's beautiful ... the plot was far away and I believed that Katrina's character was remotely attracted to Gobinda. The only good thing is the music ... 'you were my best friend' soundtrack.
