Wild Rebel is funny in bad ways, but real good, or at least effective, is frustrating due to the story's content. It works with a racing car driver (Steve Alamo), which blends into a group of devil's bikes called Devils, which rotate until a bank decides to loot. Meanwhile Alimo has been appointed by the police, has been sent back to the Angels who arrived and where they would loot. If you can call that deck to a really notable filthy and stupid music (even from a scene band, "Performance" in Alamo, it is also not true that the film is really 'dated', regular generic score). <br /> <br /> It is true that more careers for filmmakers, more guides, directions, and portions have not been cared for better. As I did with the Hallows, I did not like the main dislike of the film, but it almost kept me a little indifferent. What comes as unpredictable comes only through stupid things called the City of Florida ('Citrusville' ho ho-ho). Therefore it is completely disqualified as its mystery science theater 3000 status delayed. The comment on this movie is good, sometimes I want to know how often the characters on the screen seem to be valuable. If you've got six-packs and fewer prospects, wild rambles can be a good time but it will not be seen again.
