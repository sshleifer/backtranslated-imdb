Robot vs. Azzight Mami was one of the most perfect and least reliable movies I have ever seen. Re. Who, I can buy that the movie is a virgin, a virgin, a reborn which was sacrificed to an ambassador to God. I'm incredibly messy looking mummy and even worse looking robots that I can not buy. When you want to see a movie like this, you want to see many battles. But robots and mummies fight for about a minute! Probably the worst was that they were credited to the Dea de los Mubarts art. It's the worst I've seen. Avoid this one if possible.
