So you have spoiler warning --- but I'll argue that you can not be damaged beforehand. I think they changed the name to "The Cave" before the fame of "Weinstein". <br /> <br /> After paying the wire rent for this movie, I had considered preserving the garbage of my family for a month and the author / director of this mailing it. She has been distributing my trash to my house, so I think it's just fair that. <br /> <br /> The movie is open with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; Perhaps the author is a fan of Ali G. Shaw. But they just started inside the cave, because apparently there was no Kazakhstan outside. This was the first formula that I'm going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no freedom fighter in this movie, save it: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, direction, acting, cinematography --- every aspect of this movie is just bad. And I like bad films, incognito films, B-Awesome films. . . But this was just plain bad. And stupid And Hackneynid And expected. And annoying. <br /> <br /> To get a feel for the picture, go to your laundry room with your 5 friends and turn off the lights. Place a flashlight (on) in your dryer and start tumbling it. Now you all start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a complete revision, 6 of the laundry rooms died on 5 floors. Toss Karo Syrup on them. Turn the lights back on (off the dryer). Now the man wearing Gorilla enters the house and rape the last person with rape. Adendam: Reading through other comments, many think it's great to have a low budget. It's not awesome. Wonderful making of a crap movie in a huge budget (Waterworld). Creating a good movie in a low budget is awesome (like Blair Witch, which I've totally enjoyed). Making a shit film in a low budget is not surprising, and if you are still making these movies you can expect more, because I can not imagine anyone who sees it and then makes cash money. <br /> <br /> Is the budget low for excuse for a terrible movie? No, and it certainly does not have any reason to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It should be tilted downwards, but the number of innocent innocent visitors is their filmmakers 10 stars can increase the ability to request personal friends.
