In Thailand, American Connor (Colin Egensfeld) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meridith Monroe) quarreled in Muay-Thai war, and Amanda left alone Conor. He directs a stranger to the hotel, in fact, the moderate (Don Heretak), moderate, and he cats and kidnapped by a gang of his naughty vampires on a motorcycle. Conor joins the "good" vampires under the leadership of Sir (Stephanie Chau), trying to save Amanda from the bird of Niran. <br /> <br /> I hope "Vampires: The Turning" was a good movie. Location and cinematography are beautiful; Very heavy music scores are excellent; Stefani Chow is fantastic and striking; But unfortunately, the screenplay and the director do not help his fallen breasts in the very loose clothing of Terrible and Meridi Monroe. The story is very short, and the complete unknown minimum of time for the film using the long-standing scene with the unknown Martyce Motorcycle race, fights and annoying flashbacks. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: a convero" ("Vampire: Convert")
