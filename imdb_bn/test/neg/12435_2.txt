I'm not the biggest fan of Larry Clark, but somehow, I'm dragging almost all of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I'm too big in punk rock, and I'd say that this picture is frustrating for both audiences. Not every punk song included "O!" <br /> <br /> The problem with this picture is that it changes every 15 minutes or more and lacks any kind of harmony. Clarke told his biographer that his fantasy story "how the kids really are" and thus allow you to allow ten minutes of strong dialogue that can not go anywhere, because it seems to be the desire of the movie. However, when he draws a ridiculous death scene (any of them choose, save for the opening drive), the highly decorated attempts on what I think are the purpose of black humor is completely out of context, ridiculously shocking (maximum), a student Much worse than film) and the story conditions are absolutely ridiculous. John Cosvettes and "Data Movies" create poor pedals, because the ongoing style of the next version takes you out of a movie that reminds you that you are watching a movie - it's really really bad.
