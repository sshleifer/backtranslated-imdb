Some giant cats are a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some Marine and the scientists in charge of the project paved the way for the sub-vehicle to retrieve their products. After finding 200 dead bodies, the Marine Commander told the doctor, "I need to know that there is nothing here that could cause my men to be in danger". Oh, g ... do you remember? He asked, "What is there to know?" Yup, that's pretty good size up One of the scientists is obviously fools intelligent - heavy on the fool, light on the intelligent. He gave the light fixing task. He found the control panel for lights, cut a wire and found the bamboo hooks. Then he did it again. Then he takes a hammer and breaks the control panel, making all the lights of the submarine begin to work. <br /> <br /> And so it goes. Apparently this was made in Sweden; Whether the Swedes really have a weird idea of ​​ridiculous or not really sure if I'm really awful movie makers. I'm eager to think of the scary filmmaker. If you assume that a huge explosion happened at the end of this item, sorry, but it is a need-based basis, so I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you've seen absolutely a giant Scorpion movie, I have a tile sting, a chassis of Scoppieran on a plane and a fun movie, or Bagus, which is considered to be a rough genre of film about a tunnel. Look at this movie as an absolute ending resort. Oh, it's worth watching, it's hard to stop because of it's cruelty, but it's all about what it's like.
