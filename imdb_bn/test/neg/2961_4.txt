I saw Shelo's grave many years ago, and * that * was one of those movies that I have kept in memory for a long time. It was intense since the start and with lots of sudden twists. But this makes all sense. <br /> <br /> I can not speak of dead bodies. There is a subtitle above the title claiming it is "better than Shelve Graeve". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They're the first to appear first. That might work as a surprise, but it does not surprise me. I could see it a few minutes ago, and * that * a big difference with Shelve Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing to mention is that the characters of this movie are not often very realistic. When the film ends, they behave more and more. <br /> <br /> If some characters were completely innocent, I would have been more interesting to know what was going on. It was better to contrast with Tonty and his friend's example, with whom they * had to carry a huge * secret. However, for some stupid reason the filmmakers decided that all the characters should display their darkest sides. It does not work in such a movie. <br /> <br /> The last felt a lot like the open end. It leaves me with an unhappy feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> At first I could give these six stars this image because it is not a completely bad movie. I like watching it. Most of the time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes I've seen really poorly played and unrealistic scenes and because of the frustrating open end, I'm with four stickers at the moment. And it can be a mistake because I've spent my time and money. Unlike Shello Grave, maybe I'll soon forget the dead body. This is not just a special movie. <br /> <br /> The creator with this film could do a lot better. It's a shame that they do not.
