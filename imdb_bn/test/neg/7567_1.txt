If I could give this movie less than 1, then I would definitely do it. I read a review of this movie in the LA Times and I saw myself walking in the theater and remembering the review. My wife and I were playing and we thought it could not be as bad as critics - you know critics. Sure enough ... I have terrible acting, awesome camera work, pause with the budget abuse (which has been repeatedly referred to as over). I worked with the small budget movie which is 100 times better. It is the director and the producer who works in the film - they select the teams. That's it. If they do not keep it together and it works ... it simply will not. So, they did-- and it's not. I do not think they ... I want to take the time to write this review ... although I'm not sure that the movie crew does appreciate this review - I hope I'm doing everything on your behalf to make you do my best, but - in another career . Good luck
