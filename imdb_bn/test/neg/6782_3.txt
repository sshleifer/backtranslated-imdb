Some local friends recommend this, but as a film it is really largely lacking. I found the letters as obsolete stereotype, and the plot is almost predictable from the beginning. However, if you prefer the traditional English / Appalachian ballad, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. I read that soundtrack movie is nothing like music, professional singer admission for actors.
