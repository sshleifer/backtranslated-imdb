For the first time I saw this movie ten years old. I thought it was bad, and at that age I did not taste any movie. I watched this movie 3 days ago in Cinemax and thought why I hate this picture in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, annoying and objectionable. There is no way that the main character ever falls in love with her. Curiosity was a bit more and the dialogue was worse than the TV. Soap opera !! I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, or rent it. I felt bad for my parents, who had to bear with me! Madonna is not necessarily bad actress, but in this role she has been portrayed as completely stupid.
