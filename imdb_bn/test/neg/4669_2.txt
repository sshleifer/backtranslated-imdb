Like many people in my normal age range, I think this movie has to be seen as a child in '98 and remember to get out of tears dramatically. It seems, at that time, the experience of the most important, wonderful film of our generation. Once the riveting, action-packed, fun, heartfelt, and really inspirational, Armegeddeon is really going on everything, directly featuring the Aerosmith theme song and ending sappy tear-jarker. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus We were smoking? Last night I saw this in one of the first movie channels, and ... I can not even describe it. This is, really, one of the worst movies ever made. Where to start even? Embarrassing scientific flaws (which are 'employees' trackers 'on astronauts'? ​​Yes, sure, thank you, Billy Bob), I want to tell about that the worst thing was awesome - I even dare to say dishonestly, in which it combines crappy writing with crappy acting . Even here, there are many examples of these to start the list, but especially in the springs - a scene where Bruce Willis is right in the Fed where everyone has to go to track the arrogant-rogue members of each. The Oil Drilling Team ('Check each time New Orleans', 'Vegas's Craig Tables', 'The Only Black Man In Sturgis Motorcycles' ... All 'Together Together' ... This reminds me of a little "New Team! Assembly!" From the Anchoran scene without serious). Ben Affleck has proved that he is again the most paid actor in Hollywood, in which there is less depth, range and overall talent than anyone else in the business. Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or Garbage did not have any better at this god-oriented level. <br /> <br /> I said, I went to see the pre-starded Oven Wilson. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, (Again, Peter Strummer seems to have got the talent to play in the upward uropody.) It was really interesting that American's Russian space station (which is actually called in the film ), Which resulted in Ben Affleck exclusively producing the whole jointly spectacular Hollywood fashion explosion. I also love the fact that in the world only Paris has lost its only place in the world, and absolutely no one cares. And at the top of all that, at the point literally turns the ads simultaneously for Lockheed Martin and Care McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. <br /> <br /> There are lots of stuff, but I'm not going to ... It's enough to say that it's really, really, really terrible movies, that I'm ever feeling ashamed to really love. <br /> <br /> I just give it two stars for fun factor.
