I'm not the greatest fan of Almodor ever, but, generally, I have always found something to enjoy in his movies. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something to enjoy broken embraces, then I would generally think. <br /> <br /> I embraces the largest character characters in the embrace and they lack the depth of the display. The film is basically a love story, which is tragic, and wants to include viewers in their story. I got this problematic from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the first scene, our 'hero' director / screenwriter Mateo, having sex with a very attractive young woman she met very often. <br /> <br /> At first, our hero director / screenwriter Matto, showed a very young girl with sex with sex. Her agent comes, and rolls her eyes, as the woman leaves bashfully. Maito makes a little bit of the need to enjoy life as he has left. Visitors can buy this concept in the event of being blind in a tragic car accident that killed his true love lenna, played by Penelope Cruz, but the rest of the picture is not illustrated why Lenna is in love with her life or the depth of her character or any other <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cruz, an artist named Ernesto Martel, played Lena. From the beginning, their union made an unhappy, jealousy to Martel Lena, and Lenna avoided uncertainty because of her relationship with the old Martel. To proceed, Martell made a movie for Monteiro so that he could keep a movie star, Lenaar Tab. Naturally, without a background, Lena and Mato fell in love. And, in the world of Almodovar it is really that easy. Initially Matias, having sex with a sexy young man, is now in love with Matteo Lena, after seeing that her boyfriend had a son with her boyfriend. His son smiled and replied, "Oh, well." Again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, it's all right. Finally, from the beginning of the film, I did not feel any depth from Mateo. He is flat, and does not work much different from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> The scene I enjoyed was when film producer Martel was watching the video footage, Mateo was doing a documentary recorded in his son's mind. Martell obsessively obsessively watches a moment as a lip study ensures her worst fears. Later, Lena struggled with Martel because she was watching the footage, and with her statement, her lip video footage loudly alouded out loud aloud. Some pretty bright moments. Rather changed, but still interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the movie has bothered me. I could not take care of these characters or their situation, so the part of Almodovar could not lack the depth of this amount of cleverness. I think if you are a fan of his work, you will enjoy this movie, but if you are like me, you will find it lacking in it.
