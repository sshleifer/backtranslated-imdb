Well, you know ... Roger Howard and Robert Patrick are both really good actors. But with this movie, WTF? The story was in Lam and the script was just terrible. There was no material to work with poor actors! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover invited you to the Flight Action Flick. Hope you like something like Top Gun ... huge disappointment! Flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you mute. The air view is clearly not made for documentary and is taken from some other footage source, this is not made for the movie. And they were not even concerned about the models of Marx or the fighters, the viewers would not notice it to pay tribute. <br /> <br /> I told that the story was hair. It may be very interesting with little effort from authors and directors. In short, it seems to be a B-movie made in the 70's. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for these actors who keep their names here. They sure will be ashamed.
