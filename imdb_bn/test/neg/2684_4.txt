Scott's 80's icon collection can not save this disaster disaster. But then I think why it was only a TV movie and not a big motion picture. Schwartz at William (author) comes up with something near "Steward School", boring without this movie except this. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and totally intriguing. This is the only reason to see Tina Yther in the real role after family relations. After this movie and equally "Class Cruise", I guess that Mr. Scott became fantastic and went back to the seat-less, which is his best step. 10 out of 4
