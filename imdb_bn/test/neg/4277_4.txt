This version of Manfield Park was very perfect when I felt a lack of feeling for Fanni, which is very important for this Jane Austen story and central. This actress was due to the total lack of power played by Le Touzel in Sylhet. He did not have any appeal and sometimes seems to have lost outside the place or its depth. He was violent with his uncle, where he broke into hysterics. She saw the most important scene and I'm really sorry that Henry Crownford never cared for her. <br /> <br /> Picture by Mary Crofford, Mary Crowford's screenplay Jackie Smith-Wood What a wonderful actress, that character can be malicious and self-centered, selfish, or even weak in love. <br /> <br /> I always like the Fanny. He is light-minded but with an impenetable sense of what is right, and he thinks worthy of respect and praise. In this adaptation Fannie is very serious and very less humble about her own thoughts, near the end of the series. As much as I like this fanny ... I just can not. <br /> <br /> I think this version of Mansfield Park is a real thing ... novel. Fannie will not be disappointed ... you will love her!
