If you read the plot summary for "Mad Max", you just finished the first 1 hour and 10 minute movie. You've also found that "Mad Max" is held in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be helpful because otherwise you have no idea what's going on. The 1979 film, Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) only works hard for that movie, actually makes sense and influences its curiosity. This image is not a car / bike stunt-filled roam, which crashes like every vehicle in the film. <br /> <br /> The first thing with "Mad Max" is that it tries to sell itself for a final 20 minutes as a revenge story when taking revenge for revenge. The first hour is narrowed by 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 is added and then another hour is added, "Mad Mac will be a great action film with a great impressive drama, instead of waiting for Mel Gibson and 2 / There is a sudden epiphany to work like a sissy for 3 and then seek revenge.I will still see the series "Road Warrior" and I must admit that I'm excited for it only because I want to know that the next picture is mostly lost. <br /> <br /> George Millar has done some great work here, but the top of it is an irrational and unbearable Chess response sequence. Every time a character discovers something terrible like a burning arm or you've completely destroyed those moments This is a very close b-movie technique. <br /> <br /> This film does not have any valuable evaluation or subtle criticism of a society.You can think of a great action. Sci-Fi makes at least one point in the movie, but Violent, gratuitous bikers done by gratuitous irregularities say something of value. Even the villain Towers think that alcohol's "clockwork" model is simply rude and incomplete. PJ Violence does not just permit the gang members to sit in the violence and respond to the audience, if it is anything else, then they hold it down. <br /> <br /> I'll credit the credit for the amount of stuff blew up the film crew and crush into things and makes Miller feel the severity of the clash you work in a great job. Everything else is intermediary and then one hour after the mediation, you get a little better and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers "Road Warrior" where the film ends its expectations, otherwise it will be lost more time. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
