Supreme Concert is a film about a female killer who works in the United States. He must kill a known TV reporter, but when he sees his little girl, he will abandon his life. Because he did not kill him, he became the next target of his employers. <br /> <br /> I saw bad B-movie even if the script is not good. The killing of innocent people in the fight against terrorism, the government is beyond? Aliens release the hunter ??? No, the maximum approval script will not win any prize. And acting is no better, I'm afraid. Some well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Crusty Swanson), who paid most of the bills recognized for playing this film, and yet with any other actors who probably do not even know how the camera actually looks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not have anything to do but some action flick is to be seen and you're tired of MacGivever's 10,531th restoration, but it might be a movie that you want to see. Otherwise you leave it alone well. I give it a 3/10.
