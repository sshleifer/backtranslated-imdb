About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental shop to see some. My friend saw the shelf space trucker, and so we got it. Once we returned home, we realized what it was a part of! Can a Boat Float Place? A guy taking a dump in a toilet? A man with a mechanical dick who tries to awaken a woman, "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! Tearing my eyes, fools, fools, the most annoyed, horrible thrones were uncovered together. My friend and I have seen it as the worst movie we ever saw. Only another movie has come close to its ambiguity (and that stupid Jackie Chan Flick, "Medalone"). If you have seen this scene in the sandy scene in your video store, proceed to do the following: 1. Look at it and throw it on the ground. 2. Stomp it for at least 30 seconds. 3. An inclusion facility (bathroom stool) to proceed to set it to fire. 4. Finally, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste management facility so that it can be dealt with properly. <br /> <br /> Stay away from "Space Trackers" !!!!!!!!
