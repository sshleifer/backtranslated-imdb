Interesting subject. Patienceous delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, got accustomed and his emergency world - restoration of the first life. Here is the beginning of happiness. The underlying problem is that Miles has no soul !!! These two are used to explain their short-flawed behavior to indirectly being responsible for death (I believe this is the total number of deaths within 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> Miles likes a strange brand of glass, a fire burning flame and his young, mature cousin cousin. Finally, the film can be judged. Some ideas: 1. Producer $$$ took part in creating this trip. JD Figgleson was the author of Script and one (or only) producer. It seems that when he saw his other writing credits, there is no lesson on how to "get an interesting idea of ​​life". This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now DVD is available !!! This is really awesome. Always in the VHS format should be "under the shelf". <br /> <br /> 3 A resurrected man without a soul would be the default of an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. Scores are provided with minimal support. Jerry Gold may not even save the form in an in-form form. <br /> <br /> 5. More touch sensitive than the 0230 timeline slots and infrailers on TV + the test patterns that I have tested while watching it <br /> <br /> 6. Thankfully no sequels ala Wes Craven do not spawn the "nightmare" franchise. Chilar Too: Return Return of Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie as a great example of how I would still be able to kill acting or script writing, despite my rating 1. It should be applied to indicate, but Wis Craven "Alem Street on a Nightmare" will be exempted as its only good piece of 1984.
