What I came up after watching this movie was the guilty conscience. The film itself is more interesting than the plot line and its context, but unfortunately it is a movie that you can not watch with pornography bombings. If you plan to view it and you have a moral problem with decreasing marital law for viewing pleasure, you are making a big mistake. In this token sex scene you do not have any type of movie that you can avoid in your DVD player. At the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character taps the video of his sexual exploitation without the knowledge of his partner. This tape and others like it continue popping up throughout the film at an unexpected time. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about women's dignity. In this way, they turned many women into prostitution. I gave it 2 instead of 1 because they played belvedown obscurity, it was an interesting movie.
