But of course, one of the worst 10 of all times is a serious contender for one. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, in this case as the title of Sandra Bullock. This false advertisement - he's on-screen for about 10 minutes of film <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrific, the edit was apparently done by someone running in quadudes, the direction was ... well, just say that my 14-year-old girl Can work better, but I hope he will not see such extraordinary praise from me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stupid stories, bad writing, and should be able to move to the film as the only 7th grade media class . <br /> <br /> In short, this drake.
