I love his martial art style, fast, close and very quick, but it seems his movies are becoming more crime-oriented, lifestyle quality and less meaningful ... I thought he was able to send a deeper message. At least some movies had a secret or agenda, in which there were some of the most valuable qualities of the character, but the rest were so far away. I was very frustrated. Martial arts also has trouble. I'm hoping to see more dedicated seagulls in his future films. The storyline of this movie is lacking in the running, so there are so many differences that the thinking is lost. Many things are mysterious without solutions.
