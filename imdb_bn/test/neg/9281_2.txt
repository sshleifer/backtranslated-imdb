This is a show I wanted to follow. But, I could not bring myself to dedicate this event to my time. In order to display a theme centered on politics, you must have a strong plot with a twist and girth to increase the mood of the show like "West Wing" or "Commander-in-Chief". Rob Loay was right, but actors like Kyle Chandler could not act (he was "awful" in the "Initial version"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With the lack of suspense, urgency, and characters who could actually work, I just had to leave this event and I was glad that it was canceled so there is nothing left for me to miss. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
