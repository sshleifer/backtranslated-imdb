The film, which was omitted from non-production of Sun Air of the Charleston in 1972, has been described as a holiday movie for all concerned and is the best way to see it. Jean Renoir does not think footage editing together even think it enough. An easy reverse to the racial sectarian stereotypes ?? In 2028, a black investigator traveled to Paris Post-Holocaust, where a white native girl taught him Charleston (Naturally he thinks he is a barbarian, whose tendency to feed him before he's tempted to beat the song "White Aborigin".) There is a lot of stylish touches, Catherine Hessling's hair is full of Gorilla, Angela's telephone (Renoir and producer Pierre Brunbarger) or black actor Johnny Higgins plays her part in the small blackface, Hessling's dance power is almost completely incomplete, and there are some interesting occasional tests with slow motion, But for two reels it's really enough for survival II. Does this silent musically do not have any scores in the new DVD in the Lyons Gate?
