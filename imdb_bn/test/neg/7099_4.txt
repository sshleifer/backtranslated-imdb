On the scale of 1 to 10, I gave it 4. I thought this picture was not very good, there was not too much violence and did not like one character. <br /> <br /> I gave it to a boyfriend's scale a 6. Sexual scene was tinged with many underlying fog. I always enjoy nudity, and comes through Nancy Travis and Fay Grant, but sex scenes are more humiliating than lovers.
