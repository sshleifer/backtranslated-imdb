The headline is right for you ... a fishing island. Ship breaks are planted for doctors Claudio Casino and crew island, they are sorted by fishing or Treasure hunting manuscripts for Richard Johnson. The casino discovers that Johnson believes that he has found the missing city Atlantis, he has hosted the disgraced scientist Joseph Cotton and his daughter Barbara Baach for 15 years, so fishing boats can dig a billionaire under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a completely crazy. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This frenzy is managed by Sergio Martino and, without merit, is not surprisingly. It looks fast, rationally well played and the fishing looks quite strong (though it is impossible that anyone can not see this thing as real fishing). There is a wonderful music score by Luciano Michelin.
