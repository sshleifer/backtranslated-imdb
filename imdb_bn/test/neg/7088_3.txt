It is one of the 1950's golden communist polymics in Hollywood. Stalwart American Gender Barry, lovely English woman Valerie French, and three other unexpected - and fantastic obscure - power is abducted by an alien and given clamshell. What will earthlings do with such power? Is it used to toss in the sea or remove all of mankind? Anyone who knows America's American film in 1957 knows the answer to what it will do, but the story becomes ripe if America actually tests things in the middle of the Pacific. Then a scientist with the ultimate power of the universe brings his theory and uses it! His intense feelings are annoying later, and the happiness of everyone else is frustrating. The explosive for this dog is here: The capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that they say they only kill "enemies to ensure freedom"! That's right - Do not worry about the moral consciousness of deciding any foreign pill, it's the enemy of freedom. To do it! Hurray! No committee! Foolish woman - and you drop yourself into the sea! Ha ha Give me a kiss
