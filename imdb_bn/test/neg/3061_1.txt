How bad is this movie claiming? In my opinion, yes it is I'm not going to comment, quite a few comments seem to have been made already, from 'awful' - that's not so bad ... '. However, I can not resist. <br /> <br /> You made a movie on DVD cover. "Mother Barker and her sons ..." the real story and the "meeting with real people" value credits on the credit? I'm not a homemaker, but in this case it's a pretty relevant observation about this movie. <br /> <br /> Several comments threaten performance. They are very scary, Roberts, Russell, Milano and Stallone have some 315 movies and TV shows. They can work or <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the dialog is not in my taste and sometimes quite strange as funny. The shining look of the story does not seem to be a few scenes, but the minimum required for sticking to certain scenes. Violence and melodrama together. <br /> <br /> Instructions and screen writing should be wrong: Amirilis moans to see the violent mood of Mother Barracker and "take her!" Ends with ??? Formula You think Alice's acting ability ... Some screenwriters wrote that the line or response, and / or some directors shot it, and said, 'OK, it's good enough, or for an ad to recover, it's trustworthy ...' One footnote: I've copied my copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 for profit purchase; Running time is shown as 91 minutes, and I think the running time is listed as 95 minutes on IMDb. I do not know whether I am missing for 4 minutes, but I admit that if the correct person is 4 minutes in the right 4 minutes, then my rating may be 10 to 3 or 4. It is, 1/10 what I will vote for.
