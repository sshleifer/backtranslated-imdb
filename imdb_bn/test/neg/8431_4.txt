Ginkgo Bed is a weird movie. It was very slow, as it had many ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into a consistent story. Instead, we get different plotlines that are divided into their own small films. Oh sure, they eventually met up in the end, but it seems to all ... rather cashless. The note is the girlfriend of the hospital and her troubles. Was this ... interesting? Then "we are spirits, so we do not have any physical" elements, which makes people with the same problem with the ghost, namely: if the characters have no body (ie no physical form) and they can go through the walls and, How far away from the floor they fall, or the ceiling for it? <br /> <br /> Like the new kind of South Girlfriend, Ginkko made Bid very ambitious. There is a lot of impact, but the film is released and its obscure melody will only "touch" easily, then touch to start with. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (Visit www.nixflix.com for more detailed reviews of this movie and other foreign movie reviews)
