The movie can not be simply that open with a view. A man wakes up and his wife lives in bed, his morning prayers starts in his bedroom, when his wife sleeps quietly. The blessings of morning are read, but only Gitei becomes controversial. The rest is conveniently excluded. Then Philippe and a kiss he kisses his wife on a good morning! This is not the exact screenplay of Jewish prayer at a house, a chassidic house alone. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately illustrating the life of a chassidic life. He is eager to add a growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The scene of Mikka (seasonal bath) was far from right, and its Jewish wedding was ridiculous because it did not even reach the atmosphere of the chassidic wedding. There are many problems with the way my cassidic life, but there is no use of Amos Gitei's commentary on these issues. He thought that chasidemy is all dense comformists with the serious problem of depression. I can not agree with the Cassidy Lifestyle, but I acknowledge that there are many levels in the life of the Cassidy. Amos Gaitai was blinded by his own secular proxy-intellectual cruelty and therefore unable to film the correct depiction of the chassidic life. In addition to his poor research, in addition to the inconsistent screenplay of the chassidic life, Gitei also failed from other aspects. The plot is full of holes, silently loaded into dialogue, the soundtrack is very repetitive and sometimes while the strong is loaded with melody. The movie drags on and over and is not worth sticking around for the end. You must, but be warned. If you want to know about CASIDEAL life go to communities and talk to chassidimm. Do not depend on the pictures of Guitaiye!
