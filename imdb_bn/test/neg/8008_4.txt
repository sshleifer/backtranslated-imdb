I think this film does not make much of this film that makes a lot of money. Twists are not the problem of film The story was quite tricky and impressed if it was too cool. Why is everyone complaining about movie twists? The main problem is that the film is not enough to follow people. The film shot fiercely (at least its series brother lock, compared to the stock). Bad: Characters (though often played well) are just plain flat. There is not enough time for the characters to make enough acquaintances so that viewers are allowed to get involved with their singles alone, they have to understand. Oh, and the locations are just terrible: Location-Individuals (I'm not bothered to see credit for your name) - Get another job (perhaps still photography or interior design)
