I'll just start with some quotes from other critics that describe it best. <br /> <br /> "It's easily one of the most printed films of the year, and probably the worst movie in Tarantino." "The only good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz." <br /> <br /> "So I was really frustrated, and this film is always looking at # 40 of the greatest film of all time, something about this, which gives me the release of my face." Now read and read "Hate" reviews for more details. . <br /> <br /> I hate about a movie, when it seems to be a bunch of people with ignorance. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know that the style of Tantinno is based on imagination and fantasy plots, but at the same time Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers will appear in the presence of the movie premiere in France and there are two guards in your entire theater and the neighborhood. Where American-African also walks freely with locking doors and also setting fireworks place doors. These 2 defendants are then executed at the empty time with almost 100 rounds of Hitler's assassination in a few seconds of opening the door for our 2 "heroes" ... too stupid. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smart plot to kill the most dangerous militants of all time (see Walk My Wife). Apart from this, the British General's Mike Mayer is more realistic and real true realistic pictures than Hitler. <br /> <br /> How it gets destroyed, it is the only smart and strong character that has duplicated each and every movie, with its psychological and mind-faced interrogation, eventually being deceived by the most stupid character in the film. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, I was sympathetic to the Nazis, who were portrayed more courage and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine that <br /> <br /> If you have my uncertainties, 2 hours 33 minutes of waste or you want to break your mind, check out this movie.
