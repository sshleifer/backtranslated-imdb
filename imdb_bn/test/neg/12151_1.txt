First of all, if I wanted to use my imagination in this movie or tried to save money or less in the budget, then I was the first to sit down! Here we go ... <br /> <br /> There were many years and spaces there, which I did not understand, like the movie it was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 years and so many gaps you ask questions This happened? And why? I think this is a big stream. Forget about reviews that are shiny about history, this movie is not just a history problem, but it has many errors in it. So most people keep watching such movies, you will lose all the cinematography of river, desert etc. It is true that they are waiting for Blu-ray to release 1080p. OK! Nice view but what is that point? I closed the movie after 1 hour and half, I just lost interest. The film has been running the same thing for several years (at least for example, for example, for example, after two years after 10 years!) I mean I can not see the movie, I understand what is happening! Anyway I wish I could include spoilers but when you decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how this happened? You know what I mean! Do not waste time on this movie.
