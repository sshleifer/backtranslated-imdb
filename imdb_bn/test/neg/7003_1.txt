It's hard to believe the movie may be bad, but you live and learn. The more amazing thing is that those who kept this thing together were college education systems. Meanwhile, some of the fruits of their labor could come up with a group of eighteen graders to look at some of the bares. On the bright side, if there are some nice moments in the soundtrack, that asks a question about how the rest of the film might be so bad.
