If you've seen this movie, you know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who knows that they will copy Terminator 2? The difference between the film industry is that Hollywood spends millions and spending 100 thousand (average) on Bollywood. If you want to make a T2-style movie then this is the problem of the movie, then do it correctly. The director added a fiction story about a resurrected snake, who found his long lost daughter (in the previous birth) two people's death, but the blame goes to 10 people. He suddenly reincarnates in a ghost and together they want to kill 10 people responsible for his death. Not to mention, there is some power of reincarnation snake or villain. He can convert some, he can fly, invisible, fire power, wind energy, you name it, he has it. She gets even bazookered and survived T1000 style. You are probably surprised how he survived. Do not be good at asking, and do not waste the best time and money in this movie. Just forget this movie even out of its best. I am ashamed to use a big star in a vague story for this disrespectful movie.
