The most obvious error ... awesome, awesome scripts. This movie was a good story, but it was a bad conversation, continuity problem, which was never explained, plots were deposited, sub-plots that have not gone anywhere, and were simply destroyed with stupidity. Sandra Lock is not referred to the awful, cliched instruction. Even two great performances can not save this movie. So Devon Gamersal and Rosanna Arquette could not give terrible performance. The matter is, they are better actors than the film. Arctets are the best, Rosanna Arquette (Silverlight, hours and hours, obviously to find Susan), there are some fine moments - like a great scene at the beginning when he closes his handcuffs - but gives its overall performance weakly. And Deven Gamersal (Dick, Trumpet Fading, and Bright My so-called Life) is very bad, acting with no determination or emotion. But the actors will not be blamed, those who played other roles. The script does not help horrible, and bad aspects. One benefit to me ... to avoid this movie.
