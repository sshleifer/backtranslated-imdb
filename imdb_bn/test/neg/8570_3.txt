The title just describes it. The film's dribble was 'no more than killing someone in the accident of youth-youth-youth-youths that after 20 years some of them have been killed / killed' for several decades they have cut our throats. The only twist was an angry former classmate or lovable psycho / corrupted instead, it was a noisy. Nun wants to remove the sins from girls, Bla Bla, girls accidentally sinking a nun, incidentally, blah blah, hunt for young girls, people die, cinema ends. The only thing to create this watch was the death scene, which was quite quiet (especially by breaking the Fat Lady's arms through the elevator door) but even they could not make a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head to attach himself to this denial. I'm sure I hired it and bought it, or would I be very angry out of trust. If you want to feel the nudge of a nunsploitation, watch Damonia or something to go. Stay away from this garbage.
