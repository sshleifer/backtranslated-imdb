I agree with what many have said about shallow and objectionable nature of the film's test of racism. It is boring to me that many people seem to be fooled by its unrighteousness. I would like to comment on Matt Dillon's character as one of the most worrying examples of this movie. Here we have a man - in contrast to the underlying message of this movie that "we are all small racists" - effectively rapes a woman, harms her husband brutally and deliberately removes her, knowing that she will run well, be arrested or even die. He did this because after the couple was released for any legal reason, we realized that they are black and rich and he is a harmless little boy who is now the police and can do whatever he wants. This behavior is not a small racist. This behavior is evil It is boring to me that the character of this racism is kept next to the behavior of another character - its paranoid stereotypes against gang violence - each of which is a tiny racist. Afterwards we were dillon's poor old dad and black people taking a little bit of a pinch about taking him to a poor house. This supposed to be supposed, or worse, excuse this behavior? And what is the meaning of Dillon's character to completely free herself from being completely disrespectful and incredible, ridiculous and ridiculous to save the victims of sexual abuse at night? Please Many people seem to be congratulating themselves for this movie, I am sorry about our understanding of racism and the lack of condemnation and ending commitments.
