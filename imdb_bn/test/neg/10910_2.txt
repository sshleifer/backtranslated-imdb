Some filmmakers can not make mistakes in the eyes of national filmmakers, it's a reason you never have to pay attention to them. This image is a perfect example. Critics like Director Eric Rohar <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teen ("Polin"), and she is taking care of the summer and there are some relations with her. Talk it, talk, talk and more talk. <br /> <br /> There are some fast nude shots and some swearing words for those who are looking at the cover and are expected to headline, otherwise it is a humble French ethical game. A friend of mine gave me this tape loan. She got some sexy French film, and was frustrated. It was very annoying because I was just so frustrated. <br /> <br /> How such a great review is almost impossible.
