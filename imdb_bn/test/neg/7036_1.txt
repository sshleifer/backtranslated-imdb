One of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely funny (though not objective). Each scene has something with that; Air, romance, scripts, or acting have become worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture for these pilots, it is very bad that you will burst into laughter at any time of the film (See also airport 79: Concord, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like a plug-in (of course, without fans of B-movie) <br /> <br />
