From all the rave reviews, we could not wait to see this show. We especially love ruthless humor and creative elements in Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge it can not be a fair review, because we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we could not bear even more trouble - it was certainly the most annoying and painful 15 minutes that we had ever experienced watching TV shows - it was felt like 15 hours. The song itself may be interesting (short), but inserting it for exactly 3 minutes in the middle of a story scene does not work well. <br /> <br /> We are now working hard to remove memory. If you want some wonderful down to a delightful and compelling film, then instead see "Dish".
