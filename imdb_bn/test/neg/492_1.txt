Well ........ how and where do I start to describe this stupidity? Imagine the Hollywood Morality of a Chess, the most trite soap opera story, throw a hug, and some 'contemporary' try to imitate the kids by thinking it's cool by the dress. This image is not all packages and absolutely no substance. <br /> <br /> It starts with commitment ...... Youngsters dream of becoming a rockstar and everyone can laugh when there is too much dream of being involved in heroic worship. Then, it goes all down ..... faster than a bobsleigh with no brakes. The scene involving Giga with steel dragon has long been seen as the most kind piece of 'Cine Kitts'. The singer appeared on the stage for his debut and fell down some stairs .... He would rise and sing the song ... ... or would he stay there and do not sing ...... Who is now care ?? It gets worse, but I do not want to fool myself by remembering all its stimulus details. If you see it after this review, it's your own fault!
