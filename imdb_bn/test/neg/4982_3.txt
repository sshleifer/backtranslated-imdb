Good things from the road first: <br /> <br /> The voice of the underdog was just fine. But Jason Lee seems to be pretty extraordinary, that's not really any surprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Deinlaz (Barrancer) and he was all trash. He played the part shockingly well. And so Patrick Warburton, Moroccan assistant. Now, it was a stupid character but he played very well, I actually liked the character better than the character. The line given to him was pillow but malicious. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger did terrible and hope he does not work again. His "Scrum" was so nastyly fake. Silence Silence "Aaahhhhhhh". The scene where he heard of the dog, "Oh no, impossible!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the first meaning, he is a "reporter." A school reporter but still regardless of a questioning mind. But why, why did he surround his dog? That was worthless and the enemy dog ​​did not even say anything other than an innocent "Oh, wrong!" His presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was unfortunate. The only reason I give this movie a 3, barricinters, its cooperation, and the voice of the underdog.
