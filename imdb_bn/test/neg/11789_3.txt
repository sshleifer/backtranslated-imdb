I really wanted to like this movie. Great Cast ?? One role reminds us of his iconic that Walter Pidgeon "banned Planet," such as a young man, such as Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling, a sailor on a submarine even Peter Lorre (as a musical, as a musical, gambling crew, in Avalon, in Avalon Is there?) With a love for shark. Maybe it was a good Kiddie movie but I had trouble having trouble. Lorre was severely underused. I think he was red like a pydan ?? You probably go to him the nut and try to throw in the hero or his girl shark tanks. There is no such luck. However, why is there a shark tank in a submarine? This is the lack of lack of films. They explain why sharks are running behind Lorre (because we see this) but we should expect that there is no way to shark. "Research?" Yes, scientists are always doing experimental work, who can understand them? Of course, if there is no shark, then who would kill the evil psychologist Woman (Joan Fontenay)? I'm sorry but even the child's film in the 50s is less fanciful and frankly fooling (not to mention the exploitation). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes really got my hope. Music by the Great theme song Frankie Avalon. Paidon Floyd Hairdresser (Howard McNear, in fact, loves "blue Hawaii" before sorry Howie) and in front of the prominent guided tour of Fontaine in Guyana, avoid the room with a huge "alert" sign on the door, with the sharks above just above Peter Lorre, and then We saw Edon's whole screen shot and pushed his meaning to the Avalon's emotional horn game! The movie is quickly flowing downwards. There is no real interpretation of the threat of threatening the earth, so there is no drama for dramatic tension and boots. Instead of making Pidgeon character Ahab different in the red herring (I suppose "Caine Rebellion" was still fresh in the minds of the people) was made in red herring, and Fontaine's character suddenly turned to evil for no reason. Oh, I think it's a surprise because of the audience. And it's astonishing, since the only negative thing that he did was to talk bad about the captain's mental health and that's because he has no reason to make a bomb after being published as a villain. Very weak work and unconvincing Was the guy in the dull Bible nuts good ?? At least made in the sense of his character. <br /> <br /> What could be wrong? Constant, intermediate scuba-diving footage. I do not understand that kind of appeal. A giant squid attacks the ship for one minute, so there is a giant for the theater trailer. Maybe some people have fooled that it is going to be a fantasy adventure film, rather than half a baked suspense movie about military scientists, which is never wrong. Yes ?? Probably the worst, it's just a science fiction film much less than a fabulous movie. It has never done anything to my imagination because the whole courtyard was nothing but a catastrophe, and these characters never felt any feeling of surprise or discovery. I'm with Irwin Allen. However, I do not like his next movies, but this got me pretending to be Jules Verne when it really was another source of accidental symptoms. The whole movie just waits for a waiting sheet and waits to see it die. In order to perform these roles, he always employs an actor / actress with an impressive and personalized screen personality, and since these characters do not have any logic, this is the only "wonderful" only material available. This is a kind of waste time for actors. George Pal's film is 100 times better (the only one that was lame "Atlantis," which was not coincidentally the most Allen-Esquire), full of wonder and excitement ?? Think it! ?? Ideas! Some effects scenes and Barbara Eden are nothing else, my opinion is worth seeing here. I think it's good fun for disaster films, but I think they're a cool and humble section of movies.
