This is Eric Roberts "Big" in Tommy Lee Thomas's first prison film. He plays a corrupt ring leader of the guards. Although most people are evil by the standards, their character is like a man who is nice enough to give you therapeutic support, when you are tortured with "Lethal Wipen" Electric Productions. The film has a complex plot about prison corruption, which gives absolutely no idea. The eyes of Thomas Clint Eastwood's squireer, the dolph Lundgren's one-liner, JCVD's acting ability and the stereo graduation in school after Schneider took the body of his youngest body. <br /> <br /> Martin's "Cobra Kai" shares the following point with Roberts in the career of Cove, whether it is called to be drunk for the whole film in the film, or if the cow has come right on the way, it is difficult to know. <br/> Thankfully, I could not blame him for engaging everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun if you have a good job.
