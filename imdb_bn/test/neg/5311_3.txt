The first 10 minutes of cinematic and pg-13 movies make fun of the movie. This is due to 2 reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo", which is a short film-in-a-movie version. Each time they do it, you will be really angry. The Travolta is not very cool, Keitel is not. However, Rock and Vince Vaughn are delightful. It's not funny that they can see Elmore Leonard's film. If you do not meet to get short, you probably want to be calm. If you prefer to get the law, you will leave the theater to kill the director and painting. Wait for the DVD.
