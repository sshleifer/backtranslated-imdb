Loneme Jim is a romantic dark comedy about an unsuccessful family, whose two sons are the total victims. About 30 year old boys live in the house, there is nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and I can not name such a family. I like to pick it up because I like the humor acting Buscemi. Now I understand that I need to be with that comedic agent to do its job. Acting and working on the camera and editing was fine. The first 15 minutes you got set up, and the last 15 minutes prevented the film from being completely frustrating for the trash type of the Jerry Springer trailer. The female members of my family were begging me to stop it, but I won at the end that there was a turning point at the end, and we saw the whole movie. The expected male family members left after the first 30 minutes.
