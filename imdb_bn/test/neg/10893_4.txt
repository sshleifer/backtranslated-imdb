A young couple decided to flee to California in sunshine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When she is ready to leave, His only abandoned camp van with his company stuck in the streets behind Texas. <br /> <br /> Rest stop is one of the cheap and drawn horror movies that can be a classic classic. Can Stop Rest Stop a Classmaker Classic? Good three ingredients that you need to become a classical classic require cow, gender and artistic competence. The rest stop has loads of bulls, and when I do not want to give it too much, then it remains in the body of dying in blood. This movie has its car from bad guys, which uses pneumatic drill on her feet several times with her car. Sometimes, it can be bloody as it can get a film. It's an unwanted and yet some intimate love scene in the whole minute. Therefore, sex is covered. Now the hard one ?? Is it any artistic talent? Do not you see the look of the bad guy ?? You see glimpses, profiles, galaxy silhouettes. He scored a faceless, timeless, giant, single score on artistic intellectual scale alone. The movie has fewer characters than the main hero ?? Nicole Carro (Jaimi Alexander) Since he spends a large part of his own picture, he can not express his thoughts during conversation, but they must speak so that the audience can understand what he thinks. At times, this can be a little irritating; However, this writer (John Shi'ban) is a bold step and it works for most movies. An audience knows that being totally lonely and disassociating from civilization is not enough to chase you by psychological killers but is terrible enough. <br /> <br /> So, the rest stop will become a classic classic? While it is probably running from an assassin's killer that does not necessarily have to be of great value to the main character because it probably screams lots of cold, attractive and inventive plot and screen as well as lots of cool, gender and controversial artistic merit as well. (If you can complain about the stupidity of the hunter, the horror movie is fun?)
