I'm not saying that they can not see this movie again if they give solid gold popcorn and tickets give me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can not give it a genuine honest rating because there are no negative stars. Acting is absolutely terrible. This movie is a quarrel based on the classic, "the most dangerous game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gogli. At least Joe provides some advanced scenery, and Ben should calm down to see this. I'm not sorry for the 7 dollars I paid for this move, I want 90 minutes before my life. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time ?!" Samuel L. Jackson, change the lane
