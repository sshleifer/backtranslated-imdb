The opening scene makes you feel like playing high school. But I saw high school drama with good acting! Every line was so clearly distributed that I felt that instead of seeing the characters I saw actors acting. I found the development of character poor and played very obediently! I did not get 25 minutes in the movie, the plot was more visible and I was bored because I did not take care anymore. I was hanging there, waiting to free the film, but it never happened. The sister Theresa was very sweet, even for a nun, still passionate and a little manipulative appearance. Above all, I was disappointed.
