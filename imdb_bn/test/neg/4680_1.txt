I've recently been a huge fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he is one of the most interesting original comedians along with age. He is refreshed and refined in his routines, which debates how many things Bush has with the shameless exploitation of producer Robert Evans of 1970. I am Mariah Bamford's longtime fan and his wide eye is innocent / schizophrenic routine. Whenever he gets tired and throat, he naturally switches high-voice voices but I can not help. I love Brian Porsche long ago, even he knew that he was in "Just Shut Me" and that's so funny about his oldest personality. These three genius, unique comedy titles "Comedy of Comedy", a netflix documentary on their visit to the US They really deserve to be they, and this tour gives them so much valuable recognition. I thought, no, I know I want this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of each of its comic's own routine segments, "Comedy Comedy" has diminished in the mad and lazy documentary scene, which is nothing but humor, insight and genuine interest. I think the 109 minute movie has a 30-minute interstitial stand-up routine. What a rip off! Come on, is anyone really interested in watching our stars fool our RV? Where is an arcade and humor to see Posehn in a comic book store? Does anyone find Random Dinner scenes especially laughable? If this movie is not seen by our comics strips their stuff, at least it can create what is like life on the street. It's not even about that Worst of all, comics do not seem to be real fun. Oswald acknowledged how tired he was in a radio interview, Pausen admitted to how much he had been sucked during his travels, and when Bamford looked at him in the camera, he is always progressing nervously, and his humor is only rhythmic. <Br> <br /> Sheesh, these guys are a refreshing change of pace from the intriguing entertainment of mainstream comics like Dan Cook, who have the opportunity to showcase their unusual, surprisingly diverse comedies. Instead, one of our films will have to sit through a routine public routine on a low-end Borough street, which can be easily passed by a student film. If you can identify Osvald, Poecien or Booster performance in DVD by any means, by all means. It should be a pleasure to see their talents, not a hiatus like here.
