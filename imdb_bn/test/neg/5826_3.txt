The first thing I should know is that I loved Winnie the Pooh as a child and I really enjoyed Tegar's movie at the age of 20. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that I was ashamed <br /> <br /> Well, I know it's a movie for kids and people like me can not be noticed but for other people My thoughts about cinema Age <br /> <br /> The original fall of this movie is Hafalam itself, it will be the most annoying character seen in a child's movie (perhaps more annoying than the children of Monsters Inc's). It is the most annoying voices and fools, and more stupid comments from the proponents, I know that even though the PuHh movies are not too high, it was 2 years old even insane! <br /> <br /> Where was the second story? There was at least one point in the story of previous PooAutting - yes I can see that it was in your heart that you had to accept different people - but it was actually over and I think I saw kids 5-minute cartoons on TV. <<br /> <br /> I am not my own child, but whenever I want to show them suitable children's films such as Tega Movie, Tao Story and Finding Nemo (although they are very young for me, I can see how they can make small children Will make a big appeal). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There must be its own movie!
