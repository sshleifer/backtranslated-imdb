... if you've been so much sunny for a long time, and have to take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 responsive reviews of this event, I decided to launch it and test it out for me. Everyone who said about this show said that everything is absolutely true. Mensia's mind is like half-hour version of Mad TV, but in some way bad joke. <br /> <br /> One of the disadvantages to look at was the "Second Annual Stereoop Olympics". What's interesting about Black People, who is swimming, or is the name of the girl "Sparkles" which played a banana? Which of these ideas is especially novel, insightful, or funny? Do we really need a joke about every episode Star Wars? That movie came like 30 years ago. The funny thing about Messius tossed some stereotypes about Halopics and threw some "wines" in there; And let him go around the money pills and go home. Pure comedic genius However, I saw Jeff Foxworthy, the second time, "if you gay ..." bits. You can only imagine the proud smile that he got during graduation in ryan-sycrest-e-gay mix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p>
