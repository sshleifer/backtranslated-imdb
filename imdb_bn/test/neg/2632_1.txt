This movie is very sad, I could not see it at all. Millo's voice was very low and I did not understand what he said, as well as some central lines. Also, where did he get all these wedding dresses; It was very unreal. Milo drowning and how are people John The film failed due to Jeter and her habit of laughing. Overall, I was disappointed that I was unable to give a zero rating for this film because it classified this movie as one, I felt that I would unduly appreciate it.
