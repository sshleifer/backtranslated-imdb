Yesterday I saw this movie in Midnight Snake Preview screening (I work for an independent theater chain in Colorado - it's a pleasure) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the best movies I ever saw! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fantasy people who (Stare War Mother Dr Hardes) will string you from the nearest tree, if you say any of their favorite cinematic icons ill ... However, Campbell-tiers work from China, celluloid blackhole. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Think again - I'm a huge fan of B-movies, and especially Bruce Campbell. Her trademark character is my favorite dude, and her biography of Elvis at the Bubba Ho-Tape was amazing. <br /> <br /> But O, B-movies are still likely to repeat, and we all love the "good" camps) ... and this was the same as myself and my colleagues. Without the tracking shot where the Bruce goes through the square and scared the kids, there was no smile. Overall, we found the story of the so-called humor figs like mind-stacked Stupid, like Pacing Molasses and Hammer's bags. (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's "Pavel" was not a comic relief ...) She believed, we all want to love it, but incredibly frustrated both of them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, you want to watch it once, get married and want to do with children etc. It is fantastic - we like everything we like. , So you can get any judgment from me. But Campbell's latest cinematic do not ask the ideas of humor or fan loyalty to those who do not have multiple orgasms. My modest opinion of this glimpse was a steaming drilling sandwich ... and as a true Campbell fan, I was allowed to say it!
