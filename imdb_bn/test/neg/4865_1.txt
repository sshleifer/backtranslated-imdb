I wonder why I still sit through this whole thing. It was only about 3 minutes of actual entertainment, the rest were only a total bore. It's not that great and the action scene is soooo cheesy it's not even fun. I hope I can say something good about this movie but now I can not remember anything. There was probably something that could have some enjoyment but it should be the greatest concept of all time. What kind of people are supposed to get a remote controlled helicopter by burning machine guns to kill the President? This idea was never possible in the first place that anyone is stupid enough to try it, I think the author is obsessed with the carriage of car toys at the Dead Pool, but actually tried to make this appearance serious.
