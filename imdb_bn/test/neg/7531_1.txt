We saw the movie in Lawrence, Kansas Premier. The killing of competition for the queen of this controversial story about a group of disrespected high school teachers was just awful. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad scripts, no obvious point. But mainly it seems that the filmmakers themselves said - "Hey, I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - Really it is without thinking. Unfortunately most of the indie films do not enjoy the mentality. They just can not understand that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or even an observer in this case. I am not ashamed of this picture that if I did not know some crew, I went out. That's as simple as that
