How did Billy Crystal Melanes correctly describe in the "My Giant" that the film was named as "Ishtaar" in his career, his name was Warren BTi - it was not destroyed, but it has diminished ..... .. Crystal will know about three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) Do not play against a child 2) Do not play any animal opposite. 3) Do not play against a person about 3 feet taller than you, it is innocent as a child and "work" an animal < br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but Crystal is not out of his own scene and I do not have the Sheikh (his role-in-the-movie) except for the previous wife or the giant of earlier mentioned giant. Did I mention a baby in this picture? Well, forget him. The boy has come to remind us of the crystal, and we do, but the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny person. If you do not trust me, then look at the old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live" "City Slicker" or "Running Dredge" or "When Harry Matt Sally." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more threatening than Fi-Fi-Foom. <br /> <br />
