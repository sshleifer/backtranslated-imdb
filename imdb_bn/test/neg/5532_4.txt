This is a very interesting introduction! There are three stupid and childhood episodes - "The Two-Tough Stories" - the article is not really horrific or action, but there is more to it. Where is suspense? Where's the fun? Where is the common sense? Of course not here but if you do not expect to get it, you will not miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "showdown". It's a violent, weird Western. I failed to understand the whole concept of it. "King of the Road" starring Brad Pitt is a stupid story. At the time of "two difficult stories" he was just a nice face who did not know how to really work. Fortunately, he learned skills and now he is an excellent, talented actor - one of the young generation. The story's all its stupidity is almost okay. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost completely successful. It's stupid but fun. We need to thank Kirk Douglas for this. <br /> <br /> When you sit in a simple chair and eat popcorn, you have to see something. (I should know, what I did) If you like the "Tales of the Crypt", you would prefer "two-minded story" because it's basically the same. I understand that these three episodes are actually very rare "art pieces" and are very difficult to find anywhere. I have a full package of VHS but I do not think it's a big advantage. You will be a fanatic Brad Pitt fan to find out. Do not disturb otherwise, it is not worth the effort. Stupid shit
