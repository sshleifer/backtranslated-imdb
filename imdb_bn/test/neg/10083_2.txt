I want to comment on how girls are selected. Why are they always black women selected then their black women are. Each episode is still more white than white women. White women say black women are good. I would like to see more black women then white once. And it's not just your show that is always white in many shows. But as you have since you titled this event you will see this as yourself and have more black women in your show as I thought. But like you're just trying to work just like you're so fair and beautiful. You're just a big dirty hypocrite
