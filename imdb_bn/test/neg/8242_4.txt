I always like carrier-on-movies, with their dual futile sex conversations and slapstick comedy moment, but I can see why the critics gave these two stars. Basically, many British people combine trainers to attend a Spanish holiday on an island named Elsabel in the Palace Hotel. They do not know what they are not completely made, plus they have to share the bathroom with their neighbors, they have drunk drop and the owner's drink (Peter Butterworth, very funny, for example, sounds sound bad sound). Sid James as Jim Floyd, Kenneth Williams Stuart Faruquer, Charles Haworth Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims Kora Flange, Barbara Windsor, Sadie Tominson, Kenneth Connor, Stanley Blunt, apparently shit (I personally can not remember who?) Jim Logan, like Bart Conwy, Whitfield at Evelyn Blant's June, Hello Jacks Flora (a ridiculous Hagga character, his usual matte Not as memorable), Bernard Breslah, brother Bernard, Sally Geson as Lily, Carroll Hawkins as Merge, Jack Douglas, Miss Dubbs as Harry and Patisser Roland's. I do not acknowledge it's great, but have enough dialogue gags, and of course in the baby shower, and that's going to leave her with the thrifty stairs, and after her bra quickly rip off. OK!
