After watching this movie on TV, I saw it on IMDB and I was surprised to be 7.6 user rating! This is not a good film. Especially bad edit is; The story goes from point to point in the poor and a huge demonstration. It is not done very slowly. I agree that the acting was fairly modest, especially Kelly Capozski, and the story was quite stimulating.
