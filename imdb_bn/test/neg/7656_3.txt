This image is not a little bad. It's not even bad kind of. It's horrible When Charo shows up in a movie, you are in trouble. She was off the week "love boat." George Kennedy, at least he is a gamer - he's trying to be there. Actually, he's okay. And it was nice to see Martha Roy. The hostage walker is okay. There is a slightly better performance compared to the airport, 75 but the airport does not perform better than '75? What I liked about this image is that it is more than plots-intelligent than many other disaster movies. At least they made an effort to subplots. What really hurt this picture is the special effect - Uh! Not very special if you ask me This is a kind of movie that is really fun at 2am, if you have fun with your friends and you are looking for something to laugh.
