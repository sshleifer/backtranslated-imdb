Interesting husband and wife writer team Robert Wagner (Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) actress "Lorana Love" (actually the silent film star Harold Lloyd's house) reached the wonderful palace. Mr. Wagner and Miss Jackson signed contract to write a silent film star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project because his father was a famous star lover. Mysterious incidents have been uncovered, and Jackson must fight to protect her husband from the beautiful blonde soul, who is "completely preserved" in the property's crypt. Nevertheless, the evil woman is disturbed about her husband's assassination and the murder of Jackson! <br /> <br /> It has distinguished many "Night of Dark Shadow", with true "dark shadow" former student Kate Jackson, who knows and plays his part well. Robert Wagner lacks the severity of David Shelby. Sylvia Sydney (Mrs. Josephs) sidesteped Graceon Hall Mariana Hill is not a match for Lara Parker (or Diana Miller). Bill Messi (Oscar Pine) is good in a part that John Karlen (played by Dan Curtis Productions). <br /> <br /> June Blundell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lama. Miss Lemo's delivery is similar to that of Jon Bennett, who asks: Why did the producer Haroon Spelling not come to the original "Dark Shadow" regularly? <br /> <br /> Director EW Sawakamara was Bridgette Hanley's husband; He worked with Mrs. Blondel on "Harme's The Bride" and Jackson "The Rookies". "Death at Love House", rational, is a difficult story compared to the film "Dark Shadows of Night". This movie is different from Star Angle. And, at the end of his "Father's Eternal Fire", it is closely related to the story of TVR's "Laura the Phoenix". <br /> <br /> Death in love in the house (9/3/76) EW Sakhammer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Silvia Sydney
