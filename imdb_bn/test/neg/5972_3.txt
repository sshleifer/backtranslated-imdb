This documentary was boring, and was quite stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... Documentary builders probably do not know how Darwin's evolution works? This is a theory, and the name is just plain fool. Reading a college biology textbook is what the documentary could really be called a documentary creator. Darwinism is a good theory, but if it is done in politics it is evil. <br /> <br /> Also in this documentary some people interviewed ... no expert certifications and shadowed leads ... <<br /> <br /> The documentary was also boring. I mean that it can be edited for up to 35 minutes, and then it may be better. <br /> <br /> There is a lot better documentary ... it was not valuable to see ... you can do your money and time to get good information from Wikipedia = D!
