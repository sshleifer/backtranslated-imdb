Somehow, I really thought I was going to enjoy this movie because I liked the photos with a great mystery of mountain climbing and plot. I certainly captured photography on my attention that photography was fantastic and had some scary scenes. I thought Nicole Egert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, Good Night", '01 played a very strong role as a young girl who had a sad loss in her life and met some characters who wanted to guide her on the mountain. Mark Singer, "Angel Blade", "20", played a very strange stranger and acted in many scenes that played with bad scenes. This movie was not a big disappointment and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on TV !!
