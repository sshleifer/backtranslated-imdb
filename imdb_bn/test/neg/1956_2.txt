Outside the Jack Frost 2 question, I am really surprised that people are allowed to create such films. <br /> <br /> Sam and his wife are going to Tropicana for Christmas to glide, Jack will return to the fun and take revenge of the inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Do not swipe into this movie, most people find it Laughs with your friends, but it is naturally a waste If the person who produces this film can get the job done by their work, at least one good story, especially the name of the character of sugar can be tried and tried.
