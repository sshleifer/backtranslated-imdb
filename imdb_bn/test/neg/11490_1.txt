I saw the original version and did not hear it. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but now I'm learning. <br /> <br /> I do not like Russia, Bulgaria, United States. <br /> <br /> What I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> All Russians talk to Russian accent in German synchronization in the whole picture. Speak Americans "Hochdeutsch" (without pronunciation)! I have never heard so stupid! As well as it's annoying. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is good. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of James Bond.
