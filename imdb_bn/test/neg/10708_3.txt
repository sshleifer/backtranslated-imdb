This movie is horrific beyond belief. This is a low budget, badly written, unmatched garbage piece. But the way I ran on TV in front of the television on Saturday, it still takes my mind. The epic of this film epic - perhaps Ed Wood is not epic, but close. The court is violent (men are very dangerous and imprisoned for imprisonment - football stadiums), pseudo-deck culture is ridiculously intertwined (there is an underground sex troupe with women who make garments to serve men "Davins") and the title "last person" Rocky Rocky is a cruel rebirth from the Harr picture show. I could not finish what I wanted to guess. "What have we learned from this?" Lum said, "What did we learn from this?" Nansense would like to brush his teeth, but everything in the first two-thirds was very memorable, even if the last third became an empty emblem of rest, Perfect for campi, stupid, intelligent science-fe B-flicks.
