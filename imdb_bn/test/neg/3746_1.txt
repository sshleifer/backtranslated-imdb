After 30 minutes I went out of the movie to suffocate this movie. <br /> <br /> As soon as the surplus sequence of the movie is closed, I think there was something wrong and I did not stop it long ago. Embarrassing myself from hiding under my seat. I'm not the only one to go out of movies, although they usually get some release features, but it is a bad guide, bad luck (bar 'Bruno' character and unsupported Jean Rochford - telling to my friends) from a list of victims. , Scary editing (in terms of theme and money), terrible soundtracks and image correlations that leave the art of wrong protection on images and scenes in the wrong time. The worst offense is its overall ambiguity and unbelief (the consequences of previous persecution). Why was so awful? I do not want to waste more of my time explaining. I would say to myself and see it for myself but I do not want to give more than the excavation of this project. Oh, there was a redemption feature in the screening: My friend was camping in the rows of Silhouette seats with his umbrella and holding his hand with his umbrella - more than 125 minutes more than a road, excitement and entertainment This sad terrible effort.
