When I started to see it, I quickly noticed that I did not understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume With booming with background noise now, I could hear the voice Just what the actor is saying? Does not the movie dabbed? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realized that it was English. At least, I think so ... Amazing Jess Franco has set a microphone far away from the actor. As a result, we are not fully able to hear what we are saying. He did this before. But what could be the intention of Mr. Franco? By knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mysteries about what is happening and with more visual sources ... maybe this is mine, but I wanted to know what's going on! How many hints? The main foundation (I deny it a "plot") expresses concern about a young American foreign dancer Palla (played by Amber Newman), who has a boyfriend, who invited him to a small island owned by some small wealthy people. It's off somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this tour, Paula is promised a great cash, which is a boyfriend. Then he fled to the island, only after returning. Why? Where the boyfriend walks open the US passport to pay attention to the scene. Although his hand tried to cover it, you can see the real name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed in the picture below the passport !! However, the "story" back: Some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, with all the suspicious purpose. We witness sadistic games (they are real or fake?) And unappealing dining scenes. But the food would be good, such a terrible French chef prepared it! A young servant who walks around and never speaks. Is he really silent? And do we care? Of course all the women are mostly naked in this photo ... Well, we can at least be grateful that (50+ overweight) men are wearing clothes! Along with the unrealistic quality of sound, I am always surprised by the fact that the great nudity of the audience to completely close viewers is his amazing skill in the movie. Any exceptions to this picture ?? I need fresh air after watching it! At the conclusion: Despite the fact that Mr. Franco could dream, I was happy to report, I am still attracted to women.
