Wow ... <br /> <br /> By reading these comments, I've been inventing an extraordinary socio-cultural conflict that is in America and ... Dutch! US Pov Looks like this is a very good little movie, Parker is a favorite hero, the story is a glorious presentation that can be a real glory. <br /> <br /> Three Dutch critics watched the world. Think of it through a completely different pair of glasses. They explicitly and surprisingly agree on the same condition with a disaster. <br /> <br /> Stay away from what seems to be a debate in the culture, this item separates them geographically, like the ocean. Still, based on actual observation - I saw this movie with my own eyes - I suspect that the Dutch are not very close to the mark: <br /> <br /> "Why Parker" is weak, completely annoying and does not really cost celluloid, which Creation is ruined.
