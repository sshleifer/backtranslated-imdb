The film beats me as how to describe this teenage exercise as Noah The fact is that guns and a bottle and a dome and lead a private eye, but it does not make the style, which makes people. Repeat this TV show show show stuff - a lot of bloody deadly and shy continuous - with a dash of Chinatown memories. It's hard to see for the first 10 minutes. If you want to feel contemporary, see something by John Dahl.
