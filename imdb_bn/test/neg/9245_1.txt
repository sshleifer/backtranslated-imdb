Why would someone make a film like this? Why would anyone invest in a movie? Why would this film work as someone in the film business? Why would a theater show a film like this? Why would such a TV channel be a movie? Any critic would be bothered to review such a film? Why would anyone see a film like this? Why will not a psychologist such a writer / producer / director of photo be examined? Sometimes there are movies that they are very bad. It is a movie which is so terrible that it is terrible. IMDB must really be an "0" or even a minus scale institute to embrace this unexpected pretentious horror work.
