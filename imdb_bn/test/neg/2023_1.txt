If you want to make a vampire movie in space, it seems, "Well, maybe it would be nice, but at least it will be interesting to see something different in the whole genre." Oops. I do not care what kind of movies you have; Even if you are the world's biggest vampire, horror, thriller, or suspense fan, even if you do not ever see a horror movie, and your first one is expected to be impressive by any means ... then you're wrong. I do not think I have ever seen this school "Made for TV movie" or later. I have not seen this TV a pilot show bad. I have not seen footage of sleeping or sleeping animals as bad as this. To this end, the single largest waste of hours you may otherwise consider the importance of the dish and their effect on your life. I used to stay in the bathroom for weeks in a week, but seeing my own urine and abstraction and a clip of this movie. Looking forward to seeing this, I wish that instead of changing the characters, I fell apart instead of paying to see it. It was like the ruins of the train: so bad you could not only help but hopefully something good can happen. It's not For love of God, if you or your friends - even using illegal substances while doing it - even consider seeing this movie, instead of choosing a competitor to see who can see more shoots in a snoot-rocket. This will give you much more enjoyment and relaxation.
