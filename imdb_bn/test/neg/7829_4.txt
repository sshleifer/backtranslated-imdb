Olivia Assayas movie stars associated with Asia's Argentine women as Michael Maden. Madison is a businessman who is in financial problems. In frustration, he is going to sell his part from a company called Golden Eagle, a longtime company. When Argentina moved away from her company, Agence Agento returned to her life. This pair was an intense love affair, in which he was included in the business of Madsen (business Golden Eagle). Once Argentina enters the film, the next picture follows him, as we have seen the cool web engaging and how the complexities go out of hazardous and violent control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. Actually I was quite annoyed because the film seems to be posting from the pillar to the first hour, which I wondered was what the point was more than giving the fleshy role of Argentina. Director Dario Argentino's daughter and a director on her own right, a unique actress in Argentina Occasionally well nicely, he is not going to give you more often illustrating a damaged person to beat off an abstract Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. I do not think it works entirely here because the script is too "complicated" to support it. Did I not think that her wounded girl surrounded me with a wrong way (she thought she was more shrewd than anything else). I am not blaming the actor but the author / director Asayas, who once again made a complex story, likes to deal with the actors, but the audience pushes their heads because they do not really work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
