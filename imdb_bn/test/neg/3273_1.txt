This is really the worst movie I ever seen. For a while, I made the habit of watching violent movies with "Battalfield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starships". These films are cinematic gems than Sindhhurat. <br /> <br /> There are not many points in this section of junk; I think it is more beneficial to minimize my response to the film, which is as follows: I have become very angry and I want to tap the tape from VCR and want to burn it after playing about 80 minutes. <br /> <I rated this movie 0, but IMDB does not rate a movie less than 1. I can fully tell it 0 that I say above any movie that has a score above 0 that is infinitely (indefinite) than that - it's really bad.
