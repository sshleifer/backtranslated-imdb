This movie is extremely impossible. <br /> <br /> I said that most of the characters were plastic, but they did not even afford their little luxury. They just work like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to get real surfers for their surfing competition roles, so this is a bad drawing they can work on. At least Occy did not give a shit and just went with it. But "lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit <br /> <br /> The true character was portrayed by Gary Lopez, who did not actually act, she was also quite beautiful. He is quite accustomed to stomping people. :-) I gave 2 reasons for this movie instead of 1 because it was a newsletter on my laptop when one of the cable channels came in one night. That saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster. There is no way I would go my way to visit it.
