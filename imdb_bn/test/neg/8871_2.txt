Tu pa tam one of the worst movies I've ever seen. On the other hand, most of the movies from Slovenia are good, without a brilliant idea of ​​depressing characters and stories. Tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. Many interview director Mirza Okorn tried to tell us that her movie was of high quality because she did not spend a lot of money. But thinking that way is wrong. You are a very bad movie for me. The dialogues are really poorly written (90% of the scripts involved in crossings), characters Stereotypical Mornings, Stories and its Twists are very predictable and action sequences (this movie is considered as Action Comedy) are very poorly decorated and without any style. Okorn is thinking that he is bigger than Quantin Tarantino, so he's copying his style within 90 minutes. Movie humor is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably think that constant damn funny). In my opinion Tu Pa tam is very cheap (not by budget) movies with stupid stories and very bad acting.
