... but this is not the one! I always wanted to know what "happened". GWTW Margaret's children were there because we never knew what to make sure. I went with the winds of a long live fan and I could not cancel more by the movie. I've compared "Scarlet" to the original GWTW because any movie that is compatible with GWTW is the same quality as the first quality. The rath was thrown nicely, though at some point no. Do not compare to Gabel. I'm a strict Vivian Lei fan !! She was scarlet. He fit the bill. In this lifetime no other actress or anyone else will measure the same shoes, but the work with "Scarlet" may have been better. The exact scarlett was not worried enough to find, which was clear. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something overall, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Reetta, I would recommend writing for myself or looking for a fan. Fiction This movie is not worth the time.
