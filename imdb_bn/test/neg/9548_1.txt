* Criticism refers to spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely comment on the user, but this is a movie I have no problem with blue. This movie has become frustrating and its mid-6th and 150th is probably too much for this decoration. The bone collector is not equal to any film that lambas or seven silence, despite its advertising demand. It's not a thriller how a perfect example. The motion of this film was very slow - I actually crossed the half-way in about 10 minutes and returned to the right scene with the same character with the same progress (I mention the part where Dangle debates about the character of Angelina Jolie and cuts a body 'hand). The film is not terrible, but it is trying to compensate for the love-theorem despite the character of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington. Of course, what you found is that compared with Hibbler Lecter and Sterling, the comparisons of the Brillian epic poem is comparatively comparable to that of the counselor-student relationship, but even all its functionality is lacking and I'm routing routine villains to kill Hackneyd Giggle. Turn off Denzel for that. With such pornographic images, I was hoping to get some credit for the movie or some surprising conditions, which dragged middle movies like Arlington Road and Scrum. With 4th grade education anyone can see the solution to solve (a situation that mixes alfred hittercock's rear window). There was considerable ambiguity for the killer to explain his motives, but that reason was humorous and stupid, which spit on me the screen latte. Obviously, I also think the murderer's purpose was completely lost because Danl's was happy with his loss of 'chess game' and took his pet project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of movies, you can not appreciate the original idea and indeed dynamic ideas (like I). If you are not present in a single movie in your life and sometimes do not want to catch a Hollywood clich√© (late night hit the window from someone else), but with the main investigative relationship of the murderer, ridiculously serial-killer, the horrible 'woman is the male supremacist, Ur STLL ), Watch this movie .... but still it is very slow and you will get bored.
