Based on the first novel A Tie Tie to Kill John Grisham, she wrote before she became famous, and no one wanted to get her fame. (That will be done by "firm"). The film has not been made so long, the meaningless coins of the Grisham movie have renewed their sympathy. Unlike most of them, this book was actually about anything. It was flesh, was weight, and it was in the heart. <br /> <br /> But this was a fatal error, and this fatal error was translated into movies. For example, you set up "A Tie Tie to Kill". <br /> <br /> We have a black man (Jackson), who tried the trial of the murder of two white men, who tortured and tortured 10-year-old barbarism. Daughter. One of our client lawyers (McConnie) is struggling with a bad system to save his client. And oh, however, the whole thing has been set against Mississippi's racial retrograde, who has done it with the crossing of people. <br /> <br /> In other words, we want to be sympathetic to Karl Lee Healy. We believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing a man who is raping him. We are going to experience the injustices of a system where all the white jurors of the racist can judge a black man, who was just trying to take revenge on a cruel crime. We feel that we are standing alongside holding down the word "Free Karl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the problem of racism is a smoke screen, and the whole thing is coupled. Karl Lee Healy had a surveillance. Yes, there was a situation of damages for what he did, but he was not really innocent. This was not true of the color of his skin, or his daughter, the judge, the judge, or the color of the murder of someone else's skin. <br /> <br /> And anyone who thinks of this image should be convicted of such a heavy elephant, Karl Lee, is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be taken by the people's own hands, then you may burn the lawn after burning some hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time a heavy dose of sensitivity is inserted into a story like this, and it will not end. As a film, A Tie is quite faithful to the Tie-Tie Book, and the performance is not half bad. But it has been played really hands, acting Even a good cast bad source material can not be improved.
