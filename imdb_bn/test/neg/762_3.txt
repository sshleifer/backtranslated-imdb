C.H.O.M.P.S. For example, the Disney family comedy-the cat's exterior spaces or anandidified flying rounds took a chessy in the late 70's. Do nothing ruthlessly creative, hit the same cliches of death, yet vaguely entertaining way to a stupid way. The actor will not win any prize, nor will the director, writer, or FX crew get it, but there is some obscure entertainment in its illogical ness and blend predictions. The robot dog concept as security system is so full of holes you can use it as a colander. Incredibly the repetitive discos soundtrack will stick in your head, so be careful.
