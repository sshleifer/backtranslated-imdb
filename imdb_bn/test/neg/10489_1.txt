I'm not the fan of the worst horror films of the 1950s and 60s - movies are so ridiculous and stupid that they are good for laughter So, because of this, it is natural that I will choose this movie - especially because with John Agar, it was actually a bad idea. Sadly, this was a bad movie, it's the worst kind of bad movie - less than faith and illogical. With at least stupid and very bad movies, you can ridicule with violent monsters and terrible aspects and acting. Here, you have never seen much of that giant (mostly due to the printing of darkness) and acting, when bad, low energy is low ... lazy and dull <br /> <br /> Some young adults are turning to Satan's lip on their necks. Well, considering the name of the place, when they are broken into pieces, there is no surprise! Dove ... do not go to the devil's neck! Well, there are reports of crashes in the sky, so what do the teens do? Yes, throw a dance party - a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids dance almost at slow speed. So make sure to Sheriff (Agar) and his men that they can dance silently without the skills of the thirteenth. <br /> <br /> For the giant, it's like a guy in a gorilla suit - a bit bit like a monster in Robot Monster. Not just the original and just high tech. To make it worse, it started crying and slowing down - so slow that even the most vulnerable tins can easily go beyond it! How often it is managed to beat me out <br /> <br /> Overall, very nicely - even if you're a fan of the shy movie.
