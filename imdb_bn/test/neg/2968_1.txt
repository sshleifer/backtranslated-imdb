I just want to say that I saw it after the assault on Tomato 3 and the Starships fighters, the third worst movie. This is not just a dialog or a paper wall or a gun shot, which automatically disappears, the wall is a hole. It was awesome acting. Probably never before seen these actors that they are probably sleeping with the director (s). I now feel good for this movie but that's why I've been tired of screaming in the movie (I saw it). My suggestion: In order to buy many DVDs of this movie you probably want to burn it and burn it, so sometimes someone can not see this terrible waste of time, money and film.
