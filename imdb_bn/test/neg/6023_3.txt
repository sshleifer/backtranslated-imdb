The "ClubBad" project is a catchy movie about the scenes of the 1980s. We end up in a film with identity problems. Since the sub-plots take from viewers, it seems to be the main plot, so the focus of this film is mainly on the clutter of "clubbing". <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, suicides, gangsters, bouncers and drug-police, all are quickly crammed in 90 odd minutes. In less than 4 months, I had to check the film's run time because the picture was frustrating. <br /> <br /> We see the views of a club that is about 3 additional dances that are happy and repetitive, which are rarely identifiable as a "club", rarely hold the daytime of Veeb. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about the club scene in the 80's, but in the late 90s, what "human traffic" has worked, forget the "clubbad".
