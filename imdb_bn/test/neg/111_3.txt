These cheap, great-looking Italian Fleks are some heirs who live in the Italian rural area who move towards home to sit in the house and then kill the ghosts who died in that house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed by this. It was not really horrific, most should only be a cheap Italian movie. A girl, her cousins ​​and a cousin, some reason for this huge house (why I could not understand it) and I live there, make it clear and check the place. Characters come in and out of the film and it is quite annoying at points and most of the deaths are spread out. When the girlfriend dreams of her death, the car hits the vehicle when she escapes from home, and the scene is pretty good, but after the end of the confusing some things become slower, when the male cousins ​​die together in some strange way, and this strange guy (I'm in this movie time I did not understand who was) or after the attack on this girl, this girl finally killed her. The last hate to give away, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and keep an eye on her, and they show her home scene there after a few years. The end You're not really missing anything, and anyway, perhaps you will not get this anywhere, so lucky.
