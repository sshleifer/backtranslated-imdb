This movie is a comedy. So where did all the smiles go? Forget about entering the version I saw in them. As a football movie, it's gently entertaining, I'm guessing. I'm just a stick mat, no ridiculous feeling. Or maybe this movie is not funny. It's also boring, topped "You're a Winner" musical score. And the odd thing is that the team has succumbed through only in the last two matches, winning most of the season, and there was nothing to understand the last game because they were not in the playoffs. Are they celebrating middle class? I can not see it. If someone knows, please let me know. However, this movie is not superb even very good. I'm giving it less 3 *
