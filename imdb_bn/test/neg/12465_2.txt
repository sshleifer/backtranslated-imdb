The box of this movie presents itself completely. The cover shows a view of legs and panties in a short skirt. Title 'Tart.' The back section of the box seems like the cat was known as the main character, which became one of the popular students, but the popularity became such a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from it. The box that created this movie is a terrible falsehood. I hope to watch the videos, video-from-video version of Heather's thirteen-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I tell you what the tart was really about. Yes, this is really a plot; So if you do not want to know what is happening, stop reading. We have an unlikely, annoying rich girl. This unlikely girl's best friend is a scank. Scandal is expelled from the school, so unlucky girl has some British girl friendship. This disgusting girl is this annoying guy dating, whose box 'school is the most popular boy'. If that guy is the most popular man in his school, I would like him to go to high school, because I could tear his shit away from him. However, since a movie will tell you, the most popular person in school is always a killer or a drug addict or thief, or in this case, all of the above. Since, he is impossible to disliking the main character of the Jewish people. Then the most popular man in the school died by his best friend, Scanck, because skunk caught the most popular boy of gay sex. The impossible girl's stooping mother and the younger brother of Hypochondrius have end up for her. Oh, and the whole movie is about rich rich children and their awesome parents. Gee, what's wrong with that? That sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, what I think. But you see, there are no eligible characters in this movie. The main character is boring. Filmmakers made their average, when he spouting about what he was amazing at the time of the film. Scan is not quite skanky, and there's a little screen time. There is nothing to write about the popular man. Popular girls are just girls of your run-of-the-mill rich. There are no moral lessons. Cat, the annoying main character is not a strange thing, he is never one of the most popular girls and after all the cravings (worst of all) he never thinks he is still the only beautiful girl, dorky girl. To be honest, I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I asked, who tart? Is he tart? Are they all tarts? In 94 minutes, theoretically it is not a long film. But after watching this horrible waste of VHS tapes, and did not know the turtle, I was surprised that the film was only about one and a half hour. The movie was feeling like it was two hours and some changes. After a while, I hope the movie will be about pop tart. At least when you see a box of pop tart, you know what you can expect.
