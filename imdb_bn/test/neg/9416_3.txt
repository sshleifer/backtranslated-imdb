Mario Van Paibles tried to go to the Jane-Cloud van Dam route and played an ornamental robotic soldier who went to AWOL for his protection, but the government is not going to lie to it, so in the midst of the conspiracy, Van Pubal guards the villagers to rebel forces and in this frustrating film. Makes yourself a better version. Universal Soldier's Blatant Rip Off (which makes it even more fun) simply does not go anywhere. The main problem is that the movie is incredibly inactive. Van Peebles is just enough enough to justify a wait-stick enough to be there and waiting there. On the other hand, the movie is called R.O.T.O.R. Although it is sort of like a suitable version of it, even though it was a ludicrous bad comedy film, it only occasionally smiles on its ridiculous incompatible action sequences. Also, like R.O.T.O.R., it does not give any idea in its description and the movie is quite annoying. Plus villains are frustratingly poor and essentially need a real action scenario for the movie work, because the material is too dull. Solo has all the weak movies. <br /> <br /> * 4/1 of 1- (poor)
