The "highest risk" walkway for a step-by-step approach to Van Damme and much more of the obscure B-Movie Action staff, which we have come to expect from the characteristics of the macho Belgian martial artist. This flick has a graph plot hole, a gouge's gallery, a dirty trunk plot and an excellent henstridge, who spent most of the time waiting for a queue. "Most Risks" do not separate themselves in any way, and normal young men will not appeal more than the audience. (C)
