Why bother watching this movie? After an ironic play by Clerk Gable Parnell's Irish patriot, it is perhaps a prize for a major movie star's worst career move. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The interesting Hollywood carrier where she could choose between the best script and the time the director was given. Initially, there was no script to work without some notes. Then we believe that a poor refugee is believed to be a domestic refugee who wants to do something for the liberation of the refugee camp, to marry a poor Italian fisherman who does not love it. I read that Anna Magny was the real choice of this section. If so, that makes a far greater sense than throwing a brilliant Bergman in a proletariat. But when he loves his director, the common sense comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> They live in this poor village, where men should work hard to live a little bit alive from the sea. <br /> <br /> His only friend is a village priest who knows that he is not fit in the life of a poor fisherman, but tells him that for love, he will have to put a real feeling of revenge on him, and he will accept daily poverty and frustration. Above all of this, there is always this volcano erupting in the hot lava and on the edge of sinking. But like the real heroine, Bergman rebelled against his sadness by proclaiming a war about someone in this audacious film. Trying to seduce the village priest, he does not even smile even in a scene where smiles arise. Since a husband has to keep her poor slogan in order to keep her away from the house, she is forced to use her body to marry her to get married. To him, no sacrifice is too great; No man unapproachable if he is willing to help flee to the island and its famine. I will not bother telling you how to end all of this. The last no script film is considered as the rest of the stromolei. I remember (late at night watching it on TV) that it was two different ends! So you will be warned if you sit through this king-sized turkey and should feel brave enough to catch Bergman's miscast. It was her decline in Hollywood for the next seven years and her father was condemned for sleeping with Lindstrom when she was married. No film with this director (after which he was married) did not make any significant, except that without the evidence of the carrier. I'm not joking with you. It's quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack
