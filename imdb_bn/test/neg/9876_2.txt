I do not read books. Now I really do not want to. I went to the theater when there was no source about this movie. I still can not understand that it was about to reach a point, but I know that two hours of my life were good. I can never get two precious hours back. <br /> <br /> The story was so convincing, it's ridiculous. VeruValves ... or something ... Romeo and Juliet type plots. I anticipate the end of film in five minutes. And I was right. <br /> <br /> acting is not awesome. The only two coolest characters in the film were the British cousin and the Rambo-graphic-novel Duder. Other characters too ... The dialogue is very delightful and expected. <br /> <br /> The absolute part of the film is transformed between "man" and "wolf". If you wanted some kick-ins like Van Helings, you would be really annoyed. Ballerina's, a bright light, then imagine a wolf. Yeah ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Duration Especially if you read the book because you only want to delete the child.
