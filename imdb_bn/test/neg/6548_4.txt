Officially the first martial art film in USSR cinematography, which is a true martial artist like Tandan Kashianov and Russian Bruce Li-Talgat Nikgmatulin. Bad guy is a ship ambitious to the high sea but fortunately just a trained martial artist about everyone on board. A collectible for martial arts aficionado.
