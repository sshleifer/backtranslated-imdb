Whenever Knight publishes this news, then his obvious ESPN drills, but did he have to create a freakin movie about them? This is one of the worst attempts in a serious drama movie I've ever seen. It was all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous cast, cheap set etc. It looks like it was shot at a $ 10 budget. Cummon, what's up with the game scene? They had a middle school gym? And the light, well, let me just say it ridiculous. And Bob Knight as Brian Denhey? Give me a break. Looked like Danielle ... a red sweater, there's nothing else. ESPN has lost many credibility with this flop endeavor. They poured $$$$$ for advertising, then the premiere was a huge fanatic. Bob Knight is not an item that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it Even Knight himself thought that it was stupid than anything else.
