I'm a fan of horror movies, regardless of which comes from the hemisphere. I know what to expect from the west, from the east and the most awful. So I got 'Acacia' DVD in this post and looking at the slow buildup of children with screaming, confusing movements under the dive and growing tension and fear. <br /> <br /> The main selling point for this movie was that it had far more linear story lines than many - you got the letters where they came and what they did. You can get baseline information (nice couple, not a child) and realize that primais is quite normal for something unusual. <br /> <br /> And then it's worse. The number one complaint is that the story is weird. I got pretty beautiful by hugging the child. I knew where the picture was going and predicted the death order and for any reason. <br /> <br /> The edit is frustrating and, unfortunately, not for the benefit of film. Even I was still thinking about the incident, not allowed to create tensions because the director got a new edit suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> and my final grapes this .... trees were unnecessary. The little story was full of horror, the couple broke after the child's death - the famous tree did not buy any new or exciting movie. So I'll finish where I start - my overall impression was 'Oh.'
