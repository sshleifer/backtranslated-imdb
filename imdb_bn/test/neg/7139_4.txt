Fault 2 ... let's see. Do not make me wrong, I'm not Japanese Horror Film or Horror or Gr√ºge Bashar. I liked the first one and the original junior. I think there may be more to this trial. Abahari only existed to meet the need of 'discovering' at the end, (which you have already seen on the Zoo-on, you already know the whole film) It was actually a complete rebuild of the Ju-On, just following the hated more closely. Although everyone thought it was a little fun coming to America, but the house burned at the end of The Grood was expected to leave the second hunger for the new plot. Save your $ 6.50 and wait for it to come out of DVD, rent it, check it out, then decide whether you want to buy it. This movie is good for sleeping morning morning morning. But overall, I want to say 4 out of 10. Sorry sorry fans ... it just failed.
