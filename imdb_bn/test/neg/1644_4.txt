Best wishes .. I think I saw it all. Danny Thomas looks so out of place in this mishmash. He seems really uncomfortable. He can not sing a lake price, and when he is easily paired with Peggy Lee (Peggy LEE ???) .. easily outsings him out! Maybe the director has seen this and he has ever made a real bad comedy routine, which he sometimes does in the film. Peggy Lee is okay, but the whole thing is a shambles. Good for a laugh, maybe maybe.
