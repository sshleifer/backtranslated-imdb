I was about to show demons that were hooked by the evidence. From hell And a door to hell. I did not understand that I would see some people running around the tunnels followed by small boys, who could become a monster for the whole movie. Certainly there was some dialogue in the intermediate underground scene, but lack of a plot, better character, any twist or development of the story was all too bad. Oh, and out of interest, there was no special effect. The whole budget wages, sets and sometimes walks underground by camera with actors. <br /> <br /> One of the last undesired boring ends was that "You've tolerated this boring film for that !?" If you want to see the giant and see the portal of hell, then I promise you that you will make the task of showing trailers in the game Helgate: London is smaller than this movie in 5 minutes, more dialogue, character development, action, <br /> <br / > The second star is for the effort, but for the failure to create a movie overall, fewer score, and taglines promise Which was provided to Barua much higher.
