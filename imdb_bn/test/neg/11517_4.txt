When I watched this movie three years ago, I think it is the most of the features found in Singapore's art-house movies, for example: depending on the film's composition for moving slowly, briefly and with the dialogue. <BR> </ p> <br /> Then, in the local films, the inability to appreciate "Stay with me" is not capable of panning any "Citizen Carnage". I do not know how Singapore's cinematic consciousness has reached this high altitude like "Bay Be Wit", but I always think that Khoo's "12 stores" is a good film, though the next film does not boast a painter as an Adrian Tan. , Khoo's DP "Stay with me". "12 Stores" is a story that is most related to Singapore and it bites too much, something that is not in Threadbayer Wistfulness of "Bay with Meow". <br /> <br /> "Stay with me" is basically divided into three chapters of stories together in a movie and one of his screenwriters On Kim Kim Hohn. It works with a security guard, who loves a girl, whom he sees only at a distance. Two girls of a horoerotic relationship; And the story of Deaf-blind-dark Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Bake With Me" very well pulls using a variant camera. Film compositions are efficient. The film is almost completely silent, there is no dialogue next. Characters are not realistic, but they often look at the screen as directed by the director's direction and are somehow: loneliness or sorrow. Unfortunately the characters do not work against each other. This type of movie has been seen long ago: In the movies of Need Ming-liang, Kho's perspective is "4:30" by Ryan Stan and elsewhere. Sadly, its super-slimness (mainly being conspiracy) and the use of the Lento piano soundtrack simply does not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> Its inspirational story seems almost negative to criticize "stay with me". , Teresa Chan, who has lived a complete life despite the blind and deaf and still in spite of all this, I am afraid that this movie does not do much to me. I am ready to appreciate Chan's strong and bold procession and praise Tane's attractive painting, but with more meat to take the same thing better (except for two other tedious and confusing maidens), "Land of Silence" and Darkness "(1971) of Verna's turmoil.
