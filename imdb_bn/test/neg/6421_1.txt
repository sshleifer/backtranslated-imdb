Good Lord! This film needs a new classification on its cover "Only if you do not have anything else to do!" I'm hoping. I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend ... an Adrenaline needed and needed awesome tingling sensation that pushed my voice down. But this movie is not it. A reasonable good story but quite horror acting, dialogue, and filming. It was isolated and sometimes stupid. We have played the camera looking at the wrong side, the people are loudly speaking and describing what is happening and describing what is happening, in some shots, the shadow of the equipment, like fools, "I just have to catch you" completely wrong places and circumstances. Thanks for the unexpected me and if I bothered someone, it was a waste of time and money.
