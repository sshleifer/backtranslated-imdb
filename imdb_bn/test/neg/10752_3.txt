One critic, who does not like this picture, "It will only appreciate movie viewers who are tired of the film's abstraction". This, I think, it is unfair for those who seem to be annoying to us. <br /> <br /> I have not been tired or confused with filmmakers, but this tedious and self-fulfilling. But then, it's true, I'm not too big in deep meaningful. I know that those who know it may have a lot of money, you know. <br /> <br /> It's used to slow down and use the image, to do this, actually, it actually takes a long time to try its own points. But on such days, it seems like a movie like this is perhaps the one thing that you can do in a dark and dangerous booth of modern art galleries on the screen of a popular movie setting.
