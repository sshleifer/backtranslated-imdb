This pretty joke for a Norris movie. It is neutral for an action movie, and as far as possible the prediction goes to my friend and I almost nailed every turn of this movie. It was amazing that every step of the killer was not telegraphed by 80 action movie satellites, but let's just, the non-expected move denies the plot and the setup of the edit. Originally it is said that the killer (Jack Ohloran, one of the few famous actors) killed only women. Yet, suddenly his M.O. And kill people, is not it? I can assume that it can be somewhat reasonable and reasonable, but why can it be seen by editing this movie that she kills the woman? <br /> <br /> Again, I'm sure there is a reason (i.e. skeptical), but why spend it while watching while many other suspense movies are too high. Fans of "Renegade" can enjoy Brunscom as Victor of Richmond, but his short appearance can not save the film and even 4 votes seem to be liberal. <br /> <br /> <br />
