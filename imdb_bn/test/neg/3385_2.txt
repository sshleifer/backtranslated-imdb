Wow, where do I start? I had to make some comments after the trouble with this rogue $ 1.00 rental (thanks a lot, family video thanks). I am not bothered to write the names of 3 actors in the movie, but I hope you know who you are talking about. <br /> <br /> A giant truck terrorizes the countryside and behind them old friends of two colleges destroy them. They face a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. I mean, these are just fantastic words in theory. I was fierce in the DVD box, when I started walking towards the counter behind the counter in the video store. Acting: Whatever Emae, the hot girl is visually smiling through many scenes, she is supposed to fear. The other two main actors of the film, Fat Crankster and Vanilla Strait-guy are both terrible. Fat guy thinks he is Jack Black He is not Other actors, our heroes, misses too much emotions and all of their cues and came to some kind of generic character that can be seen in a nicode-nixelodian movie made about skateboarding in the early 90's. See: I do not expect great performance in such films, but at least the actors can try not to be annoying. You can still be an unfinished actor but still agree (e.g. John Wayne). At least that Aime is attractive to the gallery. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy ****, who was this conversation interesting? It will not be nerve to play in front of my grade school drama class, much less as a film script. Unexpectedly Bad After this more. Production: OK, this is the place where the film is definitely successful. The production quality is amazing high. The look of the photo is very good. Actually the only talented person acting was the director of photography. Well, I have the biggest determination here: 1) The man who runs the car does not drive more than 25 miles. <Br> <br /> 2) A fat person in his back seat mask understands that the person running the car went out of the country. He seems to have gas mileage recordings and his antique car in good condition, but did he not see any 300lb jack Black Isnatorar behind? <br /> <br /> 4) Characters do not change their clothes. There are two hotel views. Probably, the fountains are available for our character, yet for 3 days of this movie, a letter is not bothered to change their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Lighthearted, slapstick comedy is not mixed with horror. Duration You will not move away from our characters' monster trucks of one second and the next second makes them pushing each other together with some DOPi lamps / comedy music playing. This kind of pacing virtual cinema destroys any tension. 2 comedy movies that combine with comedy and horror, can understand that the excitement can be reduced, but it is not completely eradicated completely without humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, well, good.
