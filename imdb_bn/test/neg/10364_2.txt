Whenever I see such a movie, I get sick in my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in my daily life. Through my day I see black, white, Asian, Latinoos ... how do you throw a movie and do not think that other ethnic groups will walk before you? I'm not sure they intended but to pay attention. I do not care if it happens in Kansas or South Center. All I saw was a token black. This was usually between 80's. Hey! It worked as a performer of 2007, all rapper, singer and athlete Thomas Haden Church could give more attention to his cast. Are not actors supposed to be more liberal?
