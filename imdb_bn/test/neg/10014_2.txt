The 'Pilot' piece is called 'The Final Executioner' in the lower part of the movie 'Scene'. At least I came in. The former Superintendent of Police is trained by a bomb to take revenge for killing women and girlfriend in cold blood .. And about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. For a while, I saw in a film that one of the weird Arrests and a huge fortress, apparently driven by 7 people. Sinking is a very good job! (!) Best Moments: When our hero encounters a sword and squares through the neck, he comes to his gun and bank! Why not do that before? This is a mystery. Why would anyone want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still annoying myself at this moment .. 2/10
