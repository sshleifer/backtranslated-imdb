I want to say that I am a big fan of this 'left-wing left-wing leftist', even people who seem to hate are also held in higher honors by me; But this kind of movie that I did not like was Adela Lodo's Night Train Murders, and unfortunately it seemed that the train and leftist The Last House do not mix, because terror Express is another unforeseen rip-off. There really is something of a resoundingly nasty lead character that needs such a photo; And Terror Express proposes to three potential candidates, none of them departs, and this becomes villane, which lacks the most important areas. It really started well because three youths of a passenger train excited the young person on the board. These viewers believe that there is more to the shop, but unfortunately it never gets after the scene is set once. Three trains have been eliminated from here and using their newly found electricity to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It should be said that it has a rough amount of puzzle. The film, which will be delightful to many visitors; But there is very little blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi thought that he could replace blood with sex scenes, and he also went away with it; She could film a cruel sexual scene. These men leave the window after knowing that the train is forced to leave, because the people you want strong and forcible expectations are very interested in showing good time to their women, and in spite of being very copper 'sandwich' sequence, gender is no more attractive . Since many movies are taken by these sex scenes, it has become a huge problem. Such movies are often lacking in style, mystery and credibility; But you know what you are seeing bad when it's annoying. As you can expect, nothing is played up; And the central three especially stand for being garbage. There is lack of style in direction, and there is very little tension or suspicion; What makes it hard to care about is going to happen. Overall, it is a fantastic crappy example of a exploitation film, and I can not recommend it.
