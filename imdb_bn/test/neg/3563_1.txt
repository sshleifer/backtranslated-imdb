Conclusion: Very ,, very annoying, I saw the end, expecting some compromise-down effects, but it was nothing because the last was bad. The old black and white game did not always help, it usually helps in psychological films, but this is not the case. Script, plot, etc. were linear, there was no substance, nothing is going on. When you deal with psychoanalyst, then you explain in detail with the analysis, the unity-diversity formula .... there is no formula, no details. There are many stories to tell stories, but to make them unique and difficult to apologize to the makers of tools and creativity ... well, it's not the one.
