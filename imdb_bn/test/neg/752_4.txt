Generally Jane Austen's BBC productions are quite good, but Northbourne Abbey is just awesome. What did they think? This picture contains Austen's elegance and oddly disrespectfully portrays Gothic novels miraculously. Not only that, the "Gothic" series is the money, the final, and the most stupid. Miss Marland's acting actress throws sternly without any clear appeal to attract qualified graduate attention, and although I'm Mr. Tylen, like Peter Pearl, likes to glance, but if he does not have anything like a novel, even if the dialogue is given directly, Robert Hardy turned his horror "Ham" performance as General Tyler. This movie was so weird and weird that I actually saw it again that it was a strange mistake.
