I am very surprised to say, "the graveyard man" among the terrible fans! Now, I generally welcome movies that blend two or more types of styles and I just like the zombie-comedy I've seen. For my frustration, this Italian culture-classical did not really show me much to pump me too much ... It is a full-time cemetery, who performs unusual responsibilities of care and her disabled, male child, Coralie Joe who initially popped the soil after seven days of death The recent dead seem to be looking for Assistant looking for. She meets a widow whom she "wows" and develops a rapid romance with some deadly cemetery atmosphere, soon she is having sex with her dead husband's grave. Husband's body is a series series that seems to consume the living springs and its bite, the rest of the movie. "Graveyard Man" attempts to include every element in voice, romance, comedy, action, and complete failure. It plods along, not able to focus on any aspect that is enough to make it interesting for visitors, punchy sidekick's relationship with such a living stacked head, a motorcycle riding a zombie ride from the ground, the main character of the gun down shuffle on the stray people, Etc. This thing is so slow and lazy that it is almost impossible to take seriously. Of course, it is stylish and often "elegant", but even "art" types of films also require reproduction properly, so that it turns into a sense. Plods along the "Cemetery Man", unable to focus more than a few minutes, which became very tiring after a while. People argue that "this is a sophisticated zombie movie" Frankly, when it comes to the zombies, I do not want "sophisticated" more than Romero ... there is a small amount of cattle and nudity - mainly in the scenes where it wants to play "horror movie", but not nearly enough of the structure's uncompromising To make up for lack. Terrible film
