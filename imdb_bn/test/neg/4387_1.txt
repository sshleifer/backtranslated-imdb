It was my wife and the worst movie I ever seen. The only requests are that we did not pay to see it in the movie when we rented it from the video store to the DVD. Just - There is no significant plot (I just watched it 5 minutes ago and already forgot), the annoying character played badly by two-bit actors and if it seems to be a comedy then I'm still waiting to laugh. Actually we got out of this movie that we had fun with each other that we were absolutely awkward. "<br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely cruel and I used to waste time on others, a National Lampuna Travel, rating 0/10.
