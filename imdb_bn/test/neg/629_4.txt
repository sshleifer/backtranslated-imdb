I have seen the previous movie of Sidric Clapish, and therefore hope to have a quality movie with emotional depth. After visiting Erasmus students and visiting several friends studying abroad, I know what it means to spend some time abroad and mix different cultures at the same time. Yes, it's so fun! For that reason I thought I did not miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was frustrated to fail to satisfy Apophagnal in many ways in L'Argeb: Characters have been stereotyped, the events are intense and the story is shallow. Although there are several familiar situations, they can bother nicely and can not go beyond trivial events. Does this movie make you unhappy to watch, and lets me add a strong "paid-to-do-nothing-something"? Feeling. Besides, there is no strong story in the film. It sometimes shows more like a documentary or a 'real-life' show than a seriously created movie. However, I can imagine that if you have not read or traveled abroad, it may be fun to see it.
