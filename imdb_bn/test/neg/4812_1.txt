Why? Why? Why is anyone in the world telling the truth about this horrible, hateful movie? I still woke up in the morning and asked why he did not stop seeing this rebel "comedy". I can not believe that I can see this crime in my cinematographic taste. I'm starting to think that the 5 stars are the nudity of Martha Higheria and all men who can not buy a pornographic movie and can not see it ... I'll call it "things" because it's a movie. The insult of the Mexican film industry. Characters played a huge clich√©, because the unintended smile and script ... Well, I do not believe that a person has been writing this. And when you thought that you had done enough torture ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to burst my eyes. What I can say about this hatred is only 90 minutes (which will seem like centuries, but still). Really, avoid the pins !!!
