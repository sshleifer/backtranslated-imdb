It surprised me that someone would actually consider spending some money in a movie like this. Really Let's forget for a second that this plot does not give a hint of originality ... Most of today's movies are based on the story of other movies, so a "simple" lack of basicity is not a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can not believe that any person involved in the movie has never seen the plane before this shooting. Because, be honest, that the only excuse will come with some ridiculous. To be sincere I think a 6 year old child with a fake camera could technically come up with something more credible. Some examples are being followed. <br /> <br /> When the scene that made me really crazy came back to the control of the aircraft, the engine stopped. When they want to turn them on again, the person says on the radio "OK, push 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard". Now, those buttons do not. They should not be pushed, they should actually pull up and turn toward the pilot. Is it just plain-addiction, will you know? Wrong The next scene you can see by pushing their fingers "buttons" ... and of course the so-called "buttons" can not be removed! Not even a millimeter! (And remember that the engine engines are not like the car engine, you just launch the key and the magic happens ... even if you need to do a complex process to launch it ...) Let's all! You could have faked at least the movement !! Not to mention the sunny final impact, in which the plane runs along the runway against the disasters (light poles along the runway? Where are they thinking?) ... and wings are not leaked! It happened to me, once ... the plane made from lego on the plane! What about the flight attendant? He is actually so skilled that he fully knows that the "Ox 1" and "Ox 2" fuses are in the middle of the cockpit in the middle of the wire. Then what would we say, the man who could run an ambulance _and_ use his computer to fly an aircraft behind the ambulance? And how did he turn on other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could go hours with this thing. This is the most dumbest movie I ever ever covered, and I'm lambing just like in black and other things like rubbish. Want to give yourself a favor? Do not see it.
