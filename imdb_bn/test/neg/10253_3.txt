I easily admit that I see many bad movies. But when I was torn by women, I was very sad. It is a stinker of epic proportions. For the first time a woman should not be a sexy comedy about a group of caves discovered, but rather a stupid, stupid thing without a smile. Comedy is extremely weak. If I think the head bad someone feels bad, you might find a smile or two. The boys of this movie look like three stages high in the industry. And there is not enough one plot to keep things together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good question! And I got two answers. First, the movie is not without its curiosity value. I find a little interest in an Italian spoof in movies like a million years BC. With Raquel Welch When I had a point tile for the historical "value" I would give it For the mere presence of the other two points Centa Berger. I know it's not an explanation or argument for ratings, but what are you going to do? It's good I can come up with.
