The uncomfortable mix of comedy and thriller is a major problem where a wildly outstanding movie. To me, the unusual compound is definitely a ridiculous, and they will go for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is very unlikely for a comedy. Betty's husband is very bad about scalping scenes that should be a violent comedy. The leftist writer of Hollywood is another good example, through the character of Freeman, about the plight of Indians, at first we were preaching; I mean - Javan! Frean should have said something interesting in that segment, but of course he is far more difficult than writing boring PC lectures. <br /> <br /> There is still a new age of PC-Ness in the last form: The girl does not get the boy only - she does not get a boy; In fact, the message does not need any boy! There is a feminist statement bit. The first half hour is weak, but the film gets better - maliciously - once the jailer goes to Kinnear. I say "maliciously" because I'm not a fan of Kineyar, even though he is tough here. Zellweger is very tricky, as usual; It has the beauty of all kinds of American characters that should appeal to almost everyone, and I am surprised that such a woman is not "represented" in today's day, rather than a dog like dogs such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since this movie sometimes tries to be very serious, I have no other option than criticizing Freeman's character, which is similar to that of Gangster's equivalent film World Junker. -heart of gold There is absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock, which they can suggest even remotely to father and son.
