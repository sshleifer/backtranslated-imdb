After the snowstorm, the road was blocked and Highway Patrolman Jason (Adam Beach) came to the diner of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prokovo) and advised his client that they could follow their journey the next day. Among the strangers, Jason met his former sweetheart Nancy (Rose MacGuyen), who left her husband in Los Angeles. Along with the night, without contacting his base, Jason faces the clients in tedious and suspicious situations and finds some corpses, indicating that one of them is a murderer. <br /> <br /> "The Last Stop" may be an average thriller, but the playplay is simply terrible. Most of the letters are frustrating and the objectives of the wonderful serial killer are not revealed and the audience has no explanation as to why the murderers decided to kill the guests. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encralados" ("Trap")
