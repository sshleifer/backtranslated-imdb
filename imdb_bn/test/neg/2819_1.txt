This movie was the absolute trash. The director and star (?) Should be exiled from the movie made forever. The paper thin plot expresses concern about a lazy director managed by advertising (currently played) on the Internet to play a snap movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Director Aluminum Canes used to wear glasses in a few shopping carts and received a script, gentle actor and several light bulbs. As it is a scary, ugly, worthless mess of a movie.
