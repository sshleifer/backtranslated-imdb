I had a bad feeling when I saw cheap title work. It took only a few pictures in the scene that this movie is a real stinger! I just got the only pleasure to smile on the technical flaws (for example - "car listening" audio disappears during the scene with Danny and the dog in a dog's carriage). Production shows the total lack of imagination (for example - slow machine gun fire repeated many times). Sandra Bullock is basically a bit part, the plot is totally unnecessary. Not saying that a writer of this movie is actually trying more for writing more than this. Attractive types of ancient computer hardware. This image was published in 1982 (did not indicate the IMDB database in 1987) and then there was an Amber screen with 4.8 MHz IBM PC with current "High Tech" floppy drives. Perhaps the original star of the PC movie was ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We got the DVD for a few rupees in the Walmart door box. As with other critics, we pay too much!
