This movie is probably the most long time I've seen. A friend of mine kept it in the video rental shop, and all forced me to see it, a step that we deeply regret. Ahhh ... where do I start? Writing, acting, quality? All of it sucked. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the worst texts ever seen in a movie. The dialogue seemed to me worse than it could be in movies. Blatant dialog, such as "How are you doing?" ... "That's not great, Doc" (directly after the temptation of a man's daughter and his wife tries to commit suicide. Of course she's not such a great one.) Point, funny kind. Not written horribly, planned out, and obvious. The general plot of the film, writing and how it worked, in Haribil The authors did not do well, then used to write a bunch of obscure conversations and could scrape many sex and nudity scenes. Only good sex scenes (among preachers and tattooed and chicken girls) were depicted with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap animal than a feature film. Oh yes, and they did not really do any work. <br /> <br /> acting? Horrible x100. I think the only good actress Miguel, who played Dell Zamora, was a small Spanish guy. And his part was written horribly. Worst acting? Logically Paul Capellus, whose acting is going on in short music, guns and half-naked blue white girl, has become almost intolerable through the movie. He even ruined his own death scene, which was easy to nail. However, everyone else's acting was horrible too. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters has been added to the overall suction level of the film. There were enough letters in which almost half of the letters died, the same amount of people became a stage, and the remaining letters could not be counted on one side. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> PS What's going on in a stable exorcism movie climax, anyway?
