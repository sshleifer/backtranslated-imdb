If you think that this is the French Mummy and if you are waiting for another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere well. Mummy's same story about the deceased book and a soul that has to find 7 missing pieces spread in Luv. I found the boring, little entertaining for movies mostly. Special effects were not bad, but there was a large explosion expected and there was nothing spectacular until the Eiffel Tower decreased, until I realized that the scenes were in the mummy and that is Belhpegor Apparently based on a French culture TV series, Belphegor could be so good. I voted for this picture only 4/100 Beautiful Sophie Messeu ... she's almost 40 years old and she looks exciting!
