This movie sucks so bad It is interesting to see his funny story, where two motor-brain American twins who do not know anything outside their school can come to the other continent and can do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they find just two French boys, hit them and eventually kiss them, do not know anything about them? More realistic people take them away and rap them, which are easily occurring in such situations. Where they could drink the French president 'bad water', it was just hair. I do not think he was very happy in real life. Everything works very easily for girls, and they can fall into real trouble many times in the movie, if it portrays everyone in real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
