My suggestion ... this movie really wanted to be a "comedy", is not it? !!!! If not, the producer, director, actor and "hair stylist" will really choose another career! Now, my submission guidelines require a minimum of "10 lines". How can I add this to the world? Hmm ... let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite ridiculous with the "crash landing" scene. Very bad that the plane does not hit the tanker truck and the bunch of "Martian's" is cut off from the debris (probably secret) and decides to accept the "world" and create a better movie. Now, that's a great start! <br /> <br />
