I'll really have a good movie on it, boy ... I was wrong! For a quick summery: B grade acting for overall movie C grade Special effects D grade. Do not make me wrong, the story was good and there was not too much adolescence with the Kurds, so "Hero" looked very good, so most women would like it :-) War scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, send some acting actors back to school if they are present in a class. <br /> <br /> Believe me there are many good ways to spend 2 hours. <br /> <br /> you have been warned.
