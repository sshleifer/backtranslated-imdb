Flatland is one of my favorite books, thus I was looking forward to this photo. Unfortunately, the film is absolutely awesome. The dialog is so bad that it sounds like improv at half-time. The new story reminds me that they took the book and some magazines, put them in a blender, and used what they found out for the screenplay. It's a shame to create books and independent films. The only reason I managed to get all the way through the film was even my hope that it would be better. Unfortunately, it has become worse, ending up in a really annoying end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guess what they're going for. And I think you can cut the "people" half and not be able to make mistakes with bloodshed everywhere in the blood.
