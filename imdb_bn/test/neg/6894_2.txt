"This picture is great! I saw it with some friends and we think it was proof that commercial success would not succeed in a film!" ... I want to be able to tell about this picture. The image itself is "very bad!" I once went to see an unapproved singularity, which generally agree with the morality of the film. <br /> <br /> I included a spoiler, but lack of plot makes this very clever. Overall, a cinematic disaster. <br /> <br /> quotation; 'You are not even a clown!' 'You are beautiful, and I say you're also beautiful' 'Have you ever seen a naked body?' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
