Romantic relationship is a tiring mix of sunny puerile attempts with melodrama The reality is that this fails to provide this poorly made film with any weakness. When the action was opened, Reno (AJ Buckley) entered his apartment, where his girlfriend discovered Flintstate Delity with his roommate, who globally said to Reno, "Well, at least it's with someone you know", so that Rono decided to make a roommate, This decision was told to the audience through the immediately abandoned voice. The story came for ten months where we found that his words about avoiding Reno Rumu Roommates are true, although it asks him for the splendor of live-boyfriend Holi (Holly Fields), with whom he has created marital plans. This plot was transferred to the Hollyweed Strip Club for a short time, where Reno's Uncle Charlie, who had fallen in love with a "dancer", whom he found very impressively, saw the decorated skins seen by his love object with death on the club bar at the death Goes away. It is clear that Charlie was aware of the bad state of his heart, because he made a video tape, during which his commentary moved to his big (and mortgage-backed) residence in Reno, and we were next to him as an oath, two roommates interviewed for the tenant And Holly sharing the process of selection in an organized manner. Following an anne sequence involving odd tenant candidates, among whom Reno and Holly find unexpectedly to live with them in their home, they are unknown to each other, they select each other in the opposite sex, the lovers obviously prefer to cool down their partners The Nabin (Chad and Nicol) seem to be a little visible point of view of their existence, apart from the most inanimate adultery with their broad partners, and it is not long before that jealousy blends the Reno and Holly's harmonious relationship. Reno is dependent on making a type of merchandise of travel and sporting travel bags and he gave an engagement ring on Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneur's courage, financial financial significance if he wants to improve his marital plan. Unfortunately, Chad and Nicole's outrageous group, each with its apparently lustful attitude, may disrupt any future of Reno's marriage. Instructions are frustrating, it is simply away from meeting the basic needs of the players, although a flawedly-compiled script provides fewer components to which the actors can work, and the ad libbing is embarrassingly flat. As a result, performance is not known by the obscure, editorial editing, camera-action methods change in the fireplace and often as a fireplace trunk light. Illustrating with low budget and location, design processes require only skill level, but worthless DJs. Background soundtracks, usually blaring and almost always offensive. A good deal of discussions about the final sequences of the film has been raised, which does not depend on the audience that has ever come before, but in reality it is probably the only thoughtful part of a weak cobbled screenplay, and bids fair, despite absolutely shabby quality of production, almost watchable work.
