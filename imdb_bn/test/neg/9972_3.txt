This picture is falling in love with a boyfriend's friend. Then, he will have to share his time for two boyfriends: Jack Day and Joseph night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are only three main actors, other actors listed on the credit are only passing attendance. Clothing designer does not seem to be doing much, because actors wear far fewer clothes on the earth, and in fact they are mostly naked. <br /> <br /> This film was very heavy in dialogue, which should have been made for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialog is very composed and awkward words. At the beginning of the film, most of the conversations are a very long sentence, and then the person is called 'me too.' After the fury of the contract, the dialogue goes into confusing and confused words in the world of salad. <br /> <br /> The only capability of this movie I can think is that it acts as a feminist character, which means that it is not just a person who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This picture is frustrating.
