I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDB, because I saw it because I really wanted to see it and wanted to create my own mind. I was a big fan of QT in the past, I think we all agree that he made some great films, but recently he was defeated by his own mystery and made his own originality disappear. This proves that this "movie" is. It has some views of Bastard. Instead, there are extended sections of conversations between long, tiring, annoying people, after some time you realize that there is nothing about it. It is chronic and lacks a great surprise dialogue that has been responsible for QT for the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no excitement - what happens in each scene is already telegraph that you do not care when it's time. Fond of people, do not believe betrayal. This is a very annoying movie and if you do not see it, you will not miss anything.
