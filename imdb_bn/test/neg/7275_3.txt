Flipping through the TV and saw that there was secret life; George Duran hosted a shot being. I was very energetic of Jim O'Connor and nobody could be like him, but George was very good. He does not seem to want to be really hosting; His voice was over-monotonous, not involved with the guests. It seemed that he was interviewing guests for the unpublished, and he would be in the show. I do not know whether George is going to get "good" hosting this event, because he has hosted his show now. The show seems to pack more information, but only the host sees less. The source of this event was very fine, and I was scared that it is now disrupted for good.
