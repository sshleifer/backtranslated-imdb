I like Ali Ji's show, I believe that the man is a humorous instinct, but it has not yet (yet) developed in this genre. <br /> <br /> I hope the movie is a bit bad. I did not find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that seems "objectionable", look at "Gregg Finger" by Tom Green. <BR> <br /> 2/10
