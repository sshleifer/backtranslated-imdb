Wow, this movie is bad. Think of "flashadence" with ninjas. The worst part is that when a sword is supposed to float between the media, but you can see the string. Or perhaps the worst part is the demon eye patch (it looks like a coaster) that wears good ninja. Actually, there are many bad parts, I can not make my mind worse. I really do not believe in borrowing money to make this thing. The only ransom is good to laugh at it.
