How nice! This movie is almost too bad for the sound. Clearly the authors wanted to add this link to the Gholija franchisee, so they got Pittips from the first to reconsider its role as Jonathan ... only now he has no character in the character of a policeman and his first character. . These horses are not ghalis from the end. Cheap looking dolls were even replaced with costumed little people looking cheap. Rather than being a major opponent or evil, they are not more like comic relief characters, which are not seen for any reason. <br /> <br /> For the first time, seeing this movie seems like I want to see it before. Why was this? Because all these things are stolen from another movie. All Chess police lines and action scenes were from Lethal Arms. Gaushils were mostly like the Bugs Forest and Duffy Ducks, except they were not very funny. Even the original Gullies photo scenes were also scattered throughout this flickr. <br /> <br /> I think target audience was considered adult, but there was a combination of black magic, cartoon skeptics, police drama and bad acting. All work I hope they will not make Gholiez V, because I do not want to lose their money in the movie studio. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / **** 78 minutes No more for violence.
