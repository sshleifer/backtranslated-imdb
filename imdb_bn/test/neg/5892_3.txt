This film was a lot of frustrating that several pieces of book were wrongly done. The original story is similar, but there are several flaws that hit the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Bobby Miles was injured at the start of the story of a Texas game. This means that they will not get anything in the season and Chris Kommer's team comes very soon. <br /> <br /> 2) Marshall's game is lost in Marshall. The team illustrated as Marshall was actually Parmian's main rival Middleland High and found evidence - Marshall High is the colorful scarlet and silver in the name of Marquis, Midland High High Bulldog colored violet and gold. Look at the Jersey and you will see it. Also the original Marshall High football roster is very black, the team showed the ethnic mix like mid-high. <br /> <br /> 3) Permi lost only Midland Lee at one stage in the district game. Medium Li Midland High and Midland High lose lose Permian. These teams set up such a coin toss. <br /> <br /> 4) When Buey comes back as Crowe Kumar's reserve and does not get any time playing Midland Lee, she excludes the team is completely standing at half time and does not stand on the sideline or go to any game again. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a tight and defensive, who was not wearing # 85 Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian # 62 wore. Coaches like Kris Kommer likes Chris Kamar as Bobby's player because he has good Lieutenant policy and the staff likes him even more straight away. Leave the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter Arenain Darl K. Played at the Royal Memorial Stadium where the UT does not qualify for the state semi-finals. Carter won the title of the state but was forced to slaughter him because of an inexperienced player. Acting is done very well, but if you read the book you will see that this error is quite true. Complaining about Dallas Carter's football team's screenplay, I'm tired of hearing all the PCs hypocrites. According to the book, the group is big, demon, talented, and black as the film show. People say this is a racist screenplay but reading the book, you see the true screenplay of the group. The story changed very much, giving the score a score of 3.5 / 10.
