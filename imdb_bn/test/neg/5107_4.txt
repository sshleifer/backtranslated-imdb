When I first heard that the video for Nintendo 64 was not enough, I was very excited. Finally when it came out I was the first person to rent it. I paid it for 7 days, and I got the whole game !!! The game was easy and gave too much hint. Goldmanie is a laborer sigail Take my advice and rent this game. <br /> <br /> Make sure the guns and gadgets are cool, but a clock becomes tired of the laser, which looks like it is reddish in color from GoldenEye, instead of the colors of the blue color, a dart gun, a terrific stunner and a stupid fascinating A poor excuse for the hook that can only be attached to yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made instead of EA, this game should be good in games like sports games and first-person disappears should be cleaned and masters should do the job.
