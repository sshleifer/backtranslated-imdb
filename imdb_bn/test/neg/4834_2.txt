I could catch it on TV, and wanted to see because I remembered the article of Spin, on which the movie is based. I was very frustrated. First of all, if James Belushi becomes the main actor in a movie, then it should be a sign that it is not a listing list. Gregory Hines was the world's dancer, but sadly not a great actor. <br/> <br /> <br /> Actually, the film is played by Flat or Hammy, which can be held responsible for the director, who is the weakest link to this picture. Charles Kerner was trying to impress Oliver Stone's "JFK" to illustrate the conspiracy to cover the "real" child killer (s), but without the advantage of a good script, it should be a listed cast or it must be said, genius. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> This kind of shameful movie does not get good treatment for any shameful movie.
