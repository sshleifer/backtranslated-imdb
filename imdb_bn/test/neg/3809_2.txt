This movie is one of the worst examples of hip. Those who can read IMDb comments may be tempted to see the total waste, just like I did by "false tags of 80's" and with false tags. This movie leads from acting to stories. Awesome, across the board. And I really like the good horror films, I do not have a snob at all. Sucked this. For reference, I started The Grade 1 and 2, Black Ship, Planet Terrorism, Texas Raisso genocide, Others, The Ring, Jason X, Til, Planet Terrorism, and Really Ring 2, Texas Chains Genocide (Re-create) Wolfe Crick, The Hills A Eye (again) Hostels 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore fun or fundamentals do trump
