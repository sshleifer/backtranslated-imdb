You are not requested to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and it looks forward to the end of the movie to you ... Predictable, not always entertaining, movie is lost ... Save your time and See a better thriller. ... the summary seems to be good and so I have seen the movie ... but it was nothing to start with you ... there is no great suspicion ... no good thing ... there is nothing unusual with acting. Come away from this ... low rating ... I do not have to write anything about this movie so I'm sending it to the remaining line so that you can imagine how much time the movie was lost ... really How annoying is a good prize and it was written in a screenplay how bad it is ...
