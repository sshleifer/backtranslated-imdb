Code 46 is one of the Sissy movies where the government allows you to love, and if you try to make a mistake, then you really will punish you. Haves and not live in completely different areas, the ability that your memories can be erased, etc. We saw this thing before, but it's OK - no movie 100% original. This kind of evidence is always fun to think about. Unfortunately, this kind of future idea code 46 is actually more interesting. The letters are annoying and rarely something interesting. Perhaps that's a comment on a dehumanized future, but it's still dull to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Code 46 also sometimes uses television cameras - which I find boring. You know, two characters as a camera gently talk to "floats" on one side. After two seconds it is looking at the other side, a failed attempt to maintain your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this image. If they try to meet me again, maybe I will not do it if they do not agree to pay me $ 50.
