I'm used to being patient with movies because usually I saw it usually closed. But some jobs accept the new level of tiidium and enter the state of tension .... "I think last year in Maranabad". Well, "Pola X" is not a "last year in moribund". I can count on one hand that I have acted in films for years. "Pola X" is the membership of the August team. My defense, I believe I made a brave attempt to stand on my ground - hopefully things will turn around. However, I finally put the shiny towel in the 90-minute mark - in this situation, quite respected. "Pola X" does not come anywhere near the residence of Karax's previous work. After a 10 year break, it must be tough for him. Melville is still cut in his grave!
