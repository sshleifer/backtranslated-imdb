First of all I want to say that I really love Udo Kiar and always respected Arman Assent but could not destroy this movie in a movie. Udo does not appear in the movie much later and acting from everyone is just terrible. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wood, "action" is ridiculous and the plot can be summarized over a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to redeem this movie, but holding my head in my own eyes and holding my head over and over again, "Oh wooodoo ..... why ..... why ?? ??? ". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please do not watch this movie. It will only make you sad for them.
