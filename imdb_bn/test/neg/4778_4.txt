When I saw the 6.0 on IMDB, I was rather excited and excited to watch this movie, because for a horror movie, rather than 6 should be entertaining. At first I thought it was going to be some boring, invisible evil force (not reading the book) to threaten viewers - but it changed a bit - the killer tree. However, for the film I'm not an open-minded person, so I thought that the movie would bring some successful spins to Maradorie Vince. Unfortunately, my expectations have failed to meet the excessive cliché and lack of any basicity. Top off it, the female lead character continues to disturb you with its stupidity. Unless a movie is deliberately entertaining with a bad B-rated movie which is an entertainment of evil, a major character that does not expect to care for the character of a film audience will never bother you at all. Such roles should be preserved for secondary characters. Characters have been adopted, the monsters (in this case, the plants) have become obscure, and the clichés have jumped on all. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> A consistently unsuccessful logic (like a character when watching a rope on a puzzle during the second attempt, it only robs and kills almost anyone), even if the minor is added, and the audience continues to be angry. The film may use characters or some type of narrator to defend themselves or to fool innocent characters ("at least let the character recognize or forget their mistakes"). But to allow the Presiding of the Mushrikers, all the listeners must give up their care, so the film's terrorism will be removed. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a bad movie done. An example of a good film involving the killings of several things was a repetition of the Texas Censo genocide (and the preliminary) which was certainly frightened and fewer characters had reasonable flaws. In short, if you have a lot of time to kill, then see if it is not something else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this sub-parle flick and go to see really scary and highly satisfying things like the reconstruction of the hills.
