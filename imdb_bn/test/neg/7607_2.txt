It is a film film and it is a piece of shit. I will use a lot of powerful language to describe it, but then the review will not be posted and without any possible uncertain doubts in the world - this film is really SUCKS. <br /> <br /> It seems like a different director used to measure a famous director's initial job when used. Anyway, it was genuinely that we realized that we were too stupid, finally decided it today. I'm not buying it. The first film made by LOTR Peter Jackson sucks "bad taste" and this "primary job" from another famous director sucks really the same way. From this "primary job" budget to the speaker to the actor etc., representing all the crappy representatives .. It's all below the bucket trash. Do not be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a mobile phone in the 70's Hippie Barnout, they can never ever show a ship that you've ever seen - it's your movie. <br/> <br /> I can not believe in * 37449 that this thing won a Golden Scroll Award for Best Special Effects. Is that a joke right? Or a joke prize? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, it would be a season or three red dwarf that you hired to kiss.
