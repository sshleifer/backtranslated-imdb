This film was directed by Roger Avary and Quintin Tarantino, because I was playing a screenplay, it was sure that it was going to be a gem. I was roasted. I do not hate this picture, but by no means do I like it. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Everie because the rules of his attraction and the exhibition on his screen are in the imaginative and silent hills. Make this mistake. Do I really have to comment in Teretino, we all know a jeans laughing. <br /> <br /> This movie is set in a bank robbery near a gang but fails to participate in fools. <br /> <I'm disappointed with Tarantino and Avary for doing this picture, but they are both amazing how my mind Does not change Everyone is wrong ......... 3/10 ...........
