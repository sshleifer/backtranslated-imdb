I am so disappointed in this movie, I can not express it. When I started to see this picture, I was so excited that all the skin was in Mickey Rouge and the child from the third rock from the sun used to work like a psycho. I thought, wow, this is going to be the winner, Freakin 'natural landmark killer style. And it got better. The production price was great, the direction was good, the acting was great, the cinematography was fantastic, and the plot was, well, the plot, the good, what the plot? Through this photo, I asked about half the way to pull my hair, "What's going on?" And I mean that quite literally? Nothing makes sense. There is nothing. There is nothing. There is nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhggg !!!!
