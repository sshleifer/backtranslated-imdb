Childs Play Horror has created a new genre, The Killer Dalls, there is not much money to make some of these movies, but it seems that this film is the only film to create shade. This is a typical product directly on the video or on the live TV, but Pinoccio is not realistic and the killer little girl. Children's imagination is very big and this movie plays with them. The role is good and the Candance Mckenzie is awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
