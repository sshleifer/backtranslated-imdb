This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. <br /> <br /> For the first time, there is no character in the movie which is preferred by any means. Michael came near Caine, but even he was quite flawed. The rest of the "commandos" are made up of hateful ex-ear. Two gay Arabs, and three who try to rape a red cross nurse and "leader" who has no problem to kill his man so that he can escape. <br /> <br /> "Mission" is something from suspenseful. They are blow a fuel dump. Exciting sounds, right? Well, these footages follow through infinite sandstorm and fixing flat tires. Yes, you read that right. "Mystery" whether they will run out of extra tires We actually see some changes like 12 flats towards them. How incredibly thrilling this movie is! <br /> <br /> They get a fuel dump, it's a fool. So, nothing to blow And at this time, due to some strong determination, the British army decided that they no longer need these people, and the Rados in their positions to the Germans to kill them <br /> <br /> So, at least we are for freedom Will there be an exciting race? No, instead, they decided to blow up a different fuel dump to create a diversion. But, when they arrive there, they set a travel wire, and the Germans come to them - calling their names on the loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really strange. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they allow the "trap" to enter the dump before sitting? Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel depot and set all their charges. Yes Right <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> , All of the men were betrayed and killed, and Michael survived Caine and Nigel Davenport. British soldiers brought tanks, and they decided to get rescued. As they wear the German uniform (they wear them to blow up the dump) they jumped a white flag with a stick and roamed the streets. <br /> <br /> Some British people walk behind them and machine guns die. Credit roll. <br /> <br /> Yes. Two of the pictures "heroes" died due to a random law of violence. <br /> <br /> It almost suddenly went out of budget and decided: "It's a wrap-up. Go home." I saw this tired, unknowable, and completely unreal film for two hours of my life, which ended with a mysterious bombshell.
