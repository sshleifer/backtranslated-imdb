I try to give a creative license to TV writers to explain the real story, as my diplomacy, and academic writers in my reviews. This story about Karen Carpenter could help many, because of the instructions and editing, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> Cynthia Gibbs portrays a realistic Karen, but sadly so many edits have been done ... Luis Fleischer illustrated his mother, and did a great job with limited ingredients and dialogue. In this case, I pay the actors credit for the survival of this project. <br /> <br /> Why were not the reasons given to the audience? .... American listeners are quite intelligent, and if they have only, then generally educated. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that I could write a good story, could not edit the truth, and allowed the project to project reality <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a director, serious underestimated and insulted the American audience. Karen's story is important, and it is unfortunate that we will never hear it.
