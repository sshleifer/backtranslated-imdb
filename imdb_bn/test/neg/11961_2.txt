I saw the first Squarecore movie and did not take it out, although I knew it was B grade, it was actually some decent beef and that guy was a scary acrobat and had some skillful skills. The effect was good and this movie is better then the dress is better. <br /> <br /> I lent him an open heart, why I was a fan of Simon (former ufc superfight champ) and hopefully it was a decent film. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong, the movie was full, the giant was both sad and really scary, the story was very predictable, it was like watching movies in preview mode. I guess, what will happen, the song was so bad, a terrible lip sync song that would make me wipe the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Save some money.
