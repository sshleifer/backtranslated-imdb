There is no doubt, some people are trying their originality, but what is here is the most tragic, diverse art of it, so for this, I have respect, but to be realistic, it does not make any difference which this hatred is almost, but the record For ... <br /> <br /> With the horror of the final incarceration, we start unknown times in unknown places. Bat of Wright, we have entered into the psychological nightmare, which is a god, seemingly depressed, distorting itself with a razor, I mean, to try it out of hell to end it all, it takes some time (why would not it be ?) After this supernatural introduction, something is happening, something is going on from the body, say hello to Mother Arthur. What does she do? Well, she gave birth to a thing. Perhaps likely liked to be pregnant, but that life. Begins's psychological nightmare welcomes the way it knows the kingdom. Along with the motherland, only the transparency is found with unknown, hooded, attackers, evil intentions. From this point, drag the thing as they dragged before. Attractive, serious images with a complete decent soundtrack, remaining high points. I do not recommend this evil, because I do, but only once, and only for the dark side, thanks to people for gratitude. <br /> <br /> From my description, it may appear that I do not get started "get". Believe me, I can get it, and yes, if I ever saw it, it is brinjal. Despite all of this, regardless of how it may seem, regardless of the film. That is, perhaps, the only thing that makes the art created. That is, most of us need some form of entertainment pricing, and this Chooper is coming from someone else. Probably the most fascinating in the first five minutes, I have seen in a movie, but to be realistic, keep one in the next 7 hours and 55 minutes, ie, if it is not for any kind of cyclical purpose, in which case, do not remember. But, how would one rate such a unique annoying masterpiece? Depending on how much time your attention can take, it should be 1 or 10, no other number will create a statement only. It hurts to do this, but as long as the quality of entertainment goes, the brinjal is not just this. 1/1
