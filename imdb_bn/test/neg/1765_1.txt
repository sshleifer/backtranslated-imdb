This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle. I had all I could sit through it. At the beginning of the movie where they were committed in the war. It just smacked me "Savings Private Ryan" ... or at least one of its efforts. Not only do we care for these people. There was no build up to the letters. The baby that I was going to die seemed to cry us ... but for some reason it only provoked everyone. Then we would have to listen to the line after the line of sad conversations to try hard to imitate "Worthington Heights", of course, the film was cited. Go figure There was nothing original about the film, it was sometimes sitting through the oldest parts of every war movie ever made, it made some humor to keep you hoping to get better. Sadly it's not. After 3 hours, I left the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghila should be shot to try to duplicate the English patient, it was a good movie for the time, but now I am surprised ... I'll hire it and make sure I'm not just hipi ??? Maybe I was, but definitely I did not get caught in the promotion of this film. I really liked this movie went to the theater. I'm a nic hard hard Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, hire it on DVD and smile through it, as I did.
