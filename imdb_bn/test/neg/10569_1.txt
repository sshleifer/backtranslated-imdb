It's terrible! It's like someone who gave a child a defective video camera and $ 30 and asked to make a movie. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so stupid that you can say one can say. I do not think that this guy could know what to do - seeing foreign art films all day can not be an instant manager. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain horror. The only scene I did not hate was the Karwan accident, but that meant only a little less horrific than the rest of the film. How do people get money for this thing? I do not think alternative films but at least should be a big vapor lid of beef? If I am not insulted by the people, I call 'milk prices' amateur. If you are not drunk then it will not be a good movie too!
