"Air Bid 2: Golden Receiver" is a bad practice for creating a signal in a single year. The first picture was tricky, cuddly and charming. The dog's idea of ​​playing a basketball team has been far removed, but he stopped enough stunt to preserve the idea. Even the stories of humans were explained in some of it. Josh's father was killed in flat accidents, so he is sad. And the audience has also been involved in emotion. <br /> <br /> For weakened seagels now. It's terrible. This is the worst kind of bad seagull, which changes good ideas and makes it worse. The way the main plot pieces change in one way, at this time, playing football instead of K-9 basketball. There is no time spent on any narcotic content, the benefits of any suspicion, with a film, your attitude continues with an open mind, there is no positive thinking during the creation of the right bad movie. </ br> <br /> Kikvin's cricketers, like Jacou, are in eight grades. She lives with her mother and younger sister in a Seattle suburbs. In the first film, the human story involves him in a plane crash in his pocket, which can be related to the audience, most people know that it seems like losing a close relative. <br /> <br /> In this picture, the mental plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating again. He and his body, dogs who can play dogs do not like it. Why? If I had been in her shoes I would like to have an extra father in my life, especially this one nice. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him, he became a local veterinarian for Badia. <br /> <br /> The story of animals is very simple. Josh influenced his best friend to try for team football team Timber Wall ves. The group looks like something like America's most fun home videos, even though it may catch a ball in addition to topping or plumming in between. So while Bund shows one day, he proves that he can play as a receiver for him, and there is no doubt that the team's best player. <br /> <br /> Buddy is very interesting in her dress in football. Oh, he's enough to melt the heart. Best of this movie as well as dogs. It was not too bad that no one could draw attention to the question about the dog in the school football team game. <br /> <br /> The plot about the Russian circus staff like a very bad sub-amazing animal theft, of course they try to catch the Buddy. But their mind's mind is ruled by animals and ends up showing their "home lonely" scene. <br /> <br /> "Air Bid 2: Golden Receiver" is a lot more stupid than the first. Russian abductors added a bunch of Lambrain slapstick, which forced me to laugh, with its stupidity. There is a way to look at Scruble's details of nature and very few scenes that show real causes why people see this movie - watching dogs play soccer. <br /> <br /> Performance was also quite embarrassing. I like the presentation of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the overall acting grade will be equal to a D +. Kevin Jizzar and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely unhappy. <br /> <br /> There were some sunny moments in the end by a few football enthusiasts, but not significant. Children to enjoy this movie? Possibly, even when the feeling of heart becomes too long and deep, they will become tired. They will surely complain that the dog has not received enough screen time and is protesting against the hate and annoyance of rapidly changing scripts, and argues that the film is in the trash than Origigi Al "Airbud". I did. <br /> <br /> I think they think the dog is comfortable.
