I like the CSI concept, but the show is seriously broken by wood acting. Medical examiners have the best line and distribute them in an unexpected manner that makes the story live. Unfortunately he has a little screen time <br /> <br /> Also, why does Jazz Fox always look and feel uncomfortable? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious business, but in most cases, letters seem to be confused with the lack of harshness and complete lack of personality. I can not imagine Sarah Sidell or Catherine Wills dating; Will you talk about one thing? I'm waiting for this episode, when at the end of a transition, Catherine chooses the remote control, indicates it in Greece, closes her and gives her a walk in the closet until next day.
