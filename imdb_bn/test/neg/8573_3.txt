I thought this movie was completely different than just another teen slashher. Well I was totally wrong. A liquid salt is coming out of the toilet seat and there is something really weird. I know that the Spanish culture was a little different and they had movies, but I was not expected to see a fake Hollywood movie. They of course faked it quite well though. Why did they create a movie without any new direction? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, turned it turned into a tin slasher. If it was done ten years ago, it could have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend anyone in this movie, but there are some comedy values! It's like a horror parody on some points.
