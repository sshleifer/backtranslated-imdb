I went into this choice firm in this movie. I usually enjoy the plays of Wall Street, Glenn Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. ... I went to the movie that I was on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big passino fan. <br /> <br /> What a piece of garbage Perhaps in five years I probably saw the worst movie. It's actually a disappointment of passino on Sunday given a good look. First, half the movie Matthew McConnew lift the weight. OK, we get it. You are matte in shape. You do not have to see all our other scenes with iron, shirtless pumping. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what is the plot of this film? Why not introduce the phone call to Brandon's long lost parents and address it again? Her mother was hanging over her - why did she not say that she sent him too much money - what did that mean? Puerto Rico has lost 30 million people? Also, since sports satellites are illegal in NY, and admittedly as illegal, how can they finally bet on everyone? <br /> <br /> It was simply a very weak written script. It was possible, but it was up to a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his text about script selection after a given Sunday, but apparently not. My lord, this same actor played Godfather! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
