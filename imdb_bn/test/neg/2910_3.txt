After the Second World War, Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids", attacks Japan on US forces: Leo Georgie (as Magas), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Hunts Hall (Glammy), David Georgie (as PV), Ernest Morrison ( As Scroo), and Bobby Stone (as skinny) want to serve their country. However, both the U.S. military and the navy rejected them at a very early age. Still want to "stop nearly one million japa", "boys" attack an Asian clerk who is going to be Chinese. As a result of the unfortunate incident, some really painful Japanese and German leaders lead the gang to help release them. <br /> <br /> If "very young" is defined as "less than twenty-one", only Mr. Jordan and Mr. The stone will be canceled for military service. However, the prospective employer was stopped by the behavior of the office displayed by Georgie and Mr. Hall. "Come on, be strong!" The script was correctly described as "open season in japa" - it was not very good for this and other reasons. This is a spoiled attempt, but takes place abomly regularly, moving stories along with Tom Brown's Jordanian spy's brother, <br /> <br /> *** Get stuck!
