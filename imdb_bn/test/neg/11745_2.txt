* Some potential spoilers * <br /> <br /> This picture of course can not be as well as expected, remakes are rarely. However, this reunion of Hitcoak's greatest film, Psycho, could be better. <br /> <br /> First of all, anyone who shot this movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince van Norman bat! Where are they thinking? Like "harmful", often a little bit that was able to portray Anthony Parkins, Vaughn looks like he might be a killer. Try to think that his betts are innocent, Vaughn ending gay acting. Many other actors, Judyien Moore, do not even feel fit in his measurement, who do not feel right in the film. <br /> <br /> Above the shocking casting, the cinematography is apparently snail, though they do not even have to recreate the film scene for the scene. One thing they added was the random shot of the object as a cloud or a naked woman, in character killings shot. These shots seem to be irrelevant to plot anyway, and there is no knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this psycho remake, which can be a beautiful picture, can instead be a complete waste of time.
