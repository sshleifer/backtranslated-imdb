I like this move when I was young, but now that I grew up I can see how strange the plot really is. If you did not read the previous review, it was a teenager and an army officer who knew about the colonel who stole two completely loaded F-16s to rescue the teenager's father. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent wind stunts in it, even if techno-bubble is basically with dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some funny humor edited for the TV version. When the father of the protagonist comes by Iran, misunderstanding means I am an unnamed country, and his prisoner will accept him (why he is being held, why not worry about him, or they want to confuse him.) He says, Tell him he can accept my confession and throw him under his throat. " But with his lips and more importable, his gesture makes the part of motion and posture clear, he was really thinking.
