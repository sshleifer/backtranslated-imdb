Concept: In Fairfax district of LA, 4 family members of different castes have shown to be assembled at Thanksgiving for the family. I liked the Saule Food and how to make American rattles (I think Alfred Wudder should be in these movies), as well as giving a palette of family tradition and preparing for a treatment. Instead, I felt cheated. They find around 40+ characters, and the other two are one-note clips with a character. Authors and directors must spend more time in life and learn how loving people of different generations are related. Instead, you have a ** hole in a ** hole with turkey days being together extra-insulting ** ** Work like holes. Now, all of a few thanks to Thanksgiving. But, this is not confusing. And why Julian M. has been bothered to stay Marguiles, then give her absolutely nothing. It was a rare event to go through, and Mercedes Roulele is a standout, but I can give it a 4/10.
