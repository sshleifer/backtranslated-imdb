If I could give this picture 0/10, and this first film I wanted to lose so little. Its worse than terrible. If I went to see it in the movie then I have to pay to see the movie (at least the minimum wage). Some camera shots were quite effective, but many were such examples of garbage. Villain reflection is a mirror that separates his head and shoulders from his body (seeing is believed). Most of the innocent civilians are in vain killings 2 I was shot dead because of murder, because of the victim's facial expressions / face I had to laugh loudly. I have only seen it in the end (it is about 10 minutes faster than the annoying dialogue). Hopefully some good hands will have to see Seagull for war, but none of them was there (should know that at the beginning, when someone threw someone down a lift, Music is shown gradually with - the end of 'action' scene). In one scene we can see that the Sigal hands slid somebody's neck at a slow pace, which makes it clear that his hand has never communicated). The main villain keeps coming back to life. He got 2 separate shows shot in the chest. For the first time, it is a shotgun that shoots him from the 2nd / 3rd floor on the street. The sum up, total waste of time during this film and total joke. It shows a very low budget (even for Seagal). Color dust and gray. I could go any further ... just like this picture, but I do not like it. See this film if you've got insomnia. It's sure to make you sleep.
