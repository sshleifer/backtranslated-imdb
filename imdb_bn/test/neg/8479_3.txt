This movie is not suitable for the theater to watch, I did and I do not like it, the effects of the movie have been really good and you smile here and there, but the story is really bad. Looks like they have left the idea, and what's going on with Lucky and Aden? That nurse completely destroys the myth, and I guess that the people's power only worked at night! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> wanted to do a movie to show cool animations and effects
