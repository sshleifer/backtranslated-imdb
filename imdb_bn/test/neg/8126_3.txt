Royalty television crew has allowed a small town hike school hockey team to enter into a black mask and hoodie serial killer. Many interviews where crew members (and most of the local films in White Plain city where the film is set up) talk to each other about the camera, they can be seen in White Plain city, their interviews are in the present situation, and the showbiz side of their lives. The screenplay is often acidic, playful, and the Kustyk and Keller movie mainly makes fun of reality television shows, which combines a cast of characters found in real world. If this plot is interesting to you, ruin yourself. I found the letters tedious and irate old hat. Outside Caste, director Paul Wesley, who was a big break director, probably for Jack Tanner, had faced more than the court, he was an excellent guy, he considered the first Donace, and the unincorporated people in his entourage who often do nothing without migraines. Particularly annoying is his producer Lee (Sia Batten), a resistant who constantly orders everyone, his poisonous attitude creates a lot of excitement. The kind of producer who used to cover the hockey team wants to capitalize the blast in a small town with the murderer. A story in front of the tragedy used in White Plains. Known to Kelly Cuco, who knows that she has perfected the sticky princess so far, it has become a pattern because it is the only role that we have seen her most of the time. As Blanka, she is constantly stopping her attention, her little celebrity status has been breastfed, she has created many friction as a source of frustration, and she has a lot of faces (the cookie can also take part, so she can move away from her normal television sitcom role May, without restriction, maintain stupidity) Cuoco, along with the entire cast, Service as a movie id candy, but it is hard to find a character, which you do not want to see in pieces with the cutter. Jason London sound / equipment guy, a real trembling with a sticky attitude, is often tormenting with torment for others that remarks his foul. We are witness to many personality clashes, how these self-absorbed Hollywood types can be sniped to each other. The murderer's identity should not be a surprise, it is quite obviously obvious. Some minor boards, but most of the violence shoots off the screen. Despite some joke about homosexuality, even this is not satisfied. Leighton Meester pops up the film as a tricky victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher has played quite interesting, but I can not make a difference from the number of slashers collected during the last ten years of the scram and I have collected tremendous observations. Although I did not like any character in Kaouko, I was never tired of looking at him, but at the end he would have to come up with a role that would not be associated with his progress, always with shouting arrogance, always shouting and complaining.
