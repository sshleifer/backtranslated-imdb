This is not a strange, weird movie and a better sign than David Lynch! Special effects are made badly, the actors are mainly bad actors, and in this film it is not about a nation that tries to fight against the minorities and predominantly of a planet, but it seems to be an insane film that reveals the organization's organization. Surely Frank Herbert's desire, the author of six epics! See David Lynch's one, it's the perfect respect for novels!
