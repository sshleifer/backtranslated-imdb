I did not have a classic hope, but at least a funny picture. There were only a few scenes that let you laugh but nothing else. You are not afraid to fill the American teen-slash clutch and you can easily guess what can happen. <br /> <br /> But it says a lot about a senior student of Turkish high school. Student Selection Test Pressure (OSS) tests in 3 hours determines that you will go to a university and do not worry about exams when you have a ghost after you. The movie is bad. Do not waste your time to see it.
