... please go ahead now because it's falling on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, "My own personal idaho" and "To die for for" (and others did not have such a bright movie, meaning unnecessary "Psycho" remake) started a test phase with "Gary" "Elephant" reached its peak with The "last day" had some interesting aspects but was very incompetent, when his new movie "Paranoid Park", started walking toward people over 15 ... and nothing else. Elegant cinematography is highlighted by some cool references by Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and legendary Christopher Doyle ("In Mood for Love"), but the movie itself is very artsy-fartsy and meaningless destruction of the movie itself. We've been coming up with many great age stories, and "Paranoid Park" is nothing new to come. I do not see artwork about watching Gabe Nevins excessive shots in his underwear or shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen ("little girl from Hah Greenchurch theft Christmas"), who plays her cheerleading girlfriend, is sex for the first time, because she felt that they should have done it and they were 'done' later , She is telling her friend how amazing it was (and you can say how frustrating it is from Navin's face). Everyone knows that they are starting on earlier and earlier days, such as "thirteen" and even "elephant" films (which shows how their minds are lost in general, not just sex) made a good illustration of it. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the final results are just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biology about SunPen actor Harvey Milk, is expected to bring a good old gauze, because, frankly, this passion is almost ... unclear about young children. 4.5 / 10
