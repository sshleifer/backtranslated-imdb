What can be said about such a kind of kinda movie? <br /> <br /> - Acting very bad! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear weaknesses mix. Like a poorly beaten dog ... Another actress (who played bad), Ozzi Ossouro's female double, terrible red wig. Other actors are so cruel that they are not even valuable to be described. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with the possibilities but does not go anywhere: We do not know anything about the meaning of "11:11", and who really is not really Raiden in addition to "he is evil" or "he is the son of the Apocalypse"? ... not an explanation. We do not know why the father is dead, what kind of danger is increasing and why the Sarah was elected. The film continues, we only see pseudo-scary scenes with a bad music. Moreover, the last is not saying anything: We see only two possibilities that one of them was a bonus scene or a director's cut ... there is no plot, so there is no possible explanation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" Only clichés are full! It is so obvious that I could not help laughing. For example: Deporting libraries or bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with an explosion of air ... even have a fashionable "little scary girl" as "dark water" or "ring". Of course, the main character is confiscated in school and it seems like a stereototed Gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black cloth). Is it an obligation to make its credible? I do not think so. Sara's psychology is so low-developed and so common that it makes her believable, not respectful. <br /> <br /> - Horrible aspects: As I said, nothing is real, everything has already been seen thousands of times and is used here without any real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some interesting inconsistencies. উদাহরণস্বরূপ, আমি জানি না যে "ভূত বিজ্ঞান", "অস্বাভাবিক কোর্স" বা আমেরিকান বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে যাই হোক না কেন যা শেখানো হচ্ছে ... ইউরোপে এটি আসলেই নয়: শিক্ষকগণ নেতিবাচক শক্তি সম্পর্কে বা "অণুগত প্রাণী" সেন্সর ব্যবহার করে কথা বলছেন। Ridiculous Also: How can you see the movie shot in the 60's with the super-8 camera on the computer screen while spending time for digitalization (in the movie they see it on the computer screen immediately) and how do you cut this old picture, a tiny description then zoomed in and a perfectly See the identifiable face? If the director ever tried to digitize an old similar movie, I would be surprised ... <br /> <br /> Finally, "11:11" if you want to smile in silly movies, or if you want to sleep on your couch. .. but it is an expensive way to fall asleep!
