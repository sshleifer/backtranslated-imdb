Lenny Riefenstahl tries to call "ridiculous" to be embarrassed by annoying publicity. This movie and Moore's other obstacles actually attracted viewers to prove that it is always possible to fool some people. <br /> <br /> Let's see how we can ridicule foreigners. Let's see if we can extol outdoors factory. Let's see if we can add hatred to the world. Let's see if we're funny. Let's see if we can do separatist Charles Lindbergh. Moore's lack of comparison to London is only a medal from Gourong. <br /> <br /> Sure, there was some surrender to Moore's study in this movie. In this movie, Moore recognized Roger Smith, chief executive of General Character, as disrespectful, lazy. Moore could have done it in 1989, but now Murray has surrendered herself to isolate herself, this character of Roger Smith has a satirical twinge. Who is Roger's friend than Michael Moore?
