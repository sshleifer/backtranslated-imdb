Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of comics (but if comics are similar to the same "quality" movie then it's hard to believe it), but it should be one of the worst movies ever made. Unconstitutional plot, ridiculous acting, silly dialogue ... This movie is so bad that it hurts. Many Some people actually gave it a shame. 10 Insult of a good or at least middle (or at worst) movie. If you hate yourself, then see tank girl! In another thought, if you hate yourself than yourself, you must commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
