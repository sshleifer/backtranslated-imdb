When I was young, I did not see cartoons to rise every Saturday morning, but to go to launch a local channel called 'Kung Fu Theater'. These pictures were not like artwork. It was not that these films came from China, Japan, Korea, or especially from any country; If you have to fight with the story ?? Is it to be the sword or the fisticuffs ?? And if the war was not like what was going on in an American gym class, it was good enough. It was not as they really did not really really have. They were incredibly impressed with over-dramatic music where the hero took his revenge on the whole world and then the credits would roll. <br /> <br /> "Lunar Sword" Many choices of these films, controversially, welcome a bit of a theatrical thrack with drugs into narcotics so that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys better. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is a 'human Butcher' known throughout the state. He was killed fast and brutally for the Chun Dynasty, who was the chief bodyguard of a emperor who saved his life and lives instead of his service. However, it is equally cruel to see the rebels and their lovely neighboring villages and the empire starts killing the ministers, and Yun agrees to find out the rebels and kill them. His work became one of the personal inventions when he came to know that two rebel Cheyi (a friend from his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Sorry, "the sword" is nothing to differentiate itself from other action movies. Some stunning cinematography is often damaged in editing similar to the parts of the film, which firmly believes that it must have been made for a movie that was created for any purpose. Although the atmosphere and the story attract attention to a dark mood, the voice is often not offered in the flashbacks of the ending parade, because each major character is given a picture of a healthy story. What a quick and easy action film should have had to lose weight by very much personal accessories, and the resulting in the film is suffering. <br /> <br /> I like reading this picture that marks the first real war of Korea, the art-house action piece loves the world "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The next time, I strongly recommend that the producer is a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art'.
