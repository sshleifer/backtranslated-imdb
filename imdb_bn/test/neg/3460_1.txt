Let me do this campaign by going to the record, I'm the great father of George Clooney fan, and I love John Crashinsky at the office. Well, I was and I did. <br /> <br /> It was the world's worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to close it. During my reading and frequent reading of my watch, my frequent effort only stuttering wasted. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was in preview. Three of them. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just plain bad. I had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The title SuperDuper was bad. This movie is a lock for a RAजी. It will get a full slap of Razzies. I want my money back.
