When you first sit down to watch this movie, remember that you are going to see something that you might not have seen before. Keep in mind that this is a film where they are definitely not enough money to cash in on the explosion and it is not enough for acting or anything else. The crazy thing I noticed is that each character is fully illustrated and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the movie has 'sped up' to make the characters faster! (I'm wondering if the Hong Kong version was dubbed?) I understand that the cartoon was this, but it does not work for live-action. It looks weird ... like the camera crew decided to work because they can not afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is dubbed heavily, and the character's words do not match the face. I liked the subtitles, but it's a children's movie, and since some kids do not read well, I'll leave it. But there is something very strange about this movie. It's supposedly a children's film, but there's plenty of stuff about SEX, RAPE and Stripping, which is not good for young Western viewers. (In Orient, different laws and sexuality in their children's films are more acceptable). But be careful parents There is a scene where two letters talk about rape, many scenes where people say 'sex pot' and a scene where this very young Japanese girl gives a sexy dance for 'sex worker' and shows her breasts! <br /> <br /> <br /> Who made this image <br /> <br /> Oh, and special effects are ridiculous. You can say something like a spaceship in which the village bomb explosion (or animation, I was not sure) can even think of even a child as inconsistent. The makers of this movie dropped several cool items from the cartoon, only they could not budget in their budget required. I did not like how all the letter names were changed ... It surprised me if this movie was made by the same people as the Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I have not really recommed this movie on anyone. Kids, adults, or Dragon Ball Z fans. This is just a poor representation of cartoons, and obviously, someone can say that this movie has been thrown out and there is no care about it. I will not go to camaraware ... still wait till the last minute of the photo that is sitting there for 2 minutes ... most of the shots are not made properly and the movie is made only by amateurers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
