Two little girls strike a friendship One another he tried to satisfy a witch. The other will push the push of one who wicks the wishes of the witch. The film was reduced to uninterrupted interaction between film and two little girls, because of the many dramatic cuts they released "threatening" questions. You know, kind of sweet little kids should not ask, for example, "How do you deal with Satan?" Oops ... unclear. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, Her friend is a witch that leads her to a sad ending. But when the time comes, you do not care at least. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this film was terrified of the greatness of the Mexican film in the 1960's, an impressive remnant. It just drags on. It's annoying. It's in vain. Do not see it. There are many people who have a lot of good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other work, and, of course, about the unmistakable film about each of the common words: "Ah, cinematography is wonderful!" Those critics probably have a point. But those who find this film without any prior knowledge, do not care about their "photography," his "atmosphere" or his ... whatever - for the audience, who are just a * good * movie, which they will enjoy for one and a half hours Do it, help yourself, people: <br /> <br /> Leave it.
