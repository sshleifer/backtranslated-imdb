This movie was quite a mess. There really is nothing going on for it. Bobby Phillips's Maya was the only character and that too was not worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With some very double double cross in any sense. Sometimes in this case it "keeps you guessing" in this case it "keeps you waiting". In the end I just wanted to throw everyone in jail or shot.
