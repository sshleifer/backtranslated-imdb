I really tried to give this picture an opportunity, but when I realized that most of the movies are roaming around mostly annoying officials and talking on phones, I knew it was over. This film looked like many stock footage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> It bothered me a lot but I was wondering why they thought it was a good idea. It does not add anything to a static view of two people. It's not NYPD Blue or some police show or anything. <br /> <br /> How could they not understand that the conference room people talk about this story, what else is not? They did not see this mess? However, this was a really annoying movie and it does not understand the good story of the film that it seems to have made it. <br /> <br /> Darn Stock Footage ... It's Wrong
