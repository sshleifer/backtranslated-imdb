I'm not surprised that many people for this one. When I was watching this movie, some of my visitors who were beside me felt "guessed" - or at least "touch" to be "convinced". Like when hunting said that he did not love the girl. When the character of Robin Williams (sorry I forgot the name of his role), repeated hunting says "it is not your fault" (Oh Lord, thinking only about that scene gave me a hunk). I may not care less for the characters to happen. Many people can not be related to Hollywood characters (Titanic thinks! Yuk!) ... but it really bothers me and wants to get out of the theater. I think I refuse to be psychologically and mentally impressed by all of these. <br /> <br /> Folks are not silent about it ... those letters, and because of any good reason they are untrue. Still bad, nothing new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is also the most beautiful. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not bad; It's just quite middle ... but many people go to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I will not hit a single balance vote.
