After writing this review it is difficult to think of what I should write. Nothing will happen in this film. The story is a South Asian woman who falls for an English londar. The problem was that he and his friends had a racist streak. At the same time, his friend's work is unknown to his brother, and he goes away. The problem is that this movie is very much expected. As soon as all this stuff happened it all pretty much value. It drags just a little 90 minutes long. This is a chic flick more than anything else. So if you are a male, I do not recommend this picture.
