There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I can not begin to understand it. <br /> <br /> The general matter is, with plot holes. Early temptations and expected many leave, but do not keep it, and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and stupid. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility. This movie claims that the film is violent, violent, adventurous and scary, violent girls who have seen nightmares after seeing CSI because it is far from here. <br /> <br /> So I warn you, do not try to watch the clock. If you have any intelligence, because you will be frustrated. May be a true bore and a median film.
