I usually love French movies on Americans, with explosions and driving, but this film was very frustrating. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing happens. These French couples are living in Lisbon for years, and they return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend that they are going to make a dinner which they are going to split. Then nothing happens, they do not think whether they want to be separated or not. I did not think that their hesitation was made for bad films, it was very confused before making a decision to do well, but it can be treated in an interesting way, but it can not be done for their desire and their relationship. Why is it uncertain why you want to split it together or split out of a theater? The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk. It was the truth of life.
