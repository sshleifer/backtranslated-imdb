When I was a child in the middle of the 80th minute I saw this movie again. We could not even get all the way through it. Dialogue, acting, everything about it was just outside of LAM. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... Imagine this dramatic drama, like acting method: "Oregon? You are going to Oregon <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For his 16th birthday party, so our friends can almost laugh and laugh and I do not think we could finish it!
