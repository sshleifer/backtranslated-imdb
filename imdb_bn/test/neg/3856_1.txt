There is a mysterious knack for finding mine and me - a terrific! - Bad movie choice I recommend 'Pest.' At that time I was aware of the taste of the film, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly straightforward as the "Manhattan" theme will make any 6th grade English textbook, fun under the right conditions - good actor, writer, director, dress , Etc. etc. almost end up. Clearly missing these reasons. <br /> <br /> 'Pest' is considered funny, I think. I say "Imagine" because I have nothing but little smile throughout the whole film. Not a gulf, not a smile, not a shiny, even a nap. A smile, good And rarely happened to see this picture, I also remembered how often I laugh - maybe 3 or 4 times good. <br /> <br /> So please infinite yourself. This movie will never be seen. To avoid all costs.
