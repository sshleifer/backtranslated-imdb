This show is quite beautiful and fun to watch, it shows a great Disney Channel and sometimes entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season but hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed. In the first season it was more about science and animal, which has now gone to season and third season. More about her life and dating. That came with gay baby (Ben), since this show was sucked. The authors took a perfectly good kid show and it changed to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse. I can not stand watching new episodes, they're all garbage.
