Outline of Cover Art and Story To give another indication of Indian production of Bollywood, be cautious: In this tired story of the wedding of British Indian culture, there is no musical dance number or song of production value to brighten up the mood. Diversity has spread. As Rupesh Pachar's writing, this script takes up the topic of appropriate discussion for discussions on regular negotiation strategies. Hormaz Singh Kailarai refers to a traffic police, which is trying to unify the isolated hawks with keystone cop techniques. <br /> <br /> Jimmy (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and he is Jack's fat, alcoholic, loose moral character, Vanessa (Sally Bank) and Sally's Throat Hanna (Katy Clayton ) Live with it. Visiting Jimmy's family in the Patel family of Delhi, who brought her beautiful daughter Simran (Zindar Mahal) to England to find her husband. The decision of Jimmy's parents (Saeed Jafri and Jamila Massey) and her grandmother (Johra Sehgal) to marry Simran without consultation with Jimmy and to arrange marriage and marriage in Indian way. Jimmy discovers this plot and does not go along with it too, a decision that burns Jack and displeases Vanessa. Hannah laughed at Simran saying she was "a little liar" (she was Jimmy's daughter) and the marriage was closed. When Jimmy's parents went to Jimmy's house, they discovered the drunk vanes, they were rejected by them, but ultimately decided that they gave Vanessa their "granddaughter" to Jimmy's happiness and decided to marry as a wedding preparatory. Jimmy and Vince Jimmy convinced Venice too reluctant to take this idea, and long ago Venice was dressed in a sari, ready for a wedding, and Jimmy was afraid of what he was doing to please his parents, in which Jack is included as his best personality. The truth comes out in marriage and as soon as Jimmy is surprised, his family receives the true spirit of Jimmy, and he is truly saved. The kittens have been torn apart by the disguise of this cruelty: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash play well with interesting people and their role, although without any indication of any loving relationship (the director threatens to show at least the intermittent advice of two men. ); Sally provides most of the humor like Banknace Vanessa; The rest also played the role of stereotype in countless times in Indian cinematography. This is not a bad movie - it has moments - but it's just a lot of worship and tired of caring for our characters.
