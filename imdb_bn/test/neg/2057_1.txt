This movie is probably one of the 3 worst movies created in history. Without reading this review, rent this by chance, and wow, I'm sorry for it. There really is no plot, really do not follow the section of the vampire. Just terrible God is terrible. To watch this movie, your enthusiasm for vampire films will be drawn. I think the writer / director / producer went on this drug seed and was illusory and tried to resurrect it in the film. The whole time I wanted to finish the movie ... but the end was even more terrible. <br /> <br /> If this review can save only a person to see this background, then I feel like spending time in my registration and it was good to write this review.
