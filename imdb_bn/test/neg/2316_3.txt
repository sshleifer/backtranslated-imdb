"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDB allows one-word reviews, then it will be mine. This film was originally meant for kids only, and it seems difficult to watch movies for adult or adult kids. Singing, story, everything is soft and washed - just like printing this public domain Like other comedy team films, this film has limited the appeal and is not good at the age of traditional children's stories (such as the dreaded Snow White and like the three kids in the stog and toilet). Now I am thinking about it, I seriously doubt that many kids will enjoy this movie nowadays! So my suggestion is not to see this film. If you see Abbott and Costello films, then it will be an improvement in addition to one of their movies (A & C Go to Mars).
