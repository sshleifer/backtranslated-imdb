Catherine Hepburn is not seen in any scene or seen in any way through her first movie career, and at that level the movie is fun, but she is a terrible mistake as Hill Billy. His famous New England signal was a sudden, "I grew taller like a cat". She is so beautiful and so young ?? It almost exceeds this major error. The story is an old adapted melody, and there may be a great generation of this fantastic element, but it was the mainstay of American entertainment in the 1940s. It's a moment, but you have to be a rust-film buff to appreciate it.
