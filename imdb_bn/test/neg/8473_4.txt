"I remember waiting for my birth ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision Quest for the American West". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This place is violent. <br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Beckett) and her husband left New York quarrels and storm and culture decades ago and died. The Valley has moved to a deified city with 10 populations. There, they renew a theater - painting it is a very frequent / folk art method. And, once finished, she actually performs dance for no one dance. In many ways, it is a Warner Memorial film FITZCARRALDO or a dream field - although Amagona is a documentary of a real man - legendary mad people like Claus Kinski or Kevin Coster. Her husband finally leaves - mostly because of her favorite lifestyle. So, today she lives with her ten cats and her new male companion Tom as well as a refuge for burros. <br /> <br /> Depending on your point of view what you think about this documentary. If you open New Age ideas and this sensitivity, you will probably appreciate the film. His speech about how he is talking about his birth, ghosts, outlook and psychology has evidently made my psychic teacher cringe and it must be for many people. In addition, his burrow will try to save the horse in the wildlife and the desert, probably appeal to PTA and other animals lovers, although with my background of environmental concerns and biology, I will destroy the natives that see the burros and horses as a blight plant and animal. So in two different accounts, I think the opposite of Marta - who is more of a "sensible" and "sensing" person. Depending on how you feel about all these things, your opinions will definitely color - and I'm sure that most people will think they are a talent or nut! Despite all this, the picture is striking and Marta's life is not neutral - especially in recent years, people have actually started their journey to travel. See her perform in the desert. There is a certain following for her and her unusual little world. Although I'm not nearly as positive as most reviews, but I can not be negative as a review, because this extraordinary documentary has specific qualifications. I like movies about extraordinary people and Marta is unusual! I appreciate the love of his art and happy life - it's a rare gift <br /> <br /> I teach psychology in an arts school and it will certainly be interesting to show it to the staff - where I am sure that we can get a strong positive and negative response - perhaps on whether the teachers teach arts classes or core curriculum. Depends on! It must be interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when it was working with Marta's husband, who was it? At the end, they did not live anywhere and I was wondering where they would find partners. <br /> <br /> If you want to see his / her acting and / or stay with him, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is quite reasonable as in English, French and German and hotel rates are similar to ticket prices.
