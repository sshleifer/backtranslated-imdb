Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and he's really rich. He congratulated Demi, and because of being a gambler player, he was "obscene" to the couple: one million dollars with a little girl for a night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of the film you can keep a description of your sleep together. Of course, Demi is going to accept. If he does not have the first half of the movie. Of course it will affect Demi and Woodie's marriage. If the second half of the movie is not there. And of course everything will turn out well by the credit roll. If it is not there then there is no end to box office. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the rest of the ... the script is incompetent, directional, performance is insignificant. I suspect Redford, Moore, and Harleyson and change the subject each time while mentioning the movie. Make them - and more importantly yourself - a favor. If someone does not give you one million proposals ... Miss Miss! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, Ur GFT, Amazon Reviewer
