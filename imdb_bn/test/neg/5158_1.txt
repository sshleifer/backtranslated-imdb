The worst movie ever !! Its tricky or funny or thought-provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best work with a scary script. <br /> <br /> The acting was so bad that you can breathe dead people. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer / director combination believed Quintin Tarantino or something (you still do not know anything cool about a movie) but sadly failed. <br /> <br /> I hope writers never make another movie !! Not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and go back to the bathroom attendant or whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A painful 84 minutes.
