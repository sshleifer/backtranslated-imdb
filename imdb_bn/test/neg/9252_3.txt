'The Match on the Flowers' is one of Marie Anne Evans' short novels, who wrote under the nickname George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but unable to finish it. I will completely review the version of this movie on my own, because I do not know how faithful it is by following the real novel. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < (On the other hand, in almost half of the film, we see a close-up shot in the advertisement of a handbill advertising ad, which is set in pure Victorian type fonts and * very * firmly believed.) Most of the film depicted the architecture and costume of England in the early 19th century. Very convincing The exact location of this movie was not published, but - the expression of the actors is being judged - I would like to keep it in Koteswalds, perhaps somewhere in Warwickshire. <br /> <br />, two rival families, a wealthy and a working group changed a few million (for several decades) a few hands. I do not agree with other IMDB critics who claim that James Mason has a very small role in this film. Majority is the largest and most central role in this worship, such as the wealthy family. As weak and petulant Tom Tully, Mason is deeply annoying and excited. Here's his performance in a good film: It wants me to see 'Worthington Heights', restoring Heathcliffe with Mashon. <br /> <br /> It is a multi-generation Saga (something that George Eliot has done very well in 'Middle March'), several major roles in the film split into two actors: original actor producers, child actor in adults The suggestion of this film highlights a well-written view, from early age, Tom Tulliver is considered as deliberate and barbarous-ragging, and young Philippe Wechham is honest and thoughtful. Half of the money earned by Philip through hard work: Tom tries to push him away, but he is reluctant to take coins by Buddhist power: he wants to give * Philip to him. All the children of this film are actors, men and women, talented and attractive. Unfortunately, children talk to their conversations in a flute-prone accent, which is not quite different from actors and actors playing the same role as adults. Call attention to the stability of this discrimination object. Sadly, which of the following scenarios is just as good as this suggestion. <br /> <br /> Climax shows the characteristics of the crowd of workers in the rain storm, much better photos and photographs than previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least Britain) can not take this type of material seriously. To date, in reality, every British comedian has been facing the problem of "TA Til", squared "Comedy Routin", is filming this issue properly, so I had difficulty viewing this movie with a direct face. <br /> <br /> Character Actress Martti Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credentials (Old English Typeface) made her first name as 'Mareta'. I'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10: one point for the effectiveness of James Mason, the primary scene with the kids, and the prominent Victorian typing in an auctioneer's handball.
