This is one of the few unreasonable and entertaining entertainers that struggles to make you love them more. But like many others, its material is not strong enough to successfully complete several hours. <br /> <br /> Pitch is committed: Runs a bus through the outback until three drag rounds from Sydney to Alice Springs. They have many problems - with homophobic locals, with engines, with their paste. <br /> <br /> With the real problem dialogue. Leads are fine (though Pierce's continuous camp is tired), but one-fishing equipment and concubines are forced to feel that they will be thrown in somewhere. Letters can not laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Elliott wants to enter the delightful incompatible shots of dazzling drag dresses against the desert retreats as a very cheap make-up. For a movie for self-confidence and like myself, it seems all too insecure with himself.
