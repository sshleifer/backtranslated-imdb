Best wishes to all <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> Do not stop talking about "flatlines" to my friends for a few weeks - Remember I was very impressed with the 18-year old galaxy and since then my taste in the film has become a little more conservative. <br /> <br /> I saw the DVD in the local movie store and wondered how big it looks like, I forgot the movie! OK! I'll close the boy while taking out the special edition. <br /> <br /> Last week, my best friend invited me to watch DVD Flatlines while I was happy. I was hoping that I would love to see this photo more .. I was so wrong! Ray: After 11 years my view of this movie changed from a scary first-class movie <br/> <br /> I was not a big fan of Julia Roberts's acting (besides Irin Brookers, Was eligible) I think the problem lies with the director of this image and a very middle script I feel that this film did not have any real material or feasibility and there were only a few of the awesome cheap thrills that were not done very well. James-Newton's Howard's score may not be liked by me as a film musician, I can be impressive and thrilled. <br /> <br /> In 1990, I used to give this movie 9.5 / 10; But in 2001 I would be lucky, it's 2/10 best. <br /> <br />
