"Get short", "Out of the site", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 pick-up") - people finally get Elmore's rights to Leonard, making good films from his work. So, despite the warning of my student about how bad this film will be, I could not protest to renounce it. I thought, how bad can it be? Oh, what's wrong, especially on the healing of the book, which is related to Lamor's (and very circular self-referential) Elmore Leonard's books. Yet, the book was better than the movie. Leonard again tried to take a weak and uneducated screen-writer for his book. Writing for Steven Tyler was painful to see the dialogue. And Linda Chand's first song song song? Write more about my middle school with more depth Sorry, sad, sad Why does it give a star? Because Harvey Kettel and Uma Thurman are fun to watch on screen, and Andrea 3000 did not fool herself completely.
