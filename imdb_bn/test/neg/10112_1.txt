Hello boys Never rent, or Allah forbidden, buy this piece of garbage. I rarely see a film in a style such as this. Acting is worse than mine and my friends were at the age of 7 and had to work in front of all parents and siblings in class 1. Actually, if we could compare with the actors of Darkhanger, then we took it for the assessment of the Oscars. The story is terrible, terrible makeup, filming is terrible, it's terrible, directions terrible, and so on. Actually I can not find any meaning spent on watching this movie .. Perhaps all the cats, which my girlfriend thought was a beautiful kind. Please, use your money on other things than this movie .... I did not see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was terrible .. If someone really liked this movie, I really want to hear from you, and I will try to see if you can get some advice on a psychotheraver's office near you. <br /> <br /> 10 out, actually if possible below ... do not have DVD or tape value on it ..
