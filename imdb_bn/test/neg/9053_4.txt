Eaten Alive is a small picture that is open in New York City and the Ark, where some of the people throw tribal snake venom, then a woman enters the police force, who is trying to find her sister, which has disappeared after 6 months from Sheila Alabama, But his pronunciation sucks, he seems to want to just want his money to those who are combined with an adventure worker and the whole of the film Seems to many. They only find a community with people and they ventilate through amazon, find sisters. One may face a crazy person, who probably would have promoted many Jim Jones. He will bring them to a better place, but he can stay in heaven, but Mark and Sheela commit suicide after him. <br /> <br> Why do I call Eten Elevow a "little film"? I'm telling you, but when I saw it, I was floating with all the insides of the cannibals, Robert Curman's cannabal hoolocast played a different role than his professor. He's a little annoying, once we've seen it come in an arm wrestling match, like the Russian Roulette, we know it's a tough guy to smile. But the powerful naughty just makes you miserable and it looks like I've seen anywhere, oh killing each other But the whole movie is moving around those scenes, in fact it is an image of nature with parts of a picture, but after seeing this picture, I realized that most of the movie scenes were taken from other cannibal films, even the death of two characters, the better. Call this small picture, when I saw that the scenes were borrowed, I felt like roaming around the house, this is not a simple montage like a movie.
