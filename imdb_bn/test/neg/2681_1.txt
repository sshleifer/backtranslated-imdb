Halloween: I express concern as a concern of Halloween of the Michael Hales of the Micrones myers. <br /> <br /> I think John Carpenter made one of the greatest horror films of that decade in 1978. Despite its flaws, it still keeps well up in the 21st Century. It reused many devices from old horror movies but used them in their original and effective way. There was no other way than a movie about a brain patient escaping from bed on Halloween night, she had no tendency. And still there were 'ideas' in the film, but they were very familiar and did not enter your forehead.
