First off, until this movie is complete, I guess someone is really annoyed to steal every page of the script. <br /> <br /> This movie has seamless time travel without notice, incompatible dialogue, on incorrect transfered details, the music is not bad, otherwise the wrong transfered track, and this exercise goes up and down between different tracks. The cutting house has actually done a reproduction job, and that says a lot. Missed sound effect broke, though <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As the worst, and I've seen few bad ones. Do not spend this one money, smile on it that it is not so bad, it's bad. Rating above 1 star should be rendered in a black list at IMDB, because it is a false lie.
