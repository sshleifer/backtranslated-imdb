Well if this picture was a plot behind but it was good. The title did not fit even after the first ten minutes. The rest of the air was nothing much with the rest of the movie. The acting was sub-par and the article reminds me of something that you can read in a children's horror stories. <br /> <br /> As far as horror movies go, they should not be classified as one. This was an insult to horror and Thriller fans everywhere. I hate to be very strict but I think I want to spend time watching this movie. Hope this will not be a follow up. This movie should be locked in a vault and is not always released for viewing.
