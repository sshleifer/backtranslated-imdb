I think maybe ... maybe it might be good. An elementary look by the re-animator (Jeffrey Combos); Many tributes from old horror movies; Troma label in front ?? This movie can be a gem! I thought I was wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I The story is an old, young people breaking into a house, being drunk, making love, and scattering things that should not be scattered. What is that Recycled slash film formula is used here, this time the actor was named after the Conrad Randazzo murder. Actually, the only freedom fighter of the film, the role of Ferdinand acted in the role of Rodzeph. She makes snooty Dakula style character very well. But for the kids, it's not very good to have a brief part with combs. <br /> <br /> The film lacks the entertainment value, and has only one cool character and one or two scenes that can attract your attention. Do not recommend this movie until you are frustrated to watch and this is the only movie in Blockbuster.
