All the positive reviews of this movie have an underlying current - it's just an intelligent comedy, do not take it seriously. Cilax Dude !!! See the one point that is good. Others will be - why we accept the same illogical people in the exact same script, the same formula and all this "joke". <br /> <br /> What you get is a slower who has to change his life (always he), in a completely irrational situation, must overcome a set of situations that can only show a racoon or a teenager, similarly stupid Beat the bad guy, who wanted to steal the cheek two days ago and stole a slacker but with more money / self esteem. Someone is gross but very irrational. This means that you can call someone after the movie after the movie and you can say "do not believe it." This man drowned in the bucket of diarrhea, another man left after eating the political brownies. Then he shines his shoes with "ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Most common names were introduced: David Spade and Rob Schneider are not a vague shirk, but a character of Crozzy - a Russian and, I hold my sides, a adulterated restaurant Waiter Adam Sandler, the king of idiocy unreasonable, co-produced with a comical comedy, and some talented people do not see the dancer again, to the rest of the world. It is important to mention that this man is famous for Dante, we are stupid, Alan Covert, who played at the age of 36, who got the smile of the night from me. He was looking at the age of 42. <br /> <br /> I am laughing? Yes, But I did not sit on TV and I did not have to pay to see them. Stop making this movie.
