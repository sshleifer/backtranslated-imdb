If a movie is an unimaginable, hackneyed story and vowel characters are really fun, it has to be created for it. If you are funny you can get far away. But Grandma's son has a few fun moments here and there, but they are so far and few that they can not begin to prepare for a lot of movie shows for the hack work. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly does not care to surprise anyone. When Alex hid the marijuana in a grand house in his grandmother's house, you know what is going to happen next and do it. The film seems to have been written by a committee that conducted a study of medieval comedies and used to mark some of the time appearing among them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is its unusual setting. The game will be an interesting source for some cute cute comedy, which is performed in a video game development company. But do not be fooled, it's not a movie about video game developers. It is basically a college frat house movie that has all the embryo boys moved to a big room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The movie completely fails to think about its settings and it seems to be laughing in the original JPJP character, I think by the comedian John Carmack, more or less were imagined. At least inspired that he created a strange talent who made those games. <br /> <br /> In this movie, J. P. A weird, hateful gaique, who thinks the company's game testers as trivial and disgusting. That makes no sense at all. If you are the most notable person in the history of video game (i.e. J.P.), but if you are satirical and objectionable, people will still admire and respect some levels. If Stephen Hawking is objectionable, then his associates are still not going to make him in June. <br /> <br /> Also, testers of the game can be geeks as JP, but they are mainly frat boys in the movie. This is a funny usual guys against the offensive dweebs movie. And the formula that worked, very temporarily, in the past, this is a game company's setting unreasonable. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you will not only combine it from all the settings in the movie. Until you do the hack. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Something happened that I knew that there would be a series of troublesome predictive events. And I realized that I really did not laugh at all for the last half hour. So I stopped (though I had to move fast as I was sure that they were right that they would follow the most anticipated clich√©s, which they did). <br /> <br /> Usually if a movie is bad, then I say it is bad and then not saying, but this movie is an unusually lazy production which is a good fit for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Insignificant nobodies Although I would give 1 point of movie for the chance to be Shirley Jones opposition Sheryli Party.
