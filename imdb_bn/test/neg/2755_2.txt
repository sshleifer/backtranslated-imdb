This movie reminds me of a song from "Kidneys", "Straight Ace". However, unlike this movie, DK's song hero committed suicide. Instead of doing what you did to Boozo, you tried to kill yourself. The whole thing slowly and initially, when you are sympathetic to the hero of the film, he quickly believes in your sympathy. While highlighting multiple films, only drag the movie into the long sequence of showing the hero face. Avoid this if possible.
