The movie is not just worse than this. Awesome plot, awesome time, kind character and effect and yes it's using the "B" quality. <br /> <br /> And for the boy: Nothing, this movie is a terrible deterioration, the couple's scenes which can be great but you do not get anything but build up with no delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie did not appeal to anyone, terrible movie, it was bad; The plot, acting, "B" smell, special effects and everything else. Plus nude or nudity or erotics for girls.
