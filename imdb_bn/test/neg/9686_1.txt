Who wrote the script for this film in Disney Studio? This is the most favorable adaptation to any story! I wanted to laugh at some of the scenes and wanted to cry to others, and it was just how unfortunate it was. I would transfer it to credit, it was some funny scene, but I could spend good time with my evening. Sometime I do not stop a movie through a quarter.
