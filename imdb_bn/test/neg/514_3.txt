Re-intended This low budget action / horror car is made directly into the video to be able to leak things for Don Wilson. The intrigue: Wilson is a ridiculous vampire hunter who is forced to kill lethal killers in the eyes of local law enforcement. The police left him behind, the vampires put him behind, he kicked off ... a lot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> This story is a little more, but it is so impossible that I can not remember the truth; I think people actually talk about movies, but that debate up. There is nothing more than the set up to kill the vampire as much as possible in Wilson's ongoing period. Generally <br /> <br /> The technical terms are the words of anemic. The use of little color treatment, light amateur use, cameras and corners available. Curiosity, blood and gore are significantly limited for this type of film. The most harmful of filming foul-ups, blurred transfers for ultra-shiny cams during each battle scene. If the camera starts to rush like a monkey, then you know that Don is starting to lighten everything. <br /> <br /> Everybody, such bad movies can be made well with a lot of friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, if you do not watch the clock, you do not really want to kick things out. <br /> <br /> 3/10
