I've rented this movie because the video rental shop saw the cover. I saw Nolt, Connie, Madison 40 times, and thought, "Hmm, it can not be very bad." Unfortunately, after seeing this, my impression was "not very good". <br /> <br /> This is a Chittoon Reepoff in China, but the worst part is that the team did not get the other team except Nolt. Enough screen time But I guess once it's a decent movie to see it. And Melanie's role was so small that he was not allowed to get bored.
