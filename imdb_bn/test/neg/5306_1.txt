Last night I was 12:45 AM I saw the show, and I could walk for 20 minutes. But there was no place to go there! Blantant product placement, teenage script, has gone so brilliant, gay-boring ... what did they do? The movie is too long (we found it at 3). A person who rarely pays for movies, lend $ 25 to my husband's self-motivated, money-happy nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). Even today I feel depressed, and I can not shake it all day. I love Vince Von, and he was lost just as straight as this thing. When I'm a recreational high water mark of Sidr (a man is so illusory that he thinks himself "entertainer", he understands what he thinks he is doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorialia is afraid of right, because he died almost one year (March 10). This will give you an idea of ​​how long it has been smooth. This movie means bitter end. We could not give Robert a "flirtation", to make sure we were just what they did not do. Save yourself! Save yourself money! Save your soul!
