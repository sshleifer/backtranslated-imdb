I saw this movie for the first time and I got bored in tears. I was just looking for some flashbacks of the wonderful series that I remember. I saw religiously back Mod Squad television shows in the day and it was fantastic. It was packed with action and the relationship with Greer was loving. There was no one here. When the gueria was killed, you get the idea that these three can take care less. Actor who portrays Pitt is really a good actor, but he was mentally challenged as he wrote. The television series Pitt was calm and serious but was also a fun as well. They played this guy, as if he was a drug, drunk or simply unknown. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you are a fan of TV series. This will be a complete downtown.
