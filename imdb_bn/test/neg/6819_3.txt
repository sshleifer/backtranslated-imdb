Sure this film may have a fun moment with the people of questioning and I know that this film is not considered to be completely credible, the film considers it to be very irrational, for example a girl will never be intelligent at ten million years. The performance of the film was also poor performance of helpless performance. Plots are too bad, at least they could do great work in scripting and gave more attention to the comedy, the comedy was a little dry and after the first few joker became really annoying, then there was a 10-minute smile when the old end would start jumping on the last line If you miss a lack of acting mixed with a stupid plot and want to go ahead and watch this movie in a romance.
