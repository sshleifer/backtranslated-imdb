Ealing Comedies produces their own specific sub-clauses in the history of the film. They were frustrated, reflections on the British life in the late twentieth century and early in the fifties. They are always funny but I think it's confusing to characterize them as ridiculous. They are sunny and good humor, but rather laugh-out-loud fun. However, the best of them hates the unexpected irony and sometimes shoots with dark strokes (especially Caix Hearts and Coronets and The Laddickers). <br /> <br /> All of me have affection for them, but the lavender hill mob is probably the most difficult of my own. Compared to others, it seems somewhat sophisticated. To me, this is an outline sketch for a movie, but before it was ready to go in front of the camera, I had to spend a lot of time developing. <br /> <br /> Everything is a little less about it. For example, nobody is given actual context or background. Henry is simply a neutral trimmer, whose secret dreams and ambiguous ambiguity disappear, when Albert forced the artist to sell his talent by creating a trash of gift shop for the sake of livelihood. It establishes a purpose for their crimes, but what will happen next, is not the result of their character or their plans. <br /> <br /> Although presenting other characters, there is no real part of the story. The elderly resident of Henry's guest house (with his love of the detective story) has made an unknown thorn beside him, but only the background is used as 'color'. Likewise, various police members who go outside and outside the workplace are there to sustain the plot. <br /> <br /> As a result, this film is fully powered by its built-in plot devices, which I find both frustrating and irritating. Despite Albert being barred from participating in the plan, it is rarely done with theft robbery by Sydney Taffler's client. Then smuggled in France without the gold disaster. Suddenly it went away, if it was not for a small hit, the letter was dependent on French pronunciation of 'A', which resulted in the sale of the golden Eiffel Tower in six English schools. <br /> </ br> / Henry and Albert want to restore them to a series of deadly clocks. These scenes have been well implemented, but conspirators at every stage are frustrated in the pursuit of a complete real-time accident. It is as if God intervened deliberately to give them the difficult times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway?) All the shreds of the logical plot are abandoned. The final car is filled only during the screen, until we return to the framing device with which the image starts. <br /> <br /> The movie does not bother to tell us Albert's fate (Stanley Holley), Lakerie (Seed James) and Short (Alpy Bus). <br /> <br /> This genial little copper has the professionalism of the Elghing team, so it is far from a bad movie. I think most of the viewers will be much more enjoyable than me (and why do not they?), But I can not think that much better movie is waiting for the creation, if more time and effort is spent on the flesh <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Credit for its single line Initially, but Archie Duncan has had a much more important contribution Remain anonymous. I guess she was just a good agent.
