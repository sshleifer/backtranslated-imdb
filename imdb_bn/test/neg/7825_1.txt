The trailer is so fraudulent ... I thought it was a good movie ... What was the women to bring to kill women in Hong Kong? They could do it in Paris. And fist half hours: <br /> <br /> - You love me! <br /> <br /> - I do not! - You love me! <br /> <br /> No! -You love me! <br /> <br /> - I do not! Repeat 100 times ... then ... I do not love you ... so I shoot you! D: So here is why a movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine I could pay for this torture! I'm sorry to see the time I've seen ... filmmakers have to give me <br /> <br /> For the inconvenience ... I saw the worst movie ...
