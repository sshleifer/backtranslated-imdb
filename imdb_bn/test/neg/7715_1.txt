I used to work in a video store. I saw this title in a horrible section and brought it home as a free rental one night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really awesome, there is no quality of release on it, because it's actually a well-respected sub-genre film and it just goes about destruction. If the first film is not enough budget, this film actually takes the biscuit, mostly in the house and at night ... so to avoid the cost of setting the first movie, the first 5 minutes of this movie, a college lecturer runs on an interesting ridiculous student. Instead of death, half of the Lecturer apologizes and the girl points out that despite being dragged across the car (she was shining when she contacted him) that she had nothing to worry about ... Then he attacked him with Crobar and killed him! If it is not strange enough, he wants to take a test on him, to bring him back from the dead ... and so feel the need to remove his clothes. <br /> <br /> The soft-core female nudity (and pubic hair) has spread throughout the film and, in fact, the only real thing of interest to the average male viewer ... like swimming scenes in the first film ... but even it says that the film is bad Bad character turns out to be bad with acting, crooked conversations and strange plotting .... Why is a vivid character who survived 29 days to attack the zombie only They're animated in just 10 minutes .... this is a very bad film
