You now know the story of "Swine Todd", perhaps thanks to Tim Burton's recent movie. Although you probably do not know it, this is the old story of Andy Millington, which comes from Al-Adamson and Ted V. Mikelas gave a run for their money. Eventually it will happen. In my years of age 60 to 80 years of intimidation and exploitation, I finally reviewed Andy Millington. From 1964 to 1990, you see, Andy gave us many exploitation and horror films - none of these was good and there was very little monitoring. "Bloodthirsty treats" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There are dialogues and there are good discussions, and here you will find - lots and lots of talk. The film often reaches the "Manaus the Hands of Fat" level, as you look helplessly to happen. Although I love the effect of cheap looking, violence is very low and far, and despite its reputation, the "breast" scene is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> I love the cheap and lazy exploitation of the next trash movie fan, but the "vampire kids" is such a bad thing that will break MST 3 foolishly. Sadly, Milligan will die from AIDS in 1991, and if she has any movie, I would like to say that it is like "The Gestaliouns". It's no "disgusting man" though it's just bad.
