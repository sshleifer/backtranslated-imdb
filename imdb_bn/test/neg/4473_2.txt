Hualieo will not stop making money for a movie, even if they hold down their stereootypes and put them in the most impossible and absurd situations. This is a clear example of this effort and I truly believe in my mind that a movie that is nationally unlawful. The story is Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin), a divorced lawyer who is chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her, she has turned against what she is hoping for. Charlton Morton (Queen Latif) is a fat black woman who did not want to intimidate with Peter, but instead has been convicted of robbery. He'd like to give up for good but he agrees to look at the incident involving his case reluctantly to popping up at an inappropriate time and to save his work. <br /> <br /> ***** SPEAKER STARRED *** ** <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter is with his children and Charlene has been helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin Announced that a man escaped from the prison named Charlton Martan was detained from prison. Peter told him that when the FBI turned around, he saw his old boyfriend and threatened him if he was innocent. <br /> <br /> This image is directed by Adam Shankman, who runs the running things at a great speed and is technically a great movie, but the script is so impossible, and each character is known as a stereotype that is called "Landland" A 1970s film is more explicitly with ethnic relations than this zodiac. I've always been a great fan of Martin and I think he is one of the most gifted people around, but he loves to work continuously and sometimes seems like any script can hand him over. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifa and how Martin's life was running, as he was growing up that he was immediately becoming inseparable. The basic premises that Hollywood uses to make the hip-black person upgrade to upright white and then pass on some road logic that will help them with their lives. Originally this story should be, however, certainly Martin's dress should be blackened and blackened like anime because Hollywood knows that viewers want it. Well, I was very humiliated by everything in this movie and it is because I do not have the sense of humor, but unfortunately (anyway for Hollywood) I use logic and general knowledge when I see the film. Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levi's conversation, but do we really believe that he will attract Latifa? I think the arrogance happened and no main actor shot only to save something in their pocket? Will not a cell phone explode if hit by a bullet? Martin and Latifah are the deadliest deaths of the fan, but I will not recommend this. I know I said it earlier but it is not trying to make a good movie, it is an excuse to try and earn money!
