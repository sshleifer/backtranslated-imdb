I just read Fresith novel 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the deepest, detailed and page-binding books I have ever read, clearly in my top ten. I've got a DVD version of Mr. Swayze performing book. All right, let me first show that a suitable adaptation of the novel can be impossible during film within 2.5 hours, so I understand the reasons for separating from the book's edition and separating the team. However, when I say "different" what I say is "get the letters of the book, add some, leave a few, remove the plot of the book, add a modern new plot, add the name of the Frederick Forrest". I did not have bad pictures on it, far from it, some effects were top notch and the acting half was not bad. The story sucked and did not depend on the argument or reality. Forsyth's novels were so good and real and actually changed the reality to reality instead of them. Has been changed if it has taken its time and more than a 10 part series has been called. If you do not read the book, expect a suitable TV movie with a good acting cast, if you have read the book, try it and forget it.
