The best way to have fun in this movie is to calculate how many reviews it is re-counting. Chinese gangsters graduate A woman vice president A ventilation pulse that could be large enough to fit a large caucasian male. Shooting through bad wall killing wall. A situation where you want some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scene where you find out some memorable landmarks in a fire. Vice President of a well-established room on the coast of the subcontinent, when the premiere of China is almost in the dark room, in the light of the only dark room, as shiny gangster is harmful. The only hero is left alone in a ship (building, aircraft, whatever) with the big automatic weapon, bad guys attack ugly. Etc., etc. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I counted up to 45 people. A President agrees to a meeting at a private ship. Impossible non-overridable commands from the Nuke box. The part where the Chinese decided to shoot shoot. Etc. etc. The world may be more likely to fall in the sun than this movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that this movie was not interesting unless the gangster President of the bad Taiwanese kidnapped. Still Baidam was assaulted. Suspension of suspicion was stopped, and I started thinking about the fun of torturing this image ...
