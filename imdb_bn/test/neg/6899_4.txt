This movie seems to have been very quick together both plots and graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the film, very rarely when we went to the theater. It was a nicolodondone production and if it was released on TV it would have been better. Station In some areas the animation itself was O.K. But the plot was horrible. A classic story of a boy trying to fill his father's expectations is used in many children's movies, but the animation or graphics must be really good for the children to keep their attention. This was not the case with the film. Lead Male Character and Character Female Character also had strange elements that could be done without plots.
