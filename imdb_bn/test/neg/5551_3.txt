I have debated this issue a little bit, why should this rating be given because this is my least favorite, Herschel Gordon Lewis, which is far more than Grrumus Tausosum, but I have seen it in the movie of Lewis. However, we all know that many are not saying. Once the film was completed, I was happy because I felt I was sitting in the 4-hour film, although it was only 82 minutes. I am trying to see all the HGL movies and this is probably the only reason to see it. <br /> <br /> Girl is as good as normal, herschel is right. The acting is just as bad as usual with an exception. That exception is Frank Kress. Now, I will say he is a good actor? No way, but he's better than all others. The story goes boring and flat and goes to the place and the end, I did not care what happened to it eventually happened. I know it's a classical classic but I did not enjoy it very much. I hope you will.
