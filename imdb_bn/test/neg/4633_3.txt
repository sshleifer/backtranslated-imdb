I am not inferior to the 'American Empire's Falling' rating, but less than the average, but not too great. I liked very open conversations from people inside and out very incredibly selfish and ugly. That was probably the most original aspect ?? A dialogue-hungry sexual small film who is too far from the model. Meanwhile, it seems terrible that these French-speaking Canadians have a movie about a neighboring society which, well, when their own actions are 'rejected' their own death. Women friends and male friends ridicule their group of half the movie for their betrayal and recognition of such behavior and the other half "intelligent" to tell how strong they are for their speech and action. The usual character in this general sitcoms is to make fun of the main character mainly occupied by the college professor. Sadly, this is the skill of their "intelligence" or "history" that does not disturb me. It is their arrogance and strong-will-attitude attitude that drives me away and I can not relate to one character or not. When someone cried, I could not bear less notice? It's your bed When one complained, I barely flinched. Let me slap one character, oh, red color. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand this happened to some people, but it was difficult to see. And I sincerely hope he washed his hand because there is no problem going back to him in any trouble. At the opposite end of the nose-up educators, they introduce a stereotypical mind. This made me cringe as nobody looked real; Everyone was as shallow as their smile in society. Unfortunately, there is no other way to root, for you have just left the character of this character.
