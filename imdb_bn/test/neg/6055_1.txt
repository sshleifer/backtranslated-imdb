Paul Telefar, the performer of Hercules in this TV movie, has to be the hottest thing ever to have two legs. Wow <br /> <br /> But this film is 100% distortion of the story of Hercules. Just like "Troy," this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. This is particularly objectionable that they actually maintain the homosexual character, in order to make people hate them, make them terrible or bad just like any character in TV or movie history. Hercules had wife, because it was insulting for three times, since she had an old day's expectations, but she had at least a dozen male lover. So it is ironic that they will make the role of gay royal opponents for this movie. No, not ironic. Evil This instinct Creator should hang their heads in shame.
