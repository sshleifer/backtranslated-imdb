I started by saying how much love TV series is. The class war nature is always going to be a topic of poking fun, but this TV series exploits it best. Chemistry was always power-planting between Utah Jos√© and Brian Marfyi and writers wrote almost entirely defective episodes. According to me, in the late 1970s, the best British city of the middle class was the Rising Dump, which has exceeded Rhine's noste choice, are you serving? And so As Bush's series ends a few years ago, George and Mildred are proud to be followed by the joy of ITV (or it is known now by ITV1), enjoying four years of running the channel. <br /> <br /> Although almost every honor is almost terrible in the movie. The general summary of the TV series is almost completely broken by the writers of this vague film (anyone who does not immediately follow the same thing that works in the series). A commentator has already indicated that Melhedrade lacks his sharpness in his TV series and is not forced to close as close to him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The series was very grounded, in fact, the first half hour later almost completely wrote the forums. Plot, if you can call it, George and Melhedrade are going on vacation in some hotels and meet gangsters. Stratford Johns, Kenneth Kop, David Barry and Surunde Bond's first rate talent are different here. Most of them are out of the morning and they all feel very embarrassed, as they know very well that the hanging thing on one side is a picak (which probably will not be too much). <br /> <br /> Movies and Jogs (if you can call them) are heavily dependent on traditional British First, misunderstandings, embarrassing situations, snapshots of bad times, the controllers of what is happening, their control and general confusion are defeated. And it all fails miserable. Other commentators have indicated that the writer of this film did not see any episode of the TV series, and instead made something like a roaming carrier. The scene of detachment of George by the character of the bonded bond is particularly out of context. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The company, Hammer, behind this film, well-known for creating first-rate horror films in the mid-1950s, soon disappeared. Finally, the film is almost completely washed. My suggestion - Skip this and stick to the TV series. You will not be missing anything, I assure you.
