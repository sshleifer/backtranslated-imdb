It is so bad that I will contribute to the next bad movie party. It is clear from Steve Gutenberg that he took this role seriously. .... other principles were walking through their lines. I think they think about how they roamed and they were going through their speed behind them. San Bean "played" as usual, but until the final scene, it was forbidden to share the screen with any policy, where it was like a walking school at a high school level, which defines inequality. Some actors do look good scruffy. Some actors should not be bulk up for a part. These two statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. His scruffy appearance makes bum and indigent translation and bulking up his bulking up does not make him potato lumpy. Connected with the worst scripted conversations in Hollywood history and you have BAD movies. I can only assume that all the policies really need money for rebuilding, or some or their agents are able to sign them before the script is written by the monkeys to make them. I want to know the story behind this disaster.
