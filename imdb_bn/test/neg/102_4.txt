I certainly saw the preview of this for the start of another Lion's gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best part and looked so sticky. And it's a point, too. A young college student (Sarah) is finding riddles everywhere and being obsessed with their answers, and doing so she is becoming involved in some sport unjustifiably.
