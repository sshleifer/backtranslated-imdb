Ladies and Gentlemen .. Sorry (or be happy!) We are on the hateful forensic TV series- ERA !! Now count with me and ban our fate: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Jordan Crossing", "Photos Vinicha Inquest ", even" The Kosby Mystery "! .. Were we not already happy? <br /> <br /> From the end of the 1990's to the end of the 2000's, almost the same sick series jeans criminal expert has a partner (or a team) who is going to solve the crimes by examining the autistic ... and what a boring Mission. So you'll definitely see lots of lots and many annoying scenes where we clearly, accurately and scary T.V. Seeing the most awesome shot in its history <br /> <br /> Oh God .. once was our great day; Good police (or intelligence) such as Colombo, Kozak, Magnum and Simon and Simon. Or better old Sai-Fi ERA, six million dollar man, The Bachch Wimm, Night Rider. And oh boy, we also got hot and sexy like: cover up, the love boat, the bait, and even a flop as a thunder in the paradise. <br /> <br /> Those who were all unforgettable, real, good. .real good thoughts, action, women .. When the x file comes up .. And then it may start laughing or right: Catastrophe! <br /> <br /> The X file is undoubtedly the greatest one, but there was some difficulty, our agent was Dana Schooli (Medical Doctor and FBI agent) was an autopsy of each episode .. And of course his lap (as a series success) in our living room So the thirsty finance minister's producer loves it with all the physical terrorism + exciting looking for the truth ... so they are each other Trying to classify too much: Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it turned out to be very ugly, full of distortion, and just bonuses like very vowel. Apart from this, the presence of Emily Descenell's oxyase and Blood Donor like David Bernius (he was much better than the angel), and these bodies. The quantity that I saw it, I shouted to hear my husband's voice !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Here it is a bad .. so please .. a little please and enough with the bone-er! .. or we will throw ourselves out of Neosha and Monotony!
