As suggested above, I was finally unimpressed with this movie. It looks beautiful to look, the scenery is pleasing, but the story details, especially the characters are completely incredible. The film does not have to be credible, but with a political edge and social commentary, movies like this. Similarly, there is no problem with commercialism like me, but again, such films will not take complete voting decisions based on the draw of the box office. It is completely the case with Sutherland, who is definitely garbage as the dye. His pronunciation was far from authentic, but he was trapped in the highest maximum, his pronunciation was his performance, and we ended up with the impression of Irish without any personality outside of his nationality. I think it's completely unlikely that anyone involved he was the best man for the job. After all, it is a clear case of commercial interest on quality and when you are trying to do the mission, then such things destroy the potential of success. <br /> <br /> The couple did more to say the pronunciation, the age-old modernity of work, which was done to overcome the feeling of being sent at another time. Paranorma Morton's more acclaimed Irish accent was more surprising, which was variable to say at least. His voice was expected between the north and the soft south of the north, even in the voice-over, where I wanted to highlight such a contrast. In between these small hard motions are motivating and less than. Sarah works. He never lived in English and often went home with his son and his tribe, he knew that the conflict of life and if he lives, it does not seem like an intelligent one. Perhaps a lot has been lost in the editing, maybe it could be a three-hour movie or mini series where these things can go out, but I can only judge what I have seen. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem now is, it is impossible to relate to Sarlan (Marton) on Sutherland. Indeed, until his election between him and his son, his affection is not expressed in any way, the contradiction that he was going through this time was frustratingly ridiculous and killed the film for me. <br /> <br /> As you've guessed. This movie did not work all for me, but the top notch to view it, you will not see anything more spectacular than the visual aspect, some good performance and my wife liked it.
