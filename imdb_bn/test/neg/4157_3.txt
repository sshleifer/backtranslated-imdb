I like to think that I can appreciate a movie which is a bit common, and I certainly love a good movie that makes me feel. <br /> <br /> If you want to get out of the ordinary movie which you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so confusing that only after you finish it you will think how it is possible that you saw it 90 minutes lost your life. <br /> <br /> This type of movie requires a driver to buy a driver. Why are we interested in main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they decide? This film makes very poor efforts to do this and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both are excellent in the ability to be comfortable in any land. So why did they fail here? I firmly feel that they do not know what their purpose was, and when an actor does not know, their listener can not follow. <br /> <br /> I saw macromedia flash videos, at least in the way of anxious thoughts, I showed more interest to the brutal Hamster, who liked the moon to risk this violent family man for "Code 46" violation.
