The film begins with the beginning of spring 2001. A soldier named John Tier (Channing Tutam) falls in love with college student Sabanah Katies (Amanda Sefrid). Within two weeks they became mad in love with each other! (!). But he has to go to war and he must go to college. They however keep in touch with each other's writing. Then 9/11 happens She wants to re-enroll - she wants to stay at home. What will they do <br /> <br /> Violent bad romantic drama. Lovely attractions - handsome people with a beautiful beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he started walking shirtless outside the water after surfing) ... but he could not work. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it and a friend of mine did not fight to laugh aloud from the very first "romantic" dialogue. It was just weird. In the first hour or later I amazed by the frustratingly anticipated drama or amused by the awesome "romance" Then, after that first hour, kicks in tragedy and, I must admit, there was my tears. But filmmakers have to go out of their way to ensure that they are weeping with death, funeral and meeting with tears. How can you cry? If acting was good then this would work. Never change the expression of Tatum's face - not once! She always had a blank look in her face. Seyfried was a little better but not much. To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried did not have any sexual chemistry on the screen! They love each other just like they love each other just like they are. Carolinas had some beautiful photography but this is a boring and stupid romantic "drama". A 1 all the way ... and I usually love this kind of silly romantic drama!
