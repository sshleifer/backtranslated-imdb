Warning ** Speaker ** <br /> <br /> The Lord knows that I saw some bad movies in my time and it makes me angry. It's an insult to those who are looking for a bad movie. The "story" is a lover who discovers her boyfriend (otherwise acting badly by great Robert Wagner) is a murder, thief, and only an entire cruel face. After the condom was closed, he sent missiles directed to destroy the Concord. When Concord is traveling in the light, our "hero" (played with stupidity, George Kennedy) then opened the window in the cockpit, then the missile burned in the fire! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it looks like his hand will burn at least wind. Then the final "climax" when Concord encounters some disaster and everybody dies, a passenger will return to his fianc√© and offer a wedding. A princess will just sit in the next row and earn money to marry them as crashes! (I'm not making it) Wow, the person who wrote the script must have glue for the week.
