I am a huge fan of the enterprise's real crew from eight years old. I have seen all the movies and praised everybody for what they hold from the old series and for the development of more characters (and generally the Star Trek universe). Even in "undemocratic countries" I think the story of the theatrical release was well managed as the characters grew. However, that said, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is the worst of the main crew series. I agree with many that Kirk, Spoke, and McCoy's colleagues are well managed, but the overall script, by the side - by William Shatner - and special effects are not more qualified than a television episode. This is a "friend movie" and, sometimes, almost as illogical as Star Trek. The sequence of action does not last and therefore, to build a little or no tension. Although the conversation is weak, it is available for some laughs, both for purposes and not-intended. Klingon then seems to be thrown out as a thought. The whole "sha-k-ray" concept is just silly and unlawful performer of the movie, Lawrence Lynchbill, any other actor who I have ever seen. The scene where Sybok speaks conjures the pain image and McCay's painting letter shatters the image as we know them. Speak never talk to the party with such foolishness, and McCain is trying to save his father, stuttering conversation and completely destroying Kelly's acting ability. The whole scene is damaged and does not really show us anything new and we do not want to see from these characters. I have understood that Saturn's special effects did not have the luxury of working with ILM, and the film budget was tight, but it did not allow such a bad story. In some cases, I think this story is fitted with the old series, but movies with "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" are much better than the ones. It is a shame that most of the other characters are mostly in this movie, and in most cases this movie is rarely done. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is excellent, but used on the way. The old crew looks really out of character. I like the oldest clanging general of Berlin and the sultry romulan. I liked the idea that I have a half-hearted talk and a half brother, but that's about it. If this was a TV show, I would be able to accept many errors. As a movie, it just created a bad, uninspired film. It's also embarrassing, because I want to make this movie better. Even if it was the "Star Trek III" level I would be happy, but all the other films in this series seem like Shakespeare's works.
