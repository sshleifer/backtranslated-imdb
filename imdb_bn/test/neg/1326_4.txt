Does man give this movie a lot because it's a foreign war movie ??? <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a bad Hollywood movie in Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on many levels. It is also unreasonable to mention it along with platoon or flower metal jacket. The series of war is sad, the dialogues and the acting are uneasy. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "Storm Army" is regularly in Warmat. Not SS soldiers. It is so sad with this movie that it is sad. Bad editing, bad acting. Got it all. <br /> <br /> The movie continues and continues, though the audience is suffering as much as the soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that this film was a $ 20 million budget. <br /> <br /> is real? Where was it spent? Fake train car order? Kind of "special effects"? Ugh <br /> <br /> Buffy of WWII history, and as the fan of WWII film, I turned this movie into a serious frustration. <br /> <br /> Check out "The Best" for a great alternative fight movie. (Not a WWII movie, but still outstanding) <br /> <br /> Do not get bored of this.
