To be honest, I have never read the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3. I can compare with the first part (Warner - Bainhardt) and the part is really frustrating than 1, as well as compared to most of the other movies I saw in the last week. The first minute SIM debut role is only to be an inappropriate clone and then it becomes even worse. There are some good scenes, but at least it is another boring second attempt at the German film industry that can not be successful (almost normal). A good thing: the movie is very short (75 minutes) bad thing: it only contains stories and tricks for 45 minutes;) -> Do not watch it
