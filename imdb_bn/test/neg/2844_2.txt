This was a very short episode of the 1971 "Night Gallery" show. In this episode, starring Suu Lyon (the fame of Lolita film) and Joseph Campanella, who plays a baby sitter and a vampire respectively. The vampire rents a baby sitter to see his child (which seems like any kind of sheep or giant) while going out at night for blood. When the baby sitter first saw her, she completely ignored the look of the vampire and when she noticed that there is no image in her mirror, she began to unite both of them together, there is a strange collection of books in the library, and they hear a strange sound when talking to the child of the vampire. He realized that he might not be the one who hired him, which he originally thought. He bolts outside the door, the enthusiasm coming out of the vampire and the episode ends. I did not know how this brief briefing lasted for 5 minutes. They only extended the episode of the same 5-minute episode and dropped it. Total wasteful effort.
