How nice. As soon as I saw this movie's cover, I wanted to see it immediately because it looked very bad. Sometimes I have seen a Bollywood movie because they are so bad that it will be entertaining (for example, a song sings). The film contained all elements of a tyrannical film: a "local gang gang", which is completely ruthless, a badly accomplished motorcycle scene, horror dialogue ("Congratulations to the boy, I'm so proud of you that you're a bad boy"), the actors say they are good, sad songs Playing basketball as "bad, bad, bad bad boy,"), is like a boy boy and a bad boy friend in the fuzzy plot line ??? And why the hot girl nerd with boyfriend ?? I have never seen such a horrified story as horrible as the direct. Indeed, some 30 seconds of scenes take long, when Good and Bed Boys "gang member" poker game ran unbelievably. Congratulations Ashwin Chowdhury, you are a bad director. If you want to see a good movie, look at the guru, if you want to look so bad to watch a movie that it is actually entertaining, then see good boy, boy.
