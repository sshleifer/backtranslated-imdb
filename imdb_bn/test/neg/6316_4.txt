Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I'm really looking forward to this! <br /> <br /> However, it seems that the film did not have any real idea. Direction or purpose I could not connect most of the characters with it and there was a lack of significant steps that made the other fighter fighter so much better. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good points, the animation is fantastic !!!
