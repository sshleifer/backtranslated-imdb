First tell me that I am not a person who is really bothered to think about movies, for example, I like Tarkoski films, Bergman is also dear ... but this? Positive aspects can easily be summarized: Photography is great, and music is perfect .... Does it make a good movie? I used to think it, but this is a perfect example that does not make it for me. Maybe it's because I'm too stupid? Possible, but I do not think .... For example, Tarakosio used a lot of shots, but what he did not do was to shoot 5 minutes of the same image (and I just want to say their head because this movie has many shots , But sometimes it is effective), general results are obviously annoying, with intelligent practices (that is done when it comes to intelligence , Is all too slowly) <br / <br /> <br /> You always think that some of the long-term aesthetic or symbolic effect, not only for budget .... <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in this movie, because I really like the first 30 minutes, but it was left at the beginning of the same level. <br /> <br /> Very complimentary opinion on this page, I think some people are just trying to watch more in the movie ... when a film is slowly and slowly, it is necessary that it is very deep .... Yes it is a metaphor for a small town musical theory that is quite interesting on itself, but it does not make a deep film. You want to find out some of the most intelligent masturbation, but then you can not find what you have in the movie, but you find yourself ... a practice that can be shown more effectively in my opinion than "Starker" or "Solaris" Werckmeister Hermes , Which is much closer to Tarkoski, but the cab is not equal to its level.
