This movie probably looked like a great idea of ​​pre-generation. "Let's make a movie among the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era, and let's throw Brian Denny as coach Bobby Knight!" Where this movie went terribly wrong. Why act like an actor who does not have a similarity? And then, why does this actor not coach his coach in the knight, but in a red sweater Brian Dennehey? I sat while watching this movie at ESPN, I did not believe in myself that this man is actually a coach night. He did not look like him, spoke like him, does not act like him or even walks like him. I can not find this fact, and thus, I could not enjoy the movie. Paul Newman and Robert Redford were expelled as Bach Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we did not care about the exact historical models of their real characters, because we never heard of these people as we have seen the film. But, as a coach night you need to do better with someone who is visible in today's media. When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Nixon, it was the same situation. However, Anthony Hopkins believed that he was actually Nixon. Dennehey did not even try. What could have been a great movie turned into sour by this. In addition to what the movie "Chiving Private Ryan" tried to do for the four letter word for hijacking, it also included Stank. Very few superstitions for the original coach plays and shock quality, this film has become "season to halve off half way". The only good thing about this is that it was on television movies. I did not have to waste my hard-working money in this piece of trash.
