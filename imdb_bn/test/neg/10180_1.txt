I saw this third movie in a month which I did not expect. The first two are Black Dahlia and Hollywood, of which there is no crime that has committed crimes. <br /> <br /> I was always fascinated with the UFO and was very excited to see a new movie. The subject of the UFO investigation was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it became a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> If I could stand for acting, camera angle, stereotype but there was a good story behind UFOs, but there is no one here. I am not saying anything wrong about the issue, but Netfix pushed the film to the UFO suspect and one UFO believer for multiple citing investigations. <br /> <br /> I have not seen about half way. I could not believe I wasted much time with this one. Please do not make the same mistake.
