Anyone should be thinking of having sequels to the iron eagle. In this case, once was enough. There was a good movie to see the iron eagle. Although it is unrealistic, it's still entertaining. The iron eagle can be used as a stupid plot and insomnia healing. I was not bothered to see the Iron Eagle III, but after rating, I think it is more violent than the last two films. Well, the fourth of the Iron Eagle is probably the maximum inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. is always a delightful "Chappy" return as Sinclair. Another Jason Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who first looked like Jason Gaudrich from the Iron Eagle) came back to fulfill the role. But wait (here comes a potential spoiler) ..... Doug-iron did not kill Eagle II? The authors must have been frustrated for a story, so they revived Doug Masters as the prisoners of Russians. This film was the most economical of all the iron eagles. Why did filmmakers fail to make signals in unreleased movies? (Former police academy film). I always liked Gusette Junior's work in this movie. He was only holding this turkey together. Hope this is the end of the iron eagle cricketer. Give it a rest for peace.
