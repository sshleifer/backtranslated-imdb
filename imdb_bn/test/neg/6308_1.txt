I mean, I was surprised to find positive opinion in this turkey (in the need for a feather transplant)! I'm giving it 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a film about the wild people of Rock'Orol - Jerry Lee Lewis is honored, but it is not embarrassing to get out of such trash and to be "murderer"! There was a great thing late in his career ... They said that Elvis has ruined his career by the movies he gave in the sixth year, and Jerry Lee could do the same thing, it came 15-20 years ago! This is based on the mother's book of Gayle Lewis and it is shameful. It's a bad and wrong story with Lewis and a lot of good books about the killer, which can create many better and more interesting scripts. Add a bunch of actors know that it is not participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! Otherwise, fine actor Dennis Kayad is one of the worst performers of many moon actors! He's walking around the photo, about his "God-given talent" and as a visitor, you want him to show some of it on the screen! Cruel gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee obviously felt betrayal by seeing what happened in this true horror movie! The rest of the crew left almost bad ... Save for Winona Ryder, who works her well with her given crappy line. It is again "Greece" and when Jerry Lee travels around Memphis and carries in his transitable condition, the whole city dances from the music! Cartoon figures of real people involved in everyone in this movie ... San Records Sam Philips from Wild Man! And it's a shame shame! A charismatic and attractive artist like Jerry Lee Lewis has been well-liked and I hope he has received $ 500,000 from this deal and asked himself to go ** ** to the company!
