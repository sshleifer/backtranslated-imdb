<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very unhappy face, very impressive, very serious. At this moment there is a very serious sounding music so that viewers realize that the scene is fun and not about games. <br /> <br /> More entertaining parts of this movie are looking at many. We learn that the women of the Kadosse community perform two duties. As many as possible for their spouses are reproduced as many male children. The second task is to free their husbands from working. What do these men do their free free time? They pray. And we learn that in the house they pray aloud, "I do not thank you for making you a woman." And in the place of worship they pray to give thanks for working for men's genials. <br /> <br /> Aside from praying, there are many intricate (or simple but weird) formal activities mixing with passionate antics, screaming, and continuous bobbing head and body rocking and fourth rocking. <br /> <br /> Coming from the strange comedy cream cream. A hot and annoying man is trying to stop his seedling while lying in bed on the bed in exchange for body fluids in his body with his body! <br /> <br /> Every sexual scene is funny, but that stands when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife (Yael Abecassis) feet. Oh yeah, we are finally entering the land of sex ... but not! Before leaving the foot, it is a bit closed and until the end of the scene, the husband begins to autobilize his autistic looking business and body! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Technically, some interesting imagery and There is delightful use of light and color by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and recreational behavior about being disqualified from the concept of a book becoming an impotent woman, the world is measured by the speed of respect, by which a person can quote an old phrase from the ancient writing, I am Barbara Streisand Recommend YENTL. <br /> <br /> <br />
