At that time, the Helrah franchise could reach his next film, the premiere was a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsay), a scientist in the future who ridiculed the prisoner of the story of his captives (played by all the rams), then first created a bad mock configuration puzzle box which made the world worse and how it was dealing with the box next to his blood pressure. The film lacks consistency in other movies and this film is threatened with lack of compromise. Yes, it is a combination of rewrite, a larger version of the movie's original version or what might be the reason for you. But I'm reviewing the movie, and it was not what it was or it could not be. And now it's a mess. Definitely the franchisee DVD will run indefinitely in the sequel, but it was a mostly death-nail for the possibility of a new release in the theater. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
