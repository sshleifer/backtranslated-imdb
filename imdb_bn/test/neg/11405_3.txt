You can usually ask two questions related to the horror movie of less than 80 budgets. And especially in this 'Demo Wind'. 1. Is this a good film? No .. 2. Is this a fun film ?? You bet! Demo wind is filled with a chronic messy and annoying story, Chess make-up effects and nasty violence. The story is quite unincorporated and includes a group of young people expressing the terrible secret information of one of the ancestors of the clan. Obviously, his grandparents lived around the devil-worshipers, and evil (living in giant and fog) still lived there. But, I was able to put my hand in this picture. Starting from the end, it breathes the brain! Impressive undertones, playful gore and (relatively) moderate acting played together all of this mainstream height, high above the high-precision slashers of 80. It shows some creativity and difficulty (literally), where other productions of this decade are routine and more easily confused. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of 'Evil Dead', and perhaps even Lamberto Bava's' enemies, but what is the hack! It is made with fun and lots of enthusiasm. Though. This film has a pretty high 'key f ***' - the value at times. Especially at the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are being mixed with joy. And what is the story of the magician in those two wanges? Still, 'Demo Wind' is recommended if your choices are not too much about shocking horrors!
