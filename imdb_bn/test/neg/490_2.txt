Firstly, this movie is not a comedy, it's a lot more of a play. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations in the movie, and they still did not come to them. As some reviews out of the other reviews, the movie has some nice music. But if you want to listen to good music, I recommend spending time watching some concert recordings with sister Jovi, or Matley Cruz, it would be more quality time. <br /> <br />, if you want to see this rock'n'roll style is a good movie, I recommend "almost famous".
