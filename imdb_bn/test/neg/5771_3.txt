<br /> <br /> <br /> I think the first project manager could do a good job with this project, and an experienced man like John Bewillar made me to the end. Somehow, the budget allows them to preserve an awkwardness of de-list actors, which they have been annoying for 150 years. Unknown actors were just terrible, low Steve Westel who did a good job like XX. The story is so bad, it really requires no mention. The overall production value seems to be somewhat ideal for the above camera work, if you can create it in God-fearing "Sl-mo" scenes and in the painful "fire blazing" sequence. I knew it would be stupid, I had no idea how stupid, and unfortunately I did not have time to return to me. I think if you really enjoy the bad "B" movie it will work for you, but if you evaluate a story, it's just terrible ... it's a waste of time.
