Ten years after the release of this film, it has not been slightly improved after ten years, and there should be some drama in the middle of Australian filmmakers, as with other comments, rather than in the middle of the ride there were no dialogues surrounding beautiful places in bikes. The middle class is not funny or rich. Cast has a spice pricing. Why a young woman is going to marry an old man like her father, she escaped from me. So shy about this picture, your holiday is a wonderful place. However, I will not be back for an hour and thirty minutes of my life. A short life to watch this movie.
