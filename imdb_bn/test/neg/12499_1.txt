This movie was very bad. It was not even fun. Even the playful scenes were not funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Frustration Incognito, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dunk Dance, Some Wonderful, Soul Man, and Probably The Other Two. At Chris Kattan High School as a janitor, at his worst time a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. She has Chris eyes who goes to a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and places her dancing beautiful blonde stranger. I was really bad acting. I loved the laughing laughter, this one was not the one. "Not Another Teen Movie" was not funny, but was a much more funny scene than a completely unique one. "Scary Movie" is the funny suuuper. I always, when I see those, ridiculous usable. This movie is not funny.
