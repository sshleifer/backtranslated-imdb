When the filmmakers listen to two popular villains / warriors, then they wander around the theater to see how the war will end. Freddy vs. Jason, who is trying to kill each other with two very popular horror icons. And more like Godzilla v. (Enter name here). But very generic Komodo versus Python is just an awesome title, and even a bad compound. Obviously, the film comes with a de-list photo, but comes with a lesser-known name, perhaps something that the audience can make a joke to see it. With a name like this, you know what you're doing. <br /> <br /> A woman with a group of women / women, 20 year old sexy scientist, died in the military. An Island lives in a demon comodo dragon. As long as they can stop it on the island and in the boat, they will be good, but ... no ... there is a huge monster behind the ocean guard and the road closure. I hope these guys can stop the island, and Python and Comodo do not slogan each other in the terrible special effects war. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is almost everyone's bad way. The performance is bad, or the special effect is so silent that the act is incredible because no one believes that these people have been in trouble like the animals created in the first computer of the 90's. Yet, this movie is actually quite funny. Animals seem so weird, and the actors are actually pretending to be just as dangerous to them. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not. This PG-13 rating film actually sleeps out of itself. Every time a damn word comes, a parrot sounds out of the word beeps. Words that may even be said on network televisions How to make * squawk * cheap that they sleep sound, and less with a parrot. Finally this parrot came to me and I could not help but could laugh at the helplessness. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, till the end of the night till the last night of the dead dead style, from the stupid night to the end, but it is also interesting. As a horror movie it fails unfortunately, as an action movie, it fails to fall slightly, but still very bad, and it shines as a comedy. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** out of 95 minutes PG-13 and Damn for some violence.
