This disc was included in "Shorts: Volume 2" - comparatively little collection of small films. Shorts is one of my favorite styles of movies, but in any case this second gathering collector got a hard time finding quality content - and it was not nearly as good as collecting the first volume or other shorts. <br /> <br /> This little film looks like it is incomplete. There is a story, but in the absence, the viewer like me, somewhat left and incomplete seems to be in the absence of many. <br /> <br /> This image is a woman, her boyfriend and Westie (it's a dog, by the way) going on a solo beach. The lady that speaks with an accent, at times, is a little harder to follow. I've heard that I've been working hard on hearing power, I definitely liked it if it was closed. However, when the boyfriend is silent he goes for a swimming. When he was awake, his dog went away. She makes her follow all about looking for panics and dog dogs. They often debate and spend unreasonable. Then, outside of the blue, they stopped sexually. After that, they are dogs - the story ends. <br /> <br /> As far as letters go, both feel rather functional and impossible. She was a rusty and demanding woman and she seemed insulted for her. When they were surprised that why they were together, their little sex breaks show that any ties kept them together. <br /> <br /> Someone may like characteristic features - I have found people irritating and unreasonable - you can see or hear more like a man than you. Also, pay for all this is just waiting for the price (unless you want to see the naked guy).
