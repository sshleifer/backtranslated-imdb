This has got to be the worst piece of shit I have ever seen. Randy Quaid is as fundamental as a supporter of the original, but as the leading. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, supporter actors carry the show. Ed Assana was very funny. He is the Eddie of Christmas Vacation 2! Snoats still look the same after all those years, and how come everyone else in the 14-year-old look. After 15 minutes of watching this movie, I do not believe that I still smiled. The island thing just does not work. If it was not for the South Pacific Ocean guide on the island, the film would have been a total loss. I was sitting in this review for a week and yes, still the movie should never have been created. Hope not thirid! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sean Gearin
