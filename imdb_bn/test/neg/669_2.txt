Yeah - - - Nothing. If you are a long time fan, you can tell what you know about this video: The past, the harmful songs, the "Big 3" hits from the 80s and their "end-deviation" efforts to be contemporary. They are successful in making fun of their critics by portraying themselves as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they are unable to protect themselves from embarrassment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, then you know there is no new element here. The same old, the same old: 1) Avoid the blue press, 2) No real back footage (GD is hiding his shoes? Give me a break! Even he thinks it is irrational!) 3) There is no new insight. <Br /> <br /> Is a good video showing for CREW 3 or 4 hours? Let's just run the camera. And every 2 seconds the camera angle changes! I understand that the director wants to try some artsy. But then visitors can select 2 or 3 shots to offer a full concert version. Do we know what the band looks like? Let's see what we really want to see. <br /> <br /> Please make yourself a great favor: first rent this movie.
