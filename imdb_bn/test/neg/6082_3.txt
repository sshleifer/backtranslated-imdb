The movie was horrific. The production company will be fined for waste of electricity to send this meaningless money. <br /> <br /> There were many holes in this plot. Why send a killer to the DEO for the killing of the World Bank? If they are not in the DEO, why would they send someone who they do not think will work? To quote Boch Cassidy, "Who are those people?" Apparently, the director does not know because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The letters were incredible. They do not behave in any way that they complained about who they were. Without a doctor's exception, a letter was not particularly compelling or preferred. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste the power needed to watch this movie, feel free to Otherwise, run the opposite direction.
