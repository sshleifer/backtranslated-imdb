After seeing the first film of BCI's new premiere Mummy collection, it was difficult to believe how excited I was about the set, and how frustrating I was when the release date was sent back. I've seen many Mexican horror in recent months. Something great ?? Curse the woman to cry Something entertaining despite obvious errors ?? Bloody Apes Night. And some Chess ?? Choose which Santo movie. One of the things that is common in all these movies is not "dull". Well, it's not with Ezake Mummy. I have seen something in the last moment so it is asleep. I did not expect or expect a great movie, but at least my entertainment! Aztec Mummy accepts every situation that can be interesting and some people like this can ruin life through a recurring scene and then extend the scenes that fall like an eternity. I guess what happens when you create an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of content. Padding extraordinaire! For example, for anyone watching the movie, there is no purpose to bring a masked vendor type on the screen and expand the runtime with 15 or even non-minute minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two movies of the collection are more entertaining like this.
