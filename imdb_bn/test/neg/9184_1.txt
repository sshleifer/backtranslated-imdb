"Wagon's East" is widely known as John Kendi's last movie, as he died in the set. This makes it very sad: only the candy did not suffer from a severe heart attack, but it was in such a fatal film set. Seriously, I do not know what they thought when they came with this shit, but the flick was not a freedom fighter. They took every unused script for stupid westerners and mixed it together and it impressed as it. John Candy does not want to make movies, no wonder; However, there is a hint that Candy has done much better than this throughout her career. To be sure, he has already completed Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon", where the United States declares war in Canada. Just stick with that one and you can say that Candy is ending her honorably career. Prior to Richard Lewis, Eugene Levi's comical but playful "Once Upon His Crime" co-starred Kandy - he later made it for the guest's guest appearance at "Counterdown with Keith Wolberman".
