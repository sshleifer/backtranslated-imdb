My opinion about this movie, in his conversation. <br /> <br /> To be even more serious, I can not say that this movie is a bad moment but I did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and could not get my mind on the world. Although make-up was very realistic, constant screaming irritating. The picture has changed the apes for cats and it's a civilized movie for me about my next love. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, then the talents of newcomers and MacDowell & Lambert, but I felt disconnected: all the stories are located in a big British palace: how luxurious it was, it was like a prison for me . <br /> <br /> Finally, could it be a good adaptation of Tarzan Burroughs' story? I do not know, I could never read the book (or saw Disney): at the conclusion, I have no better moments to remember, so one visit will be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should guess my annoying idea after the continuous freeze called "Overture" ... What does this mean? Only the director knows it.
