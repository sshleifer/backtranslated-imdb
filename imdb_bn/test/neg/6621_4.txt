I watched this movie in HBO, I did not expect anything, but here and there some sunny and all together a fool and common plot. Well, except that I went out, I was slightly satisfied after the movie. I did not expect it, I thought it was in my hands only a half hour. Well, it was, but still it was somewhat valuable. The whole plot was played very stupid, cheap, and some lines were very stupid. Otherwise, it was still a fun moment, though not much. <br /> <br /> All, if you're going to pay this, do not Watch it on television. I gave it a 4, because it was liberal because it smiled me, but still it was still stupid.
