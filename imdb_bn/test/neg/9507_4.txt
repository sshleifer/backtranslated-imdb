(It's Alison Lowman, Patrick Stewart, and so on.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Genuine I was a huge fan of Princess Monoco and Spirit Away, and after seeing all the reviews of this previous Miyazaki movie I was interested to see it later. But I am surprised, I said the quality of this film. Those next films are sculpted with sculpted plots, 3-dimensional letters, and boasting with the best film music ... well ... ever This image just does not come. <br /> <br /> But good / positive aspects can start. Like all Miyazaki movies, it is still very fantastic, with a bizarre fantasy / science-fi setting, later in a mysterious world where insect dominant species Naosika can also be proud of some of the high-end animations from his time to other films. (Though Miyazaki is not as beautiful and fluid as the next movie) and the English voice acting did a great job. <br /> <br /> But this picture ... just ... not good ... all the cardboard in the letters - from the sweet little Nausicaa to the saccharine sweet, to everyone in the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen it all there. There is still music ... Now, Hasei is in my favorite film composer, but Naosika does not do justice to him. Half music has over 80 keyboards overdraw, and it usually enters and releases so casually that it confuses the visuals instead of helping them. I am very doubtful that Hasechi was asked to compose many songs before watching the film. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message with this photo, is not it? Save all the environment! It is very bad that the film is hit by a title-like head. A scene in which Nausicaa hug a tree. Not really. I'm not kidding ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For some reasons IMDB's other reviews worshiped it It seems. And when the letters are to speak to themselves with an extended sentence, let's know what's going on, it's Lum. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who does animate, enjoy 80 songs and every Arbor per day, you will probably like this film. Otherwise, save your money for the next movie, because they rock big time.
