This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the real family and other illustrated characters will prosecute lawyers to prosecute the hell out of VH1. Acting is terrible, bad writing, and painting characters are scary. It was supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, there is no other way than to smile at the bad acting. I usually like acting Flex Alexander, but at the moment he has missed this mark completely. <br /> <br /> You can argue that you can lend this role to yourself because it was very dangerous. If you really want a dramatic movie at night, do not choose this one. But if you're laughing at something bad and stupid writing, then tune-in. Also, do not waste your time.
