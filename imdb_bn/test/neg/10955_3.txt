The production company itself is called 'Nut Entertainment' for this movie and it is an amazingly appropriate name. This very 'knot' starts from the beginning to recreational, which is an embarrassing reason that a mixture of zombie films and western can be interesting. Each time a low budget jumbo movie is released, it will be "for fans by fans". I actually consider myself a fan of the zombie movie, but I would like to re-evaluate my opinion and so much more! This image appears to be a rip off of half-ace Aussie jambi flick 'Andyd', instead of just being the leader of the cowboy hat; Everyone is wearing one; But this scene is not understood much because it is apparently set in modern times. The credit sequence at the beginning of the movie believes that we are going for the atmospheric film, but when the movie starts right; It soon became clear what we did for. Naturally, there is a fairly large amount of beef and it really did quite well, although the good that I have to say about the film is quite good. If the rest of the picture is interesting, there is a thick half way through it. Overall, this is a lot zombie movie in the world with a very zombie movie. I do not recommend it.
