A scientific experiment designed to create epidemics has gone wrong. The creators are trapped around the remote desert, tirelessly and neutrally followed by their own creation. James Stokton, a scientist, used his research despite the protests of making the monster, that the post office is called to help blindly hide the horrors hidden in dark halls. James, stuck together with his son, tried hard to survive. There is no way ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unreasonable. The sets are beautiful clustrophobic and some cows. Although it is sadly unsuccessful, it fails miserably at almost all levels. There is zero mystery, the script is weak and filled with big holes and ends extremely predictable. The so-called Master Way Craven produced this one - wonder if I'm happy with this trash. Joe Gayton directed without any style. Acting awesome, only Lance H Enriksen can do all the work. Okay, I was a big horror fan and very desperate. Avoid it like a plague-it is again the same old annoying shit!
