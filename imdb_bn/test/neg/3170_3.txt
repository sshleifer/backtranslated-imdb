I usually do not consider turning off a movie until it gets worse. The homegrand is a movie that I do not want. The plot is interesting but the very original origin of acting and writing. I do not care about letters. Any movie that highlights as drug use and does not appreciate as unwanted nudity. Let the characters get their time high and believe me, spend the only way to sit through this movie.
