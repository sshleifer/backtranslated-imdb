Shit! The swimming stream that was released in 2007, which I mistook in this movie-thinking. I am sorry to sit for one hour of my life. Shame has given anyone a junk a junk I totally hated this movie - I did not really see it at the end. An hour later I could not stand. I'm afraid that people are horrifying by such violent scripts - which try to stop the story of a dozen other human interest and stop acting as BA-Ed. Painful I rated it 1 out of 10 stars. An amateur can do a lot, much bigger movies.
