Yes it might not be for adults and some adults might find it stupid, but if you do not think about it, it's not really bad. <br /> <br /> The story is going on in Alvin and his gang, in the world of searching for a bad person, and in the way they come in contact with the ill treatment. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good, and the story is beautiful, and forget the songs, but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I gave 10 or 6 out of 4.
