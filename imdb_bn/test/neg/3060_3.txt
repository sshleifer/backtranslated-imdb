It is very kind to call a "fictitious" account of the Barker gang. They got the name right, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I will give it to you, but it is not the real mother Barker who used to cook mainly the boys and when they move around the country, do not plan or participate in crime. I think it was far more interesting than the real story of a middle-aged woman being caught in criminal activities of her children and their chronology. <br /> <br /> I get to agree with those critics who shoot out the scenes to be absolutely incredible to be found. The victims of Barker / Carpus pursued harmonious and law enforcement agents by following them, but they certainly did not reduce about half a dozen FBI agents. (On the other hand, as related to most recent books, the FBI of that era only emphasizes the concept of agents coming from legal or accounting backgrounds, which many agents have very little law enforcement or firearms experience. br /> <br /> But the worst sin is that the movie is basically a sister The second does not. We know that the road has come to an end, we know that it will be a shoot-out. <br /> <br /> Your message for Russell fans.
