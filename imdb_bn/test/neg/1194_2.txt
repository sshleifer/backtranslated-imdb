I saw this photo in the Edinburgh Theater with 3 Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought it was a waste of time. We've spent an hour to see the Star Wars III's VIP dialog, which was the game below the hall. <br /> <br /> The commitment made to celluloid on the big screen has not become a cold as it opens with the worst jokes. We got this feeling throughout the movie that Jokes were trying very hard, the writer thought so much about the setup that you can see this joke coming 2 minutes before, when it comes, it is so unthinkable that you can not laugh; I quote giraffe cum-ming as a prime example. <br /> <br /> This plot has created some interesting thoughts in my mind, which gives me much more entertainment than what is going on the screen. I think that the angle (two different worlds, the experience of fish outside the water of the letters, confusion and surprise can be done by people trying to differentiate letters and writers from each other) can do much more. ) But this painful plot was finally ruined many times to make 'embarrassed' and 'cave' humanly possible. Writing additional characters from writers for writing <br /> <br /> and 16th-century letters is insulting to intelligent writers and editors, who probably could have considered this film 40 minutes later; But not, it's a complete length torture film unfuniness. <br /> <br /> When we were leaving the theater, there was very little smile, when the little Hip Electro-Class behind me heard the British couple said, "It was not good, what's next." And the girl's reaction " Yes, quite wonderful. " And that was To show a comedy from the British people means that if it does not laugh for 90 minutes, then eventually a great deal of communication between two lovers, but the film was successful. But there is more faith in British life than me. <br /> <br /> I am not so frustrated in comedy movies from American Pi II.
