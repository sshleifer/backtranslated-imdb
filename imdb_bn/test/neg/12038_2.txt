A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougarthi, accused of killing their daughter on false accusations. People start to wonder why they do it. Police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple is maligned by the public and accused of press. Police believed that they had murdered the devil and their own daughters. They were accused and brought to trial. They represent them by campaign-seeking lawyers who give their bad advice and pay them $ 100,000. The evidence against them is concealed or hidden by the police. FABRICATED INFORMATION OF SOCIAL TREATMENT is presented. Their other children were taken away from them and kept in a feather house. Dogretty is pregnant and finds her baby move. Ray, he did it but he did. He went to Slam with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> Surprised about what to do next, in the Dillon Prison and in the final third of the movie, we see people are slowly coming to the defense of the couple. Witnesses acknowledge lies. Other information is brought to light, finally, the result of Dillon's release. The killer has never been found, though the film gives us a thorough vacuum as a thorough supplement. <br /> <br /> It starts crying from the beginning. Nothing seems to go right for couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy together and dissatisfied, or some proof of their evidence is discovered and people embrace each other. But no one ever goes through the door with bad news, and all faces are frozen in a sad disbelief. (Usually a fade to follow.) Tragedy is not necessary to make mistakes, even though I can not imagine how we enjoy seeing people suffer. There are lots of tragedies in Shakespeare. The tragic stories I find interesting are what we say is false. "Oh, but I'm a fool of Fortune!" Romeo cry after Juliet's brother killed! Here we are running his clothes through a hospital airless corridor, shouting, "Where is my baby?" There is no ambiguity or animosity in the story - I'm sure it should be based on real-life events. People here are either good or bad. Or they are bad, then they become better, then they become better. <br /> <br /> The film is not aimed at searching for people's curiosity or things. It's tear-wrenching targets from the audience. The actors provide role models for the first rate role. I can not remember the last movie, where I saw many tears. There are tears of rivulets. Their shower Their cascades One of them is actually Niagara. They have a lake lacromos. <br /> Well, I'll give an example of expertise that the movie has been created. Dylan and Dagerty hire a Chicago Police who acts as a personal investigator (Ed Asner). Asana is sympathetic to them but he does not really earn much. He does not think of the movie because of his importance in this field, but he can give the hunter couple a kind of philosophy - "Learn to live with her" which is fine - and because she is suffering from colorectal cancer, so we take her medication, pain Let's double out and finally go away. <br /> <br /> It is frustrating about this movie that it gives a lot of attention to the couple's attention so much that it shows more important things - Gossip's work in the control of personal life. <br /> <br /> Gossip is really a strange thing. If we call it "Gossip", then it is bad, but if we think it's "public opinion" it seems very rarely acceptable. Of course, all of us have a determination about things that may or may not be appropriate. (I write, Michael Jackson is being brought to court again for mocking a young boy, and I was surprised how many of us were glad to hear this news and immediately thought he was a parent.) But Gossip is not bad at all. It's like water When it is properly controlled, it is a community resource. We need the Gospel to keep each other in line. It helps us maintain our public order. But, like floods or tsunamis, it is destructive for a village, when it goes out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a movie which is okay if you are not looking too much on the way to the human nature insight. It is so clever that it is difficult to argue with it, given its goal.
