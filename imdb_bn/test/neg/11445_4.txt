A young girl Jodie Foster has been a witness to the Mafia murder, reported the killing of local police, and targeted herself by population activists. A professional killer, Defin Hooper, who is hired by the Mafia, is preparing to hit him, but eventually he falls for him. Then, a parody of Stockholm syndrome, which defines a case that begins with selecting and helping a kidnapper hostage kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls, loves, and prepares both for her kidnappers. <br /> <br /> Actor Dennis Hooper tried to sort himself out with the creative ambition of director Dennis Hooper. The results are frustrating, and the great actors like Dennis Hooper fail to maintain pace with the artistic level. No real thrill and scripts are sometimes naive and expected. This movie is credited with Jodie Foster's performance, which is not her best, but she is still brilliant with her talents, looks and gifts. Vincent Price's short appearance in the historical interest, and, played a small role, which is known from his great part of Wall Wall Street. <br /> <br /> If you agree to spend 116 minutes on film, it is not a complete loss; This movie gives easy entertainment, but we expect more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias as "guilty".
