In addition to Frank Cres (who played Abraham Gentry), Honeyy Youngman and the last seconds of the film, this film was not particularly well about anything. Why is it currently rated 5.3 and I have a favorite by some critics - the film is 99.44% shit ... and what I expected from director Herschelle Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s, Lewis was known for making incredible low-budget exploitation films, such as Blove Feast and Monster A Go-Go. However, in recent years he has been named "cowboy" and has many fans - fans who ignore the inability of his work and focus on some of his films are fascinated. But without the use of fake blood and liberal grief, his films do not believe in pure shit - and scores of 9 and 10 for his movies. This Louvre will be like putting a velvety elvis painting !! <br /> <br /> About a string of very serious killing happening in film strippers. When I say terrible, it is very bloody and sick for 1972 - even though today's standards have special effects on amazing hair. So, if there are some terrible and cruel killings in the film (I would rather not explain them - they came from a very ill-hearted and show a special illness for women), at least they will not bother you because they are doing so poor work. It is clear that in many cases they are cut apart rubber dolls and mannequins. But even if they are unrealistic, quite nasty and even many misogyny shows them to do some ill-work. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the film, the police is all stupid, a guy has been named Abraham Gentry - whose method and lecture style stock actors, David Lochary, very close to the early John Waters film. Although his performance is bad, he is so interesting and interesting that he was interested in me. She could be quite funny and surprising this is the only film she ever made !! It was also strange that many women wanted him - especially because they just do not feel like their type. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, they could not work cremins and fools who could. Actually, I hope to be more shocked - they're really coming! None of their performances were at least bitable and obviously the director never redrafted a scene - because Ed Wood's best work, most of the movies in Plan 9 Out Space were worse than others. In fact, for most women in the film, the only prerequisite for appearing in the film is that they are willing to stop their clothes. Now I know it will be very meaningful, but most of them were incredibly irrational and looked like trapped drug addicts to get their next correction. When these women close their clothes, the crowd gives their money back to the crowd. (Wah - Heiney Youngman is said to be in this film)! However, considering Levy's budget, he was probably the best actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, a sticky bucket driven to be worse than one of the directors ... and that's a lot! It is violent (yet fooled), anti-women (distorting meat and things) and it is completely incapable from the beginning.
