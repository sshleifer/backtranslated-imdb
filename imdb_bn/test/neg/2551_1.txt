In the small town of Furlaf's Dust Million in Texas, an animal is killing cows and locals. When the teenager Tommy (Michael Carrio) dies, his friend Anna Falph (Irika F), his Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Guti√©rrez), Jill Gillespie (Sarah Irrison) and Rose (Martin Hughes) discovered that a Mexican vanguard The slaughtered killers and they plan to kill animals. <br /> <br /> "The Mexican Weirolf of Texas" is a amateur cone and I've ever seen one of the worst movies. There is no work in this movie: the screenplay is ridiculous, the most horrific line I have ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "Blair Witch Project". The amateur-acting high school student or a high school game seems to be an amazing one. The "special effects" are violent and extremely poor and "Werewolf" I've ever seen cheap. Ed Wood is a religious film, but this "pure Mexican garbage" in Mexico's Texas Warehouse. In the end, Jill said that nobody can resist his tweets (actually the most beautiful thing of this flick). But I believe the correct quote should be "No man (or woman) can stop this movie to see it eventually". I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad the movie might be, and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I think most of the visitors will stop seeing less than 20 minutes. My vote is one (horror). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisman Mexico Any Texas" ("A Mexican Way Whoa" in Texas)
