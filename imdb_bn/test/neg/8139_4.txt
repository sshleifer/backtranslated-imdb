These cheap horror potboiler cast and crew are more interesting than anything that happened throughout the movie; We are behind Barbara Petton, Raymond Bauer, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanho and Woody Storm Camera and writer-director Kurt Sydmak, cineographer Charles Van Ngar, editorial supervisor Francis De Leon and production assistant Herman Cohen. It's about Nearly every man who came with deep contact in the African jungle had become headache in Petton, where he lived in the husband's kavanagh: Doctor Conway secretly asked him, while the forearm's warm attitude led by the heat, most hands, on. On the other hand, Chaney (surprisingly adequate) but behind the person but intelligent authoritarian figure and the Strong, a local police officer. Plot is very simple but to be honest, it is not fully understood: After the completion of the excited dinner, after the completion of thunderstorm, rust and cavanagh (life can be lived?), They are hit on their affection in the garden. For Burton and conveniently Burr, a large snake will be exactly where the Cavanaugh ground reduces! Beat behind Bush's mysterious maid (a native witch, not less), for some unreasonable reasons, curses the old man (which has a married petton), which timely turns him into gorilla ... starting from his very wedding day (when his Hands are harmful!)! As a result, the old man loses himself in the forest for the day? Even if the apple animal itself is glimpsed across the film even then. But it should be said, the version I have seen for 56 minutes when 'formal' length is given elsewhere as 66, 70 or 76! Therefore, the film gets shaky and isolated if it is not less than the camel's enjoyment, it ends up pursuing the guerrillas intentionally in the jungle, with which the former gunman chani and convey follows. To return to the leading female leading lady of the film for a minute: after a committed start in this next Hollywood movie like James Cagnini and Gary Cooper ?? In, respectively, Kiss TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950s) ?? His career soon became nose-dived due to his own 'colorful' off-screen antics in the B (and less) grade territories: his most notorious miscreants were the reason for the dispute in the best-publicized bar-room between the suave husband Frank Tone and the atrocities. Ex-boyfriend Tom Neil, who is ex-coma and ended with Petan, leaves him soon after !! But this was not the case: Nimphomania Paton was also proud that the Woody Stroud was in his conquest (at that time a controversial issue); Short-term husband Tony, with the betrayal of Petton in the camera, spread the fake photographic evidence around Hollywood and it ended her day like a starlet ?? The appearance of his latest movie is AdGar G. Umar's Moodled IS My Bit (1955) which is on my "Invited movie" playback. His painful life has been spent in rainy rains, torches, drug addicts, prostitution, assault, arrest and even a dispute for the last 12 years ?? Finally, in 1967, his parents died at the house of 39!
