Countless historical and cultural mistakes 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jew named Omar !!! Hahahaha (2) The brightest detective movie is the least intelligent man! (3) Jewish suicide bombs !! That was fun. (4) Hitler and his top gun went to see a movie in Paris suburbs !!! With two guard in the door. !! Shoot me (5) Brad Pitt overacted and watching him was painful. (6) Mr. Kiwi reconscribes history, "Hitler has been killed in a theater ?? Really!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will actually believe in this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally someone can tell me how this movie has made it in the best 250 films of all time !!! Shameful shy shame, how wonderful this movie can still like.
