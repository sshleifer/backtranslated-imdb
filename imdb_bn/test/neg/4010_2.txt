This timeless film was a complete disappointment. Which of the characters can not decrease at least, so you do not really care how each of them fails. The film was the worst of a homosexual organization, except that this story of male hostels was related to gay sex workers' strong sex scenes and was not associated with solo scenes of gay sex.
