Well, of course everyone has the right to have opinions about everything ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white films, year 1968, student publicity, general strike, youth, ideals, love ..... Sorry but I did not feel the love, romance. Who is a lover just right to sleep with his girlfriend no matter? Is this love But not only this, the film was very long and for some reason, I had to stop watching the film several times because I lost interest only. I started to do something but ....... nothing nothing. I was fascinated by the movie: Gypsy Fydler playing in the street, yes it was nice. I do not think that the industry should be complex, encrypted, hidden, hidden, confusing and confusing. All disappointments and time is wasted!
