Che! A bad movie and it deserves fame as a strange funny picture. It takes a serious issue and presents it like a Cliff Note version or classic comics because it does not have much emotion or proper description - Only toxic segments are relayed by most intelligent "true stories". <BR> <br /> This is a great ridicule, because it has been written and played poorly. However, I've found the most interesting about the film is her explicit gay subtext. Instead of working towards Che Guevara and Fidel Castro's Communist Cuba, they seem more than a lesbian couple - Che Cheyung Koy and Alfof and Fidel as provocative sutures! Again, this film is related to the superb line, such as asking Fidel Che "You need Cubber ... .... I need you !!". I'm not sure about the studio's lingerie, but it does not recognize the surgeon in the brain! I was surprised that other critics did not indicate it. However, if you watch this movie, remember that it looks more exciting and even fun. <br /> <br /> A final note. In recent years, Che was very funny - even with the age of the brain's body, even a fashion statement, who did not know who shined shining shirt with his face. He was a cold blooded killer and nihilist (an odd combination for a doctor), considering this new tribute to humans is fairly rough. What will they do next, T-shirts and posters Hitler or Dr. Will keep Menzel? !!? Even the intellectuals should think that the communists should be shedding, and I was responsible for Guiver and I think it is disgusting that the people of the computer are championing a man who probably killed half of them! <br /> <br /> Considering how stupid and strange this picture was, Guevara was not a hero, it did not make any further advancement. I love to see a realistic movie of his life - with dialogue with good and bad and such a plot that was not made by chimps!
