Photography is good, good clothing, but bad to edit. Various scenes are cut or closed at the wrong time and the conversation is s-l-o-w and tedious. This slowness continued the whole show. It's a very tiring show to see. . . . I believe I should add more scenes, but that will make it a long show. It's very slow. It must have been a 1-night show for the writer and after the night our sad night should not have been prolonged. There is nothing else, otherwise I'll change the channel (first night). I feel bad for Indians and anger towards white men for their work towards Indians, but this was also our history.
