It's good to watch a bad movie in a while, so you know how cool a actor is and how much he is. Good in the context of this story: Thirteen boats, weather ground water, alien thirteen murders. Who does not love me, if you are in the screaming thriller? But when I came to know that something was apparent, it was only 75 minutes. I thought, "How long do they hate watching the movie, which movie is 90 minutes?" But once I took home the DVD from Bussetter, I was shocked at this entirely amateur piece junk instruction, terrible production quality, acting, at. Lastly I saw it because I have no TV, and I already gave four rupees for it. However, there was a ray of light: playing "Chris" the actors are actually decent, and carry away this drake. Above all, special effects were inexpensive and incredible. Then the alien - clothing seems attractive (rubber case), but most movies appear in the dark, so you can not see! And rarely did the actor believe enough to postpone the mistrust. Finally, I must say that the DVD jacket was made to produce more than the film, which seemed like a rip-off, so be careful when you rent another DVD. Save your $ 4 and buy a pin of beer.
