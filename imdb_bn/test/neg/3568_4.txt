For me, this film must be like a feature length pilot episode for the TV series. It reminded me of the TV series Wanderer's British rimak, played by Kenneth Brananag. People interviewed by police are hard, and often as bitter as the weather, the lead investigator has huge family problems, the investigation unmistakably gives distant past cruelty and intrigues are labyrinthine with strange happenings and subplots making knowledge at the end only. There are both excellent movies. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zar City reminds a standard United Kingdom or a series of US crime series. Effectively you can take any plots of frost's touch episodes and transplant them on top of the colorless locale in this movie and have an effective result. <br /> <br /> The script can not be more obvious than the cookie cutter. You are also known as the most motif such as going to the local jail, as an intimidation and dangerous psychic, who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm absolutely sure that it's a scone and jam for many people, but I think it refers to people like me who do not go to watch television. I felt what message felt an interested. This picture brings to Thailand as genetic studies of Thailand. In Genetic terms, Iceland is basically isolated from the outside world, scientists present a great opportunity to study their genetics. A lot of information has been kept about the reproduction of the population and the effect of many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be effectively identified in a population that refrains from inter-establishment, and it is unusually genetically a pair (it is trying to unite a jigsaw puzzle.) Underground maps of London, instead of daisies Jagaz maze). A company named Decode Genetics tried to set up a database by carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. This project has been canceled due to confidentiality concerns, and Decode Genetics has become bankrupt in Iceland by the end of last year. This episode is a rich subject for debate. <br /> <br /> But this film does not have to teach genetics and medical science, they are there for the strange environment. <br /> <br /> It is a horror movie if you are interested in that, and eat food in those who engage in those incisions in the incisions of food often have an unhealthy focus. Most queasy for me when the leadership inspector devours the sheep's head. Unfortunately for me this sometimes becomes rogue. Filming with horror films rather than trying to delicate tasks and ultimately end up giving unwanted humor. It is equivalent to, in cinematic terms, in trying to create a fuzz, if you are not good enough, hands and sharp sharpness make you toxic the client. Rather this diligent director will reduce the duty on its performance. <br /> <br /> I felt the feeling of this movie rather than about myself and almost life.
