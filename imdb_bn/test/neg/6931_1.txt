This is a piece of Hollywood that can not leave a movie. Without a possible thought dialogue, plots without a point, staging without skill, indicator without instruction, and some backwaters played worthless High School's freshman classes game. The whole cast should be arrested for acting. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, okay!
