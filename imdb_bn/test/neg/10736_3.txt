I think this film lacks so much substance, it is not worth a discussion. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the package is really annoying. Especially stereotype filming and photography. Of course, Joe Dante's cinematic style was perfect and interesting in "Grammilins" and "Short Soldier", I'm telling the imaginative and impressive beautiful story that Spielberg-Wankcard (I really love this movie), but it was a complete failure in "Homemaking". The attacks of toy soldiers and hairdressing animals are not only comparable to zombie-attacks (trying to kill the dead, weird, rotten living beings alive) - without any logical reason, they hate them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> None of Joe Danta's first episode will be seen. Another point is annoying: In the two main characters, really stupid dialogue, "Big Brother dies and harmful behavior" and strongly exploits bad acting. And, "homing" is not fearful, no secondary - even less entertaining. You see, this is not a horror film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, clear content) and fine social critics. The original Zombie film was actually a midnight movie "Night of Living Dead" (1968). It is a less controversial film that covers many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: Hitako / Raimi is a visual style, the American lifestyle of 70, political miracles, the upcoming success of black human rights and conservative Americans, as well as more upcoming racism (at the end of the film Remember the main character shooting of the black). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in creativity of midnight movies and want to know more about the most important thing, I recommend you to "Midnight Movie: Margin to Mainstream". <br /> <br /> Clearly clear "homemaking" and even "Land of the Land" of Romero dead.
