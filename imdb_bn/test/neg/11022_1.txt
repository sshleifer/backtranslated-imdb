I am surprised, after reading some of the opinions here, if I saw the same movie as other critics, but I have compelled the tragic conclusion that came to me after checking my incidents. <br /> <br /> Cute Wannabee Scrubby Comedy I've had the longest time at 94 minutes, and one of the unexpected things I've seen most, for ages. Now do not make me wrong, I like the scrabble comedy, but this annoying, set-bound adventure, Proston Sturg, and Howard's High Heights high-altitude holes have become so small that it is not worth it (mixing my metaphors) who breathe the same as great. The author / director Charles Martin's conversation is not diverse, subtle or interesting - and there's a lot of it. He does not know how to end a scene, especially because people are coming out of the room and saying goodbye to each other, the motion of the movie will be lifted and then a limited number of characters are working foolishly and motiveless things for any other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy a little less Has been obvious The characters of this film fall out of love with each other, and at a moment's notice, only a small plot goes out of the apartment and outward. At one moment the man is disturbed one person, later they are married to someone else - silence and the screen has been closed, so we do not know anything about it until a letter tells us - "Oh, they are getting married!" (Usually Made a wrong-foot or jumped into the wrong conclusion). If we came to know that these two letters were related to love or if we previously felt involved with the audience, then the audience could have enjoyed the experience of fooling themselves in front of them. Such characters look just like selfish, shiny idiots, and we do not see any sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and they are limited for them so that the whole thing is made to look like a badly film stage game. The only moment of relief from Tidium is that of Kina Wyn, who has watched that she is traveling from different movies and has decided to travel around and has been a little more fun than all the illogical things around her. <br /> <br /> Extremely avoidable.
