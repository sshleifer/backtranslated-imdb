Yes, this movie is probably trying to be a Canaan Barberian, and I wonder what it is a series (people have claimed another?). The first part of Flickr looks like a flashback. It does not seem to be verifiable from what I saw (and apparently it always kills huge dolls in his movies). Atta now lives with his silent Sidekick Thong at the edge of the earth. This bad naughty girl asks her to help her as her custody. Tell me this bad guy is very patient as the old guy constantly insults villian and prattleles on endlessly. The bad guy is waiting at the end of the movie and finally to surprise you, the old man "took so long to be amazed?" Meanwhile, ather and his sudic and cheeks go through one courage after another. They cave, invisible soldiers (not asked), hire a lip, and snakes fight those who worship. It also fight a giant snake doll and hang-glides (again, do not ask). All the time you will think that the canons will beat it.
