An intermediate mysterious mystery-thriller, which can theoretically hear fantastic words but can play very badly. The humorous script (small speaker) is fulfilled after the death of humans and the life comes back for the sake of the plot and the director does not seem capable of doing any power and mystery. The only way to "explain" the title of the movie is that the sequence is the only half-memorable of this tedious movie. (* 1/2)
