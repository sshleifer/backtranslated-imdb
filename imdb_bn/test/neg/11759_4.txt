This movie is really a strong start. We know that Atlanta Hotshots, sent to Australia to solve Roberts Kollack's marketing problems We also know he is an intelligent talent. Roberts's fine performance makes us sure about this quickly. Unfortunately, this plot is so radioactive, that the development of any subtle character has been achieved, it is negative by the sequence of void, inconsistencies, and cruel boring movies. <br /> <br /> Typically, I'm a dry sucker for bold and outgoing plots. For example, I like what I like, "Dark Star," "OC and Stiggs," and "Popeye." As soon as this picture is well-acknowledged, I can not recommend this film, even this is surprising. <br /> <br /> The middle of this movie happened through the film. All comedy is immediately lost and the film turns dark. Later, the film plods along. The success of the comedy rolling film was not successful again. More surprises are waiting for the audience and they are still dark <br /> <br /> Make sure, combining the play with comedy can be a source for success. However, with this film, the result is as successful as the "new coke".
