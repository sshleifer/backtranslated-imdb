My unclear childhood memories have been referring to the serials of the French belt of Belforg ... so I was interested to see large screen adaptations. I should keep my money and Louvre went for a sightseeing. <br /> <br /> The concept of this scenario is still very appropriate and interesting (imagery of Le Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. Conversations can not be achieved without being hesitant between French rebels and serious "American businesses", rather they do not know it. "<br /> <br /> Acting may be preferred anyway and less than what special effects can expect.?) <br /> <br /> <br /> What's left behind are some good shots in Paris There is a lot of things out there ... which is very frustrating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
