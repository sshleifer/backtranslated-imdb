I agree about sex without any seduction or love of this movie. In fact, it feels boring and why bothers me. I do not really think of all this about how Canadians feel about second-generation sex and how far they talk. At any rate, do you know that the first hotel / drunken idea was copied from a Korean film, the EPGsogine Ganoo, which was created in 2001 or later? The Korean film that was originally bright as a comedy, but at the same time forced viewers to reflect the complexity of men and women relations and male-female differences in audience and thinking. I have not been taken by the Niul N Nikki Hotel / drunk part mostly by taking. Can the Bollywood filmmaker not try the main way only? Sincerely, I have never enjoyed a Hindi flick which is a copycat. The enjoyments I enjoyed were always talking about Indian sentiment in Indian cultural ways.
