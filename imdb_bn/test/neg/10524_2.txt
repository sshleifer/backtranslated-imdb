The worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw allocated. The acting is horrific, horror of the plot, the idea is terrible, and no research is ever done so! All right, I admit, 'Airbod' was a beautiful movie, but not a 'soccer dog'. This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even 10-year-old kids will not have enough trouble to take half a stupid dog to break the ball! It's terrible, do not see this movie.
