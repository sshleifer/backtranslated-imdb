It was a serial of crash dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget segment. I supposed to be good in this movie, but boy I was wrong. First of all, this film has nothing to do with crash dives rather than submarines. Second, the plot can be gradually tedious and in some cases completely incoherent. <br /> <br /> This movie will not be the focus of most people. (I remember reading a book during a slow, annoying scene.) The scenes will be used for dramatic effects that will laugh at the audience. Corkscrew is definitely one of the scenes. Anyone who got on my primary shock would slip into this and not know not only people would be unbeliever, but it was laughing at mere silliness, I was able to find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good sub-flick at MD, watch the crash dive and leave this hair drop film.
