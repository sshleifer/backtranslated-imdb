Because Disney often does not have much, neglecting animation quality and their signals require a good plot, it's actually a wonderful surprise. I do not know why Disney does not pay more attention to them. Graphics quality is always inferior; No backgrounds are eligible for Disney, named plots and worse conversations, little or no attention is given in the actual story, and the drawing plot is often worse than the cartoons and worse than the quality of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is still poor compared to Disney themes, and the dialogue is quite intense, story lines and overall execution were really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Although it is not economical, it fails to hold the charm and / or mystery from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
