This film is a combination of the different types of super-tough hard-hitting biker characters, but it is not a real story. Some of the scenes are filmed nicely. If they take the same cast and crew and create a film called Gent, which was the most spectacular character in the film and comes up with a striking and consistent story, maybe it might be appropriate. As is, the insights of the strong man's character are ready for a haircut, all of which are not biking around the desert and are in danger, and not everyone snobbles and keeps their hair and clothes perfect and never want to look for them. A house or money etc. There was a kind of background story about characters that killed different people and a treasure which is probably supposed to be plotted.
