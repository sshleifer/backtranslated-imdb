I love the old "giant movie" for the quality of the pure camp. If you find such a thing it is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> Actual pure shit is pure. When you see enough you use it ... the conversation is too stupid and forgotten until the end. You're just there for the monster bird. <br /> <br /> This movie "Science" is delightful. One of the oldest Avenues of the brain, which can use anti-matrix ... Destroying missiles and intending to feed humans ... An alien resident in the world. Some of the best scenes in the movie include (which do not have any of them), "scientists" explain what is happening. <br /> <br /> A lot of things have been said about the ridiculous bird Marianne. It looks like a new baby ... rubbish with neat pastors and ugly. It's even a hungry, angry caws like anger. However, the birds were scared out of my three-year-old shit, who had nightmares for the big scary birds for the evening. <br /> <br /> (The way the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield. ) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
