Nico Mottorakis banned films were quite disappointing in my opinion. About a couple of movies, who go on a Greek island to kill perverted people (apparently). You know that you got some sick when a guy in the first scene involved sex sex with goats and then included it is killed. <br /> <br /> But things get worse from that point because all the scenes look pretty nicely. They meet some people, so they either kill them or have sex with them (especially both). <br /> <br /> When this couple is having a brother and sister, it is okay and she just lets her rotate anywhere. But the overall one would be more expected. There is no substance here, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
