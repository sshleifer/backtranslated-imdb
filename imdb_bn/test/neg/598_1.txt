This movie probably started with a good idea, but it has gone far. After reading the cover of Blockbuster, I thought it was a promise, but it was based on the overall concept of the movie. The film started with Professor, in the future we will be able to see the animals of other levels. There was no explanation about how it would happen, but it is true that the film will improve. It was not. In the next scene we saw two young men pressing the tubes lying on the table on their heads. There are two attractive women as well. Men start asking "you hear that" or "you see them". We conclude that they are either ghosts or other creatures that seem invisible or they are hallucinated. Women do not see these animals. It was great for the first five minutes, but the scene went on for a whole hour. It is briefly compressed by flashbacks, which have no relation to the so-called "plot" of the film. We are familiar with a man in a lab quote and think of Middle Eastern terrorists. What about this We do not find out. Flashbacks are driving us to believe that the terrorists force the lab coat to make these young people tempted to be tempting, but we never understand. At the end of the movie terrorists finally what the terrorists do? They blow the lab, but why? What is the real story We have no idea. There are many disconnected ideas and ideas in this film, but there is a lot more to it, but more important is that the lab quotes and terrorists pop outside and outside the room throughout the film and once the young man or men are trying to get out of it or they keep it on the table, even though they break Not reading! The filmmakers have played several times by Kokoch, but again we never learn what to do with the story. Sorry but this movie is worth 4 dollars and I'm seeing it while driving in a rental shop. Take my advice. Do not hire it
