When I saw this movie it seemed as if I was new to high school and I still feel like charging for Master PK for hours and 20 minutes or that I will never return to my life. <br /> <br /> The person who posted is already completely correct. Master P is a wannabe mobster. He stopped selling young printable white kids in this country millions of people in his country like all other rappers in this country. It is widely known that the people were not black and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. That rappers could not be dealt with unnecessarily. This film depicts Master P as a gangster named Niro? Horror with script acting acting. Completely unbelievable. During the search I said a link or something that he is planning to make another movie called "The Black Soprans". <br /> <br /> <br /> You are not a white mobster, you do not even have a good actor P., anyone who continues to sing your music for listening to this day ...
