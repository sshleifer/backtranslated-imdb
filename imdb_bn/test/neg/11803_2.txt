I was surprised that the producer of this movie really came out that the film was a real story. Most of the scenes looked fake to me. For example, when a girl eats her sandwich and there was a hay there. When he was eating sandwiches, the opposite camera showed that there was a hole in there. When the girl was eating it was funny how the camera in the sandwich was filmed. Another scene was when the gang had opened a clothes closet and a cat got out of the closet or I would say it was thrown to work it out. This movie was not all realistic. The incident happened in the evening in the evening of "Saint Francisville examination". It is very suspicious. I believe that the room may be frustrating, but in the night the movie was pictured! After the team and other girl shrank below a bit of basement, it was finally fun. Paul and Madison found them and their rescue! I would like to see the Blair Witch project again, then again sit through the St. Francisville test movie. I said, if the producers of the film do not have a true story about the true facts, then I would prefer it more. You're more than happy to get more entertainment from the Blair Witch project (though this is not a true story) !!!
