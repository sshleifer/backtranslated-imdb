Last night I saw this picture and especially saw that others thought that I was terrible. <br /> <br /> Please see some people have seen a lot in this picture, so if I'm not one of you, fine - good luck to you. But I'm a patient. I've enjoyed lots of long films before. But it was an exercise of persecution for me. <br /> <br /> I genuinely felt that this was one of the short stories, and it was more about the style than the substance - but the style also seemed like to tear my hair. What happened during the course of the film course is quite interesting off-screen. This is a deliberate attempt to completely remove a movie from the outtake - if the saved bits of the DVDs are deleted in public view sections, even then, about the main character Francois You have to find something. I did not have any sympathy for any characters in this film, perhaps the old man without biogasist and his goats believed that octopuses live in 300 because they are really smart. Sincerely, when I was excited I cut a shot from Fran√ßois and put a gun on his head. I felt so much when his inevitable suicide even became extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? Ammium stop smoking? I swear, I cried almost every time when I was not under the extended shot of an event, perhaps someone was looking back and behind in the back, and then the next scene would be cut very suddenly, and it would be after one year, And we've realized the mediations that arise, and everyone was wearing the same bloody cloth ....!?!?! <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, if you like it - great. But this review is called as a concern against the "I love the movie if you love the movie" shown on the post here and anywhere else. (See? I hated this picture and I still included a breeder reference to his content!)
