With the title "The Movie" in the early 1980s, I was interested in seeing it as the best movie of all time in an admission entry in the 1950s science science film. (Incidentally, the Leonard Maltin film guide given this illogical BOMB rating). After stepping out of the DVD last year, I was interested in buying the "Suit Camp Classic" box set (including Quinn Off Out Space [1958] and Giant Behman [1959]); However, after recently acquiring queen on the DVD, I gave this idea. <br /> <br /> Alas, I've put the movie on the movie only - but the print was not released from the warning DVD (which is considered to be an amazingly handsome transformation proud) but rather a dirty TV prints ... though so much Not to be lost (in other words, it was like showing the movie in sepia against black color) -white!). However, to fix the matter: I must admit that I was disappointed that the film did not prove to be ridiculous, I was always expecting it (Maltin called it "too terrible"); Actually, I think it's pretty compelling - and a little more thanks for an hour. There remains some incredibly fun bits - for example, when the 50-year-old woman starts shouting on her head, and when the deputy director of Sheriff is often encouraged with the help of her principal and leading lady, in such an unusual case Special effects do not make me think of "funny" (moltin again) in the movie - though they must be embarrassingly bad! <br /> <br /> So, the idea is that an exotic (monster-shaped man, dressed in a cave-man rag, and radioactivity to boot!) is coming to Earth in a big ball-shaped (!) spaceship and apparently the heroine's precious Necklace after unclear finance - and it does not come in any way as its transparent transparent ... However, in fact, it is human stories that hold our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the husband husband is not very interesting, but his two women: the rich but alcoholic wife Alison Hayes and aspiring, vicissitian girlfriend Yevette Vickers Hesse's trusted slave (already mentioned), some of them are policemen (one of them, as mentioned elsewhere, obviously stupid) and many doctors (one of whom is named by Dr. Kushing [!] And another name, Began to grow in size after coming out). <br /> <br /> Of course, the film can be seen as the opposite female version of the continuing Discipline Man (1957) - although it should not be comparatively comparable to both Jack Arnold / Richard Matheanes Classic's more psychologist / intellectual; In fact, Hayes does not seem worried about her 'situation' and in fact, she takes advantage of her to teach her husband! However, its violence - exaggerated in the poster of the era - rather obscure (especially when it is considered that it only takes place in the last ten minutes). If the loss caused by his huge but extremely helpless hand is not seen (especially when the doll is supposed to be her husband!), She is mostly tall shots and almost backwards (her size is not in line with the proportion of even the buildings) she passes by) !! Nevertheless, dies through the Hayes power plant (when he enters an electric cable) is done efficiently. Finally, I followed it with the title of the 1993 radio remix of Darling as an untitled animal - which I specifically hired for this purpose.
