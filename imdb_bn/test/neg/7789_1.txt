I saw the second edition of Charles Dickens' classic, and sadly it has become the worst. The film begins with a live action piece, where Charles Claire, like Charles Dickens, begins a story of a Christmas carol and then goes on an animated story. You probably already know, Abenizor Scruzz is a cold blooded businessman who denies charity and hates Christmas. He visited Jacob Marley (Nicholas Cage), who came to visit the three past ghosts of Christmas (Zen Hors), present (Sir Michael Gambon) and silent future / yet. After all this he certainly realized the true magic of Christmas and promised to be inferior in the future. The only change in the story was that I saw Scrooge as a friend as a fly (a stupid concept), Scrooge's former love belle (Kate Winslet) needed to see him in the orphanage to help him, Whit of Christmas Present featured two kids, "" and "Ignorance" Wish, screws are still scared after being beautiful, and he worries that he can promise to stay beautiful Not. Also played by Ian Jones as Bob Crichit, Julie Stevenson as Mrs. Crichit, Franchise Fred of Scruff and Colin Macfarlane as Finevig. Animation is not very good, actors waste their voices in an unnecessary vessel. The only good thing to come out of this movie is that Kate Winslet's best voice, to stop the song "What is" is to stop the song, for the rest, it's just vaguely awful. Very poor!
