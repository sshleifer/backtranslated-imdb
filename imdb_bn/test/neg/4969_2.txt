I ended up watching Mandy Lane almost an hour ago, and I expressed my desire to come home directly and I got here to warn anyone who spent the money on DVD - <br /> <br /> shallow, acting failure Matthew McConaughey More than movies, and till the end, the plot is all clear. Not ten nights, you can see the next scene 5 minutes before it starts. The whole film is less or less without the purpose or message, and half of the way a "murderer" publishes kills the plain just as you kill it with the same interest you have at that moment. How to save this shallow, tired movie is a decent demo splator, or at least female "slasher" novel - it also fails. <br /> <br /> If any of your sides require a background movie you can go outside and outside without missing, I recommend buying Mandy Lane for all boys. <br /> <br /> If you sit down and watch your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds I do not.
