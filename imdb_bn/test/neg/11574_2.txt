"In a remote laboratory, the scientists (insert the slaughtered animals here) and create control monsters, while a crack military team / scientist's daughter / bank robbers find their way to distant places and surrounded by giant critters, one by one, they are" exciting "The nation is not blown away by the people who were created by the monsters first ..." Sad Apara that it sounds like almost a dozen films, has appeared in science phai channels. I wonder what's going on? Sure ... I like Bingo and Hollywood-Hank Vanbabs to be fed by the CGI crew as the next person ... but where is the plot or originality? Guessed, there is a time when the Saifai channel shines. Battlestar Galactica, if a little dark, can be very good. The authors are continuing the life pump in the dedication of various stages and surprisingly the recent import of BBC's good doctor. <br /> <br /> Even in sai-Fi's various "giant animals" movies, animation seems to be good all the time. Compare this to Koinjo in this movie, instead of the first giant combo movie in the science-fay, rather in the incognito version. <br /> <br /> But love ... how about a different plot? Maybe a little different-monster crater? On a whim, I started searching around the Internet. I have found some interesting stories in liter that can appeal to SF fans and the work of Russia's CGI animators at once. I suggest http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-daily that they will contact the author for story rights. (This story contains violent images that are compatible with the majority of scientific-channel channels). <br /> <br /> This story contains the theorem of humanity, moral and moral commentary, and none of them ends in horrific "Did they really kill all the monsters?" The moment, but rather you completely leave and leave a completely different psychological guess. <br /> <br /> Typically what science fiction is supposed to do, is not it?
