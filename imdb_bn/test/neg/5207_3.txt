I have a big time horror fan, and I bought this movie from all the promotions that got on board the message. Well, I tell you, I do not know who was giving these campaigns, but let me talk about a few things. <br /> <br /> All of these pictures are not "much". It's not awesome, not suspicious, not too poor, not too sick (not even a one-season fair) can be scored pretty well .... all of this. <br /> <br /> The main part of the movie is that the couple is a small island in Greece because they have a little arrogance in London. We do not even know what they did, but they think they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** Explosive Alert ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Men's hatred detonates some people from their hatred by "cleansing isolated islands". The killers are cheap, the characters are cheap and the effects are sucked <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, if you can rent this and have 2 hours of waste to go ahead. It is not anything better than a processed cheese sandwich on spicy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
