It is unfortunate that in this film, the Elah Valley, the lion and the brave home for Lamb's are all based on the general practice of war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan. Seamless, war, little fuse, broken marriage, boys are coming out and their friend torch in torch, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> It will happen - yes, but as soon as possible this movie will look like no observer. I think it is unfortunate that these directors / producers / writers like to depict soldiers in such a rhetorical way and choose to choose their closure against political establishment. In this particular movie, Kimberly Pirs did not throw even a bone of ours as new family was shown that a family member was born at the time of being appointed, or some child who can now afford the college, thanks to the GI Bill, or the couple who A home can afford, or start a new business, to gain their citizenship Ray et cetera. Instead, our stereotypes are treated with that because those who made this film just want to show you the bad side. Some problems with the movie: 1) Some people forced Philadelphia to bronze at the bronze station after being forced by the gunmen and later pulled down his group. It's a fool, but yes, it happens. 2) Humvees did not have any bourgeois armor, so we believe it is closer to the beginning of the war, but does each soldier and their brother have an ACOG and have the possible attachment for their M4? Sorry, so do not think 3) Timothy Lieutenant as Lieutenant Colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked that he had turned 40 in May, so the time is not too much. 4) He attacked two soldiers to refrain from being sent to prison and said he would not return to Iraq (he wanted to know that he had stopped). So she's a harmful. Then, when he finally finishes himself, and they take him back, then he keeps his rank and puts it in the same unit? Sorry, do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a giant stereotype of the army and infantry forces. Some of the events illustrated in this film will happen, yes. However, in this film you will get almost every stereootype in the space of 100 minutes and in reality this is not the case for most soldiers to come back. I started with his agenda of the director and then made a point of making a film instead of doing a little better research. <br /> <br /> The best of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post is probably the lion for the Lambs, a comment about the sad situation of Zen Generation Y + compared to the war in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to wait for this movie cable or netflix, do not pay cash directly to it.
