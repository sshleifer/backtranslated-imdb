I've read every Baroness Orkizi scarlet pimperrel book. Count this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. I liked it with Jane Semur and Anthony Andrews. It goes from the way of violence and actions, sometimes violating the book's spirit. I do not expect movies to be stuck directly into plots, I've been idealistic long ago, but if a great movie has already been made, then do not rebuild it with a TV movie which includes nice actors and beautiful clothing. , But a just modest script. Sticking with version 80 ... in Rahane
