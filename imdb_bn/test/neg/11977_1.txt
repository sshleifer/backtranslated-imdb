This game disagreed with Farakis, I had lots of expectations but all nightmare was over. Alongside acting bad visual effects, the intrigue stunt was an absolute flop of humor used even in the film. The movie is not worth watching all. The most interesting part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give the key to the crow. Guess he's got handcuffs all the time. I hope some good directors never rebuild this fantastic game in a movie. And I'll invest some good cash to get right to ACTING right as well as visual effects and visual rights. But do not waste time until you try to watch this movie because it is particularly crazy as you are a farewell lover.
