I'm sorry but my worst movie in this life. I can not believe that after making the first in the series, they were able to get others in the budget. The budget may not be too high - it's the least scary movie I've ever seen and scoffed at all (in fact I can not believe we saw it at the end), but I think it's we do not believe it quite .
