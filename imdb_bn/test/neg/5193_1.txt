Although the film is a feature of release, such as some interesting shots The hanging sheep from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the roof, or the scene of village-abandoned boats (the scene of the scene being displayed naturally "Falini satrons") was more photographic than cinematographer, and an art gallery was enjoyed long over a wall , Which is embedded in a chronic slow film 162 minutes and horror A dialogue, development of extremely bad character, acting, uninspired symbol and heavy stylisation. I saw the first picture of AngelPaulos and his fame was before, I hope so much better, but I can honestly say that it is one of the worst movies, and I will not go out of my way to see any other manager's work in the future. The four friends I went to see it with agree.
