"Flowers for Love" is one of the few forgotten movies of Robert Ottman directed throughout the 1980s. Sham Shepard's screen adaptation with Shepard's main role, it's not just very easy. Altman has made many extraordinary films during his striking career, and he had many blame. But here I think there is a blame for writing such a harmless game with Shepherd. Altman's instructions are confirmed, Performance O.K. What to do with actors is given, but this inconsistent screenplay does not go anywhere and spend time there. <br /> <br /> Shepherd Eddie, who has a love / hate relationship with a girl (Kim Basinger). In the middle of the afternoon, two wars in some dusty Mt. Stellar have ended, when both Eddie and May may be a mysterious (Harry Dean Stanton) a mysterious or original father. Randy Coord finds four people as a gentleman's convenor. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook of the whole plot is that the relationship between Edir and the girl is incomplete. However, this hook seems more like a hostage than anything else. The screen does not explore their relationship in any details and does not use their relationships to explore any public themes. Shepard and Basinner have created intelligent, mental characters that are becoming annoying in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have something to do but provide feedback shots. <br /> <br /> The film is especially bad for the last half-hour or so, when the stories behind Eddie and the girl start playing in the flashback on monotonous words, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Altman's test gone horrible until another one. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
