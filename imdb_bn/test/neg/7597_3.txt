Roger's gradation combined his name in this project, I had high expectations for this film. In the 1960's, Karaman took a fierce storm of a remarkable low budget. I especially enjoyed the adaptation of Poole's stories, such as The House of Asher, and 'The Pott and Pendulam' and 'The Ryan', which starred in the great Vincent Price. These films provided firm play, atmosphere, mystery, strong characterization, interesting plot development and some cool moments were provided. Sadly, 'The Hound of the Damned', in most cases, offers low-budget sugar-special effects, unwanted nudity, and psychological phenomena instead of these qualities. This feature is topped with Quick Editing and Camera Angle. <br /> <br /> The Dead of the Dead starts interesting with some beautiful location shots in Ireland, but it is straightforward from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters that we can care for, or to make suspense - the director starts to count the body. After a brief introduction of lead characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience was bouncing from a 'wonderful' event to another, in this movie, the co-conspiracy was replaced for the development. The lead letters are so sick and are working so badly - the audience does not care what happens to them. To make matters even worse, the 'pieces' events are completely clean or intolerable due to less technology-less budget special effects. Soundtrack lifted from 'Oman' Plots, which are little, take a lot of money from 'Pollertajist' and 'The Legend of Hell House', but there is a lack of quality that makes these films convincing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hunted House Fleiscus, I can check out the classics like Hunting (1963), 'The Innocents' (1961), or see Karamen's first American International films and 'House' Do not pass in 'The Damned' until you are not mochochistic or mindless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Canada
