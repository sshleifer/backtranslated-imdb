I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and the Holy God was bad at it. From the scripts to performance to cinematography - none of it worked. There was so much confusing errors for the time not to mention set designs / constuums (this is more than the end of the late 70's from the end of 2006). Even John Hart, who was usually an amazing actor, was so ridiculous. Imagine, Quinnen Chris is a leading man who started, but there is nothing given to the urt who worked here. I can not say anything other than the audience except the audience. So maybe it's mine. But while sitting beside viewers and directors, the audience loved something at the festival. It is not a very accurate test about how good the film is, or how good it will be. Personally, I was terribly terrible in this movie. On the other hand, it was so horrible that it was lovely. Get drunk and give it a shot when it's 2 years on HBO, if it ever makes it happen.
