If you've seen the series and love the league, then I'm ready to be frustrated. I went to a movie with a group of die-hard league fans and we all agree that this film was not as fun or dark as the three series. According to my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. The text was enclosed and the plot was confused - it is not confusing with what it is trying to do. The writers had the worst kind of selfishness, who are far more gifted than my cruel criticism. Hopefully the league will be honest with at least yourself and will admit this movie is less than the best three series. Despite the majority ownership of the league memorandum I will not be buying it.
