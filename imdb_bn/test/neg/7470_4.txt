This picture was nothing more than drying cheese cheese cheese. It was not an "art" movie; It is simply an excuse to show a number of undesirable, exploitative, final scenes, with extensive male sex nudity. There was a locker room view involving a dozen nude men. Cameras zoom in and zoom in pixels, because they are portrayed for a few minutes after seeing their full disk. There are different views of this photo showing sex after sex. It gets the overwhelming real fast and makes this image incredibly easy to take. I was surprised if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If women are used in this same scenario (for example: completely naked and repeatedly showing their waist) then it will be very easily removed as an excuse to show sarcto porn and too much candy ... which is all about this movie. Any artistic talented gay goto got mentality flushed down the drain. The differences in class, homosexuality, desire and desire etc. were simple and simple; The first year's philosophy is not even better than what the student is expecting. Just cut chasing and instead rented a gay porn.
