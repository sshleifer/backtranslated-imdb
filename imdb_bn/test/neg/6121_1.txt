There was a waste during this movie. Keep it waiting for meaningful money so that it seems to be excellent, fantastic settings, perform well, appear sincere and can move somewhere. It does not happen. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the movie can be tried so hard, it was clearly done very professionally, and a result that does not seem to be less than B-Movie. <br /> <br /> Save your valued time and see Les Vicciers (funny), French Genène de Falté or French films like Mann. I can not recall the language in Europa Europa, but it is another great film - heavy but very valuable watching <br /> <br /> This picture promises a lot but does not provide anything.
