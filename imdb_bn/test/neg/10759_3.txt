During the war of liberation this series, and especially the mini-movie was very important, but I think the series was fairly badly written with a weak cast. Although heart issues are very well-depicted, yet the acting and the script are not strong enough to believe (especially seeing the mini-film) is difficult to understand and understand problems in the film. <br /> <br /> It does not believe that this mini-film or series has stood the test during the time that many scenes are quite ridiculous. Things are still important, but Blackstuff's boys can not help fully understand Britain's problems in the 1980s.
