Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, was a wonderful idea in this detail which surprised the book. While reading this book my head was completely drawn in my head and I knew how each character was feeling. This book was a lot of pieces and when I finished reading this book, I realized that the puzzle was over. After reading the heat of the dark, I saw the movie, which was a mistake. So much important part of the movie cut. For example, in the novel, Marlowe waited a long time for Rivets to fix his boat. This was a big source in vain. The part of that part was just the remainder. The film has added more parts that are not in vain and in no sense made. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book, and Curtz bowed the monkey and killed him. Does the viewer have the view, to express the viewers' apathy? It seems as though the script writer did not read the whole book and decided the parts that were read in the movie. If I could not read the novel in the movie then I would have been completely confused. The book was amazing and it was really a classic in American literature, but the film was nominated for the worst picture of Razzie Awards.
