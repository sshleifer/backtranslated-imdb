I was hesitant to see this movie, I actually enjoyed the original, 'Most Martha'. What a disappointment Kathryn Zeta Jones is a good actress but it's not her movie. The original ruthless moment was, punctuated with an incredible soundtrack perfectly. No reservations felt like it did not connect. Food, Characters - Some felt sensual. In most of the heads, the food became alive - each scene was portrayed in such a way that you can taste it with your eyes - smell, texture. 'In the note reservation' the food was in the background - very rarely we stopped preparing; The characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. It was difficult to finish the film - most of the scenes seemed weird. See original - this is really enjoyable movie; Incredible soundtrack
