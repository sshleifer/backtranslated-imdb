I really wanted to like this movie, but the pacing was very slow. <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful story, but it really would like to see a slug race. <br /> <br /> The movie has been done a lot better, if it had some more work. I do not want to say something grand, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It can also help with songs that set a longer tone / mood in the absence of dialogue. <<br /> <br /> I've seen it for about 10 years, so let me give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (between fours)
