According to his "Histór de la Mussick" (Robert Loughnt, Bauhichis 1973 page 338) "Lucien Rebettet", Beethoven's character was not very consistent with women. She had several "emotional emotions" with female members of "Vietus Aristroscci", whom she dedicated some of "Sonatas". But the musician, even the composer, did not qualify for the husbands of "Fine Women". Hayden was a "servant" of Prince Von Asterhazi, who died of fun drinking or a frequent customer of "prostitution of the street" in Vienna, according to poison and Bethuel Riaat. Newman, a British biographer in New York, said that Beethoven had been contagious infected 40 years ago. For this, he became deaf, but not possible, but not sure. <br /> <br /> The 7th Symphony premiere was premiered on May 7, 1824, with Vienna's Concertnartteretter, the synthesis of House Overture and the first three parts of Misa Solomania. It was the composer's first stage appearance over twelve years; Hall is packed. Although acting director Michael Umlf was directed by the opera of Capelmaster, the Beethoven divides the stage with him. <br /> <br /> So what remains this "female imagination". The interpretation and character of Ed Harris is very good, but very linear, based on the painting of the 1823 Furninand Waldmüller. I have it for me. It shows a man who hates the world (probably hates). Good reason
