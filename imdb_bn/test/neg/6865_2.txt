I can not believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is weirdly bad. Twenty different directors were brought to different parts of the film in different parts of the film, but without any idea of ​​portraying this story, other directors are much more than my expected results. <br /> <br /> I think something was spliced ​​out of the scene - things do not always seem to progress in sequence. The movie works in such a way that we already want to have about half of the letters. <br /> <br /> and Steve Gutenberg attempted to comedy Manik, A-La-Robin Williams in this movie. Ewww And putting a pre-ex-charge in a bunch of kids does not seem realistic in this compound of this day and age.
