This movie was just plain bad. I can forgive low budget movies for low budget but it was not fun, it was not smart, there was no freedom in it, unless you really want to see fake boobs. I do not know this style is probably a teenager, perhaps the boyfriend is awful, but if so - well, it's neither sexy nor scary. It was in vain for Slumpy Party genocide movies; I have never seen previous movies, and except for a scene that tried to combine together, I had no choice but to cheer the psychological killer of Cheerleader, or why they are annoying him, especially because (and I do not think I'm expressing anything here) It was really clear that the cheerleader killer of this movie is not his. As a real killer? I can say, Lum. Really hair When you know why the killer cheerleading squad (and the squad's coach, and the two stoners who are going to the bus, and the bus driver is visible only for its hack) why do you sit? Go there - WTF? The worst excuse for a killer spree "Actor" (two assumptions why I've added quote) generally seem like a porn budget refusal of low budget, which they probably were. Those poor people, try to break the "legitimate" film. One of my friends about Bashar's acting actor said: "She looks like a man that you know that it really gets and her face gets all red and stuff." We had a good look at that. Within half of other actors, the actor had the skill and skill of producing 6th grade of "Annie". Most of the other half seemed to be indifferent to death (especially in a deleted scene, this one red faucet ...), and I was in this movie ten minutes. A note: The DVD has a deleted scene, which was out of NC-17 from the R-rated, if it was released, it was completely ineffective and the adult entertainment was not as good as a quality. The only reason to get bothered with it is disappointment, a lot of smiles.
