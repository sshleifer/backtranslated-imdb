U.F.O. Its movies are always a great way to kill a bit, so on Sunday evenings I chose this flick, hoping that a direct-to-DVD U.F.O. Mystery <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! In almost half of the movie it has become very clear that UFO The theme is a fraudulent way to attract unexpected visitors to this Christian campaign. And it's not just a Christian movie from a Christian Christian. No, this extremist fundamentalist Christianity. Awesome kind <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, the unbelieving leadership has deceived their colleagues by using a curiosity that romanticism has started (which Christians believe is happening) when true believers are going to heaven and ultimately Goes behind the unbelievers). <br /> <br /> When the trick is explained, it is recommended that being true believers always be good. In the case of 'only we are Christians' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Believe in Allah or you will go to hell! Here's the message. Simple, but quite aggressive, really good. Especially because the film is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Now let's assume that you are a Christian fundamentalist and you can not be offended by the themes of this movie, is it a good movie? I'm not afraid. Actually I'm lying: I'm not happy! The acting is horrible, pacing is awesome, plots are horrific, especially the ending is laughable. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately realize that it's going to be worse than your expectations, and you're right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, it tries to set up at least a mysterious UFO, but then suddenly they start babbling about the same devil in this Count Dracula appearance. At first you think this couple is only a crazy madman, but when it gets active, he actually presents the original opinion of the makers of this film. As soon as you start to realize this, you know how this is going to end. But it actually got worse. Avoid <br /> <br />
