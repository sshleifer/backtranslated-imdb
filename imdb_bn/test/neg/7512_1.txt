If you like me, it's going to see a movie history class or something like that in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. I believe, something better than this movie. It's slow, confusing, annoying, badly built, poor, gringy, I need to go? Its message is good, but I saw it was well-managed in many other films. Not even good at acting. This movie is more painful, because it starts as funny (though not theoretical), because it's more than a guest's story, to the end, is simply uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> I really want to tell 1 hours of my life and 40 minutes have been looted. For a 20-minute traffic jam through a traffic jam, anyone who wants to describe a threesome for 10 minutes, listen to a hippie that can make sheep, her husband can take care of rape like a woman <br /> <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is nothing but 1/10. And if you are not satisfied with my preview, then I am an open person and I like movies which are protesting through symbolism, but this movie was just terrible. To avoid this film, create any excuses you can make.
