I love how everyone likes this show love next American sitikom. I saw five episodes of hate, and the only person to come to a real teacher was the old man who loved and hated his servant. The rest of them are just trying to read lines of beautiful people who went inside the actual classroom. I included two idiots of each love (each who laid and those who did not have others) got some form of zany problem that was indirectly involved in their students. The British girl thought that she found an optimal quality like the main stupid, but eventually she suddenly became zakas. The hot chick was there for the special purpose of heating, and the major and its lack of progress in any way leads to the almost uninterrupted conspiracy. I was quite a teacher of almost all of these events, but I want to remind you of your high school days and teachers who are with you. . . They look like that? Or will you go to high school in middle school? That's the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacks any form of research on what goes into school. Principals of government schools do not have the ability of high school teachers and school teachers, but on the school board, but the episode of which I saw the head teacher threatened to set fire to his teacher. Think back to your history class. . . . . Or think history history, have you ever incredibly taught British British chick in American history class? No Have you ever seen a teacher lounge so big that you can actually play basketball? <br /> <br /> <br /> The teachers could really make a great show based on some reality. The stories from interaction with the students make fun lessons and teachers find it interesting because they deal with students every day and day. Out of education, the importance of more than life on their four more cameras has created the sitcom, which says the unreal line in the unrealistic environment in an irrational environment, and I'm sorry, I bought it. The show currently model itself after other successful sitcoms and uses a single camera format, and it should be centered around their teacher's relationship with their students, not with each other. <br /> <br /> It gets a star to try and a star for hot dogs (she was really hot) <br /> <br /> In the end, it can be down in history as a hack attempt to realize a career which was a failed sitcom. I just hope that if they make another sitcom based on learning to learn from their mistakes, such a nudity will never touch on the television screen.
