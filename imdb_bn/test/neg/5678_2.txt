I was a huge "SNL" fan on Chieve Chase, John Beluzee, Dan Acquired, Gilda Rodner and many other memorable stars. But every time I tried to see it for over ten years, I was very frustrated and sometimes hated with it. Ten years ago I believed that the show probably could not survive, since it was completely disconnected from the sunny situation I understood, and it has still been plugged in, which I have always been frustrated, wondering how some of the world is probably all fun May find hairy humor. Whenever I've finished in the last decade, I will never be happy. Indeed, I have always bothered myself to waste time during my stay and my time. For me, the absolute low point came many years ago when popular popular male actor I liked a lot hosted the guest. One night that night, he thinks of a big star, perhaps himself, and screaming, the character of "Mongo", played by Chris Kattan, and it seems like he ended up in the rear of a car. Mongoose is followed by the tops of the actor's shoots and down and down and down, as he is sodomized with fiercely screaming. The audience smiled at the head of their heads and I shouted out to my head, they could find the distant pleasures, wondering whether NBC would even promote such things. Even then, I tried to listen openly over the years, hoping that for many years I would be able to get back to the jolly comedy. But, just a week ago, it was not done for me. Not even close One exception: During the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fai was fantastic, and she was an actor who had tuned me. But those who did not have enough to keep Sarah Palin suddenly, 90 minutes left, and as soon as I heard "it" I heard it on Saturday night as it never stopped, I would always be sorry! "
