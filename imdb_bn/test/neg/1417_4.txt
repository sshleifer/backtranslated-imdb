I saw a screening of this movie last night. I was going to high expectations of it, but was definitely frustrated. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his President. And he became the President in the first 40 minutes. So the movie goes that aspect of that. The first half-hour is ridiculous. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It's a comedy less, and a thriller / play / love story more ... which is in vain. The movie does not go anywhere and is still standing for a good 30 minutes. There are interspersed smiles here and there, but consistently funny part is at the beginning and only begins. At one stage, the biggest pleasure I heard among the audience is that when a crowd of people shouted 'Boo' during a very confusing mental scene. Williams gives equal rights with his ridiculous style, a great performance. Walken is only distributed in a strong support role as he can. I think a character that goes underground is black in the lewis. Continually vulgar and political, see her funny pull down for a PG-13 rating. Overall, I will not pay for watching movies. After all, I saw it for free and even I was frustrated. The first half hours are hard, and all the woods from it. Not really fit into a section, through the film half that it should understand that it should not be more than an hour's comedy central special. 4.5 / 10
