Julie Andrews has warmed up her own self-shoe picture in this highly-produced musical comedy-drama, but if she comes up with her role with the underarm, she is alone. During the WWI, music-aware and German spy both know that Black Edwards's film could target any voice, and expressed the gratitude of Rock Hudson's romantic second puzzle. Musical has been favorable since 1970, and "Star!" Like elephant production And while this picture really came along with "Tamarind Seed", keeping a lot of dead space in her catalog, Andrew's reputation tarnished. I've always thought Julie Andrews has created a great villain or a shady female; His strong voices can really pay attention, and he may hit some short notes that may be necessary or seductive. Husband / director Edwards seems to realize this, but he or Julie can not work much power in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter is not a good partner for Blayy Edwards, and the person does not have his heart in this material too. Better's script just gives Andrew a fabulous sequence - a striptease. * **** to 1/2
