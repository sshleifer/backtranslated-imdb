This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stops my perception that this film really sucks! It is disguised as a "thought film" like Memento and other jewelry, but ultimately, and after a while, you realize that it's nothing but scary cr4p. Perhaps some collage students with his colleague friends wrote that his writing sucks to tell him. What is the whole idea? I do not even know whether I tried to scratch on the miracle, or they want to trust us because someone fills your intellect (very weak, BTY) with stupid "holes", you learn about repeated types of elementary school, you suddenly Come "one true", then you have to kill someone and accept ?? !!! What? How, what, why, why? Just like making the cake, just throw a bunch of elements, and add water ?? Forgot to cook it? I guess these guys have forgotten, do not explain, but why this incident happened? When you present a simple story, you have to do it, everyday tasks (false riddle rhymes) begin to start an abnormal impact on humans. The act was awesome, the girl always looks beautiful on camera, and the Hilanders series works like a heavy metal record store (yes, they are all real-world). "Oh-so-cute" REDELS ("enter 60-bitman and Robin series with Riddle's guest appearance)" and "tragic" atmosphere and those crazy people claim to make "the smile" of that smirk? <br /> <br /> I'm very part of a very low budget movie, and instead of their inconsistency, instead of being more appreciative than their qualifications, you know, but it's just a ugly excuse for a movie that gives you one and a half hours You will want to keep good and ultimately you'll be sorry for it that you've read it for.
