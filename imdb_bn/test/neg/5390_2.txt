Other posts mostly beat this movie and deserve it. I just got to kiss the filmmakers in technical uncertainty. If the director knew at least one body, he had lunch with them, because it was not a good idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! You have been warned !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sniper school instructor uses a sub-machine gun (pistol caliber) to oppose a rifle, which we estimate will be more efficient. <br /> <br /> The night vision of a poor party member is more than the eye optics rifle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A 200-year-old reenimated an American American skeleton of an attitude of riding an immortal war horse with a long spear and a serious nosebleed? I do not think, Bubba <br /> <br /> <br /> (Some people have already mentioned this.) <br /> <br> The parties "air support" contain a universal "black helicopter", only under it there are some side-mounted missiles. Some people have forgotten to say hello crew that Skeleton Man can not fly, and they are in America's Hartland, where there will be no enemy aircraft. They should instead carry some air in the ground missile. <br /> <br /> Helo's ground forest consists of a door gunman with a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?). He only needs to tell the dirt hit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> not below the helicopter, Mr. Director <br /> <br /> I could not accept anything after this point (about 30 minutes). You need to seriously drop a morphine through this flick, it's just that painful.
