Perhaps the worst film in the existence style It was announced as a comedy, but only sadly unfortunate. I do not think anyone could achieve something more terrible and annoying if I was specifically requested. This is the poorest toilets humor, I even want to avoid watching the trailer. I just went to see it because it was announced that you like Monty Python, but you are bound to love it. Anyone who wrote that is either prejudiced or serious deranged. I'm still stupid how can believe in such a statement. Very rarely I leave the movie, indeed, I have many attempts for a film to have such an effect: it did in 30 minutes.
