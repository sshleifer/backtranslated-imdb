I've lost roughly most of the film, and I usually understood this kind of great movie great work as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me) and Darren Arnafsky (PI). It does not just combine the formation of a complete coherent film, because NorthFork does not sense in some level. After the time the movie was over, its themes and objectives became clear, but during my initial watching, I was really confused, and I see it is the main fault of this movie ... its lack of direction In 1955, this center was vacant in the downtown suburb of Northfark, Montana, and floods would soon cause hydropower dam construction. The main problem is that it is not willing to move and move its residents. Prior to drowning out of the cities, a group of men is hired to force residents to leave the city, and in most cases they are successful in some great conditions and urban people. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irune, a very sick child (or a fallen angel?) Whose parents returned to Northphark to orphans due to his illness. Father Harlan (Nick Nolt) is worried about the mortal Irwin, but Irwin imagined (or he?!) A group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) came to the solitary and empty city to find a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels firmly that his scars are spreading his wings and Halo to the people. Oh yeah, and all this time an amazing curious walking creature that straddles the landscape. There are many other small things happening in the film, but none of them ends far more than a passing plot. One might appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is clear that filmmakers take a deeper look at this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still works hard to differentiate and then ends up and wipers without much to do. Statement. As I wrote earlier, it has become clear, long after watching, probably what happened in this picture. Irwin is going to die, and in Northfork, and in dealing with his own loss and death, Irwin has probably made ideas from the objects around the orphanage, which he has been released to release, and his life is near its end. But then again, perhaps he is an angel, and he is available in his kind and can now return home. I insist that the film has some really beautiful moments, heartwarming, lively and loneliness and full of depression. Unfortunately, the film itself feels completely disconnected and on the other hand it feels incomplete.
