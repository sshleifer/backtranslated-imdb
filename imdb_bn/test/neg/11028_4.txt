When I bought 4 DVDs for 5 pounds in the local store, it should have been careful enough that this movie was not up to the standard criteria of David's Cellular Productions. I was waiting for a real deal with a cast like James Stewart and Carol Lomber. Many other commentators have said that this is a diverse mix of conspiracy and scenes that do not believe strongly. However, I'm very happy that I saw this movie because I am now reminded that seeds will never stop you from enjoying melon. Live by This should add everyone's life. Those who pick the seeds or spit them or swallow - and then enjoy watermelon - life itself.
