I did not see the other two "ninja" movies and I know that everything is known, but for some reason I saw it. This is the start of this fast as this one goes on a super killer spree of the Nizam. Because he takes quite a few bullets to go down, almost unstable. Although he was not out of counting until he was holding a woman and then he continued his killing using her as her tool. Another ninja enters inside and obviously the only way to kill yourself is to volunteer with another ninja. Ultimately, a great war started because the dead ninja went back into her body and they came out completely in battle. It's actually better sound than being turned, but at least it was not boring.
