This film is totally incredible. The only way for a girl to perform this task on the dog, if it has serious health problems or has a long history of sexual abuse or is buried. Yet we are convinced that otherwise the 'normal' healthy woman has got a little annoyed and 'made a mistake' and above it was sex with the dog. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With its own choice a pet dog The activity is completed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But for the sake of this belief we must believe that it is a woman who is capable of doing anything if she feels 'right'. Think about it - did he consider the right and wrong of this step before executing it? If he closes his track. People have natural boundaries because of them. Now if we start to think of 'clever' as a bit annoying, then what's next? Child abuse? Yet the 'heroine' painting has been shown to work harder, beautiful girl, who had an annoyance at one moment. If he was forced to do this work by the persecutor - the story could be more knowledgeable and I would be able to accept the story. But there is no way to carry out lasting activity and even to be mentioned once - if there is nothing deep, it needs psychological support. <br /> <br /> I know it's just a movie, but it is by ordinary behavior that makes it social through the media and much more. The terrible reality can be possible. <br /> <br /> I can imagine an abusive person to point out to a child that it is not such a big deal and then continues with their agenda. It can be used by an abuser to underline a child not to abuse - because if you do so, how people will react to you. <br /> <br /> This is not true. The director wanders thinking about the truth about it. It is a matter of diminishing and how easily people (visible public) are tied to the right path, they can be used to accept the most terrible concepts. Observer public missiles, frustrated and laughing. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that is being humiliated by actors and viewers, and fools in a very sophisticated way through intelligent but very annoying films. The author <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture seems to be being used as a vehicle for film makers for my passion to play with heart. I do not know whether it is conscious in their part - but this is my biggest example that I've ever encountered Mind F ***. <br /> <br /> I hope it does not blame anyone so much. But if you have watched this movie - I do not think there is any room left to be offended by anything.
