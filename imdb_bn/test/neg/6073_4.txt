Yes, I understand that half a dozen other critics called this movie "Amadeus copying", but it may not be enough. The scenes are taken directly from Miles Form's scripts with the sponsor changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> - The arrogant scene of the mothers ("I am the voice of God. All the other meaningless!") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Medieval composer works (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulens, like Amadeus) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The medium composer dialogue with media ("Why do you raise me with music but refuse to compose me?") < br> <br /> - From the scene of death musician ("Sadhna Start time with violin ... cough cough ") <br /> <br /> - and the list is going on ... <<br /> <br /> The problem is worse. These scenes were not copied to shame, they were not done very well. Zipers, if you're going to delete a root, at least try to improve it yourself. <br /> <br /> Do not wait, there is something worse than that. It is true that the director tried to defeat the story of Moorette in Beethoven's story. People, Beethoven was not a crushing, this film was like a rude slab to portray him. Furthermore, Beethoven is not a fool stupid, 23-year-old music student took pointer from his copyist. Unfortunately, such a movie is responsible for the slaughter of history. <br /> <br /> Another thing, in Beethoven (in real life), never tell Sonata in the movie. The name that was given by the confused critic after a few years of Bithovan's death, and unfortunately it was trapped. But Bitoveen's original title was "Kossi Una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> Another thing, when Beethoven (in the film) "B flat! B flat! b flat!" And hit the note in the piano, he's hit a white key! <br /> <br /> Another Things !!! A few years ago, Beethoven (in real life) was the deaf enough to write his 9th symphony. This movie shows him a slight disadvantage ("what?" Every other line, just enough to be annoying). <br /> <br /> Chat ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American pronunciation ...! Oh do not think anything Do not miss anything. I've already lost this enough time. See again "Amadeus". Then, if you want to see an interesting biology of Bithovan's life, see "immortal boyfriend" which takes poetry but at least they are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something next to the lighter, see a film "Imprint" about Chopin. But away from those three, I have not seen a good respect for a classical musician.
