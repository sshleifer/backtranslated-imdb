Princess Warrior is a scientist fiction film, which is a beautiful thin plot-mainly two sisters of their queen mother, one evil and one good, for control of the throne of death. The good sister is being beat up so she escapes to the world where she gets naked in a strip club in the middle of the wet T-shirt competition. The rest of the movie is basically a long chat scene, because the bad sisters try to find and kill the younger sisters. But the little sister was assisted by Bob, an impressive DJ, and the police involved everything and the good sister Earth customs and the ignorance of culture, everything is complicated. The older sister caught her younger brother several times, but later she escaped and escaped again. In all these activities, to bring a good sister back home, there is a realistic age sensor in the home planet. Sadly, a good portion of this movie seems like a boring car charging scene while driving around Los Angeles (and if the police car crashes, what is the effect of that word?) The film is likely to end up with another physical fight between the sisters. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Star Wars (in the opening and subsequent scenes, the look of the girls' house), and more. Hu (transport booths like phone booths)) and some clothing (from home planet sources) can be taken from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Mrs. In another user's commentary, Fan Fredisti (mischievous sister in the film) mentioned "an endless (and dull) wet T-shirt competition, it's the longest wet T-shirt competition in movie history, and only where competitors were wearing cotton-polyester shirts in industry power. Defied all efforts to get them wet and transparent. "I could not say it better. The only thing I would add is that the music of this scene is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting has gone up, but it seems like the whole genre of the movie. The actors playing Vini and Vito were too much for me - I just found them annoying. Curette was enjoying himself and did not take the whole issue very seriously, who strongly played against Sharon Lee Jones, but took everything seriously. All the police have been portrayed as satiric idiots, perhaps adding comic relief, it is unnecessary, which the whole movie was rather ridiculous. <br /> <br /> From a rating point of view, this film has many nasty language; Some helpless women and others wear sparse clothes, but there is not enough skin to satisfy those looking for nudity; A non-graphic arty is a sex scene that has been depicted in dreamlike fashion; And a little violence-although there was a threat of violence, both war and rebellion scenes were exaggerated, and many camps could be "offensive", although it seemed that the actors enjoyed a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I wonder who came with the name of the character? Ovul (a small egg), a curate (a surgical device used for scraping and cleaning), Xmas (suspected to be a disease marked by skin and pruritus scaling), blememia (a eating disorder with beating and peering) and rickets (another disease) ? <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad, low budget, campus, science-fiction action film, but it kept me entertained, although it may require some drinks before I can see it again.
