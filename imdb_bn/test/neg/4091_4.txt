I've enjoyed Bruce Almighty very much but minutes I saw Jim is going to be a signal without Kerbery, I knew it was bad. Steve Carroll was violent in the first movie but (my leftist view is my darling), and in my opinion, to blame him for his role in the office, he is quite weak in this extraordinary comedy. I'm curious, how much work the author of the script is, because we can do just as well without stories. But if we tear a huge plot hole, why did the elephants and lions come to help Ian when the flood was only concerned about the special area of ​​Washington?) The film was easy ... not funny. I did not smile once and as far as I remember, a comedy forced you to laugh. Or at least gigabytes This is not the one. <br /> <br /> There are small hopes. The "family" of Ivan Almighty is written on it, and perhaps it can be enjoyable to see a family (kids can be entertained by different animals and stupid jokes), but for me Ivan the Almighty is not just spending it. <<br /> <br /> I give it a 4/10 and hope that Carell will be more cautious when choosing her role in the feature.
