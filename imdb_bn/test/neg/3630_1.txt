The main character of Blond, always believe everyone and when you can stay together you can do something! The best friend of the shy guy with soft hair (knocked out from the gordo) wants to be a film director, the secret crush in the zoo. The best friend of Spanish (shouting from Miranda) is the weird smart queen Queen (bursting from Larry Tudman) and the popular stock up Prog Logan (Kate of Rip Off) and Joey's little brother, Mac, boring (Matt of Rip) <br /> <br /> Joe is a half-popular girl, two best friends. The only thing missing of it is the funny little Sastik cartoon Lizzie Mcguire, and Hilary Duff was a lot cuter. Jamie Lynn Spiral Tubes looks more like teeth teeth at the top.
