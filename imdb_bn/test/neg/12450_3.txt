Slowly running horror movie plays a terrible role - but a pleasant place and clothes for praise and of course, Timothy Dalton, who always does a compulsory job. I wanted to laugh loudly in the voice over - so stupid !! But Dalton is always valuable in bad movies, even a wonderful actor, older, but still very handsome and even obsessed with the marshal. This movie is only valuable to him ... and he seems to be a bad dime romance novel, poor colleague. Seeing your time in 1970's "Worthington Heights" or the BBC version of "Jane Eyre" in the 1980s Dalton will look better. Poor Sela Ward, is so beautiful, but woody .... Surely he has been good in other movies.
