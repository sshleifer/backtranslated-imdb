This horrible date, though, I must stress ... please, no remedy! Actually, it will not only help, because there is nothing that can be added or changed, in contemporary, this movie can make better. Based on this, the novel was atmospheric, well written, really amazing work, but the film did not translate it. The best works written by King failed to translate into most of the films. I'm not sure why this is, but when you see this work, if you see it, you can see what you want to see. <br /> <br /> book? It's nice This is not a great composition, but it is not only entertaining. <br /> <br /> movie? Do something else. You can thank me later <br /> <br /> it rates 3.1 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br />
