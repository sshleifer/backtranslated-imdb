I must admit that despite being nominated for all media promotion and Oscars, my expectations from the movie were not so much before looking at it. And I really found what I expected; A movie is trying to be selective for both the conservative and liberal of Turkey, it is authentic for foreign viewers and is trying hard enough for everyone. But it should be understood that it is not possible for everyone to be favorable, so the film holds everyone as average. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is telling a story within 24 hours. To fit a short film short story length, some scenes are added without connecting to the original story. These mostly sell ice cream scenes to strange people (such as goats, old women etc.) and these selling scenes try to be attractive to the spectators by curiosity dialogue with the audience. This issue has been referred to as a universal problem: the organization of local producers and business organizations and the struggle against monopoly rights, but it was interesting 20 years ago. Most of the readers will remember the "Hero of the Supermarket Against Supermarket" from Sensui again in the 1980's. This was the right story at the right time. Soon this story is a powerful and not very valuable movie. <br /> <br /> Except some Gibra due to local cavity, cast performance is so successful. The main role is played by Toran Ozdemi with excessive body language but whatever is also successful. <br /> <br /> The versatile endeavor of directors, directors and players is a good mood for the film. . But as a result of this film it is not appropriate to compare with Italian Neo-realists or nominee Oscar. Note: In real life, usually ice cream dealers will stop their production. And may be one of the brand name brand competitors.
