The first two films of this series excelled for the general people trapped in their footage and society in the natural world. There is no natural footage in this movie that I understand is a part of this point, but it really is completely integrated into the entire video element of the video and feels like random images - flying around one and the other zeros, human computer model skeletons, and so forth. Sometimes the stock footage can have a good effect (Nationalism / Finance Segment 35:00), but generally it considers the video as a lack of meaningful content and claims that you are the director of the stock photographer instead of the director. It's not better than a video displayed on a caro machine. Three-star Philippe Glass added for the soundtrack.
