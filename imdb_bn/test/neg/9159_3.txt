I was genuinely thinking that the movie is going to be chessy, though I've liked Albin and Chipmunes for a long time! I was very wrong. It was a lot better !!! This is the best movie since October! In my opinion, everyone can see this holiday season in the movie! Enchanted (I thought, though ...) was awful, the Golden Compass was right, but the end was quite crappy for fans of its dark ingredients, and I'm Legend, well I still have not seen (or National Treasure 2) but it's just showing. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give anything, but this movie is great for anyone, especially kids!
