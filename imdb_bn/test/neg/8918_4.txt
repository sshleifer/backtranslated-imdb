I've just seen you die today. It's bad, almost too bad <br /> <br /> 1) Directions and edits are awful, just awful. Often, I had closed the movie, there is no idea what Fanterlaraye (director) is doing, he is delicately portraying things and not understanding some of the scenes. Also, I used to hate the same scene again in the same movie, some scenes were used 3 or 4 times in this movie. very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awkward. I wish they wanted to create the character of Sigal and the character of the trace seemed like a similar relationship to the letters of Lethal Weepon, but it just did not work, because the dialogue did not create some senses and I spoke in English very well, I understand it I can not say that the lines were loud and the line of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is quite bad. Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies? Sigla's wife has mental power in the movie? Is it beneficial for the movie? No Seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for betraying him and he knows these people by not meeting them in this movie. Stupid The story sometimes goes off the track and jump back without any reason. The story is sometimes dirty and dull. They should keep it simple and it should work. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action scenes it is not Seagal, it doubles its stunt. You can say because they only show him the movie from behind and never show his face. He also hits boys with film martial arts, not like Asido Steven. Stunt double cheesy uses kicks and punches. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven movie is good. The line 90-95% is called with its real voice. The rest is sinking but it's not bad. This was good. Steven also thinks of enjoying himself in the movie, and he has more to do in the Siberdade move. He loves the trach as a partner; At least he does not seem to dislike him. Also, he is better in comparison to his recent films. I wear clothes to hide her body, but she thinks that she is wearing the DVD cover she is right, and for most of her films she does not have stupid long leather coats. <br /> I really think Segal is ready to make films like this. It does not seem like a coincidence that he came late and the events that started from set on two movies directed by Fauntleroy. I think he understood that the crew was amateur or just for hurry and he did not blame anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a good company and crew it was probably very good action movie for Seagal. Something like justice or for the sake of law. I honestly believe that. But those who made the movies were not very good at their job or they did not have enough money to do the job properly. Very bad because I liked Steven in the movie and the trach was very cool (Ice Cool), but the rest were bad. Hey, at least this gives me hope for black don and past shadows. I think the basics can be managed badly. But Hey, Steven returned to the same mood while making his film, and at least this film is reason enough to see it. <br /> <br /> I like it, but it can be a lot better. 4/10
