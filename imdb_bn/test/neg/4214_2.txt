There was nothing like this movie book. I think the screenplay writer wanted to write the sign of the song with the Wide and was humiliated. This was his way of getting his ideas in any way. The only similarity between the story of the film and the story illustrating the story was the name of the main characters and the main steps. This is not the case in any book shown in the movie. For a mass with Win fan (both in books and movies) this was quite frustrating. If you like the Scarlett book, do not expect to watch this movie play on the screen. They only share the common title
