I often spend time writing my reviews as long as I see the movie, but today you die, I think it will be a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's how bad this film is here. In the mid-80s, the single appearance of Steven Siegel was enough to pull your ribs; A full scowl can stop your feet off. If he really holds you, he'll tear you like a goat. <br /> <br /> This day, though he is still able to do enough harm, he will not see any part. She did not know that the seed has gone and she has never called it. He managed to walk still, still to see constipation in the foot as he dumped into his pants, and he had been weighed. Her trademark has long gone to the ponytail, but her hair still looks stupid. How this guy works in the movie industry is outside of me <br /> <br /> Today you die bone cranking fight, car crash, gun fight and general sigill mixture of pyrotechnics. Sigal spoiled his way through dull scripts, offering his line with zero enthusiasm or reliably. In this third-rate activity, he is trying to go straight to Harlan Bank with the thief, who is ready to take part in the $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets caught, goes to jail, escapes, takes revenge. Yawn <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful carriages and gunfights which are spreading annoying stuff (many of which are there), but other comments of IMDB are being reported that it has actually been borrowed from other well movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, recent efforts. The most ridiculous of her Ebonics (slang in African American streets) is her complete embarrassing effort. 'I'm the man, the show'? No, actually Steven, you sound like a donkey! A ridiculous script and plot line that does not go anywhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. And the final moment, where Harlan banks protect the child from closure, they are enough to break you. <br /> <br /> Threat, I just looked at the watch. I was very proud to enjoy trashing this steaming shield, I went the way on my five minutes. Time to post this comment and to see something decent.
