Calling this movie will be a loss of complete waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> The acting was at least uncomfortable to say at least, especially actor Craig Fang, who could not work hard. As far as the story goes ... well ... what story ?! "Film" Harry Lee, a Chinese-born Malaysian, who returned to his country after being leaked to each country and tried to start the band. You might think - throwing tensions between the band, band members and raising a few ethnic tensions. <br /> <br /> The problem is also covered with any subject that even the most amateur directors are covered. The film is everywhere and the whole thing is joined with parts that even the most serious critics of hair end. <br /> <br />
