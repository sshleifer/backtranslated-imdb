I do not really believe that producer George Lucas is not really ready to create a terrific signal to be a "glorious graffiti". But on the opposite side it was the first crack in its seemingly absurd armor. Directly coming out with the huge success of "American Graffiti" and originally produced as "Star Wars", Lucas successfully removed Kapolo without refraining from directing himself. The result is usually Lucas - it is much more interesting and interesting than the actual material in terms of its structure. Author / Director Bill Norton has allowed to use a variety of different screen proportions and split screens to produce diverse associations in the image. Although the charms of the four stories are interesting to watch, the style eventually reflects only the broken image of the picture. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original film tells about the "last big night" before the end of school and Kurt (Ron Duffy) and Steve (Ron Howard) go to college. This is a very important thing, despite the fact that the film is one thing that creates the original character at the beginning of it, and finally it comes back again. Nick Ray has a tendency to be "rebellious without rebellion", where the fixed period becomes very elastic and gets more money than that fixed time actually in real life, but everything takes place in a fixed place. "More American graffiti" is the main opposite - the place is very dynamic, with the closure of Todd Martin (Smith) in Vietnam, his ex-girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clack) is accompanying Hippie to San Francisco with Steve and Laurie (Syndi Williams) Barclay student protests with the party, and John Miller (Paul Le Mate) ran half-pro circuit. At the first meeting of the film, all the policies are brought together to look at the public eye, but then the threads do not return together and basically disconnect what they do. Instead they are divided and for over 3 years we follow the letters, looking at only different events in the days before the new year of 1967, 68 and 69. Visitors are easy to get confused and I think it's just that we say. Although the original film compresses passage events in important events and unrealistic periods, without experiencing those events, even creating the experience of Nostalgia, this signal is real and dragging and extending some plot points from the conventional title. Make them into a cozy film. <br /> <br /> The best part of me is with SF Candy Clark and nominee Charles Martin Smith. Some jokes flatten, but those styles are attractive and they form a clear contrast with each other. If these parts are a little good then a good movie can be made, and if the other parts are not such a drag. Talking about drag racing, talking to Milner, a foreign exchange student was completely false, really hair, vague, and did not help throwing a cameraman for Maconzi Phillips. It was just another converted moment when they briefly explain why the cart is not in the film because he is already in Canada. Instead, another brother of Laurie who originally got in contact with the cart, but has a different name and is now played by a very annoying actor. Some Vietnam stuff has a black-type mockery, which I think, Lucas and John Miles's original idea was the same as the original idea of ​​"Apocalypto Now". And in San Francisco scenes that have some fun fun in some fun movies of fun. But still with those fun things, it's dragging the rest of your movie, like someone like Steve and Laurie want to debate in their terrible suburb residence that they are auditioning for Spielberg's film about divorce and infant abandonment. I think those parts of the movie are not so painful, but it will not be comparable to the first film because there is no tie up here and there is no idea that they are coming back or learning something together. They are exchanged for money, when they refrain from money or something, imitating the cheap cheap frame of "Two Lane Blacktop" and many more good movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, this movie has a great soundtrack of proprietary hit hits for its own sake, and it often makes the movie self-playable. Country Joe and fish performance are fantastic, and Scott Glenn saw everyone as a hippie with the candy clerk, seeing he saw - I'm also surprised, even if he wants to use a wig behind him? I probably could not recommend this movie, and yet there is some small affection in my heart because I love the original too much. Over the decades I have assumed that this film must definitely ensure that it is really impossible that I remember it. This is a party killer but it wants to see every fan of "American graffiti" or George Lucas at least once or twice. It shows how much effort can go on and it may still be half-baked. What makes you reflect on a miracle that Lucas actually actually made a good film as "American graffiti", as if all the ingredients are contained and placate all the appropriate deities. Unfortunately this was not the case for the film or Bill Norton.
