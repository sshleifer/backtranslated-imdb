The story of "The Stranger" is illustrated by the 1969 film "Journey to the Far Fide Side of the Sun" (Gary and Sidivena Anderson's 'Thunderbirds' and 'Space: 1999' fame). A parallel universe shows the world of both films. But there are differences here. Whereas "The Stranger", in order to maintain the independence of citizenship in the world of "The Stranger", "The journey to the sun far away" shows only a true mirror world, where handwriting, roads, houses, all kinds of equipment and of course the internal organs were all opposite (or mirror) orders. So, the parallel world is the only connection to both films. Similarly, the TV series "The Land of the Giants" came in front of two films directed from 1968 to 1970. The Earth was almost parallel to the planet that the planet destroyed by the giants 12 times in size. There was unanimity on the government's idea to capture and hold similar "universal people" in the context of "The Stranger" more than the ancestor of "JT TSSSSSS". Perhaps like "LOTG", a series of "stranger" was hijacked. If it turns into a TV series, it has become a scientific version of "The Fujitsu", with which star Glenn Corporation was followed by Weekdays weekdays, hidden in various places etc. BTW, along with a powerful script, helped this film.
