This movie is crappy beyond any limits. It's incredible - a very bad ripoff from Josh and other (good) shark movies. A really bad one - everything is really unfortunate. The story is purest shit, bad actors, the effects are very cheap, no creativity whatever. It looks like some really poor children took jads scripts and made it randomly, their parents took them 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, some of the "lift" music is soft, and when nothing happens, it is too optimistic, when the shark is near or when the children are frustrated, a little less optimistic (again listening to loud lift music). Carlo Maria (writer) should be so ashamed to ask him to remove his name from the title! The movie works like a perfect demonstration, just as unclear music will be destroyed *** A *** scene is supposed to be thrilling. There is a major difference between the jaws: At the beginning of the jaws, there are stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. Well, trying to kill a shark with dynamite. When it does not work, people take a *** big load ********************************************** The main way to catch this fishing is that I must admit! They used many war criminals as they would try to kill the battlefield (I would guess the Bismarck class of Battlefield) or other Panama channels to dig. It's just incredible. I'm glad they did not try to use Napplem-Flamethrower or a strategic nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad nearly 2-meter shark. Well, in this mystery there are mysterious invisible native Indians (who look like a German pension). This is not a movie, it's a warning example how bad the movie can be! It's useful as a warning. But the public should be protected from this punk. Most of the Italian movies are bad, but it's really the exception of the word ... in the worst case.
