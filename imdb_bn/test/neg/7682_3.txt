Sorry guys, I love Ray Bowler's work, but the thing that he takes is not a leading man. Maybe if you pretend to be the last man in the world, this romantic plot can work but it's coming now! <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that was only available to listen to the title song, which was a big hit for the live band. Previous year (1951). And some beautiful nifty songs and dances save it from total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the 1952 musical comedy quality story line is unfortunate. And the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in Paris's Cologne. Conversation is big, day and bowler embarrassing. Only the Boyhood Church of Cloud Daufin keeps its character in three dimensions. <br /> <br /> How to enjoy this movie on the video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through all the conversations ... <br /> <br /> Be yourself surrender to Dolis Day's voices and Ray Bowler's loose-football. And do not miss the Dupine's hilarious rain "Ventilation of April Paris", from reviving ventilation ...) Finally, keep some bottle cobbler cool and effective. <<br /> Bob Raymond
