The COC was his moments. I enjoyed the order of action, but I despise the screen and the plot. I hate this picture so much, I just write the least part. After all, the plot will never happen. Second, the atrocities of the President of China were uncertain. That does not happen. Finally, dialogue It is understood to employ non-Chinese artists to play Chinese role, but to completely stop dialogue for them dumb! Understand the Chinese people in the film, for you, what you mean.
