I do not understand why this movie (or many) has come up with 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there is a low rating for any reason? Sure, this might be a zombie flick with some splatter, but that's it. I did not have a hater in the zombie movie, but this was terrible. Indeed, indeed, I should call it more like a zombie-soap, because that's how it's acting. Production ... well, all right. Plot development, horror performance, stupid effects, clich√©s, and a sudden ending is rarely an attempt. Go ahead and like the zombie movie, but never do this on top of 5.0. Actually, you have to laugh for the only reason you can see this movie. Seriously
