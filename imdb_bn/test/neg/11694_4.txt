According to the opinion published somewhere else, I expect more than Korean horror if I see it as a story of the same two children in the same adolescence. Without special effect spending budget, this movie has the same power. Think Amytiville Awful <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this 30-minute short film concept, this film can be called well, 2 hours in which trees and terrorist scenes do not frighten you, but rather "what ..." can not be made to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Those who hold this film have given this lasting impression, they must have an intimate heart attack when moderate horror movies set it.
