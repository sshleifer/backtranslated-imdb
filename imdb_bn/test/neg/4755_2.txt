I really do not know that this movie can get a rating of 4 in IMDB. It's just a huge mess, and I must admit that I really liked AVP 1: no story is closed, okay, I can stay with him, but at least they've reached almost the most points. Not avp 2 After stupid firmness is presented, half-hour silly and unexpected teenage clich√©s, fake dials and silent clips are there, except for some alien scenes that feel the excuse of the first half of the film and the Predator scenes that you ask yourself if the guys who made the film even though Any other predator has seen the movie or just being anxious Taking care not mean enough. <br /> <br /> After that, the cat-festivity finally gets the point where the aliens start to attack or at least this way. And boy, that hunter is stupid, blind and deaf. It's boring How he is managed to earn even that income is beyond me. He misses almost every shot, only if he is correct in his face or gives notice to the alliance or if needed for the script, where he can go to where he can go. He is caught by surprise even by human youth and deputies punished all the time. Is that guy supposed to be? Immediately after the first hour of that hatred, I would put my head down in front of every scene. Without any "heroes" or stupid actions, without any incredible stupid conversations, stupid predator actions or stupid short cuts to any scene in this movie. <br /> <br /> Then the thing was finished. For my frustration only me and my friends did not want to know who to cry or cry, but I was crying very loudly about leaving the room, they forgot about 1 1/2 hours. Do not look <br /> <br /> Ever.
