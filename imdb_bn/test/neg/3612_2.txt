After a unfortunate accident with their boat, a group of tourists were stuck on the island of Snake. They are forced to spend the night and you probably are not known as suspects because it is not known as Snake Island, because it's just so funny - it's a history of disappearing people after the other because of a large population population. This will happen with poor stupid souls. It's a very annoying and usually movie with tons of screen snake attack and the lobby performance of Nobby actors. The only entertaining scene is absolutely unnecessary and compulsory strip scenes that people can not see, a PG13 rated movie. You are in the movie of SSSSSSS snake-out, but do not torture yourself with this shit.
