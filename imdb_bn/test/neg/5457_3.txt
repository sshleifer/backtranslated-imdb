The TV director Neel uses numerous projections to kill people as human beings. <br /> <br /> A strange horror movie sitting in front of your eyes that is sitting in your eyes and wondering why you see it. I'm finally sitting in the cinema and I'm not really able to give more than what I was about because I attracted my attention with other things. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this. I think my feelings are best summarized that I paid twice a dollar fee for the DVD and I think its opinion is closed.
