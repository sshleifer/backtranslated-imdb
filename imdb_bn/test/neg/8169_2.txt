Trying to get out of the vault of saltwater taffy for about three hours while watching "Baghban". This Indian film is a sticky sweet, horizontal soap opera that starts with "King Lear", moves to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle section and returns to "King Lear" again to end his tear-rash. </ br> <br /> Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who thinks a man is likely to go out of life: A wife who knows him, a family loves him, and after the job, he will retire, faithful service is a lifetime. Although Raj and his wife have been worshiping for 40 years and have four elder sons, they still hit the bride, behaving like curiosity and stroking some love, keeping eye on each other and having sweet drunk in each other's ears. Almost nausea. In fact, the whole bloody Brude is so happy, loving and well-groomed that they look like a terrible trumps like a functioning family. Parents and children joke together, laugh together, or even spontaneously performers singing together the "spontaneous" song-and-dance numbers (like many Bollywood productions, "Tigers", a play that is spread by a great number - in this case, A lot more extraordinary <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not know the story story knows that this kind of illogical pleasure is long Punish for It can not be done, and that joy is only scheduled to come crashing down on our unsuspecting revelers head of some terrible catastrophe, just beginning to wonder, we are surprised at the horror of the first hour of the film, as soon as we get surprised and take a form of this disaster. In the hour, when Raj declares to his children that he and his mother after them Bibber decided to go with someone who would choose between kids and their own husbands. Suddenly, discovering hidden hidden spheres of family like King Lear, the king finds his children to share their boyfriend, vain and share their homes. Eager and live with their parents, as they originally thought. Potentially possible, to encourage the kids, their parents' plans, with a plan that the king will live together with their children, and worship will live with others; Then they will be closed, eventually, each child has the opportunity to host both the parents and then the cycle will repeat the infinitum of the ads themselves. Many children in disguise, parents are involved in planning, even though they love each other deeply and sometimes have not been separated. Thus, the second and maximum third of the two women (though married) lovers have spent each other away from them, even though their ungrateful, insensitive little cats do everything in their power, helping their parents understand how they do not have their unwanted house <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Ray and Pooja for each other and intimate intimateity of the family unit, that is so deeply equipped in the first love that this image is almost reduced by the weight of sensitivity. Then, without virtually any warning, the screenplay turned into a dime and transformed children's corrupted, self-centered monsters and parents into a passive, harmful victim of the atrocities. Very little long and visionary eyes in the king and worship tooth, pouting, unexpected love bits, self-reliant to make children more lovelorn better than the parents of four growned children. The style of violet prose, which underlines and highlights each emotion, causes a heavy reliance on composer music for intense reactions and great response shots and punctuation. Musical releases a specific freedom at the beginning of the number, but they continue for a long time and they rotate so frequently that they can quickly lose their functionality and can only paddle an element of inappropriate proportion. At least a full hour can not be excised from this bloated production, having no clear damage - and something quite good. There is no reason to punish this image for three hours. The most harmful is the seemingly endless haraanga, which leads us to the end, a statement where Raj (who has somehow led to change his experience as an award-winning radio dealer) talks about the authenticity of the relationship between parents of all of us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
