Another example of a woman-in-prison. It's not a genre known for quality images, but it's the highest one notch below. They are taken from a bunch of women from bordellos where they work in a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are very poorly organized sex and abused "Dialogs". For a film of a wonderful amount of sex and nudity, there is nothing loving about it really. Sex scenes are acting oddly, and some scenes, like shower scenes, seem to pull over and over. That said, there are at least some minimal production standards. On the W-i-P scale I will put it above Frauen Fur Zellenblock Neun, but at the bottom of the chain hit.
