I knew I was not going to see a quality movie when including the title 'B-grade video night' in place of a friendship. Regardless of the warning, I was surprised how bad this image was. It is fortunate that many of us had to share the pain ... The film tries to tell the story of the dark future, in which the daughter of a difficult girl to rescue suddenly a haq (a Mad Max type character). Indeed, see a thin incognito excuse (promoting their own philosophy of producer producers on life, see last credits and end up claiming 'these people are not real' for a real laugh). The film is often lacking, and fails to develop its characters in any degree. What is worse though editing this photo Repeat scenes (usually 10 to 20 seconds long) for 4 or 5 times in the picture view. I think it was an attempt to imitate the lines of the Gene Cloud Van-Damme War, but if it fails completely. If we are not forced to move the head in front of the sun half a dozen times in the sun, the film will probably be 1/3 of its length. (Yes, that happened in the repeat scene). I saw this movie my worst movie which I have ever seen. I doubt that soon will be topping any time.
