Outward British Club scene is a nice transparent effort to monetize, a source is a film that promises commitment to specific categories, but fewer. A perfunctory thriller plot (which has only the club sequence string together), acting variable and a beautiful ridiculous script, all stop descending from the showcase that Jovy definitely intended for the show. However, although Jovy sometimes appears helpless (especially when using sick-fitting dance music often) she demonstrates potential and the lack of anti-drug messages is very wide. Overall however, the film is a spoiled opportunity, and the possibility of a big climbing movie is out of nowhere. Yet watchable.
