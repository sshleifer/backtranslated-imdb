.... where I'm coming from this movie. I mean, I have seen so many B movies in my young life so far, and I do not want to classify it as a B movie. I look at the movies of my high school media class, and think that this one has crossed. <br /> <br /> So it proves ... a bunch of dancing numbers and a secret shit happens. Women in Bikinis, who are not even desperate looking at the beginning, dance and songs at the beginning. Show off girls with hair follicles and those fangs out of sunlight. I mean, I can only assemble together the sentence combining this film thinking. According to most people on this site, Manaus the Hands of Fat and Pod public is the worst movie (Classic: -D to MSST3) ... I'll be one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually I do not try to trash a movie too much, but those who did it really deserve it. It's bad and it's unbearable, and I think the film's director or actor is the only person who rated this ten.
