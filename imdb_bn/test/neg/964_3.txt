"The Snow Queen" is based on the famous and beautiful novel about a famous garda of Hans Christian Undersen, who took a dangerous danger to rescue his friend Kai from Snow Queen Paul. This expression tries to capture boldly with stories of bold stories and impressive sets and production designs, but it fails in numbers. <br /> <br /> As with many hallmark productions, the probability of the story is completely heavy handwriting scripting and subcutaneous direction. Two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; Snow Rani looks as part of Bridget Fonda but is otherwise miscast for the role. There is a significant lack of dramatic tension for these mad three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pansing problems can be identified as the sum of the fillers' scenes, which adds very little to the original story, especially in the first letter that represents the main characters. <br /> <br /> She said, "Snow Queen" is a fantasy and ideal for pre-teenagers for some patience. It is not scary, but it looks great, and the acting is made in a very high level pantomime, with a clear and bold story story. Just do not forget to read Anderson's story too much.
