I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with this topic, not by Mark Furman's book, by Timothy Dumus but of Martha Maxley in America's far-off community, the best "Al of the East of Evil: The True Story of the Peer Maxwell". Anyone who looks at Greenwich's chicken guard should be aware that they are watching the story of Mark Fuherman, or the story of Martha Maxley. This image is nothing more than pride for Furran. Just look at his character as if he is coming second (yes, even being ornamented by women). The children playing the kids look very old for their roles and flashbacks in the 1970s are completely disgusting. If there is a hero in this story, then Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. Furahman kept the case alive for two decades before his name. They deserve to tell, and Martha, the story of truth.
