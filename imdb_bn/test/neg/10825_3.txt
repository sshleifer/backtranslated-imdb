The terrible thing about this horror film is the last one related to a sequel. 'Cave' is a really frustrating work movie. A group of cave and undercurrent researchers enter Romania's (one of the cheapest places to make at least one movie) and enter the cave of a ruined church that is proven to be a region of underground monsters. Or they are demons? The film never decides that it wants to be action, science fiction, or horror, but it plays a mixture of all without any salt or fun, and in the wood system. The best thing about the movie is cinematography, but the dark landscape of the cave becomes even boring as the film does not have the pace and the characters are not only interesting. Time waste
