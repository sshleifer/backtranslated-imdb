The film is visually stunning: the inside of the church's dusty, stained street, and the measurement of the film in the run-down garage that shines through the stained oven. It's a wonderful idea in the 1950s (opening of the film) and in the 1960s. As a parent of all performance top-class, especially Matthew Macfaiden and Gerard Maxelli, who found his own helplessness extremely extraordinary by his son. So sad, the story is so ridiculous. Initially, Focus on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadden) and his family, he failed to show that he was able to influence the community so much. In the church, we see five or six main characters on the front and two or three behind, but the rest of the congregations may also be in Manquin: They do not show any sign of listening, answering or dissenting from him; At cockfight, someone does not say or not, when he disrupts the proceedings, but when Caroline does a pint on her while not praising or condemning anyone; A situation that began to cause mysterious labor pain due to the stone thrown through the pub window. Secondly, Middleton (which is not actually a city, but a small village) lacks some of the essential services like police and fire services: the murder can only be confronted with a family member with a crawler; Despite the fact that residents are in the movie, they see a surveillance threatening to capture the whole city. In this case, daily things like telephone and newspaper are obviously missing, rural communities are ineligible for farm animals or wheat-fields, and the most annoying, only a Christian community for a 'normal' answers to the north-east of Ireland - a couple of Anglo-Angles even in the mix. Even if you are willing to suspend the unbelief, the story itself is a fantastic thread bag, an A.J. A pale imitation. Cranio melodrama And the song? Well, this is nice for the first two minutes, but when the same four words repeat non-stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a bit annoying. My suggestion: watch this with sound off.
