This film is slow. This image is cheap. This picture seems to have nominated the 13th look best picture on Friday. The acting is cone. Special effects are shit. Nobody dies like 40 minutes and all people work badly. The only thing to save it is the ability to smile on all of you going to stupidity. The interesting part is watching the attacker's "fight off" He was supposed to be trained but he fought like a 70 year old. They spend a vague perspective on people who do not die, and those who die do not know where you do not know where you die. I love slashers but this is just shit.
