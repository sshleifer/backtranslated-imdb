This third installment of the Scarecrow series is much far away. I know, I know ... but how good is it? Well, let's not be silly. It's still quite bad, but it's a fine film than the first two. Again, with good lighting and good camera work, shot on digital. <br /> <br /> **** SPILILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team digests new members, one is left in diabetic coma. Of course, they left him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. Following the legend, the boy's soul is transferred into a very harmful body, which comes to life and spreads horribly terrible vengeance, well, most of all Co-Ed drives the beach, which is very close to KarnaFild. Sunny sea beach, they are killed by whistling scarecrow one by one. <br /> <br /> Authors / directors Brian Catskin did a credible job to bring some drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama leaps the land between good cheese and ordinary cheese. The acting was mostly fair, but there were some really awful bits, including a terrible part of a bad brittle lip-sync. Some plot points have been disposed of most, and most have been used to get alone so they can be killed. Again, better than previous installments, but still lacking.
