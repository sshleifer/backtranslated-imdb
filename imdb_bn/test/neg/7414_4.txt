Bigfoot movies get worse, so I'm not interested in watching them. However, there were some good ads on the Sci-Fi channel, so I decided to watch. The campaign leader (played by Lance Hendrikson) has launched a campaign to conduct a raid in search of a crashed plane and a revolutionary DNA detector used to prove the existence of Sakakach has been brought. And it actually generates some mystery first. The Sasquatch is invisible, but mountain climbers see the body heat (like the tribe between "hunters"), and I was surprised when the strike was going on. Acting is passable, as passive music. Dense wood position is well used. And animals have finally seen, the costume is not bad, although nothing is great. But as the film was Green, it became increasingly annoying and stupid. Most of the letters are unpleasant, rude towards each other and only money and campaign campaigns (except the character of Lance Hendrix), so it is impossible to care about what's happening to them. And their behavior becomes increasingly stupid. One man shoots animals (not severely), then becomes drunk and sit alone in the dark. A female camper puts in a slewing silk negligyte before going inside her sleeping bag, then dragged into the wood with scurves, if her hair is not made and made up. Then, the survivors decided that the Saskatchet is really after the DNA detection machine and if they leave it, they will give them life ("Any animal knows what it worries"). Obviously, these actors did not apply, or they did not appear in this film. And the end is so stupid, you want to kick the TV screen. If it's not for scripts, it's a decent horror movie.
