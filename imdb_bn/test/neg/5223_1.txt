Recently I took the idea of ​​making a small film, which was hit by a car and he woke up thinking he was Chouk Norris. This means that I have to do extensive research on chalk, and find out as much as possible about human beings. I later came to know that he was not actually a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With such a mouth, who can doubt it? I've seen more than one person in Chocolate Norris in the last four months. I am proud that Bell in Innocence is at the top of the list of the greatest ever. I thought most of the film was that I could bring my copy back to the local Wal-Mart without returning, which I used to save myself to consume my tongue. The biggest reason I chose to buy this image was that it was not only the chalk, but her son Mike. I was anxious to see if Michael was an old paper-bag block that can't-act-his-way-out-of-chip. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for a common reason. He played the role of Chuck Norris. No matter what the movie, no matter what the situation, he is always in Chuck Norris. He is one thing on his son that he is consistent. Mike does not understand how people's emotions work. The scene where he is talking about the little girl about her dead daughter, she is very happy! Perhaps that's why he pushed his daughter to traffic, as illustrated in the all-time incredible flashbacks. His activities confused me all the time, which makes it difficult for me to concentrate a little plot. The other two main actors were painful to see Naris as the son. The person who wants to eat constantly or fool the peacock is just one of the most annoying characters for the direct-to-video screen. Apart from this film, I think he was the only one, Walker was an episode of Texas Ranger, where he ran an equally annoying character. Maybe chuck owes some of this guy. The other guy, the only name I can think of because he forgot so much, your average Christian was fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, I'm actually one, but this guy was too much for me. To measure the story, you have a number of diverse people who love to call "friends" and some villains do not seem able to determine which of them is charged. Not to mention the weird kids who remind me of the store version of the Dollar Dollar Group for the film's weird kids. Above all, the film is probably one of the greatest failures of all time, Chouk Norris is more than the body of the people. Despite being the worst actor of all time, I still can not get the chalk. Probably he was really sent from heaven ...
