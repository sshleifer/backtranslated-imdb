Star Trek fans try to love this picture almost despite touching incredible number of flaws. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, one of the familiar characters is not really the character. Scottie has been portrayed as a bumpling tycoon rather than a suitable engineer in the original series. Ohura ... God, I can not even think about what I did to his character. All his conversations were difficult to hear. McCoy looks like a neurotic stepfather instead of his trusted friend Kirk. Speak ... Well, let's just say that Leonard Nimo was very suffering. He was given a bad conversation ("I do not believe that you realized Captain Gravity in your situation." Gravity, drink it?) And made almost a buffoon. Kirk ... Oh people, do not start me. A hammy actor, starting with William Shatner, to allow him to come directly, to invite us to get it. <br /> <br /> This plot is ridiculous. Spock is a great story line of a brother and unnecessary soap opera. But hey, go with it. Search for God. Again, on the basis of a weak plot. Do you think so? Okay, let's go with that too. So it is assumed that the above mentioned plot element is word, is the script wrong? Well, for one thing, it recycles too many ways. For example, the enterprise is not working properly again. Can we think that Starfleet will send a serious harmful ship with a skeletal crew in a potentially dangerous situation because they want to manage James Kark to handle this situation? If the case is there, why not keep him as a good adviser ship? Adding that ... crew is fairly ineligible. Scotty has broken into pieces (and apparently claudied enough to push himself to unconsciousness, though there is a hostel on the board!), At no point does anyone ever think of announcing the Klingon ship (sensors are clearly showing arms range ships) and crews all It seems to be the most familiar way to each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this flagship of Starfleet is, then it is astonishing that Cloneson has not overthrew the federation. <br /> <br /> Because of the personal struggle with pain, it was shit Lawrence Lachenby is a worthy actor, but even he could not save Turkey. No one can short. Among all the people involved, I imagine that Leonard is the most shameless by it. I hope, whatever he is, <br /> <br /> <br /> Thank you, Thank God, in the Claddished tears.
