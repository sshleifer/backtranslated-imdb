It's hard and I did not expect it ... but it's really the worst movie, watched me and my wife. The horrible dialogue that stretches irregularly through time without any apparent reason without metering time. Does not the story follow a comprehensive intelligibly way ?? Everything is a mess. Jump to Action and Dialog. My favorite frustration was my favorite French favorite actor Dominique Pinenake? Ah ?? I do not even know how to describe it without humble ?? The most poor where the actors left. Susan Patorno has made a terrible interpretation of her character, which creates a flat extraordinary performance. Poor special effects I do not think it's a waste of complete film but it's close? I want to say, I would suggest not to see this movie. I think it will be a complete waste of time. I would never say anything about that movie? There is always a first time.
