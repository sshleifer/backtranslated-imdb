The director does not know what to do with the camera ... a lot of options and he always chooses to always go wrong ... he charges Travolta ... and he runs the movie from start to finish. Characters do not develop ... maybe we need to sing because ... there is no speed, very fast very fast very slow ... miscasted: Travolta is okay ... Johnson, he's too big to be an 18 ... Even if he is really 20 ... <br /> <br /> Happy ending? It looks like one must be, the story is sad but not too sad ... Trivalta does not know what to play a guitar, but the director does not see that she is too much thinking that she is completely compatible <br /> <br /> <br /> This idea is the only great thing, but how did he improve it? Well, it's only heard stereotype and lines many times ... <br /> <br /> Very bad, another missed opportunity ...
