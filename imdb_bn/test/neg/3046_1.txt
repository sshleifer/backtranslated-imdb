This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad it wants me to shoot in the forehead. I hate this movie. First off, this plot did not go completely anywhere, and anything frustrating about this movie was a 30 second teaser troller. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad film and totally inefficient. As far as the best part of the movie is accepted. Which is not saying much for the actual movie. There were sections in the movie when the music became very suspicious and you are positive that someone is near the corner and it can be a maid or a cat, but when someone is actually near the corner, it can be impossible because you all expect this movie. So save yourself, save yourself time, take a headache and see the trailer. Not at the TV, nor the DVD, nor the theater, there is no point to watch this movie.
