Unfortunately, the House of D is very awful, a funny plot, horror writing, some middle acting, and in fact everything else about it is sub-par. <br /> <br /> Tom has survived nyisi to survive the only son of Paris, and persuades the beautiful Parisian girl to believe firmly, eventually he becomes French despite the weak grasp of his French language. After a few years he expressed his "secret" he became surprised! <br /> <br /> She gives a "gift" to her own son as a sad story, and who, in the hope of believing in us, thinks that this is the only birthday gift given to her father, to give her 13-year-old son You can If only things were so easy! David Duchovny plays the role of his mother, his own wife Tea Leoni miscasts and strikes again again. Leoni makes me smile as a humor but he is just simple mistake for this role. <br /> <br /> A problem with any letter is sympathetic. I just do not have a mockery of what happened to them. I rather hope Robin Williams and his trademark "a large body of children" schtick would fall on a village path, but it would not have been and we had to bear all the simpler performance. <Br /> <br /> Anton Yehlechin and William's daughter Zelda were not bad, but others were suspicious of reviewing their opinions about those who were going to them because they were not as bad as everyone else in this movie. They were not very good, let me get in the way. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and congratulatory aspects in this picture - Ericaa Badu, Cycle, Catholic School and its staffers are easily stupid characters, etc. - This review will run forever, so I'm just a very poor movie of the House of DT I'll finish by saying and I'm almost embarrassed for Duvvies. <br /> <br /> The thing that really bothers me is to encourage "friends" so strongly that I have traveled a long way to see it. <br /> <br /> I would not have been so annoyed that it would have been so bad for the film to spend a few hours at a local film playwright, but instead I lost all day, and discovered that my so called "friends" were stupid or dishonest, Because it's a horror movie!
