Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and if the evidence presented in this film is believed, it is the hardest mountain that can successfully ride without killing itself. "K2" is basically a friend flick set in the exciting dangerous world of mountaineering. Outside photography takes some really awesome scenes, however, the characters standing in front of those glorious landscapes are a crashing boro - and it has blames the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Cox's Bazar lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Bihara) and his cool married friend Harold Jamison (Matt Cravven) spent their free time climbing the rock. Once upon a time of their trips, they met with mountaineering climbers mounted by rich mountain enthusiasts Philip Cleburne (Raymond J Barry). The Clifber team is training for an upcoming shot training at the notorious K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold would like to deal with both, but they can not. While training them, however, both Claiborne groups killed themselves in the glacier. Taylor and Harold keep themselves as a possible replacement. Despite initial reluctance, Claibern approved their approval and the couple joined their team at the Himalayas. Harold's wife Syndi (Julia Nixon-Soul) is very dangerous that her husband is going to such dangerous hikes, especially she recently became a father. In clashes with climbers clashing with other members of the group as the Teams Mount of Climbing team, equally slowly and arrogant Dallas Wolf (Luca Barkovci). Meanwhile, Claiborne is making himself increasingly sick, because hemolytic illness risks his body. Who will reach the peak of boys, or will they end up in their despair or death? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "K2" spends a long time introducing slightly unacceptable characters. Buddhists are particularly tough as a spirits, pushy, bold type, such as Barry Hard-Sterling Mountaineering millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Crowon is so humble that his wife might believe that perhaps her daughter K2 can be picked up - the hack, if she does not come back she will be better! Barcovski surrounds the main characters, whose character is Dallas Wolf's character, and he played any role as a high-end. The story itself is full joke and disposable ?? Just trying to reach a mountain top is a straightforward yarn. There is a bit of bondage to men, but the whole theorem is about to break down Harold and his wife, and the personality is completely false to clash across Taylor and the Dallas ring. "K2" only scores some of his qualities from Gabriel Barstein's stunning painters ?? During the Himalayan sequence, the scale and scare of mountains are considered very well. I completely commented with critics Kim Newman, who said laughingly in the empire paper: "Based on this proof, K2 can not be more difficult to climb over!" Really, Kim, really!
