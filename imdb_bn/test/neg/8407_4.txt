Um ... Okay, it's a very poor, very critically acclaimed Rosemary Baby compared to the first movie. Actually, it's usually a pretty poor film. Yes, there are some released attributes, but I'll go later. <br /> <br /> It's been quite a while since the last image ... In fact, it's been pretty good for eight years I believe. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and let him succumb in the future of bad events that are affecting him, or that Coven (or "tribe", as mentioned here) has been out for him. When he goes with him and an empty bus arrives and takes him away, leaving his child with hookah, the lice raises him until old age, where Satan tries to hold him, because he thinks that his evil traditions Rejecting. The way. <br /> <br /> Clearly, things are not designed as planned, and after all I was ashamed to be ashamed, I have heard that it does not seem to come "Rosemary's" Baby "! Well, when I was about 11 years I was old, I saw Masterpiece Rosmarie Babi and then read the book Segel. It seems to be an adaptation of this film, I followed this movie and found it ... what could I do? Well, in some ways, yes ... I am the true fan of this "franchisee" and can say that I saw a seagull, and I have the idea that what will happen after the events in the first film and "Rosemary's The son ", Ira Levin's own book, Siegel, is not yet adaptable for the film). <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon is playing several times in this movie, but why the oh why In the first film, knife rosemater was dropped out of the ground, but the minis pulled it out! Coven is now called a tribe (as I said earlier). They now roam with the hooded caps, "Shaytan said ... Adrian Hell .. Shake the devil ... Adrian Hell ... "and so on. The Gothic building is now somewhere in the middle of a lawn like a two-room house, it looks like a little beautiful suburbs or something! And the child himself looks beautiful, his eyes are only crazy when he gets mad and that someone or something in the vain killed. <br /> <br /> As long as you play, it is very poor, in all cases except Steven McHattie, Adrian plays very big. Passy Duck Astin, replacing Mia Farrow as Rosemary, is one of the best performances to be caught in the film! It's so bad that it's not nearly funny ... when he shouts, "O my God!" And crying fifteen times in the movie, you're right, "OK, it's not funny", and then at the time of departure and the film is going on for only twenty minutes, thank you, O Lord, do not listen to me, my God! SHEESH! Finally, this movie is very, very, * very few quality qualities, it is enough to get at least four stars. But, if you see it as a serious seagull in the first movie, it's quite an existent.
