If I could give this movie a negative rating. Humor I sometimes saw in a movie. The terrible things are good people and those who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots, one half of which does not support the film. Where do these "movies" see others "depth"? Any good work goes without punishment? That only heartless can be successful? The film starts well and black and white are very moody and well done. The acting is very good and treacherous witch makes ruthless ridiculous even more terrible. If you think that 3 stages are very nice to each other, a real tongue slapper showing the victim's abduction with the Bovi knife, if you think that the "Scandaler's List" was ridiculous, then this film is for you.
