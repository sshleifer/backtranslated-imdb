The topic was good, the direction was right. His role as Mahanlal Major was efficient. Supporting actors were the best amateur actors. The casting director and director should be responsible for this danger. Hawallar Jay was terrible, he stood like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not see the part and he did not go as a soldier. There was a scene where satellite feeds needed to be confronted with militants and they showed it from a camera angle. The satellite is located hundreds of miles in the sky, so the top corner is above the top. It was quite embarrassing moment. The audience is mature this day and they recognize when they are trying to burn the wool on their eyes. The director could be a major so stories out of his personal experience. No problem, but the film is as good as its actor and director. So if Major Robi is going for any other project, he will pay more attention to the cast.
