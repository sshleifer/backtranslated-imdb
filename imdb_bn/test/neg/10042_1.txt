I love ghost stories and I'll be sitting in a movie that I'm not enjoying it at the end. I rarely think my time was wasted ... But, this adaptation of Bell Witch's story was horrible! <br /> <br /> It was not at least bit scary. What does comic relief moment with? Dialogue was tiring. Actually the film was a very long way and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn to me openly. (Please choose a birthday party) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not think that the costumes and propos worked well. <br /> <br /> I am interested in other adaptations, but until then, I will stick to reading about the story.
