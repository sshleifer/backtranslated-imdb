This movie stinks. IMDB needs a negative number of its ratings system to accurately assess this Turkey. The acting is either wooden or on top; The film was apparently not written by someone especially; And the monster scene was the mediator at the best times. Even as a movie directed by giant scenes, those shots are so frustrating that they can not sympathize with the rest of the film. I want 80 minutes of my life that stole this movie.
