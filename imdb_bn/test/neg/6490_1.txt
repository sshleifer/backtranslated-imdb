Charlie (George "soft" wait) and Ronda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) Hearing, a pair of murderers alien who leaked to the world and drowned in a small western town. They became deputy sheriffs and relieved the deadly form of trial for speeding, murderers and others, under the leadership of Wen Grace (under the leadership of some of the local people). Meanwhile, their sexy alien girl (Anastasia Saucalis) came in a skimp / shiny outfit with her black man's husband (Christopher M. Brown) and TV reporters and government agents filled up the time to find them. <br /> <br /> From what I can say, it is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western ...) in a movie, and it's a stupid, unreasonable mess Despite the powerful performance of the two stars. The script is cruel cruel.
