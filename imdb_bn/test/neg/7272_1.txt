Finally, I can attach points between JD and Phantom Menace returns. We see here where Lucas has lost touch with the original Star Wars films, and has destroyed at least 1-3 of the platform. This film is one of the 80 Swords and Magicians of any comparable budget worthy of being associated with Star Warsa. Like Jar-Za's character, it seems to be targeted at children (and in the toy market). Battle scenes are particularly bad. Sean Phillips's incredible talent such as Claudius's classic performance, I was depressed to look at such waste.
