<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are "good" and "bad" people get only desserts and * bombs *, but they seem to have gone out of the script and Castes started fixing things. <br /> <br /> Which has become so bad ... if the cast only continues with letter development then they have already installed. But this is not the case and the movie soon becomes a messy mess. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie for the last 30 minutes ... and then close. Imagine this at the moment, think about the next 30 minutes depending on what you have seen. <br /> <br /> Believe it, you'll ultimately look far better than how this movie will end. . Trust me about this.
