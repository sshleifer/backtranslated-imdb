First, a warning. 'How to Mary A Millionaire' is a visible five-minute orchestral performance that is displayed by 'Street Cine', in which the Garshwin-Lite piece is fully treated with the whole Pope of Gershwin and the ceremony. It takes some patience to sit through it. If you have a DVD, make sure you can proceed You do not miss anything <br /> <br /> This film is one of the fifty disappointments of Hollywood, it is a movie starring a star star, wide ma'ass-n-scene and a movie inspired by perfect high imagination. Failure seems unexpected. Title alone is perfect. Generations are forced to ask themselves after generations - how long is it? The script is a necklace of production, a dead, perfume that can really spark the life before and an albatross by chocolate to everything and everyone. There are no ridiculous situations, just the game for the isolated moment that laughs. Whenever a real comedy scene threatens to develop, the film quickly comes in other interesting, less interesting things. The point is a case - in the scene where three leading ladies each bring the same fancy restaurant a date. One of them, little eyesight, refuses to deny her shiny outburst. Date is married one. A classic Hollywood Farce set up, surely, wrong identities, angry wife, and perhaps someone is complete with a pie? Well, no, no. Instead, we have spent three dates, because women tell their partners 'ridiculous' feedback. Hit the fifth, and cut the next lecherous bronze. If in doubt, Marilyn has to walk in a wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are a perfect figure of the classic Hollywood screen goddess cycle. It was one of the breakthrough films of Marilyn Monroe, and the camera only consumed her, though the script did not let her do anything. She seems so stranger around luminescent. On the other hand, Lauren Kakal was a great star for almost a whole decade and he knows how to keep the screen in spite of having a monroe frame. He got the only thing passing for the real role, and provided some good lines with an iron snap - with the right material, he could bring this thing to life. She is a strange foolish actress - when she lied about her age in film and claimed for forty years, it is not immediately ridiculous - and fewer girls than her co-stars give her a believer's authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless, and her co-star was well over eight years, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. Occasionally, a wind of depression, nothing but stuck on the screen, a toothache smile and a few scorpions of comic timing, unable to play his real age, but as a contemporary of this new, radioactive actress, no one was fooled, depending on the same old scotch , Who throughout his life's career (for Marilyn-Dubbers, both of these films go together Seeing the damage to Monroe and - yes - intelligence helps in sharp relief). He was also involved with dead wood for male co-stars (though all men - even the great William Powell - were guilty of lazy performances); He is unable to strike any comic sparks off them. It is better to have his role in the underlying motto, who could have been fun with himself and rebuilt Mr. Keep the tomb with the Magu routine. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is addictive, engaging in the production of ridiculous Hollywood, like those that even look like 'Silver by the light of the moon' and even Tiv. But somewhere, there is a sharp, comedy comedy outline about booming jokes and professionalism that can sing bachelor wedding - and the new generation of movie viewers, 'How to Mere a millionaire' movie hopes are all ready to be disappointed.
