Kokoda was inspired by the events of the Kokoda track during WW2, when the Australian militia stopped gradually and stopped a push by 10,000 Japanese soldiers to be captured by Port Moresby. What do they mean by the fact that the film has been set in this period, but what the imagination and what has happened is the standard view of other war movies. The first hour is only after a clich√©. Some of the scenes may be able to draw only in our feelings that this conflict was comparatively awesome, when there was little evidence of it. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown to both. Both sides are suffering from a logical deficit and the terrain was a great level of this conflict. After getting closer to Japan Port Morsby, their supply line increased and eventually they collapsed. On the other hand, Australians reduced their supply line near Port Moresby. Some scenes are shown directly outside the handbook in an ideal scene to be included in a war film. The film was confused and highlighted the production team's young man. In Australia's best moments, Australia was disappointed with the Kokoda frustration with Australia's great film.
