This movie is not good at all. It's pretty stupid, quite annoying, and very badly done. I really saw this picture because my friends said that they hated this picture. Although I did not hate them, I still found it as a very bad movie. The best thing about this remote thing was that it was sometimes somewhat entertaining and I think that if it has been made a little better then it would be ok to say a little better, if it is completely restored, it is a movie festival It seems that the shot was not made and if the script was improved then it was a good slasher film. Instead of it but now instead of what it is, it's a painful movie. The acting looks frustrating that I am looking at teenage girls or teenagers or doing something to do something exciting. These killings are quite cheap. Film itself), and basically everything else is lower class. This movie is really bad and you will not miss if you decide to skip this movie then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
