I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it halfway because I think it's time wasted. The idea of ​​making a movie with the eyes of a headman - one of the most eccentric and "evil people" among the medieval movies - it offers great and lots of possibilities - but none of them can capture the film. I was not feeling for any characters, the plot was very much expected (the thing I followed) and the story of the second story left me. Those people who hope for deeper insight into the mental state of the Crusaders for the age of medieval era may be disappointed.
