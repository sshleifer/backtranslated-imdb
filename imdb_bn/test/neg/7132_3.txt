I'm not saying that I like the main fault. This was the most horrifying, most-haired growing experience in the horror movie theater. I'm not kidding Being a self-declared JapanFilm, I see the flick better (if I change the setting to an American subdivision, I probably hated the movie). <br /> <br /> She said .. this movie is a complete mess! A) The movie has some points in good because I do not have to say it sucks, b) "It sucks" Lum's lay-downs are extinguished lamest in history. So what's going on for movies? Well, for beginners, it has a nice cool look: using filters and slow, washed colors, Taqasi Simizu repeatedly repeats the downward, obscure environment. Some scenes are truly frustrating and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the image is just plain bad. Duration <br /> <br /> Throughout the story, the Tarantino style is essentially called, for example, scenes outside the growing sequence. This technique is in vain for this movie and it only makes things more confusing. Frankly speaking, a simpler plot will work well. The original was also lacking in plots, but in the sense and the film has many fears for its thin plot and much more than the real exciting atmosphere. Worry 2 There is no material in them and this is only a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's see TV shows show performance skills, which are the real culprit customs like Emily Watson and Catherine Hepburn. Simply, the movie does not work. It is not too slow for a very slow, very slow, and confusing plot (which does not add anything new to the story, so the Grad supporters will not be satisfied too). <br /> <br /> Oh, the old man is playing Pic-A-Bu in Japan? Is this supposed to be a comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
