This movie was cruel terrible. Most of the curiosity scenes seem to be old and quarterly, and perhaps the most fun scenes in the film were released in previews. The whole court of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it's really hard to find. The actors portray themselves as the most unreal characters. It is not true that movies are hard to melt, but how they hope to put your throat down and take it. Plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. The boy is rejected from any school in any school (I think he has completely forgotten admission to community college) and decided to build his own school for fellow workers. Until the question of legalization of his school comes, everything goes well for everything. Every time Darky character drives her beautiful neighbor to fall in love with her malicious mockery, which is clearly a skill. Then comes the final struggle with the fight for all ties and school survival together with the students. Of course, the main character inspires the state education board to allow her school to survive with some "inspirational" lectures. It was more fun to see if the film was under 16 years old and is still unaware of all college subjects and issues.
