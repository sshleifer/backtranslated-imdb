Two neutral actors De Niro and Morphy were added to the showtimes as police and an actor. Although they share most of the screen times together, they will have their expected performance such as this analysis, Meet the Parents, Dr. Dulitil and Nutty professors can not reach such movies. The picture starts interesting, but it is a thin, comedy which is frustrating. This is not particularly enjoyable, such as D-Nero. Shameful because he really shows his feelings which I think. Unfortunately, if the idea is shiny it can be a more interesting job and it can follow a sigle like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I do not think it would be a sequel to cast at least DeDiro and Murphy. ** Out of *****
