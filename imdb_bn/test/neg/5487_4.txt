I like all Lilo and sewing movies. The TV series was not great, but when I saw this movie I gave up the opinion of the series. And I must say ... it was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I was disappointed with is animation. Yes, you heard it. Animation. I found its quality greatly deteriorated from the first movie. His quality was as high as the TV series, which I did not expect. If you are looking for eye candy, do not expect much here. Also, the animation failed to draw any serious mood. Even in the supposedly sad scenes, I did not feel anything for the character, another downgrade from the first movie. Next, it was the only horrific voice acting. I could not afford to voice actors with real talent, with that, Disney, with all its riches and glory, why it is very, very strangely, and wondered. The voice actor was just boring as one of the skills series. I have tolerated one of the series because, hey, who will not be tired when creating voice for so many stories? Hack, I do not know how many episodes are (theoretically, there are 624, but I can not believe it). However, I thought that the voice acting would improve in the film, and in the face of the truth, I was faced with that, what they could do in Syria was already their best. <br /> <br /> Next, was awesome scripts. It was chessy out of release, and the author tried just very hard. They tried to make some joke, but I just found them annoying. Perhaps it was not voice-acting, but decorated dialogue that destroyed the word section. (On the contrary, the soundtrack was not very bad, and the mood was good.) <br /> <br /> There was a problem with the fourth story. I predicted everything, and the story makes characters so irrelevant and unexpected. You have the responsibility to get aliens new positions and responsibility spaces. After the initial publicity, they realized that they did not really like it and missed their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, after a very 'action pack' action scene, the prison of evil spirits broke down and broke into the jumbo lab to steal its test. Then the test was cloned into 100 others and Hamster wanted to win the Earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the bad hamster, but they face the final showdown of some sugar against the test and bring a very long excuse to show the series a great one. Letter then return to Earth to give up their new opportunities and resume their lives. Seriously, how many earlier movies have been used in the past? The story was very short and formulas, so do not expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> Disney has failed in words, graphics, and stories. The only character in the series was the original character, and how he was able to maintain the 'feeling' of the characters, but was not even able to save the film. I tried to like it, I really did, but I give it a rating 4/10. Other Disney Failure.
