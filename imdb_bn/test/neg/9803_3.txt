I was waiting for the film to move me, inspired me, disappointed me, made me laugh, but it did not excite any of my emotions. It just moandered along the end. None of the characters felt very unique or complex, they just considered acting as their lines. I think it might be a good movie if the letters express more passion. The only person who believed and was credible was an old man, and perhaps he committed suicide as soon as possible. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine. There is a message or meaning or talent in this story, but of course it is either hidden or I am very dense, which I suspect.
