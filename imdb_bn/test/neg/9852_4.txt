The TV show was slow and 'offbit' characters were sometimes annoying. Just through the fast forward miracle I was able to do it within the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The text indicates that this is not a kind of comedy / mystery but I mostly see it. <br /> <br /> If it really comes up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I suspect that I will look without any other recommendations. <br /> <br /> This review will be without the supposed spoilers so I will continue to fashion a vague, non-spoiler. I found two main characters uninteresting and disrespectful. I asked myself, 'What would a normal adult do?' When the window was found with the head trimmer, the man started to tease and when he got in contact with the man, he worried. Will anyone be as nervous as a normal adult?
