Although I enjoyed Dracula's Satanic Rights (1974), I knew that I should not expect too much from the more prestigious predecessor! At least at least Hammer Dakulas (Marcus Henon [1 973] on the audio community for Christmas flush can even go so far for Nudir's nomenclature!), This film is completely exclusively monopolized by Flambers - and now embarrassing date - Better) ... even if true, Dracula 2000 (2 000) or Van Helsing (2004), it is still more favorable for the draw! <br /> <br /> Despite being fooled by Christopher Lee's film, he still spends an unbelievably impressive person like an unwanted papper (even if he rarely attends and is unreasonably limited to one setting); Similarly, Peter Cushing delivers his usual committed performance. The only other outstanding performance in the film is Christopher Neme (director Ronald's son) like Johnny Alcard (!) - even if this is incredibly Hammy! Unfortunately, Caste's two best female members (both of whom are terrific regulars) - Stephanie Bicham and Caroline Munro - can not get over their physical characteristics. <br /> <br /> The camera-work was done by Dick Bush (who had shed blood in the Satan Cloud [1971] and for Hammer, Dinosarara the world [1970] and Twin of Evil [1971] - but perhaps with Russell Known for long-term collaboration) Excellent atmosphere, especially three important sequence-related periods: In the beginning (starting with Gothic) carriage begins; Hackerical Black mass sequence, followed by Dakulla restoration; And the final clash between Van Helsing of Li and Kousing
