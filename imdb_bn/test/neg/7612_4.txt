I found this film extremely boring. Trendwell is probably frail and confused, possibly suffering from a mental illness. The footage shown is not him and an actor, but it shows behavior that ends in death. Is it appropriate to show the actual footage of a suicide? Let's not mince words. The image shows footage of the behavior directly directed towards his death. <br /> <br /> Those who think that TributeWell is any kind of hero, think again. He claimed that he shot the footage about him and about beer and fox. He did no meaningful research among their habits or numbers and actually did nothing to protect them. What he did he wanders around Bush and pleases himself that he is better than the best. In fact, helping humans to sensitize animals, he has shown a great risk to them. His autobiographical behavior is not the cause of his own death, due to the death of his colleague Emy Plan, he faces further losses to his beloved bears and foxes. <br /> <br /> But I also wondered how this film was also about the involvement of Warner Herzegov in this compilation. <br /> <br /> I had a long argument about a friend and a film that liked this movie. He believes that critically disturbed people create interesting things and he cited downfall movies as an example. But downfall they use actors. We saw the actual Madagua Goebbels did not keep Sinayed capsules in the mouth of his own children. <br /> <br /> There was something about using Grizzlie Man's original footage that reminded me of the tragedy of the awesome football stadium where people were able to touch the death and the photographer who could help, just chose to keep awful recordings. <br /> <br /> The movie of Herzog shows us that the trade footage is more about TradeWire. But Harzg did the same thing. His own personalities and opinions are circulated in this documentary, which is supposed to be by somebody else. As if he does not need a scene where he hears the tape. We already knew what the tape was because the colonel told us. We did not need to tear a tears with Herzug's former friends of Tidwell. It added to the film. <br /> <br /> This picture shows us that Tredwell was very authoritarian, but it showed us that Harzg was the best.
