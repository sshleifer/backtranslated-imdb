Superhero Movie (2008) "Parody" is the most recent among the long lines in the movie, which I insult so much. I hope this movie may be the death of the genre, but I know that it is not very dangerous to put a final nail on the coffin. <br /> <br /> If you meet Spartans, then Belar is considered as soon as you go to a Hollywood movie, perhaps near the top of the superhero movie. Unfortunately Spartans were actually miles below barrels, and this movie only made it quickly. <br /> <br /> Superhero movie is a decent cast of C-list celebrities. It spreads across Dreck Bell (Disney's Drake and Josh), Leslie Nilsson (Air!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others. It has star power to stir the 40-watt bulb, but the film fails to use any humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 80 minutes long, most dedicated to following the Spiderman Plot and not a single joke is funny. I do not smile or laugh or chocolate or whole time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. Do not even worry about it. For love of the movie, just skip it and perhaps they do not come with anyone else. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, who am I kidding? They will probably come with another one by the fall.
