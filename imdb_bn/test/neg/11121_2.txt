In general, I like the scary movie that makes me so misguided that I am scared for the next day or for all things, people who do stupid acts and die by an invisible giant. This is one of those movies The legendary dumb face of the dog is a dark-skinned giant facing the dog, which is like a kangaroo hop, fungus, and birds, there is a sharp shoulder rope from its back and the animal's blood is drained out. Many horror movies, as good and bad, this movie takes freedom with legends. It does not attack people only, but they eat their gut and have a bulletproof, almost undefined constitution. So tell me if the hypodermic needle can enter the skin if it is not pink? And why, when the mirens out, that bullets can hit the bullets, do they split so that the chubby can choose each other? John Rice-Davies gives a performance that is above the bad movie, and Charlene Simmons and Dylan Neil are credited for their performance. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was bad, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Blue.
