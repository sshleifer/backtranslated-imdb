Again, we are getting a melange of themes that are well covered by many previous films. Good and bad boy stories, courtesy of Eden East. The story of the American marine hero, he did not consider one of the reasons he knew himself. And the sad wife can fall in love with other people's stories. <br /> <br /> The stories that seem to be universal are not just a problem. Because theoretically they can still be well presented and can deal almost every time. There is no luck at this time, even though these three threads fall equally to the end. <br /> <br /> As bad boy never speaks to his father, the conflict is not resolved properly. Apart from his father, he started praising the bad boy, which caused the sad wife to renovate the kitchen. Now, how satisfied it is. Then, the wonderful homemaking Marine never doubts his wife about the conflict of unfaithfulness. Because he does not talk to the person in suspicion, as his own brother. So once more we're finally handed over a loose end here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the American military heroism hypocrisy, where the sea is universally considered hero, due to the tragedy of war, he should not be called as one of his own values, the third theme is flat. Because when the movie is over, for the first time, she could talk to her wife about what she said. Where the real story is actually starting at that time, it means there will be some big crime to recognize its recovery process, how to see it and how it will face the family in the end. All that is really interesting, interesting bits are passed and ignored. <br /> <br /> According to the story, this film is serious, and I, seriously, mean frustration, I still chose to give points for it dominant. Although a movie should not use Maguire for voice, because it belongs to Spiderman. Especially a big Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he stimulates as a young and aspiring actor. It is so true that I love watching him play a truly deep role in the deep and necessary profiles. <br /> <br /> So when Cast is actually what it seems to be, I completely consider this movie otherwise forgetting. A shallow and finally pretentious, weighing completely unhappy tears. Do journalists to the message authors: We already know the wounds, see the Vietnam movie host. If you want to earn some credit, show us a credible healing.
