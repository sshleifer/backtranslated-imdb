This film is nothing more than a Christian campaign. It started like a good sci-fi movie, and then a syrupy sweet Christian theme works in the story which is not entirely related. I had to stop it with halfway because I felt cheated to rent it. The Catholic Church has officially declared that the aliens do not deny faith in God. <br /> <br /> This film is a little entertaining but the dialogues are incredible, writing and acting mostly garbage and all this, in most cases a skink can be avoided. This phenomenon was seen in some studies by filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only a matter of frustration and their own false religious views are a legitimate attraction. If you are a zealous religious fan who believe in ghosts and angels, then you love this movie.
