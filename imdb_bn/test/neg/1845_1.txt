When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly watched the actress, who was playing the role of Lucile Ball. Rachel York's screenplay is absolutely horrifying. Lucie Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. Thinking of a legend like a lucid ball, the picture of how he was in the movie was terrible. I can not believe all actresses around the world, who can play a lot of good Lucy, the producers agree to Rachel York. In other roles, she can be a good actress, but the role of the lucid force is difficult. It's hard to find someone like Lucile Ball, but looks at least and they can find at least the same in the genre. If you look at the picture of Likia in the context of Lucy's love affair, like Chocolate Factory or Vitavatavin, her expression, voice or movement is not the same in any way. <br /> <br /> To stop it, playing Danny Desi Arnaz Pino is terrible! Pinto is not eligible to play as Ricky! She is small and skinny, her pronunciation is unrealistic, and again, her acting is incredible. Although Fred and Athel were not the same, they were not as bad as Lucy and Rikia's character. <br /> <br /> Overall, very awesome cast and story has been badly spoken. If the locals want to understand the real life situation of the ball, then I suggest to show Lucy and Desi A & E's biography, read the book from Lucie Ball himself, or PBS's American Masters: Looking for Lucy. If you want to see a documentary, "before smile" would be a good choice. "Before laughing" is much better than the lassil ball and the casting of native aanaz. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
