Generally I did not see old (and some non-old) Western entertainment for the evening. It's a great way to come back, to rest and escape for politics and world problems for several hours. But this is not the case for this version of Magnificent Seven. Casting and story of this series closely followed the Hollywood Sutra for politically correct entertainment; Good old mind-right, revisionist history, where 'bad boys' all must be white, male, confederate (in this case), and especially Christian (if it can be done in a script anyhow). It's really sad There are the best movies in it and always talk about a good story on the big screen - not always about promoting any political ideology.
