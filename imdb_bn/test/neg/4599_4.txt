An annoying movie about a boring damaged ... Factotum in that a short Matt Dillon is playing Henry Sinci, who is the author of Charles Bukowsky's pride, on this film. If you meet Chinsky, he may be a writer, but he certainly does not succeed. She floats through life, after another one fired from the men's jobs and did not care a bit. She is always drunk that may have something to do with her care care. She met a woman, played by Lily Taylor, met John, and ensues a relationship. Chinski came to John's apartment and now instead of being drunk he may be drunk with somebody else. Good time Chinski attacked his own, so his relationship with him was enough. Unfortunately he still can not put down a job so he broke. At the moment, Marisa shows Tomomi and for some reason her character Laura tells the rescue of this drunken drunk guy, whom she does not know. We meet with Laura's acquaintances soon, and this image is rather a kind of entangled world with a good bunch. Soon enough Tomomi and buddy got out of the picture and again we are taking away Chinchiki and her drink and her miserable small life. A few days have been spent with January but most of the time have become unemployed after being drunk. And then the movie is too high and not a moment soon. 94 minutes seems to be perfect sincerity and it's as impossible as the movie movie drags. Nothing happened. There is nothing to do. If you see Matt Dillon you want to spend one and a half hours of your life but it's a movie for you. If you are looking for a compelling story, a well-developed character or any entertainment value you've come to the wrong place. Dylan's performance is not really bad at all. Very bad that the movie around him is actually rather bad.
