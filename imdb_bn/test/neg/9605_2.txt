Usually I do not waste time writing junk for my time, but I forget that as soon as I see it, but yesterday I decided to make the movie in the latest showtime channel (346, I think) <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I'm always surprised that this type of handsome women Wishing to appear in horror movies, but I think he is in this movie Will move to something more like this. I hope he was right, for him. No, this is a very general-straight-video-video riots riot, or just a junk, according to your viewpoint. Although there are some decent momentary programs in this movie, they do not connect well with the real story. <br /> <br /> I think that Carroll joins Alt with despair, a housewife who believes in her husband, a policeman cheating on her. There was something about their child's death in the accident and he blamed him, but he went to any place before the story. <br /> <br /> In the same lucky night, a wounded newborn came up with his door and he was holding him, and almost immediately, he was blockaded by government stews and tenants to keep the domination of his home, which shows almost supernatural fighting skills. <br/> <br /> <br /> This same type of material has been enjoyed by Matt Damon's The Bowen credentials very long ago, and this time could also do so, but this special film was reduced by lower production costs and a laucie script. <br /> <br /> This movie is really different from the end, when the mysterious stranger became a cyborg (!), who was programmed as a police member, and after killing his husband by killing his husband, he killed him Tried to! The film was not particularly good at this point, but the last attempt was made to make it a tragic active-thriller turned into a long terminator / robocop wangabe. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the violence was a little over in the end, before the dementant cybercrime went deep into the eyes of the poor Carroll Albert, before washing the dust. What was that point? In this case, what were some of the movies? I had my attention and gave me some entertainment for an hour, until finally, when it reminded me that I was not watching first-rate movies. <br /> <br /> The final scene indicates a sigl, which I do not think, though I did not check carefully. Web for it Not saying that I do not see any sequence of this movie any sooner.
