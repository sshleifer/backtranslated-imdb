Why did I buy this movie in DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really do not know. For the long version, it really comes that I really like Titiana Ali and she plays Alicia in this film. <br /> <br /> Now is Titina Ali making a real effort in this film? I must say that it is a good, and she is shaped to be rather a suitable actress. <br /> <br /> This story was terrible - and my score was based on: 1 star for 1 star I have seen the worst movies, 1 star starring Tatiana Ali, and 1 they think Not that it's only suitable for 2, there are more bad movies for that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would not be happy to see <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What you are doing here, manuselace Wallace - you were the cool man. Just Michael Kane is a great performer, who is so awesome and very well on Flickr, so you do not have to copy the viper. <br /> <br /> Fill the other half big name: OK, the bill has been paid, and we all have to do something that is not proud in our time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It is so widely defective, it is very difficult to know where to start. It's like a bunch of scenes thrown together, as the director said "we have to say it, and we need to know it." There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising about it or nothing about it. To say the least, the plot of the story was very obvious and it was predictable so it was going to happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To join one word: Reallynotgood
