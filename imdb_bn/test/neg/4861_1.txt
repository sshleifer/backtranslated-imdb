I liked to press 0.5 but unfortunately I could not. Who could write so bad scripts (I saw five seconds of movie and knew that "bad boy" will be Sethland - its tax will be paid, when you see how good he was in the movie of Redford, "General People" and others! -) <br / > <br /> Although I do not like it, I did not have any choice, I saw this movie in French, but I know that the actual voice of Shane, Swietland and Hamilton. There was no change due to him, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> There was another movie in our other French Channel: A Silent James Bond with Boshanan (I'm not talking about the actual bond with Kania (please end the holidays, wake up!).
