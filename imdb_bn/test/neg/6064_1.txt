The original body and soul (1947) is a wonderful composition. John Garfield, Anne Riverre, Lily Palmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and has been featured by the greatest filmmakers of all times, please see the screen ... James Wang Hao This reunion is hateful. Despite Rod Stiger's presence, Joe Montenegina and Jennifer Bels are not worth the price here and it is a shame that this product carries the same title as the brilliant origin. Only the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think there are any redeeming attributes in this remake. I wonder that Rod Steiger participated. It could never be the only bad movie he ever made. Maybe he needs pitch.
