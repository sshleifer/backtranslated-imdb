Teenager Tamara (Zenana Dewan) it's rough. He laughs all the popular "kids" because of his interest in shy, bokshah, drunk, and sorcerity. Football players and cheerleaders are particularly angry to write an article on steroid abuse for all school schools. Above him, his father is drunk, not near his mother and he is secretly in love with his supportive English teacher (Matthew Merceden). Popular kids ridicule him for insulting him, beat him during the clashes, bury his body and make a contract to stay silent. From their shock, Tamara is looking temptant to return to classrooms the next day and, oh, dresses kill. Yes, back to the dead and prepared for the supernatural revenge against everyone involved. He took time to eat beer bottle in his sexual reporter pop and tried to get his English teacher away from his wife (Cold Mink), who is a guide counselor in the school <br /> <br /> Acting and writing is strictly moderate. You can also tell people who have seen movies like CARRIE (1976), Hello Mary Lau: Prome Night II (1987) and The Craft (1996) because they provide wholesale from three best films. There are some graves (a person cuts his ears and tongue, and then his ribs are probably the best bit), a terrible flip scene and some campi / malicious one-fishing equipment. By no means is a terrible film, but the very fundamentalism did not go into it.
