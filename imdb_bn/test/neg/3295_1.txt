What is he thinking?!?!?! Michael Rapaport - who stole our heart in "Almighty Affront" and fascinated us in "Isle Town", how sad the actor is as his respected actor - has gone to this sad situation. The crude under the barrel after the scrap of this sitcom is scraped. All the shame involved There is a trend: the main movie actors are turning on more popular products on TV - often the result of disaster (Stereoscos in reference CBS and NBC); However, ABC has hit "Boston Legal" - the use of hip writing and great nostalgic bills). This "All In the Family" is intended to destroy Michael Reapport and most of the Michael himself insulted.
