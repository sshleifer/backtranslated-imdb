All right, this is a movie for children, and it's not one of the movies that adults will also enjoy. However, some strange moments, most of them involved stories story holes. For example, to bring the child back to normal, the child will have to take part in the computer and he has no money. So, did he ask for his pulse for his father? No, he gets stuck on it and gets caught. Babies, if I ever disappear, I'll advance your allowance, okay? Also, the goat is in the police station (there is no doubt that the accused is accused of acting in a lame), his beautiful blonde teacher has come, announcing who he is and where he works, then the police expelled the child from the slam. To make matters even worse, instead of moving fast, instead they are polite station's parking lots and their achievements are laughable You know, I like to choose, but the kid DID stole something and must face the result, but the punishment of being in this film is sufficient. You will avoid it!
