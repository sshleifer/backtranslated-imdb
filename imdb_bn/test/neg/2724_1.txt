19th century ship "realism" is wrong. In fact, if it is close to the 15th century, 1621, memory serves me because "the realistic" ship of the "realistic" ship is the Miflawar, so far I know that M'Flawar never tried to travel to Australia without going to Australia. I do not know who has managed the DK for this movie, but using the mainfloyer and someone hopes that this is not a poor thing. <br /> <br /> They even print it in cover art and DVD. I wonder how other people might notice this little mistake? Note that the film was just plain horror, I would expect more from Sam Blue.
