The words can very likely describe this movie. Loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a harmless plot, and poor music, this category lacks almost every category. <br /> <br /> Not fooled by IMMB credits. This is not a Michael Door movie. He is a second character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> There is also an actor "Prince" listed on the credit list - which makes me wonder if it is known as the same artist .... again and again I'm sure this movie is not only valuable to watch. Big summary ... bunch of parties ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 ... one has "illegal" material ... and one is 350,000 dollars. You need to meet, take revenge for revenge, how to add some confusion and mix, and you're finished with this mess in the movie. <br /> <br /> Given a choice, I'll pass it movie.
