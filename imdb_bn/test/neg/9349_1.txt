I like the "Star Wars" series. I prefer a good, cheapo sci-fi flame every once in a while. Hack, I liked Roger Karamen-produced Nickel-on-Dime jobs too. <br /> <br /> I do not like "Ice pirates". <br /> <br /> For one, it looks very cheap, you know? For a film supposed to be from an outdoor place, it becomes furious and closed-as pictured in front of someone's wardrobe. And special effects when looking at something more like a suitable maker, Foam Rubber draw metallic gray paint. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not do anything that irritates me, especially if the stories and letters are appropriate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> and sold as water (future is a hot product, I guess) Joke is almost as original as, which is not a complimentary. <br /> <br /> The humorous almost crotch level (as it comes at the castrating machine) machine you'll see early), and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude. And who told John that he was funny? Anyone, shame on them. Good old Robert Urrich tried, but he is a reliable actor on board who is a badly sinking ship (or in this case, in the case of the starships). <br /> <br /> I saw it almost three times and felt the same way - Shanhide <br /> <br /> There is no star. The "pirates" plaque should walk, despite the presence of Houston ("Priy's Honor" a year ago) and the presence of the carabin (once in the end of the exclusive career).
