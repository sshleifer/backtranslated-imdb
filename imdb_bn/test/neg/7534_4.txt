Think of a very low-cost version of "Heather's" and got your "Pepper Squad". That briefly sums up the dust. The credit is due to where I will pay the credit, though. In the film it has a nice visual appeal. I like cinematography, I like wild color schemes, I like clothing design. But without acting well, there is no redemption value in a film. I would rather see a movie with a little appealing appeal through good actors and intense dialogue (eg: "Brothers McMullen" or an Edward Barnes film). Actors recite their conversation in monotones or they shout like a bad soap opera. For this reason I'm not the mainstream actor. Let's face it, most mainstream actors are mainstream of a factor. If they are not "great" actors, they are at least capable. People are Badmouth Leo de Caprio, but the last time you watch a movie where he reads this dialog as he closes the page? This is shameful because the director seems to know that when he sees his wrong view (es) his staff. At the same time I could not fully appreciate Steve Balderson (Director). He wrote a screenplay, which contained some terrific dialogue. He may be very little racism, because there is a black overseer in the film who ultimately lives in African-American stereotypes.
