Asia Argentina has never produced a film (as far as I know, and includes his own father, Dario) where he fails to show all of his or her anatomy at any time. Surely, among the most annoying openings dialogue, poor Madison came to his office and reminded us right there that although his hair grew, he could keep his fingers in his crotch in any second (which he was but a random "what? Seeing that really? "Kind of way). DVD box, packaging, it looks like a femme fatale film so that you are waiting to see its turn a smooth and minimalist killer. No kind of luck. His verb has become blurred on some growth, and even worse, the body does not have any amazing ability to wonder immediately (Wonder!) Any scenes when it permits to close all the clothes. His spoken English might be cold if he tried not to affect it so much and tried to speak for 12 years. How about this plot? The weak psychic but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly run to be killed when she already has another matter and is undergoing some cheap drug deal ... huh? What? Does anyone have the motivation to do anything other than buy this Houston? Scrappellel seems to have been called by talking a lot about the same thing about the same thing (I see as a producer who is shown as a producer, it only has some screen time) Promising DVD cover at any time in the movie which is going on obvious errors in the character of Asia Gives. She is weak ... but she knows how to kill. She flails a lot. She flails naked, she flails in half, she flails even a dead woman's clothing. She is very floppy and unmotivated. Actually for this movie there was a great name called "floppy". And a shot in Asia was revealed that it was a better representation when it looked angry at the cover ... actually shot his food snack! What about that <br /> <br /> This last 0 creates a feeling - everyone is simply annoying and passionate to implement their motives and their objectives. Lester's wife does not provide any true vendetta (Some are at risk of living in the worst danger but are not actually valid) .. and Lester almost flashes without disclosing any declaration. Completely confusing key industry ... Yes, we know that Asia has lost its first child fat, but in reality, a passive-aggressive chick is attractive enough to play a movie because a whole movie does not give you feedback. See a return point instead.
