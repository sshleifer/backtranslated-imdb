"Black Retribution" is an alternate title "Yong Hang Ho" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I only saw this in VHS, together with "Gong Woo Ching" ("Rich and Famous"), in the first part of the story, 1987. (Featured on the page is the poster and 2 stills 4-DVD set for Rod Perry (The Black Guest), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fest), the fourth film known as "The Black Six." Strangely, the characters are "Rich and Pramas" Their original names have been retained, the name of the "Black Vengeance" Chau Yun-FAT character is called Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Taze Lynn) Harry and Andy Lau's Johnny, also confusing, that is both a copyright date for both the 1994 films. American Doubled. "Rich and Pramas" was released according to the release date of the IMDB "Tragic Hero". First Siegel There was no reason for that? Despite some user feedback, I've enjoyed these movies, although they are not "The Killer" and "Hard-ByeLead" which is not one of CHH's best, which is really surprising, however, if one day I'm in "Rich and Pramas" And came across a 2-DVD set of "Tragic Hero" but I will not hesitate to buy it. I hope these comments about "Black Vengeance" have become clear, which was also for me, this is a mystery that was in Chau Yun-Fat film.
