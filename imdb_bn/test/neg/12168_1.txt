Please - If you have not tried to sit in this trash and are considering viewing this flick / mini series - please do yourself and look for something else. Flush your teeth, start learning to play, kill your dog - if you choose anything, spend a good time looking at this junket. This is not a bad movie that you can find a few chocolates - it simply sucks every possible way. Just boring from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> And for those animal lovers who feel my comment is disrespectful - if your dog can speak, then he can not see this mess than the trouble.
