High School Bigshot Do not make any mistake about a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High school bigshoot is a gaik who wants to get a girl to be rich and get a girl. However, he goes all wrong about it, and of course, eventually ends up with death with some other people at the end of the film. Thanks <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also for us men, I'm guessing that we only accept that we "have it" or "we do not have it"! <br /> <br /> I can easily see how this movie can be rated 1, but it's the worst movie. Acting is not entirely terrible, and production quality is not super-terrible. It's not all valuable to watch a bad movie and many reasons. If you torture yourself, you must emphasize that the MSST version is available. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (possibly 1.5 / 10)
