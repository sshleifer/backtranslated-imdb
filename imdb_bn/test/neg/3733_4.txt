I did not even watch this movie for the first two years, and yet, I can not remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it very forgotten. Remember what I did, especially nothing stands as well. A gifted cast I was meant as a dark comedy, which is lost, but in this case, it fails unnecessarily. Best, this movie is silently interesting At the worst time, the seemingly sovereign overcast sky is more interesting than the story. If you like to watch movies where it always seems damp and cool, I think you might like this picture. Try to ignore what's happening, because it's just visible.
