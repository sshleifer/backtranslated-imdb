I just finished watching the dog's watch. I think that some parts of the movie took Hakki with some impossibility. The acting was not very bad and the plot was not bad. But not saying, the devil details. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Charlie Fallon's (Sam Eliot) bandage bleeding was shown, his hand was coming from behind, when he had a blood clot. <br /> <br /> 2) Will a detective kill his murderer from a very well lit area? <br /> <br /> I am not an extraordinary choice of movie, but in my modest way, it is certainly not recommended by me.
