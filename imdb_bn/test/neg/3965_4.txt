A man dragged from London Street and escaped to a foreign country where he was tortured as a terrorist suspect. Soft, cold film bothers me from hell. A film then more an idea. I saw halfway through this 77 minute film when I realized that I did not know anyone on the screen. They accept each other's similar film and drag all the ideas and put them in one place outside the real concept of character. Of course it played with tenderness well, but there is no mental center, filmmakers think that a universal person is enough. It's not And the story warns of ID as important as the theory, but the film is very neutral to satisfy any person, especially if another person sees similar good films (for example, with Reese Witherspoon)
