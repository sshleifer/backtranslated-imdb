Five years after the US Civil War, Westerners are more concerned with the age-old war between homesteaders and cattle. The cattle burn their belongings in Texas, from the Texas to the Atlantic, Kansas Trails. There, there is a big clash with the hawks not only of the big cats but also by the cows. Marshall Randolph Scott (like Dan Mitchell) tried to keep the mint in the city quiet. Mr Scott Trail has the experience of mediation between hands and salon patrons. She juggles the most beautiful looking women in the city: sexy salon singer Anne Dvorak (as Rita) and fantastic church lady Rhonda Fleming (as Sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than the sharp shooting assistance. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" starts with some promising symbols and contrast: gunmen scour a song sung in Scott and Miss Fleming; Then, the camera sings his salon number to sex with Miss Daveora, which makes a man burn guns with joy. Then, it really becomes an ideal Western; It may be because it's a fool, but not quite terrible. Young Lloyd Bridge appears as one of the Homesteaders. Dvorak's leggy dress is the greatest asset of the film; This, he is a real lover. <br /> <br /> **** Abiline Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marine Randolph Scott, Anne Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
