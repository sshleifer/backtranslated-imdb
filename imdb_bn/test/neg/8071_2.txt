I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this movie lives and works. I've heard a lot about my films from my Italian friends ... So after looking at the preview I really wanted to see "Que Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most horrific, pseudo-religious, highly unlikely and naive films. I love the film but this one is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and should be locked in a madhouse ... created a sympathy with an aunt's negative character, who wants to earn a profit which only runs a dirty company ... and I consider myself anti-capitalist ... that's bad !!!
