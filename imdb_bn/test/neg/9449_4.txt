I saw it because of the description and cover art and was cheated again. I am getting sick of these new stupid movies on the horror films. Once the blue moon is 1 correct. It started with a confusing scene and jumped for 30 years and a couple showed during the storm, okay because I love the storm and it sets a beautiful mood. Then they are facing a wicked road where they are ending a diner in a wonderful road trip. The rest of the rest got weird and then got confusing. I saw it to finish but was even more confused even after finishing it badly. I had high expectations of this movie but it was like a science fiction, then awful and something that should be made for TV.
