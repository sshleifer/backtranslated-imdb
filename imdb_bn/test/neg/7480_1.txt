Prior to the Last Call Water / Karasan Dali, my local NBC session promotes much more effective programming after the renewal of Light Night Wins / Canaan, second city TV, 3rd Rock from the Sun and Carlin City, and some comedy stands up. Nothing good to see these days because I'm going to see Carson Dali and her terrible show. She is not an actress, she is not an actor, she can not be famous because she is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> She tried to use the Internet on 21st show in June. Meme called "Recrol" in her show. He failed hard. The incident ensures that Carson Daley is awful.
