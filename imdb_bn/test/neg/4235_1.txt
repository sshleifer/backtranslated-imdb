The director throughout the film recites a hostage and infuses this film with false depth. Every single shot in this movie is 3 times higher than it is. You can cut this ruthlessly 2.5 hours to eliminate the film for a length of 2.5 hours: one sound of the conversation, an image, an event, or some movement. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazed waste film I've ever seen. Other critics say it is called a pretentious, which is a understatement. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual trash that is designed to be anti-Hollywood so that some judges can claim their independence from the Oscars. <br /> <br /> IMDB Critic said: "Like Hollywood movies - usually in the overdrive forced audiences - these listeners are slow and see the great detail of some smallest and most old features of life." You look at some of these pictures and these characters slowly Slowly move as to be catatonic. Finally, I think the shot script was a sad feeling of Peter Sellers' expertise Chancy Gardner. He uses the same facial expression and gesture. He even gardens! In many cases there are parallel between these two movies. The main difference is that the "staying there" continues as well and does not depend on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning the various things given for life.
