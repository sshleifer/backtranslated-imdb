My friend and I rent this one a few nights ago. And, I must say, this is the only best movie I've ever seen. I mean, oh! "Dude, we can get some good bruno before closing this joint" and "Dude, Linda Orein no" again a bra. "What a poem, oh! And it's a wonderfuly original movie, too, I mean, you do not usually find a slash film where every single killings are exactly the same, I mean, right now, that's the originality. And almost all of the changes in the scenes These great close ups of psychologists in ER scraps, great acting, so wonderful, Dad was just brilliant, before realizing the real DADS study. And how many movies do you find in any sense that you do not understand? But this gem is one, I mean, how cool a shadow is thrown out for more than six hours, a waiter outside, and his friends were inside? That's really good. I want to say that this is the only greatest film on earth! *****
