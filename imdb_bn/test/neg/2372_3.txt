This is a comedy version "A Train Stranger" It works quite well. I'm a strict grader, so rating 3 mostly reflects on characters and intrigues. Performance is very good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, Davito and Crystal, are mostly bright. Every actor works well enough to stop playing. Comedy is just a small slapstick of level work. Good work when deVito depraved character. His character, as authors hacked, may appear to be more realistic and most admired as a hack. In his real-life character, there is a great agent and multiple requests. Character is one dimensional, which comedy is OK. But Crystal's character is not very well written. Suddenly, she did not understand her desire to kill her mother. This humor looks like a desperate attempt. Cruel attempts are not very often, and movies flowing fairly well.
