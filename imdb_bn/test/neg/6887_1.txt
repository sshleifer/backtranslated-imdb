I think when people shoot nicely, they are talking about frog's last ups and cooking food. It certainly does not mention a set made up of about 3 rooms with a shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,? The way this movie shows at least, it can be seen roughly - it does not have enough of a dozen or more on one side. <br /> <br /> Finally finally comes the part ... flashing a chick for Vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich people who play piano all day (he is Sanskrit). The beautiful maid stole it like a forbidden green mango tree. Deep <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to some beautiful close uploads, this image is an ugly one. It's a soap opera type with out dialog It is cloyed. How beautiful is that? The set looks perfectly fake. <br /> <br /> I did not mistake and hired it because someone recommended it. I heard beautiful shots of Vietnam coastal hills or something when I heard it was a visual jewel. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I liked them even in foreign movies. But this movie is stupid and dull. It will annoy you that won some of these prizes.
