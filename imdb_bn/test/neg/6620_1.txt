The chairman of the board has a reason 2, (which is very much) This film is flat out of all the bad movies and I saw the share of my original films. The Chairman of the Board today congratulated two of the most annoying actors / people, carate tops and Courtney Thorny Smith. The carrot top is not just funny and this piece of trash was not. Courtney Thorny Smith is not a good one, just look at "Jim's opinion" and you'll see a major example of what you say. The Chairman of the Board received 1 from me, because you can do less. I was surprised and said that this part of Junk is not below IMDB 100, I will put it in the top 5 in this list, but it will run there slowly.
