This show makes absolutely no sense Every week, two women go to an estate for some gardening, and fail every week, they suddenly stumble upon a murder. Since big gardens are owned by big house owners, is not it? But how did they suddenly happen in case of murder after the assassination, would not it be smart to tell the police? You know, those who can actually do something about it ... but every week, these two fools go almost as well, malicious proofs, crimes of their own crimes, and in some cases, cause more murder. Once they solve miraculous killings, there is no way to convict a murderer. All evidence has been damaged. And you think people covered with the killers will think that they will not be able to hire these two, right? Yes! We have solved the killings! Now, like all other weeks, let's face ourselves with the killers and without any backup, tell them we know about it. There is no way we can put ourselves in danger, is not it? Rosemary and Thyme are one of the worst shows on television, and of course the most ridiculous.
