The first and foremost film I made was a stupid plot of any film, and unfortunately I had to see it. I was moving through the channel one day and frustrated with this violent plea for a movie, and I made sure that what I have been saying for a long time. Carrots are not top actors, and are not funny in the slightest sense. He works like a great comedian and he remembers the attention of the audience. Actually, his 10-year-old Class Clown has the acting ability, which is less than the ability to compare them to the 10-year-old cow, who will be seriously insulted on their good name. This movie seems to have been raised from all 50's cartoons which tries to be fun using soft one liners. Finally, I could do something to erase the memory of this movie, but sadly the memory is with me. The only thing I can do is to warn others to show this movie. However it is not true that rumors can prove to be a dishonor of top-notch carrot.
