I think it's all about my essence. This MTV-Is the answer to the classic candied camera TV show has put the General X (or the General Y) type in a helicopter with false helmets and wearing different hats and wings and glasses and surprises people, though not often in very interesting situations. . Example: Kennedy invited a guy to his "wedding" to his parents. Kennedy's bride, completed in a full bridal gown and long wig. The "joke" is that parents immediately realize that their son is married to a person who has no "bit and piece". The problem is, this schtick probably goes very long way to meet during the time. And Kennedy is about to be funny in the sun as a dead cod. Candie's camera can run three or four scenes, when it combines Kennedy, continues it, constantly asking, "Do I see fat?" I did not find that the show was made for me. It was made for the 12-year-old pinheads of Jacques today who think of the comedy height. So let them smile. Thank you for the short time thanks to the show.
