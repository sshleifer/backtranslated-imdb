I gave "airport # 79" just two stars because it's really an extraordinary movie. There was no appreciation for who had nothing to do with it (besides Charo Chihuhua, who did a great job in his role). It is not that this film is not worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz, but it is not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really seems to be an early version of "Biman"! Each scene has a set-up and money, and the scenes have exploded after each other so that they are completely disconnected. One of my favorite repeating points is that the passenger, crew and the airline continue to run, no matter what. Are you a news reporter and a weird guy who is killing your house in your presence? Hitman then smuggled you onto your greenhouse roof? There is no problem. You can still catch flight in the morning in Paris ... There is no need to get involved in police. Your plane crashes against a human race's "drone" missile, four heat-detector missiles, and processors without an attack from a known phantom warrior with cannon fire, barrel rolls, a powered dive and crash-net landing process? No problem, we will test the machine oil and go on your way within a few hours. It's really fun. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I have some anarchy in which the passengers do not pay attention to cabin crew. When the caretaker calls to the hostage walker, he will have to take a saxophone (God will release me from the flight sitting in front of a jazz sajonist). The hostage says, "no." Later on in the flight, during a barrel roll, the sack was damaged and Jimmy actually looks at the next leg of the flight which will not leave another sack. This aspect of film is just fun. (A passenger actually compels the minister, when Charo is told that she can not take her dog on a flight, then she goes to the plane. Naturally, because she can not get a good idea about her ass and boobs while sitting. <br /> <br /> <br /> The essence, a terrible movie, but a little funny enough to be funny. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit for this, it's probably Was completely unrecognized.
