Hmm Rich looking good looking kid gets hurt, poor girl falls in love with her, because jealous is tired of ex boyfriend .. Yadda yadda. I laughed heavily in most of the movie because the next scene was so hopeless and simply stupid. After moving one scene to the next, I often wondered how we went there, as I dropped out a few chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty cool and I did not have to or without much of my wife's character lover, much care about any of the characters. Now, if the former boyfriend got an ax, and the girl and the rich bite cut, then .... then ours will be a movie, and leaps between all stupid dialogue and plots can be acceptable. However, the film tries to touch and misses the boat completely (and finally tries to burst out the thrill and tries to blur the tears) ... it is very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Instead of clip your toenails, you'll be more fun.
