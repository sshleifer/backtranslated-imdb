Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" works much more than cheese you close. It's you know that it's crazy First: There is no killer in this movie. Actually, there are only good people fighting in the whole film. Second: Location ... is basically a location: some zacos house (or basement. It's up to you.). Third: Special effects (described in the wise) can kiss my ass. Fourth: Acting Bits "Out of Exotic Plan 9" in the worst-acting-big section. Ron could not work to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the small issue): Edit. The person performing this image hopes I will never find him. Coot and Shot Horna !!!! Other topics: Light (virtually none), the cover person is not in the film, and this movie is available. The sum of this picture is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I tell you that I have abused the DVD copy before returning to the Hollywood video (Do not worry! I used the MVP membership, So it was free!). Do not see this image !!!!
