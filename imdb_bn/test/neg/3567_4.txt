A different translation made it chillier or scarier? Are subtitles very little to express the definition of the original language? Does it even matter? You've heard that great actors can read a phone book exciting. Well, this is an opportunity for you to judge. <br /> <br /> If it is not about homosexuality, murder, separation, psychology, madness, confusing psychology, then it is about acting - acting with many dialogues, so enjoy the acting or acting dialog is really delete. <br /> <br /> For English-speakers, "twelve Eng's Man" may be a good choice. There is a little more interaction, and you can judge whether the acting is consistent with the dialogue. If you've lost something, then no surprise. <br /> <br /> I would like this picture which would recommend Andy Warhol's "empire".
