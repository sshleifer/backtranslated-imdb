After all, I want to say that I am a teenager, so all of this is sold to me, and I can safely say that iCarly is a very bad programming, and it is accepted between both jinn that the truth bothers me. This is one of the worst attempts in the comedy, which I've seen in the mid-action to boot. The supposed humor in the show is all based on poor quiz, poor quiz, bad one-fishing talk, and someone else's line, and you get the picture. Also, I'm still going to see spaghetti, which I know I can get negative backlash, but it's a nice fun moment with its quality programming, we make some mistakes by mistake; Intellect About the show is a young girl Carli, to set up a web show with her friends, which I can say is a nickel version of the Internet without any doubt. It's okay, but the show is okay ... well, not funny, as mentioned earlier. If this happens today's programming program, parents show them something which is really fun. Sparkrobes or Modern Life of Rocco will work. Compared to the brother's show, Drake and Josh, this is terrible, which was meant to be. Seriously, please see some suitable. Even poor for a children's show.
