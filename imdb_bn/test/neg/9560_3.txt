A boring gangster movie that you would like someone to edit more ruthlessly. I thought the story of the creation of Las Vegas would prove to be attractive, but it almost failed to escape. Warren Batti's stupid and obscure buggy Seagel is what you want to see someone else watching. One or two times he blurred through his performance fog for a striking view but most of the time you just could not care about him. Annette Benning gives her an incredible turn as her incredible boyfriend but she is only less delicious than her more delicious <br /> <br /> I will not be disturbed with this Turkishized drama until you are a fan of Benning.
