If you and your friends find great humor and pleasure from terrible portraits, jokes, promotions, and overall filmmaking like me and my friends, you have to hire it. <br /> <br /> You can not find more interesting, poor quality, cool, delightful content, just by reading the tag line and seeing it's not funny. This is a story of some children who resist the laws of physics and reality, and through modern day large screen TVs end up with the dinosaurs world and eventually become their friends. T-Rex does not mention a ridiculously serious scene where the father became the image of one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy category, but if you find it, you can find it with kids' movies. So call your friends, sit back, relax, be ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote ridiculously awesome one liners in this movie for weeks. "What's with all ruckus?!"
