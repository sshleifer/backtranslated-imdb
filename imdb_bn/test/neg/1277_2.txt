I stopped this movie in 48 minutes and changed ... I do not know ... maybe because I'm not Swedish ... or French (cancer commentator) ... or any other sleeping place, held in front of the critics ... Born and raised in NY. Lived around San Francisco for a quarter of a century. And now Holland. I love a good independent film as the next movie enthusiast ... but a word is not funny. To see? Now that's funny ... that you're thinking that I made a mistake. I said, 'a word' but then said, 'Not funny' ... no. There is no mistake. If it is like your humor, then I would say that most of your life was not ... consider this a symptom of your gratitude to the film ... and please do not write another review ... I have them agree when their belief is a trend. Even if I had only 3 reviews before ... I thought that I would be able to save the annoying ELSE ... the expectation of the loser that is never implemented ... I smiled once or twice, though ... when I I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. That would be 10 lines.
