Lou Gossett, Jr. is a wonderful and impressive actor, but he has to take the role of "President" and then he works like James Bond, it carries a song and acts as a warehouse to unveil a plot to kill Christians. , And then being able to flee from the supposed high security facility to live another day, is not judged - this movie has many incompatible problems <br /> <br /> I will try to list some: <br/> <br / > 1 - If no vaccine is given, what was the purpose of "stockpiling" vaccine? - For example, if the "cleuteness force" already has a vaccine on hand, the preacher can be vaccinated - later, William's wife becomes ill preacher and she becomes ill; So, the virus was, so, infectious? - If it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife go to church without proper protection? Why did not they get sick? - And when he drank alcohol and became "healthy", how did he suddenly know that the drink was "antidote"? - Was it wine in the wine, the general red table wine in California? - Red wine was enough for the juice - and, if the preacher had received "communion" at least once every time, then perhaps he was already ammunition flowing through his body? - We got a "heavy" box of vaccine that was never used in a bro and cloak - can we see any mysterious message? <br /> <br /> 2 - Presentation of "evil" forces, who are working with Anti-Christian Nicolai for destroying the Earth, such as Star, Chinese, etc. In fact, in the early 1950s and its James Bond era, and modern society Humanity shows ignorance - do we believe that the Russians and Chinese are always trying to destroy this planet? - And for any purpose, mere destruction? There was such a shrill scene in the world and there was so much clich√© to be sunny. <br /> 3 - The main purpose of this movie was the very last scene where Kick Cameron and Lou Gosett, convinced non-believer among junior audiences ( Kirk was showing anti-religion Lou) - it was a film with a meaningful story, wasolated with many reality and was completely inadequate for a great actor What's the plot <br /> <br /> I, therefore, rank it as 1, since zero is not available
