Yes, in this film, apparently you are treated with more than a small snowman on the very warm climate attack, so yes this film is not really taken seriously. In fact, it is basically a lot worse than the one that produces at least one product, it seems to be more than just a few rupees and a video camera. It's fun moments, but to confiscate your movie credentials and make it your deliberate smile, if you ask me to make it a weak film. You can not bring a good story, your effects are going to be really bad, let us make the movie as bad as possible with a terrific linear and we have movies. The first one was at least a reliable story because it decreases in winter and does not amount to any symptoms. It also had a very good effect, because it is just one or two ahead of Hubble Glin, so far as the monster is concerned and you really want to be more than two steps above the hand puppet cloth. Despite this, it creates a super end to it, which brings an ocean ocean out of the cosmic ice. Actually, I'm just kidding, but it's really the most fun part of the movie.
