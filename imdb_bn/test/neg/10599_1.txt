I have heard what people are saying, but I ignore them. I ran into the blockbuster and took a copy of the movie and ran. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes I was fighting to stay awake. There are some attempts to keep the film interesting, but it was just bad. Some sort of a plot takes place, but it was long and pulled out - perfect time to make a snack. When I finished this movie, I just finished, I just wanted to finish. To see if I was trying to travel around my house <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√©, characters and their relationship. The plot twists are predictable, as well as the end. Actors made the breakthrough out of the really awesome role. Everyone can say: Their clothes were beautiful, but the movie, it was just bad.
