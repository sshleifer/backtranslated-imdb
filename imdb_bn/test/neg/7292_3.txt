When I put this movie in my DVD player, and I sat with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hopeful that this movie has some strong aspects of the first movie: Awsome animation, good streaming stories, excellent voice cast, funny comedy, and a kick-ass soundtrack. But, in my despair, it can not be found in Atlantis: Milo Return If I read some reviews first, I might not have been given so below. The following passage will be indicated to those who have seen the first paragraph and enjoyed it for the basically mentioned points. <br /> <br /> If you have chosen Atlantis when the first scene is shown, then for the frustration you have: Millo's return to my local video show (or anyway) display and I had the prospect. The music feels as a bad imitation of the first film, and the voice cast is replaced with such a modified place. (Except for few characters, like sweet voices). The actual drawings are not bad, but especially the animation is a sad sight. The story is also very weak, because it is more like the last episode of the same episode as the three episodes of Scuba-Doo. But do not misunderstand, it's not a very good scobie-du-episode. I did not laugh a single time, although I could have been once or twice as smooth. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < If you do not, but you have nothing to do, you can enjoy this movie. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I do not know. Millar's return was good on a three-episode series or morning breakfast on the cartoon channel.
