I can rarely give one or ten stars in a movie, but it was so terrible, I had to make exceptions. <br /> <br /> I saw some comics in Saifi fan and Saifai. Really like. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But consider that, set and impact is bad. Cinematography is moderate, but may be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> acting bad. A sad state when the female voice-over is the best actor for computer. Dialogue is bad The script is very weak and the plots are helpless and almost helpless. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and noble; It can not be found anywhere. For example, the entire 20 minutes of the 80-minute film, Alien Mascot and the elevator were spent with a lam 2 punching combo copper. <br /> <br /> Everything from it was supposed to be a parody. Bad 50's SciFi 2001. Even though we did end up, just a slightly updated version of an old 50's SciFi C movie. At least those movies were fun because they took it seriously.
