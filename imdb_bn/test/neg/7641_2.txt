... I have liked it but at least once in my review of Reppi for the time being reviewed. Among other things, the notification defines the lack of emotional sincerity in my opinion. Respiro seems to be an artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, fairy tale ... legendary, even made with a very closed and self-conscious intent. But thankfully, for all true artists, there is no predetermined source for artistic beauty and depth. Exquisite natural locations (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy even look outside to other Italianians) will not lift a stale film outside a beautiful heritage of some funny, ridiculous, spontaneous performance images by beautiful actors and attractive children. . Yet this is disrespectful and vain, and finally the movie can be an art, can be very successful at a very limited level, perhaps in some cases accidentally. I would admit that it's a definite visual poem that is conceptually ending chaos. However, it is my belief that it was in favor of Lampedus' sea beauty and more to do with the strong symbolic strength of water and bath (it is more so than mystical, mysterious, religious, archaeological, etc.). With the talent of the crease. <br /> <br /> <br /> For a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background, she sure has a fashionable outfit. Her flattering, floaty flower dresses and attractive, sun kissed beach hair can graced pages of any Vogue summer edition. There was nothing more than a fashionable addition to her conventional demeanor in fact she was a "nutcase" - in a way that deepens her "status" to her skin. Illiterate of the Galinor, misunderstandings of natural women and the two-dimensional stereotype of the oppressed Western communities were bad and annoying, it was annoying and annoying to make me worse. I agree with critics from London that writes that mental illness is very poorly served by the movie - during the whole film we did not really feel the feeling of Grazia's illness and there was no mistake with her (a "free spirit" is a tiring stereotype). We do not know why he has been given injections and will see an expert in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main symptoms of overall solidity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another fairly insulting aspect of the repirator is its position analysis. আমি এই ছবিটি বর্তমান বা অতীতে সেট করা ছিল কিনা তা নির্ধারণ করার জন্য সংগ্রাম করেছি, কারণ এটি ইতালির একটি সম্মতভাবে পশ্চাদপসরণ অংশটিকে তুলনা করার উদ্দেশ্যে (তুলনামূলকভাবে) দ্বিগুণ বার কুইন্টার এবং আরও সহজে এটির চেয়ে আরও সহজে আদিম বলে মনে হচ্ছে হয়। Again, this brutality smacks and part of Calyese's complete lack of sincerity. Some non-Italian viewers would be delighted to pursue a transparent, authoritarian group, opinion of the Machu Picchu, as they were common, and they would also see my country sometimes culturally broken in the 1950s. Q: I want to ask Ferguson Davis, Texas, Dallas critics are as follows: What is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? OK, so why should I be?). Unfortunately, for anyone who still wants to see Italy in such an Acharya way, Spesy's attitude is actually ridiculous and sunny in the eyes of this Italian audience. The excitement of excitement between Grazia and her eldest son was so tedious and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sex-lover-husband routine. In particular, Grazia joined her husband and male friend in the consoles of men and man-men in the bottle of beer with her husband's shame and displeasure. According to this movie, it is not a woman's place to participate in a man's conversation. Ah, but our "loving" "free spirit" is very good for this place and does not understand the tyrannical, ineffective rules of Lumpudan's father! In this scenario, not only is it counterfeit, it should be enough for itself to disrespect the credibility of the whole film. It gets the wrong end of the described culture stick, which clearly shows that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would like to challenge contemporary Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> সত্যিকার অর্থে সমৃদ্ধ সমসাময়িক ইতালীয় চলচ্চিত্র নির্মাতার জন্য, যিনি আমার মতামতটি ইতালির মহিমান্বিত চলচ্চিত্রের অতীত ইতিহাসের মধ্যে তালিকাবদ্ধ হওয়ার যোগ্য তার প্রাক্তন আত্মার ছায়া নেই!), জায়িয়ানী আমেলিও - বিশেষ করে ল্যামেরিকা, কোসি রাইডভানো এবং তার সর্বশেষ, Do not see more than La Stella Che non sin. Unlike most contemporary Italian movies, a fresh and freely creative voice of Amelier is tragic and unsettled. Despite my acute criticism of the Resiro, now I believe that the latest Nuvomomondo of the crew, which is now shown in Italian movies, is a good fit. So I look forward to enjoying it, even though I do not do it (consider my feelings for my feedback!) It would not be too much surprise.
