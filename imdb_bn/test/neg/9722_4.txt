TV shows beat the truck head-on for this movie, show battlefields, then break the bits and reform the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the general style of the movie was wimpy. Instead of these three girls, the "skinny" TV series with three boys <br /> <br /> It is a great surprise for three teenage adults to get out of the dynasty who is a fourth member and to consolidate all their energy out. In addition to driving trucks, these kids can fly by the side of the house, get out of Windows, drag each other into the dirt stack, and pop out the fur in their throats. But if they use their abilities often they are old and weak. The boy is given this evidence to father, because he looks like a mummy to sit in an attic but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> Three good warlocks are each of the dirty rich, its own right, complete destruction, insulting, and annoying. In any government school, these kids will be beat every day. Do not cut any mustard with the boys from tangled to their glares and facial ticks. Unfortunately for all the good people, these favorite boys were sent to Hogwarts Reform School for a war that Harry Potter could not enter the class. <br /> <br /> What was the movie then? Acting with three teenage girls and their daughter. One other teenager who envies their power and money and will be a lost relative. After a few scenes where extreme boys show their power and have sex with their daughter; The movie gets almost unaware of the warlock teen revenge plot. Expected material will happen. Bad warlock ambushes several friends to the other warlocks, and eventually start their very attack. The final conflict happened, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you want to see fireballs, spider, and blue veins, then see this is a good movie.
