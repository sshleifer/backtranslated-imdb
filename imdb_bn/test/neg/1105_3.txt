I really wanted to like this movie. A movie coming out of a manger to kill the wild children in the night is a great idea for a horror film. Unfortunately, this movie was in three films held at Horror Fest. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters have died because of her illness, which costs a lot of money to their family. They will adapt to their new environment. Due to various reasons, they fought in the neighborhood. (Crazy Jumbo kids go to this section) The film does not give any emotional attachment to the living or the death, the film leaps into a horrible, or momentous moment, the movie is only showing the children what they are doing ... murder! This film might have a big budget and hope this film with a good cast. Until then, pass it. <br /> <br /> In fact, 3.5 / 10
