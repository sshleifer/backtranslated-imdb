After finishing this trunk piece of trash, a friend and I swear an important oath that I never said how we trashed the last 90 minutes of our life. This film is absolutely vain, a double-dimensional hero and heroin that we can survive or can not survive and do not darken the screen of the most harmful villains (or any other) style. To prove more clearly how foolish this film was, I liked to add a plot summary, but I can not even imagine. After all, I can remember that if anyone who wants to watch this movie, only if they kill their entire community and find some autocratic punishment that will frustrate you for next year!
