I bought this renting return for $ 1.99 and overpaid in Hollywood. I did not expect much, but at least at least I could think of falling asleep. I quickly talk about very weak story, fairly moderate (not to say anything other than a cartoon), and seemingly made-by-everything-as we go along with whatever happens. I know that the participants in this world will be very shy and I'm sure it will not help any career. For the 35-year-old film, it has now made a accountability for the worst-film-ever-seen question. <br /> <br />
