I worshiped Hadi Lamarr. I think I was widely underrated as an actress during the 40s. He was Nastassa Kinski of that era and critics did not take him seriously. All that said ... this film is a b ORE. When I first saw it, I was not only consistent, but also surprised by the lack of consistency in makeup and costumes. Changes to the makeup of the shot from the shot to the shot. So do hair length and style. The reason: this thing was so much a writer and it brought so many stops and it was astonishing that they always published it. Her film "Lady of the Tropics" began filming after the film began, but it was released before "I Take This Women". In fact, at that time, it was known as "I Re-Tech This Women" in Hollywood. That would tell you something. I'm a Spencer Tracy fan as well, but he's strong here. I've read in the history of various movies that he totally despised Heidi Lammer, and it looks perfectly clear in the film. Whatever chemists, whatever. The story revolves around the railroad and eventually ends up very strange. I can recommend all of these at once.
