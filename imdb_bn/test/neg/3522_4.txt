This movie is so light! I did not try to expect anything more from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. This could be so good. Characters are really simple, no depth at all. It is a shame that previously talented actors Tina Limi and Petty Sumannen have not been able to make poor characters better. The director is not only fragmented into pieces by piecemeal <br /> <br /> and the order of the cheeses at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
