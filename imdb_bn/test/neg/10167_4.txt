It's a long time that I and my wife do not see such an annoying thriller. It is definitely not a gripping story and it is so slowly that we almost fell asleep. It could instead be a very low budget TV series. There are some funny scenes where the mafia boss wants to see a red cloth jury lady or another mafioso can not think about her. Okay maybe it should have been a romantic thriller but you do not really miss me anything. We gave 4/10.
