I'm a hungry for crowd / gang movie, so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train debris. I can not believe how bad it is with all the big names in the film. It was so bad that I started to laugh fiercely at the end of the movie. Actor known as Zeus or Big Dude from the Icecrub film "Friday" is working incredibly throughout the film. I told Blockbuster, when I returned the film, then the garbage was removed from their roof. If you do not want to spend two hours of your life, do not rent this movie. If they come out with a signal, I wonder if this will be twice as bad for the first time. I'll be more cautious when renting the so-called 'Viv / Gangland' movie.
