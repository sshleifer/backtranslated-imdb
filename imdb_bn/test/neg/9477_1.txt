This awesome movie. It's stupid last. First, only twins are careful and how they like boys. They are the 7th grade. Can not say I'm a prude or something but it sends wrong messages to girls of all ages. Being beautiful and popular is not everything. But that twins are out of it. The plot is even worse, The girl's grandfather will just be the ambassador of France (SP?). She took a fellow girls around Paris and met two "cute French boys" with they motorcycle. They started shouting to meet the boys and picking their ETCs .... They meet with a Supermodel and they feel unfamiliar and go to Paris with the total strangers. I want to say more? This movie can be 8 and 9 years old knowing. Couple boy friends want to play that ditsy losers. It makes girls send wrong ideas. The film itself is not great. I do not recomend this to anyone. I give a Paris 2/10 passport
