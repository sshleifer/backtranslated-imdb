First of all, I'm not a firefighter, but I have some kind of firefighting unit (who hits earthquakes and more people for the real firefighter sir), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience. <br /> <br /> But still, some points are absolutely incredible as a notice. I understand that the masks / noses have been removed and there is not enough smoke, because the public will not see anything else. But some things deny rationality: <br /> <br /> - There is no second mask associated with oxygen. How do you want to save people without one without smoking? <br /> <br /> - Rapid people No, it's not like that. Even if someone occupied a rope around me in this fashion and hanged me from a building, I would have been shouting. If I can scream, that the wind does not leave the wind because the rope shakes my lungs. It's good for the second time when they mock Jack, but still weird. <br /> <br /> - "Watch high". No, you are not bloody. You always fight fire from as little as possible. You do not want to flame the fire, you want to burn the fire, and under the fire. <br /> <br /> - There are no disciplines. They're running around like chickens. And instead of using the radio, they always shouted to maintain discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why do not they work in at least two groups? You can still be isolated, but if someone walks alone for hunting, it takes too much. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter the building without water? I will not enter a burning building in Europe, except fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - Burning on the roof. WTF do they think they're without a safety line or water? - Explosion room. Wood and bricks "do not explode suddenly". <br /> <br /> Good points are actually cameradar and other non-fiery parts of the film. It's a lot kitsch, but that's OK. I would give a point for this.
