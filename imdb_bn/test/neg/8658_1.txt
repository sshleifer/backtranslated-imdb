It certainly does not cost money or time. This is the meeting with a guy's same Hackneynid plot and a girl and the fall of love. But it is with a western touch. But it fails miserably in a love story or letting it touch the West. We do not think that we are hero and love heroin. There is no depth in their letters. Perhaps, with a good cast, some trial letters may be brought about. Finally, this is no funny, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy, no work, no romance, no romance (I make romance more passionate). Definitely a movie that you want to go with your family. Overall, if you're looking for a movie with some content, it's certainly not an option. I will wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something that I can wait to see and I can mention my friends as a "watch certainly" movie.
