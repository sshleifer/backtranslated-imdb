After I posted this comment, IMDB is currently rated Alfred Hitchcock's Suboper Sabotur 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rate that it is half less. Indeed, I can not tell how the film can be bad, perhaps it might be the best director. I have seen 10 other hits in the 30's 60's. Vertigo is so dear to my hands, Subotu is the worst, easily. It is difficult to believe that hits 7 years ago used the same formula more efficiently in 39 steps. My recommendation would be to avoid this like that instead of and plug-in. This is the only hitcock movie that I had stopped before I finished and did not want to go back and watch. If you watch it, then you must rent or borrow. I did not make mistakes and buy DVDs on the good faith achieved through the new, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window etc. Even a master sometimes uploads screws, I guess. <br /> <br /> Edit: Maybe I I wanted this film was a little harder than it was. Ed Wood or Manaus or something like this is not there, but for three reasons I think I should give it a low rate: <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" comes with some expectations of quality. This image distributes some of them, but they are shaded by the void near non-sensitized plating. <br /> <br /> 2) I received this film and would like to pay some compensation for 8+ ratings. Hitcoak director John Coleton True fans will find reasons to consider some of their artwork, but the high rating of IMDB gives more casual film enthusiasts like me the idea that this film is actually much better than this. <br /> <br /> 3) I've spent 18 dollars. Perhaps it might cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, but maybe I'll be a little less nasty. ;)
