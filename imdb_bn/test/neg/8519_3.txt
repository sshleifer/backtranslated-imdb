This movie is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I got angry at TCM to show this hilarious more often than Bachelor's Mother. Somehow Hollywood Bob thinks that rebuilding the mother of the child will be a good thing, it is filled with some lunatics that can only prevent an intelligent comedy flow. Instead, Hollywood could spend the time of this horrible resurrection, money, power and talent to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Simultaneously with Rogers and David Niven sex, a spicy stew. This is an amazing phenomenon of the 1930s in the Hays Office. Bobby of Joy (Remake), Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher have strictly milk and cookies. It's a 1950s handshake with Eisenhower <br /> <br /> Which cast you want to see - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adlofen Menzu, or Zinger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each member of Cast is much better than his latest version. <br /> <br /> Basically a beautiful, young Ada Rogers is at its peak. David Nivan is a loser in the Department of Magazine's store, who is completely distorted, sophisticated and yet delivers a complete spell. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie. Among the bachelor's mom, she is priceless as the grandfather wannabe of despair. <br /> <br /> Joy Debbie Reynolds's bundle has its usual perfunctory self. She is subtle in this role, though her performance (as well as Fischer) completely alters the story's voice. As an actor, Eddie Fisher disappointed. He is fully on the screen "Appearance." Here he is a very healthy way for this story. His acting is completely soft and candid. Likewise, his song is so soft and unknown that it is completely forgotten by the earth. The only time he is not totally painful, Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he does not sing. Here, alone Fisher's lame performance is enough to destroy the film. Adlop Menjuoo, a favorite character actor, provides an efficient performance, but none of his best. She is more blustering than commanding. She and Fischer are not believers as parents. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical instrument, the story is only accessible? Or a musical watch for a story, some (optimistic) good music used for seasoning? If the former, you might like to rebuild this lame. Otherwise you are good at ginger Rogers non-musical origin, bachelor's mother watching observer.
