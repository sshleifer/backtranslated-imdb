Well, if you discount the price of production, ugly clothing and big hair, this adaptation is still worse in version 90. First Anne Firbank (playing An Eliot), this role is ten years old to play and her performances may be very fond of. Amber Route (playing the same role in the 90th edition) can produce more than four hours in his big, brown eyes, from the backbank with his whole face. What would Anne have to do with a chic, whining, boring character (and 'long walking' time scene where she had to stop spout poems?). Henrieta and Luisa looked so similar that the only time standing beside each other was when Henrieta was tall. And Luisa! There was no humiliating character! It was ridiculous to think Ventworth was interested in his interest. She is supposed to be stupid and stupid, high spirit and beautiful and charming with her ridiculous smile like a claw on a chalkboard. When he started shouting, 'Lime, lime, lime, in the lime, I shouted, shut up, shut up, shut up! The best part of the movie was when Luisa fell into the three-footed football club because I knew that she would not see her again in the movie. Talking about the fall in Cobb scene; This is a bad performance of Moses, poorly directed and edited whole film scene. How does a person fall three feet down, land on his feet, and still knocked unconscious? <br /> <br /> On plus size, Elizabeth's character was much closer to the book than the 90th edition. They showed many more scenes with Anne and Frederick. <br /> <br /> I will admit, I bought this movie, although I knew how sub-par was, but I am a huge Austen fan, so I would buy a movie adapted from her novel. See this step if you are shocked, or appreciate the 90th edition. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this novel can follow the novel's letter, but the 90th edition follows the soul.
