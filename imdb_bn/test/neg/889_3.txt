I'm not sure why producers need to trade in the name of some successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a series of the first three films. This is not what it is. Although Marx appeared on Houston's "HP3", he had played a completely different character (he, eight years old) in the film. OK ... so Reid and Martin were not the most gifted and they could not carry a movie themselves. But in order to trade in the HP franchise, I think that can create some references (though small) the previous movie. I'm sure everyone wanted to see it "Hoodwicked" - they're seeing a signal - not a completely different movie with a known name. And I'm sorry ... Kim Whitley is not funny, and last Sunday Robin Harris, Katie Lester, or DC Curry could not keep a candle. Though Megan Good and Marie Moro are a visual diversion ... but I have to give this thumb down !! Just be sure to name the movie "under the last minute". In addition, Hoodlin Bhai (who made the first three films) was not involved in the making of the film.
