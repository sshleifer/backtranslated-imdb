Mickey Roar (who once was a famous film star) played Martin Felen with an IRA terrorist, who eventually beat a school bus, who, by his actions, was so annoyed by his decision to leave the IRA and fled to London. <br /> <br /> !!!! Combined spokila !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is rather annoying, because the lives of small children have ended in a fire. This happened in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, which makes prayer for a real reality. However, Falon will decide that he will release violence (what? He is a terrorist and he never blames innocent Pasha Bar?) The reality disappears and the clichés and ridiculous plots take place in twists. Martin London wears an "IRA" (not a professor uniform) by the underworld (his own hurt person?) At a graveyard on Thursday (he never knew) using a bomb with a car bomb IRA?) Where he saw a priest Who recognized him while at SAS. Who say that I lie? I do not and we have half way through the running time and still there come various clichés <br /> <br /> All of this seems too stupid and what do you expect from a novel by Jack Higgins? Everything is clichéd, conrived and stereotypical and bits that are just plain malicious. Critics killed this picture when the film came out, and significantly, they said that this film could have some potential during the filming of Bob Hoskins gangster Jack Mehn and Alan Betts, making Sass's soldier a priest, and once the critics could be right. The flones could have been played by someone who was able to make the Irish accent if they should be careful that the film could be less frightening. Rourke may be hunky and macho (Oh Goud is another movie with an IRA uberhunk) but the character is not more powerful points than the character acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because "Annesilen bomb attack". In November 1987, a bomb exploded in the center of the temporary IRA Aniskeleen, where a memorable day parade was held in memory of Britain's war. Eleven (11) people killed and more injured scores. It was not an accident, and it did not leave anyone in Iraq
