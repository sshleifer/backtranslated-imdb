Through its 2-hour running length, crashes chart the emotional pain of the 10-odd group of characters in colorful racism and sometimes racism in American society. The one who is sitting next to the emotional anguish of one of his listeners and trying to understand how these films have become today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We do not just refuse modernity, even the thoughts of modernism are not too inspiring, how the next post-modernities Throwing by, which aims to destroy all these ideas, thanks to the great destroyer who is the great 'thinker' concept. But I have no hesitation. There is nothing to do with anything about this movie, but rather what the movie is about. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems difficult to live a Hollywood, which can be provided in the market, so discipline that has become more than just a policy of life in post-post-post. We become part of what we do and what we think about it we do not like. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films, which once were energetic and idealistic in its vulgar experiment, now seems to be equally rude to sell indie market in Hualien movie market. An indie film will be sold at Sundance before being 'acclaimed'. And so nothing is easier than ever. Even the formation of a good film becomes even pink. The past filmmakers only wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and this seemingly simple effort was made to produce the largest films - filmmakers will now have the best and foremost films to be made; Movies, people should think, be meaningful, have to be excited, question raises, yoga junk This is a isolation of the Hollywood movie system, which is a confusing feature of the Hollywood movie system, but it seems surprisingly similar to the storyline similar to the confusing Hollywood movie, in many ways it is essentially different from the same product. <br /> <br /> And I have not started yet in the film. Maybe I see these days that I have become very favorite in movies. Maybe it is because of my primary need to entertain, say, do not investigate when filming should be investigated. But the hell, this movie is loading a big greed. And this movie is not expected by me because it's How to Take Hood to the Movie Good Good 101 guidebook vibrates T-Characters in public lines and they are gifted with God's lecture. It is about life in front of America in terms of racism and living; It's a 'touch' moment where everyone discovers more about themselves and other people; Once you hear the emotional / new age soundtracks of women in higher registrations in foreign languages, you know for all the above features in this way. Up point - about raising questions about immediate compulsory issues like racism - big time pisses me off Like everything in post-post-post-post-post-post-post, this issue does not just conflict with having a message. Because, oh, in this post-post-post post post, our audience is much more intelligent for this day. Our audience wants us to remember them, we do not want that we keep things so simple, (and then they will enter the existent cone and say) because life itself is not straightforward. Ha ha ha What we do here is that other common drillers will then have to think about topics rather than feeding them. All right, all right, and okay. So, with the help of these non-messages, the audience pounds the audience and they are not exactly a message, so it is so perfect, fine and subtle meaning. So we are repeatedly hit with this mathematical disgust with the prose prose. And as if the wicked is not busy enough, we have the character of Ludicas, the only character who seems to not take it seriously seriously, is being transformed into a shocking meaningful character where he eventually learns something, the audience 'about themselves Provide meaningful beauty and breaks where something is supposed to 'learn' . Um, yes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Self-importance. The distraction that the whole movie produces sounds more white-boy than the real spike Li-Esc. When this is so, Tim Robins and Shan Pen, the kind of humanism that wants to blur the flag when they do not understand, the flag they are facing is the underwear inserted in their holes. It has become so prevalent in the post-post-post world that it is completely fine. Nothing is easier. In fact, it is not Yooho, another indie director of indie director who wants to reveal his name as a credible indie-film maker, in fact, good, provocative, and finally in his best effort to be a man. At least Hollywood is now more and more sincere and sincere.
