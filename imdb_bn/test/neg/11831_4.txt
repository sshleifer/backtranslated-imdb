This is a semi-fiction memoir of "International People" which has seen various political upheavals in the recent 30 years. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will give a great deal of insight into politics and war. I had hoped that it would be touched and affected. However, I was frustrated by this film. "Chico" seemed to be, the original character, Ricardo, lived in a country for 10 to 20 minutes. May be expected, such details of any time frame can be detailed. The excuse to transfer him to another place is often explained. The result was a frustrating collection of split clips shot in different countries.
