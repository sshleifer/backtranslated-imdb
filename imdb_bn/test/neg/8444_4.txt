Obviously, Joe Dante is not produced by this "Pyrenees" and Roger's order. It was not very clear when I bought the DVD only $ 2.95, because the DVD cover art made the charming / comedy "Piranha", even the DVD menu (certainly not a feature) matched the cover. Seeing this strange movie half way, my girlfriend and I was thinking, Where is Pinarosha? Once the movie reached Claymax, we realized that we saw the wrong movie that we saw in the trailer, which was a completely different footage, what we saw in Blobber behind the DVD did not match and the credits (actors, producers, directors) were completely different. Instead, we got a jungle meldrum to get a girl and two people who searched diamonds and ended up facing an animal animal face. This joke, the exploit thriller is annoying and unmatched and old school, is only gentlely amusing for camp quality. Wicked DVDs can be made with the wrong movie in the wrong movie, but I think it's a simple mistake to look like 70 similar B-grade movies of the same name. While reading other posts made in this movie, I noticed that I'm not the only one with the wrong movie in the DVD. How can it be an international error? Perhaps there are some DVD incidents where failed movies try to recognize incorrect DVDs? What is happening???
