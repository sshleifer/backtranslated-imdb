If you are a fan of the original ten commandments, then this film will cry inside you. Allowed, I'm currently around it for 1/2 hour, but it's so painful, I think it was my duty that they were victims of this despair even before they warned ten submissive fans. I do not think that in fact, special effects could be worse than when the main shot was shot in the 1950s, but this 2006 rimak proved me wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but the mad conversation, the cinematic life-long film-artistic fascination, and the submerged I-wax-statistic-life-life-acting I hope that they will overwrite the plot and Mozes will be drowned in the Red Sea.
