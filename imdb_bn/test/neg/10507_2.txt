I said, sometimes low budget is good. You will see a lot of good films without additional BS which otherwise might hide the bad words. Well ... this was a bad piece. If anything, I thought it was ridiculous, unfortunately, humor was unknowable. The only half acting came from Bill Smith and his part was cut (this is a joke). Bill Smith was never there, nobody could have played there. Even Gerald Okamura began to chew, and he was played in about 40 movies. The war scenes were ridiculous and I thought I could kill all their $% # @ # # kick. The word was horrible, so that all the words were recorded on the set. My 10-year-old could have written a good script ... BTW, my 10-year-old sleep ... No fun. I could give a B + to spend just 90 minutes to finish the movie ... 60 minutes a ++
