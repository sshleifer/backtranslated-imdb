This movie was really bad. I mean really really bad. The scene was like from a parody and sucked a lot of special effects. And it was painted in 2003 !!! I think it was a great waste of time and money and Michael Shanks just laughing me with his 'Scott Scooby Doo' photo. Do not waste your time with this picture ... I do not really know what the director thought after watching the film's final cut, but the fight was so unreal that it would push my eyes towards them. Ladies 'cat women' were like a sheep roaming around the scenes, there were no sources of what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of the picture below 100.
