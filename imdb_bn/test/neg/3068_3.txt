By recognizing the diner's picture in Dhaka, I realized that this is a local film. The title of the Detroit in the title provoked my suspects and I saw something and yes, this is a local film. <br /> <br /> So I picked it up. Anyone I knew actually knew the producer / director (no one remembers) and said that the producers / directors of the film had to pay money to the people. <br /> <br /> Bright! What a great idea The filmmakers have got some capital to film the movie thanks to the movie and the crew. Then the investors (cast, crew, others) get some profit, I imagine. <br /> <br /> profit! <br /> <br /> Um, whatever happens. This photo completely disappointed me. Special effects were special for small children ride in those schools as special children. Acting was very funny, but not deliberately. There is such a great line in which a person says "well, this bone will smoke himself!" As a pickup line. Unfortunately the only interesting part of the whole movie is The story Well, I followed it by following about 3/5 paths, then everything was closed and we sat down and saw that it suddenly came to an end. I mean, there is no resolution ... they are out of time. "Sorry guys, from time to time, good night! <br /> <br /> We fooled there and threw them in another picture, then after about 20 minutes, my neighbor movie showed a lot! We threw it again and he (actor) He gave us an ongoing comment, which was amazing because he was completely trapped in the movie! <br /> <br /> What more can you ask? <br /> <br /> The most painful scene for me is 'A motorbike's Chase scene was so dark that it is literally running a flashlight with a guy and not a motorbike, and that suddenly your jaw jaw was enough to make you hello hard! Zombies looked less like zombies than my colleagues and I worked at morgue. Do not do it. <br /> <br /> So, if you can get someone from the movie and you can give a running commentary for what happened behind you. But I recommend this to see. Scenes and make sure that this person hates the movie because it just adds to fun. <br /> <br /> Give it a pass. If you are a fun way to rent a feeder In the movie, it looks bad.
