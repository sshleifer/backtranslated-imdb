There is nothing to do with absolutely fantastic first flick for one. And of course, our Americans only have to succeed everything in English, because people are reading subtitles, SUNU is not hard! From what I have seen in the new trailer with new pregnant Jessica Alba now (well, not sure that every teenage son's fantasy is destroyed everywhere!) That looks exactly the same, but perhaps twice the budget / doubles I thought that the original was the most horrific / mysterious / mysterious fruit which I have seen in a long time. I suggest to see him together and recommend it to be exchanged together, because there is no reason to look at it because it is also not known as "The I2" because it was also the first Fleck's superiority capital. Watch yourself with a "Watch" eye volume and get ready for some potential jumping. I saw it w / headphones and was pleasantly surprised at the excellence that Pang brothers had instructed. If "The Eye" remake works well, I hope it works for Pong Brothers movie career, but at the same time it seems embarrassing that people will not be able to see the original, because often / almost always the key is not as good as the original. See if someone wants to be a bizarre bright spot, but the actual can not be compared with the flick just by comparing it to the siegel.
