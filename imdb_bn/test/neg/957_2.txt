Possible Speakillers - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Mag Ryan. I was waiting to see them together, married and everyone, I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. OK, that's saying, I'm the actor, they do not have to carry their acting, I guess, especially with this script. <br /> <br /> A professor may be stupid how the glue could be. No one yourself I do not remember the original, but I can only guess that O'Brien is probably in the hands of his leading lady, perhaps more inevitable. If I were to "bind" someone, I would be very angry. Crash I will definitely be dissipated quickly. Meg even a little surprise showed even a slight annoyance. Dennis kicks and screams. The whole section of the movie was so awesome - especially in the darkness of the night, Meg had to go to the bathroom in the dumpster (# 2). Ewww Any f **** ing way! <br /> <br /> What is behind every suspected scarf in the movie with Danny! Sock first ask questions. Not once, twice but not many times - If I was so interested, then I could count. <br /> <br /> Nicole and her family drama were the most interesting part of the movie. It is very bad that can not be the plot. The leading off-screen drama until this tragedy. I could have been writing it in confusion from Dex's search. <br /> <br /> I have a fault with the writer of this blame. Unless the directors and others object so much that it is unknown. <br /> <br /> I did not even kill the poor docs for real reasons. How ridiculous that is Even when DX was facing real killers and the reason was explained, (everyone in the screen was a real "silent film" moment) everyone was bored on the screen. Oh, _____ happened. Oh (yawn) "Dex even said it's a silly cause for a triple murder. Oh, pull, you can cut with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If someone without Dennis has done this movie, I'd like to give it 1/2 stars (Only because I've seen bad), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For Dennis and Meg stars, see something else.
