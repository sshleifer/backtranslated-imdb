I just wasted my Saturday night watching this hobby! I've credited Chris Noth's name (from Mr. Big, "Sex and City"), Robert Patrick (from "X-Files"), Growing Elliot Gold, Pen Menny and Mercedes Roulele; A very reasonable IMDb rating (5,6); And IMDb much better reviews. For my total surprise, the film is terrible: the characters are badly designed; The story tries to be fun, but it is totally stupid; Marxist Roulele's character is a stupid fool for the professors of Princeton So, I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews and I saw that most of them are reviewed only by IMDB users, so cast and relatives of the crew or friend, or rented person for this junk promotion My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sam Returnno" ("without return")
