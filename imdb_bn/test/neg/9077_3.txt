Branson ran with this money; He must have a home payment like me! This low budget movie made in Mexico reminds me of some Italian stickers from the sea. I have heard, I do not know whether it is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because they will make this image, it will not make sure to earn money. We had a whole lot of stinkers made in Canada, the government gave a break in tax to create a movie industry. I wonder if I pay off other countries like Canada. However, behind this issue, the film is made poorly in every aspect, I believe they have taken Charles Bryson to sell this stink; Ultimately that dead body looks very terrible. 3/10
