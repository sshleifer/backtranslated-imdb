If someone tells you that this picture is only awesome, then perhaps it's about creating or doing something about it. This movie is genuinely damaged and it does not mention the soundtrack and copies of the horror films of big budgets. I would not recommend this one to my worst enemy. This is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like shooting for a film competition. It would not surprise me if the acting is terrible and written by the author of Hai Ho script. My family smiled at A grade ZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be scared by this one. Here is a taste of the terrible element of this photo. When he gets the revorend James Johnston walking with Rick White's stupid screenplay to walk around. If the reaction of the guys was such a separation with no pain killer. Watch DVD additional after you watch the movie. When you see Rick White and others talk so much about the movie then you will laugh at your stomach hurts. How do people spread the truth and how will they earn in dishonest means? We are fooled like what and do not buy this failure.
