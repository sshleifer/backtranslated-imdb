This movie was made because the ideas are well-translated into two sentence essays that can be used for the interest of investors. That is, the courtyard is attractive and sellable. I mean, I rent based on the index. There is nothing beyond the basic concept of the problem. There is no coherent plot, no completely characters, no real comedy, no attractive scene, no surprise and no good performance (except John the Herd, he does a little bit more). It seems that these green green people will not read the script, but only get started. And if there were enough people like me, even it could earn money. <br /> <br /> To the potential audience: Do not waste your time, there is nothing interesting or interesting to watch here. To filmmakers: Hey, your movie has been made, so if it's not cool. Most people do not see their work on their own or on the screen.
