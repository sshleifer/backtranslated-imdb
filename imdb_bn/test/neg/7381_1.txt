I hired this movie because the DVD cover looks like it's going to be a comedy comedy like a hello wedder or animal house. I came to my friend's house to watch the movie night We closed it for 15 minutes in the movie, and instead saw Copper Mountain. You do not know Copper Mountain, but it's not cool. Anyway, I would say that Allan thick Jim Carey Duo has made it a more enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> I later finished Paddle Cruzer. This movie was slow and humor was forced. This movie reminds me of some stingers that I have seen in my previous production classes in college. I was surprised "did this picture enable broken lease to make supertrapers?" Also how could this movie suck so bad? Supertroopers were good and the Club Dred was decent. Do not watch this movie!
