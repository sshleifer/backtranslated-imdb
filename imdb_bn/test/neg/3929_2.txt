Yeah kabutara and cobra is awesome, and it is interesting to see them, even though cobra seems rather banned and dull here. Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s and enjoyable time-consuming cars and clothing. This annoying film is all good. The conversation is incredibly bad, as most of the acting. Ray and Mandy's motivation seem to be compelling and impossible. I've seen these "training being a pickpocket" routine many times before. A long build-up, leading to nothing. To catch an episode of "San Francisco Road" or one of the many great crimes / copper movies. To name a few, Bedtime Story, Wentley Roton Scoutries, Lavender Hill Mob, The Griffers, Paper Moon, The Sting and House of Games.
