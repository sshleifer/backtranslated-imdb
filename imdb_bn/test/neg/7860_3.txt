Although there is much to suggest about Mattel Legend in both cases of concept and finished products, it is finally a poor movie. Plot wise It is a retelling of Maetel's primary life, which is generally unclear; At the same time, the authors get the opportunity to tell the story of machine empire. And without finding trouble with her other work in the late Matsumoto, we got an introductory point for her sister Emeraldus, her mother, Queen of La Metel and some of the Galaxy Express 999 to throw the film out of the flesh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a princess of La Metal in Little Matele, which is a planet of an irregular orbit. This means that the circumference around the nearest sun reaches a cold stance and it is the death of artificial sun. The planet became increasingly cold throughout the world, resulting in increasing intelligence. To protect his subjects and family, the Queen has decided that the mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of La Metel's people. Lord Hardgier, write a robot / cyberlace that provides money for work. Through the film, the characters go into the question of mechanization, will they still be human? Can Hardgear Believe? What is the soul and the heart? So there is a lot to enjoy, for fans of matsumoto work, there are many things to enjoy, themes continue to answer questions, but it is clear that this is a presentation as well as a fan curiosity, without the theme being continued. The biggest negative of animated, when the Galaxy Express 999, for more than 20 years, a TV series has a strange face animation and sometimes Sketch character design, the Metal Legend has the worst features of modern animation and thus the Expression 999 can maintain respect for the galaxy. Detailed detail, but unfortunately Anime Sanati 'slide' well-drawn characters, which had left or moved to the background, such as cameras jumaguli, faster way to animation. But some, yes, some good animated scenes are used in the sequence of dreams, repeats and over again over the over scenes. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Lord Hardgier can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> The next story, though the idea seems to be great, the last product is actually a series of conversations that are repeated over a little effect, repeatedly face the same issues and the same thing is objectionable to the audience and the characters. , Which is apparently more apparent in the previous title. The horrific character designs that appear to be useless, excessive collectors, and the audience are left with a movie so it can be reminiscent of a different movie as it misses, at least the novice will not be disturbed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Yet, it really has its moment, last at least surprising. The plight of La Metel citizens was very influenced and frustrating; I guess that I find the whole people machine theme annoying. It is difficult to recommend Mizel Legend, because it is not well animated, written or executed, compulsory cross-referencing of Leiji Matsumoto is once confusing. But I can not help but when the three-nine grand entrance takes place it is now a good movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 of 5/5 if you are a fan.
