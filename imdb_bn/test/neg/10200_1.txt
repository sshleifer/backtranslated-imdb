I saw the gamma in the movie theater in my town. My friend took me away and I was really curious how it looked. Well, I must say that this movie was not horrific, we can say that it is a fantastical experiment ... all right, I'm going here ... but there was a lot of shooting, acting, dramatic, dramatic and story-telling problems. Because director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. Directorial directing of this photo was not bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the controls placed in the film in its extremely low budget, the scenes are often as nasty as the storyline. And there is no strong Gothic scenery. As a horror movie it really fails, there is no fear and it is quite annoying and annoying. Some people say, 'Gomeda' is an art film, but I was not able to stop such a ridiculous, terrible and artist movie. So, how can we say it is an art film! Just funny!
