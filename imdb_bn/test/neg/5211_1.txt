How are these guys given the funds to make this movie in the world? The lack of scripts is one thing, but cinematography wants you to cry. The camera can be very valuable in the look and feel of the movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he's doing. I am aware that actors amateurs but it can be the least gifted to the management of Sweden from no director of the defense. It would be embarrassing for the industry if he pays to make a movie (or about a group) about it. This film only provides fuel to the argument that many movies are produced in Sweden every year in Sweden.
