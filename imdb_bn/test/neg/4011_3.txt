I saw this on Sundance last night. Altman will ever be the most hit or missed director of the notes. This show is absolutely illogical and despite its "star power", its political insights - which I am not proud of as a proud liberal - seems to be moving away from the headline titles of shallow and incognito, and the United States today seems to be considered as Mario Cuomo Coming Drama, for example, is not very dramatic, and comedy is not funny. How New Yorkers live their life and see the only point of interest, and a cast and crew's loyalty to reconsider a series of rehearsals since 1988 has been reviewed. Sometimes it seems that Altonman's only contribution to the movie is that all of your actors simultaneously speak the art, whose impact seems like a stranger to a wedding.
