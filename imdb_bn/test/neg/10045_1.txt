I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; It was vain and just plain stupid. The supposed plot is a possible bride caught in the problem of world related to her wife and other people in her life. She disappears on her wedding day (not less than a tux) and hooks up with strange curiosity. <br /> <br /> We saw it with bus load people on the way to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that this was a terrible movie. It was trying to be deep but it was not; It was stupid and objectionable. If I was not in the bus I would have gone to the movie. The video that you are watching or considering rental or buying a video is already reported to anyone.
