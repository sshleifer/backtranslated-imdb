I was surprised to read all the positive comments in this movie. Even my 4th and 6th year old was bored. Chips are beautiful ... but the storyline is very obvious. At least sophisticated taste is not recommended for young people. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughs from the audience while we were present; But why am I surprised? <br /> <br /> I never accept the 'Chipmux' fan, but I hope to entertain. As far as I can say it is not an 'escapist' film too. Just see a heavy handover of 'very young loot of success'. We have seen enough with the speaker of Britain, et al, we do not? <br /> <br /> Do not get bored.
