The film is so prominent that it did not develop. Mark Hummel gives a good performance and so is Bill Packeston. Scenes are beautiful and ultralight aircraft are renovated. The problem of this picture is that the story is usable and the plot is not anywhere. The film will keep you awake for some time. I can give 3 stars out of 10 for the flying scene.
