Yeah, that's okay. If I ask my friends this question: "Have you ever seen the worst movies?" Maybe they can answer "Armegadon" (you can drill the hole?), "Shake", "Plan nine out of space", "Medellion", "Scooby Doo" ... No - Do not Get This Movie H ' The naturally produced human rows have seen something in the same category that you think is offended by it. If you think that the worst movie seems to be, it is really bad because it stops you; Then you do not know anything about my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy six ... I remember my day and a friend of mine went to the local movie store to rent the movie. Most of us already have movies and "new movies" - if we look at it at us. "Wow, here are some good actors. There are some things about the Mafia, just get it out and get out of here". It was doubtless without the worst movie mistakes in my movie loving life. This was the worst mistake for everyone else: the movie lover or not. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see a glass of ice cold water (or ice tea ...) to see this movie. At room temperature. Seeing this movie you have to show an eternal dream of death, if death is not just the light of darkness and nothing happens, and then you realize that you just wander in TV-monitors. Not hungry You are actually paying so much attention that human is possible. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This film is the perfect filmmaking film. It's not that bad that you can not see, point and laugh, it's such a movie that is very bad, you really do not have a chance to get out of your memory. Until you use electric shock therapy to clean the brain. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ....................................... br /> <br /> -Jargen
