This movie is about 2 hours in my time and just want to scream me: "LAME". Nicholas Stolar wrote "yes man" in the movie, but can write "this" directly. He can write. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated because I've heard all the great reviews. I was hoping something like fell. Are they the creators of "designed"? Why can not I see the compatibility? But this is a shallow, overdone theme kind of for me felt like movies. I'm very frustrated. Actually, it is not bad if you are not considered bad-movie-movie, but the character of "band people" only reaches my nerves. <br /> <br /> I have not given enough attention to the movie, but yes they have some funny lines and scenes, but I do not feel basicity. And the last movie can make a little better. At least the end is not one of the few annoying clich√©.
