I figured what ever Karen Black attracted She always had a bewildered look about those beady eyes and her. He often shines or throws it to the "other" woman. In this case, he learns the strange projection is a rare proponent of bad advertising, a secret proponent and specialist in the brain. She is an average sucker, even without new baggage. Apparently it is the path of immortality, because if you are good at it you can live in future generations. I believe there was such a plot hanging over Jack the Ripper for centuries in the Starck Trek. However, this guy is really dangerous. She has a beautiful family and makes them uncomfortable. He starts killing friends, because they have unkind remarks for them, or he does not like them. You can see the end of coming from the row behind the left case. This is a very harsh, ridiculous movie. It must be accepted as the most truthful. Why is something called but a few are selected? I found it long and very satisfying.
