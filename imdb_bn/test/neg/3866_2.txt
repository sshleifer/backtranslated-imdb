Fifth collaboration between Marilyn Dierich and director Joseph von Sternberg, Venice is a film in Blend, which looks great during the game but fails to be associated with the audience. The dramatized plotting story has exploded between two men, it became a huge cabaret star and fought for the custody of his child, and often baked three different movies bits. Dietrich inadvertently cast a reactionary, reactionary role for the film and his character is different from the audience, and Herbert Marshall is incredible as his helpless husband, and Curie Grant is mostly considered guilty and is out of the picture. This movie contains some interesting set pieces ("Hot Voodoo" is a high point), which is incredibly spiritual for this era of Hollywood, although it does not help in such a shameless, inconsistent film.
