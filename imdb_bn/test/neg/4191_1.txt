By adding the barracks to people considered as 'unauthorized' only, I will say the following: I do not repeat clear flaps clearly specified by some other commentators: I shot to the "movie" video (I do not know how to do a camera), but cameraman is also known as AutoCocus ( !) Was always there, so that a little movement is focused on it and out. In many scenes the actors go out of focus for their scene. This alone screams "amateur" <br /> <br /> I noticed that in the middle of the 'cornfield', you can hear that the gasoline generator's word is aloud .... Br /> <br /> Also, they follow (and many actors) with the source of a single discussion that revolves around. It looks like a newscaster that follows people like 'Spotlight in camera light'. There was no 'credit' for lighting design / dp and I know why. 'Filmmakers' do not need to look for someone who actually knew how they were illuminating the picture (note I'm not called "film"). So for most of the movie, the Scenario should be ready as the only source for 'Cinic Light' for the bright spotlight. UGhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically incompetent production I've ever been commercially released. I liked the bad movie because I bought "this title". Usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it. It's just so bad that it's unwanted. Out of the plan nine planets "Title Why" compared to this title.
