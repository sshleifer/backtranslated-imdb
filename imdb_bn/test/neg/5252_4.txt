Imagine the future looked so dark! Christopher Lambert gets evil giant Grendel wars in this deadly looking trashy fantasy-epos. "Ipsos" I said? Er ... here's just a position, so you can not really call it an epic adventure, you? Location is a medieval / future 5-inch-long fortress, so how are they managed to manage the sequence among all actors? Oh, I get it, where special effects are. A small <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Set and costume is surprisingly cool (if you are 12 years old) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> She loves to look outside through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> - ... er, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> - Every time they start fighting, this top raving techno-soundtrack is not going on. So why would this medieval slayer-duo dance when they are fighting? <br /> <br /> - They do not have electricity in this castle but their speakers have been installed which seem to work fine. Where is the amplifier? I think they borrowed it from Techno-DJ who provided soundtracks. <br /> <br /> - Finally see this for this mountain, which is a harmful giant CGI animals coming directly from any Playstation 2 survival-horror game <br /> <br /> If all this If you are interested, see this (at your own risk), but do not tell anyone what I told you. I have no soul in this movie because I doubt the pinhead set inspects while shooting fast. However, if you want to look beautiful, Rohana Mitra really shows some skin, then look at Paul Verrovan's Holo man.
