I went to Blockbuster, Ichchin 'to see some good old fashion action films. So, until this movie got my attention, I browsed around the Action section because in Dhaka, there was a great bold letter Sandra Block. An action movie with Sandra Bullock and rating it?! Yes! Although I would admit that I liked him in the comedy, but if it was something like 'speed' then I sold it. Sadly, Sandra is not really in the film, his role is not small: "Paney abduction girlfriend" (he is in the fifth position for the list of Gibbs!) Apparently this was his first movie role (and after watching this movie, I thought as much as Sandra The only living person in the film, everyone else can be a zombie in a B-horror flick. This movie cheats me It was that Sandra was leading ... Marty cried and said, 'Back to the Future', I fell for him like Biff. "God, I saw this instead. <br /> <br /> This movie The only bright side, when she is in the camera, she is picking shock pedals and screaming "Clean!" To get these movies but it does not matter flat plane, no matter what she tried. More ... <br /> <br /> The movie is soft, very dust, think of the slowest moments of your life, then stay alive for 110 minutes (for me, this film), this movie is a music fighter anyway and Bullet time makes the effects boring, so the elephant tranquilizers feel shameful. And the concept of Bullet Time makes it intimate to each other at a slow pace, due to the sudden move away from the caps that represent every second of your life. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself progressing fast "through-step!" The volume? . . . Had a Plot? Song? . . . Even if the 80's Mck standards are bad, at least this is something that awakens me. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good. . . ummm. . Move Is this a good reason to rating it? No, if R is standing for Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> and it's actually 80 seconds to clich√© when a movie is open with a city rising up (guitar leaking or walking in the power of the ball) and the gun ends with a steel walkway and a pipe complete with a pipe complete in a poor factory . This is the movie which is both satisfied. At least this film has established the era of which it was unnecessary, since Sandra's hair "shouting in the 1980s!" And when a killer stripper kills a deaf person in the bathroom and stuffs his body in a box, the movie actually becomes ham-fish, which you are sadly saying: "This is probably the worst thing that has probably got a poor snake." At the beginning of another Hmmm moment, when some secret agent-dude cuts the crowd, and apparently the person thinks that the man jumps into the air and falls to the ground when he dies. The scene that was needed was a Mario execution or perhaps a soundtrack effect, but Nintendo filed the lawsuit. <br /> <br /> And sorry if these pity movie icons stop key icons. Before the big gun scene, The Hero is standing in a boxing ring ('Rocky'?), Playing leather Fedora (not 'Indiana Jones') with a vague spotlight behind him (Terminator T-1000) is really sad At YouTube or Dailymotion, people can enjoy the movie after the film of good quality (no less webcam is less). Most of the rant videos I recorded with serious, bad audio and vague images are more entertaining after this movie. I can not even call this movie with the name given to her because the name is very cruel and unusual punishment (a scary violation of human rights!) Can bring back memorable memories. The only bright imagination of this dark eruption has started to stop Sandra's career. But oh sandra! . . Why do you have such a nightmare? Pichaac is well worth it. The DVD graces you with a little back story on Sandra as an extra, has seen that she is the only one from this movie who ended up being the hold of the house <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can come back to 'Majes and Monster' with a good old campus Bruce Willis Comedy. But after this movie, Bruce could not cheer me up. I still can not see any Ed Wood or Uwe bowl but I am amped for them now. I can not even even fathom even a movie worse. . . "GAG". . . 'Hangmen' . .
