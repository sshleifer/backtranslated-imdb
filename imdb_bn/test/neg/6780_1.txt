I had great expectations around this movie (now it was not an apocalyptic 8 8/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on it, they all got disconnected. Acting (poor, almost middle, a wonderful waste of good actor and talent) and the story itself: when a 5 men's team go into hiding on a «hot» zone? Suicide ?? That's a big mistake, that's the costly cost of the film. Very good actors have played here very poorly, such as Shan Pen, which has recently been "I'm not Sam» and Michael J. Fox, which plots the good chance to defeat Charlie Shane on Platoon », only performs it« average ». But the most annoying character was Diaz (director, another stupid waste by the director), Diaz (director), a chessy, scared and insecure person, even Jar Jar Binks (even you heard it) were even more annoying. . The sequence of wars is average, the only one that really stands is the sequence of the first. This is Michael J. stuck with a foot on a VC tunnel. With Fox De Palma has a weak job here, and if it is not for films like «Scarfus» and «Ashpakel» (these extraordinary films), I think he is a director of «Bluff»: too much publicity, bad filming. </ br> <br /> 3/10
