My friend and I hired this movie for Blockbuster 3.99. If I knew how terrible this movie was, I could not give a cue. I had no warning for this bs. Acting can not be said even acting, reluctant sex scene is weird, and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable and male villain ... God could not have told how Emily was going to attack. And musical cues ... my lord. This movie wants me crying. Do not hire this In fact, if you happen to look at it, gauge your eyeballs out. This movie is not God - it's from hell I am just going to write the last few lines, Allah Allah Almighty, because I do not want to continue this review.
