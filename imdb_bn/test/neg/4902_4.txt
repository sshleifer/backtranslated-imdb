Seeing Pride is important to remember the true meaning of the word "inspired by the true story". Like this "you could save up to 50%", which can be completely translated "you can not save more than 50%." Until it is realized that the lower portion of "Up to" is "zero", it seems all the best. Similarly, "inspired by true stories" means that some people have heard a story and thought about it. The only sure thing is that the real story and what you are going to see is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> The real reality of Jim Ellis is to start swimming in the Philadelphia Department of Reconcerting swimming team. In the early 1970's, but I think Jim Alice does not really be able to conceal feelings of frustration on the way to the movie. Obviously, it takes wild freedom with the story of her life, and I see her reacting to the strange look of her picture, who thinks the film is a lot different than why people know it. <br /> <br /> He must be proud that he has portrayed one of Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who played alongside Barney Mac, who is still impressive and ongoing in spite of lacking in original and powerful stories. <br /> <br /> This film was a time and place named Philadelphia in the 1970s, where racism was the norm, not the exception, and educated and professional Jim Elise, who is swimming in a swimming, this is a fruitful teaching position, finally a Falling Individual Entertainment Entertainment Center, which he employed to clean up before its demise. We surely understand the feeling of his feelings. <br /> <br /> When we first met Alston, the maintenance man (Barney Mack), he was frustrated sitting in his office, surrounded by a mesh vessel and touched on the roof and an old, dust television. Not saying, when Jim clears the place clean, Elton is not friendly with him. He knew his Rich Center was shutting down, and all his anger was shifted quite simply to Jim. <br /> <br /> As a swimmer of college, he has taken special interest in the gym pool, which he cleans and fills and brings to the top. A group of black youth who only play basketball outside of the Riche Center show interest in the pool while taking their basketball rim and the heat remains steady and soon there is a developing swimming pool in the group, which they swim through a city. Call their underdog, of course, would be something of a understatement. They are unorganized, irrelevant, inadequately trained, and have no idea of ​​dealing with swimming. <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not matter. The film is your ideal underdog sports story, so the first athletic waiting is completely essential as something other than a teaching experience, it's a catalyst for their rigorous and more concentrated training, which will lead to final athletic knitting, it's a matter. Until now, only a sports movie is going for it, not only that the playwright will not have to conquer the final time of the film, we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their efforts. <br /> <br /> Sadly, all the characters in an old Sigal movie have been developed in the movie. Good guys are good guys because they are just supposed to, and bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who smile and tongue and make racism in our team. Oh, and a scene where white boys combine a black boy in the middle of a race while in the middle of a race. I do not know that it was really possible to kick a water like this, but you got the idea of ​​how deep the development of character is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this gym alliance is the children's group. From the hanging kids on the street and some of the organizing and competitive groups to swim, but still we can not know anything about them. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the only true statement that the movie produces is the attempts and efforts of the organization and bad for the racism. Both of them are clear that when a movie is made with them, it feels empty and unnecessary. Racism was so strong in the United States in the 1970s that the film seemed like a huge loss to the problem that the direct deal was facing, but I did not really say anything about it. It's like a good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should say, it's a lot bigger than that, feeling of feeling becomes sad depression.
