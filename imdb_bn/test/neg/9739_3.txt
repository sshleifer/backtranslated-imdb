Most of you really like this movie ... you were right. Your little minority really liked the movie ... you do not say wrong. For me, this movie was very stupid. I've seen many stupid, stupid comedies but this one crosses each of them. When I was watching, I could not open my eyes, I did not believe what I saw and tried to try to determine whether I could laugh or cry, like * the real stupid * string was going on, and people were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the leading character, time travel is complete, just enter a museum and you will actually travel in the past. Plus, if you want to look for the experience of the death, just go to the nearest planet, where you show Lord - sorry, Lloyd and important commands will be given ... above all do not really understand, do not you? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I do not regret the movies I see), you probably do not like it, but you'll eventually get confused by the author's ability to create stupid scripts. <br /> <I'm 3 out of 10, not good, let's get worse ...
