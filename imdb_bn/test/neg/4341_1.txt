It is a pale imitation of the die hard franchisee which sucks only. When the terrorists keep the vice-president hostage, the film's ambition is clearly shown and the White House is asked to request some money transfer. In most of these films, the President is abducted or hosted because he (or he) is the most powerful person in the country with the finger of the atomic buttons. If Dick Cheney, if most Americans are worried then kidnappings? Honest answer- Probably not. Why the terrorists will choose the Stanley Cup final to complete their operation and why there is a lot of explosions around them, the audience is unconscious about the situation in the stadium, it is unlikely the question. Let's say this picture is not actually hockey, not hockey. Those who like this image and think it's exciting to get their lives.
