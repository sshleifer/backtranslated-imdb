The VHS cover for The Evil looks like a cold underwater horror flick. Sadly it's a boring adventure to flick around and there's no real awful element. It starts attacking invaders and we see some blood, but this is the only blood in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The downstairs temple is not the worst, but it is a bit annoying for the horror movie. The only thing that keeps you watchful from acting is honest and honest, developing romance between the two leaders. There are some nightmare sequences where it seems like the director did not know what to do. I manged to sit through it all (just about) but I will not recommend anyone on this film. Awesome fans may want a copy for cool VHS cover, but it can be kept in the best left.
