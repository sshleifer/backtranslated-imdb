Ben, (Rupert Grint), son of his unhappy married parent, deeply unhappy teenager His father, (Nicholas Farrell), a viker and his mother, (Laura Linnni), well ... let's go, all right, he is a little bit of a soldier in Jesus' army. Only then did she find herself in a real-time 'Harold and Moud' fashion, as a backlash, astonishing, a once famous and now forgotten actress Eve Walton (Julie Walters) assistant. Of course, EVV is deeply unhappy and these two sad sacks find each other when they can keep their mutual grief aside and hit the road on the path of happiness. <br /> <br /> It is a little too sensitive and very predictive but it is a difficult aspect, too much and Walters, who want to sleep in its way through things like this, are excellent. When he keeps his madness on one side and finds character stones (such as breaking the bottle and throwing it on the sink), he is his best The problem is that he is the only attractive character in the film (and it is not due to the script that does not come in any way). Grint, on the other hand, is not just unhappy; Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional when she is also a bit of a bore. (Yet, he got a pat off English accent). It is most enjoyable for it to be gently entertaining - emphasizing silence.
