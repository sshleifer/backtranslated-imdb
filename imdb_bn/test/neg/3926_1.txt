The performance rate is much easier than this rating given by me, because I will not support a film that shows how a child or mentally challenged person can achieve, cook, and inject drugs into their body. <br /> <br /> This is a horrific film, which does not serve any purpose in the world, but rather tries to legitimize the life of the drug. It carries the act of believing, which adds to my hatred. What were these people thinking?! I can not enjoy a movie like this. Think about a person who has never been a drug maker and who has freed themselves and they have freed themselves, consider the return. I am surprised that it does not make a clean junk, it closes the wagon without making it clean. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this "movie", which is a strong out doku - drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
