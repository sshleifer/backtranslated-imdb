This movie is shot using a digital camera, and it shows. There was a lot of annoying digital technique used to break the viewer with the help of terrible scores. That was not enough, the acting was also terrible. Acting in Hartley's movies is always remarkable, but here only BAD, especially Satan (Thomas J Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) can not say much. After all these external problems, it is very sad that the story itself is not good. The trick is expected and incredibly straightforward, and the incident melts on one incident from the incident to the next. The so-called so-called book inside Armageddon is nothing but an excuse for the actors to strive for their line. The time and money and efforts in these films are wasted. Frustration
