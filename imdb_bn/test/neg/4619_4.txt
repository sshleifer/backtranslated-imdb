This is not a great movie. The image is cliche road and in many places it is a copy of the original carrier. Parallel to the original film is interesting but with the inability to connect with the teleconnectic powers being born, I can not say that I dislike this film because it has spent at least a few hours ... but a inhuman book on a long train ride These were passed after reading. That book will not be literary, but it will absorb one for a while and will soon forget that it will be mixed with many other cliche books. Likewise, the film was okay when it was lasting but probably forgot. At least I think it is. I can think a lot about it now !!
