This film tries cash for the success of Richard Curtis's films, especially "love is actually" (which I liked) - a series of different scenes followed by the lives of different couples. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary idea. The script tries to be a little clever and simply does not resonate. Actors mostly reflect the director more than the performers. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on a plane) is called "Park to Scenes", which is not all the scenes in the appropriate headline 'Sexual Nature'. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for this movie, but eventually it was frustrating. Do not disturb.
