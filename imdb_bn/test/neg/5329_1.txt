Author-director Emilio Estevez shows a certain lack of talent here with this non-communal, supposed comedy. The script is completely hopeless, let alone that it is unreasonable and badly working. Comedy does not just work. When Estevez is not used to lose the taste of sex joke, he loses gags and uses them very badly again. You think that the grouping of Esthervez and brother Charlie Shane will be cool ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do yourself good and leave it on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
