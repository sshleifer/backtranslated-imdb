I hope this show be somewhat realistic. I saw it after my stroke as another mainstream show. I did not feel the characters, does this America manage its terrorism glamorized? The main character does not work like a fundamentalist and how it passes for terrorists is beyond my comprehension. Other terrorists did not really see. A volunteer, all American white boy members, will not be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a French pre-skin, is not quite fit in an Islamic terror movement. On this, the white American householders of the terrorists have sexual intercourse, which I think is very strange. This is just another stupid wrong pedestrian American TV show. It's about realistic as a prison break.
