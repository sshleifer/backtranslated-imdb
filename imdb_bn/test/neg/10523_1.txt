Okay, we went with the experience of stereooptical bad orphan and explained to our son, that it was the leading acting and dramatization, taken from Russia, so we can play the dog football (from playing football). But the last scene, the dog goes back to his original owner, puts it on the edge of my son and shouts for 15-20 minutes, "He has to change !!!!" This is from an elementary child. I do not recommend this family that is a family adopted; It looks poorly, orphan, and adults badly - and in the end, even if they win the game - the dog that binds the boy must leave the dog - and it is too much. Please be careful if you have a adopted child and are caring for your children with biological children, because the printed children are not positive and they make a steroidate color unhealthy and painful. (The dog is beautiful, but this film is not enough to save our family's response ....)
