I once had a conversation with my parents, who told British movie girls in the 1940s and 1950s, before watching it, you can see the original country of the film. It did not matter whether there was a plot or something, if it was an American film people want to see it and that the British would not want to see it. It may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing an illiterate heart, I understand why people like to increase the American film in those days. In the late 1940s <br /> <br /> British was not a member of the working class in Britain and it shows this movie. Everyone speaks the language of the English boy de de daar, which makes the British royal family a word of laboring scams, and isolating a potential British audience, which would not like to see Jimmy Cagani in white hitting without any doubt. If people were not sure about a violent gangster in the 1964 filming of some high-grade English films, then they are not related to a violent gangster. It's entertainment, because people go to movie movies. Even the letter names seem weird - Leonora! How many British citizens were named after Leonora in 1949? And get the drama cocktail. And they use the word "ost". It seems that it was not marketed for the mainstream British viewers of 1949. However, most of the British cinema entertainers are uploading Quinn in the movie to see America's many entertainment? <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the chagrin heart in 2005, when everything was dated, it was actually a date that I think it might be a fool from Harry Andfield Show. I'm not surprised that such a film came closer to drowning the British film industry, an industry that did not start as crowds such as Jalu, Alfai, and James Bond's films until they invested in American investment.
