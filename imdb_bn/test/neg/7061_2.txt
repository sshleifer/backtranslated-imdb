Jupiter is a girl who comes from a happy family in a happy family. Its amazing wild hair and sounds that sounds too high pitch and weird, it is hard to believe fusion !! There is no match with Sophisticated and fun character, Nora Charles, who played the movie Thin Man. Instead, he casts so badly that you almost want to be in Ad Wood. What a huge difference a few years he made his acting ability as well as the ability to act !! Above the stupid characters, the film also fails because it is not only interesting or exciting - it's very, very terrible and stupid. The best thing about it is the Vitaphone Sound System - since 1929, I have heard that this Turkish word is well made. Heck, it was even better than most movies of 1930, so the sound technician is proud of at least something - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that also hosts the Turner classic movies as "guilty pleasure" because the film is so bad! And, after seeing it I disagree ... a little bit. The movie is simply bad.
