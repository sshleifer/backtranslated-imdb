Oh yes, this is definitely a strong opponent to win the "worst slasher of the 80" suspicious award. "Priy" has received a thing that you usually want to avoid a horror: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen thousands of times before (and better), impossible characters and terrible performance, complete lack of gorge and suspense, strange photography and unoriginal location and ?? The most irritating of all ?? The biggest amount of unforeseen padding footage you encounter sometimes in your life (and that's not an overdue but a guarantee!). Along with the seemingly endless intervals of National Geographic Stock Footage, I'll be expanding later, this movie is completely embarrassing to include the Banjo Interlude (!) And two shows, where the characters are astonishingly joking that even the remote is not funny! It gets set up as a fundamentally basic, with an intro sculpture showing the image of OTT voice fire with the human image. Fast forward, almost 40 years after, when an elderly couple goes out camping in the same area, most of the off-screen breathes. You should have enough information before anyone can survive these years and often from now on. Enter the three helpless couple couple to reach danger zone with the only sexual intercourse on their mind, of course they walk on the walk. "The Pre" is an illogical annoying film. Apparently it was already shot in 1978, but someone wanted to distribute it until 1984 and why it is not too difficult to see. If you want to filter all the material actually relevant, it will only be a small movie with 30 minutes running time; Perhaps even less. Nature and wildlife footage have an unusually large animal, sometimes animals that I think do not live in this area and they seem to go forever. In reality, the only thing missing is the national geographic description, which provides educational information about animal habit. The animals look strange on their own natural biomass, but the building is crying, supposedly helpless, and not in the Chess 80 slash movie. Last fifteen minutes are finally effective, some with strong makeup sequences and monsters (those that are "larched" from the films "The Adams Family") with good make-up effects, but still intensely overrules ?? The scene with golf is too stupid ?? And the final shot is just laugh-out-loud. As mentioned above, "The Pre" easily creates the most personal list of slashes of up to 80 slots, "Appointment with fear", "Barkerker", "Deadly Games", "The God in the Woods", "Holy Gate", "The St Wave" "And" curfew ".
