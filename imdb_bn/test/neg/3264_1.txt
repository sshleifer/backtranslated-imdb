Why was this movie ever made? They have ruined the original Caddyshack with this hobby. I was able to see only half and I could not laugh once. At least I could not see it because it was Tv But I will not return that hour of my life that I saw this terrible mess. Without Cherie Chase, there was not a real star from the beginning and probably he would regret this movie. Jackie Mason was the first to have fun like Rodney Dangerfield but Jackie Mason was not funny. Jackie Mason is no Rodney Dangerfield If you want to laugh then check out the first cadets. If you like terrible movies, then it's you movie. This movie stinks like a Bernard on July. Avoid all costs.
