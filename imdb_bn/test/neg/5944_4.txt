Repetition: A band of five young American men who were severely hit by the WWII aggressive attack, which acts as a forward postpost and looks for enemy activity. Both physical and mental are in a really bad position and they think that when they are abandoned in their premises, they have hit gold with plus ones together. But after some time there are some enemy activity, and it is very strange. Not hostile, but seamless. It seems there is a German squad there, in equally bad conditions, that does not want anything more than surrender. <br /> <br /> Comment: Based on the novel and my guess is that the novel is much better but the story does not seem to translate very well into big screens. In fact it is a different war film, much more about fighting and stress than during war. But I can remember that those scenes must be associated with obscurity and unknown elements, just flat in the film. It's not dubious, just different and fools in many ways. Many times people just work insane, and the reasons are unclear or indicated at best. <br /> <br /> So when this emotional pressure fails to come, the main building piece of the whole story, I thought the story was read through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me on the edge and it did not really send a message. Actually it did nothing. <br /> <br /> Cast is interesting, many young actors, who turned up at the beginning of his career. Good acting, but stellar, and a few letters also fell through the irrational regions. Most of this I think due to this story, the characters need to have time, space and speed in the novel, which can not be given here. And the halfway course is certainly not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
