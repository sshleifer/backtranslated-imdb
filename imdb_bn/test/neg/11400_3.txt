Liteheaded and ridiculous books as a fan of Gifert's (in which Ik oak van jou is not the best), I was waiting to see this movie. Although I did not put it in the movie, and after watching this on TV I was very happy I bought it in the video. Outside of a good book, they managed to manage one of the worst movies in Dutch film history. All good parts have been omitted, stories change, not its advantage. All ridiculous has been cut. What's left is bad, acting, dramatic, inconsistent films that I never want to see. <br /> <br /> I am conveying Jimfer with this result and happy that Robert John Westdijk has made a hell out of sorry for the good work of Jeffert's top Philippine Jigget. Go see that one!
