I guess if you like boarding ice you might get some fun from seeing some nice scenery and some nice tricks. But there are all the films that offer. The story line was not existent, and no joker in the movie was fun, even at the level of sympathy. I do not like the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) has tried his best, and for such a comedy, which would not be too much, but when many other bad actors surrounded him, he did not expect this film to be good. But I should not be too tough on them, because I know they can have their skills, but in ten minutes I ran all the skills with a script written and hid in fear of being present in this movie. . My advice is not to watch it, I do not want to!
