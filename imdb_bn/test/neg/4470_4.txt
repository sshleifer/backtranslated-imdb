Come on, we keep away a kind of humorous humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not funny. I was afraid of the anxiety that the two main stars agreed to agree with a film that was so obnoxious and harmful for ethnic relations, and I am not referring to clear black / white commentary in the film, but in slam other ethnicities, such as the characterization of White White's character . Do we want to congratulate this movie as a parody of this movie ... is it to distinguish the very young comedy from the stereoical trash? Or the author's fault? How the third assistant makeup person ??? No, we blame us for this kind of barbarity (comedy's consciousness), since we do not have enough qualifications until our Hollywood continues to eat ... For us racism is real and this is not a ridiculous thing. We all are different, let us celebrate that diversity, do not make fun of it and encourage divisions.
