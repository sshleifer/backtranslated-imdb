Any song that can play (2 out of 5 Stars) is completely "Spaghetti Western" who played "Kaki" in "77 Senseet Strip". Some stolen gold coins and suspicious motivations are some deceitful about trying to try to track it in different gunmen. This is one of the "light hearted" Westerners ... which means many attempts at "comedy" and in some of the most verb verbs, some really shocking music (you can not say it an anonymity of michron). George Hilton plays a monster hunter named "Stranger" ... but he did not impress a lot ... does not have the style of his Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who can do a lot of sparsely written characters. Completion of the finale of "The Good, the Bad and the Firefly" / Parody ... although it is difficult enough to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes ... which is Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cliff and someone else (that seems like Eli Wallach?) Franco Nero? It is not very clear ...) by stranger. This is a ridiculous joke for fans of Sergio Leon and fans of Spaghetti Western Afdodona ... but I imagine that no one else can see it.
