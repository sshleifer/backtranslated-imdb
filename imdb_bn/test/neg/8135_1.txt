I went to Sona Heart, thinking I was going to see a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-respected tribute witness of the arrogance of old adult baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgot their roots. The aging growth baby boom is rated by critics, managed and performed by more well-known baby boom artists, starting from the heart of gold to a Buddhist festival, if you can manage to sit throughout the entire 2-hour movie. Neil Young and the crew have lost their edge for a long time, and the rest of us want to join the middle of the Road Medici's cushioned rocking chair. Prior to that, what happened to the unauthorized guitar of solo efforts? I guess all of his buzzs were damaged and his overwhelmed vacuum tube was exploded in his generation's hot air. As far as Demem goes, the tomb is wild and daring director of Melvin and Howard? A student filmmaker could create more bold movies than this poorly watched patronage movie. Do not waste your $$ heart on gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Jimmy Shelter. And if you really want to dig deep into the rock and roll icon's personality, make a copy of the Chocolate Berry Scrooge: Hail tilt rock and roll which is highly printed out. And baby boomers, do not bother squawking about how this review is jaded by someone else. I'm also one of the kids who listened to Acid's Simmons Girl and danced on the streets of Stones Street Fighting Man. Do not go back and look backwards or gimmie shelter and then come back and tell me that gold heart has no value as a document.
