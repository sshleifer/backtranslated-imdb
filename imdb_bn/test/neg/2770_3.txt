My question is, what was the worst element in this movie? Was it acting? Directing? Script ?. Perhaps it was the waste of Allan Ladd and Jack Lauve. LaRue and, in particular, Ladd is able to bring extreme sinisterness to a role. In this movie, it was difficult to tell the bad guy. Please, Lade is playing a secret guy well, but also in the role of his good man, he can be very cool. So, the net result was a potentially good movie, the feeling of contradiction.
