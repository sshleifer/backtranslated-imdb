It will be my first review of IMDB and I am happy that standard rating is one of the 10 reasons why I do not have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> There are the first terrible movies. Movies can make you laugh, like Island City, Batterfield Earth or Canaan The Destroyer. That is totally acceptable. They make a great party enhancer. Then there's the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That's the way Everything in box art was very promising. Then when I returned home, I got loaded on the first tape and noticed the first thing ... what? There is a 10 minute (or more) time of switching between current clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, which destroys your words. And it just continues over and over. Then some "acting" takes place and you are surprised why you are always born into a world where this hate of mankind really exists ... and then I realized that there are actually two projections. I did not think first about it, but the title "3" says it ... and I was scared. But I saw really great pain and pain, and I thought that I could not think of anything worse about this universe ... but then I said to write a little ... "Next ..." and ... Namesis 4?!?!? Please do not !!!!!!!!
