It is an irreemably stupid, annoying, unimaginative, lazy piece of garbage together. Directly watching the video slash decision, the film is not expected to expect trash at some level, but it goes beyond the trash. This is very terrible at every stage, a cliche slide script which is incredibly stupid and unbelievably simultaneously annoying, there is no name on the actors and I sometimes get the worst effect seen. Even slash fans of the movie will not find anything that will make the film more suitable for more than 150 years. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot focuses on the youth of your normal group who recently spent a weekend in a remote farm in the West Virginia region that a member of the group has inherited recently. Unfortunately for the teenager, the heir land was once owned by the peasant, who sacrificed his crop or for some stupid, and now he is going to kill everyone. I do not know anything about author Paul Paul, but I think he is more than ten years old, and so he should be able to get some more original than the killer fear. Really tell me. <br /> <br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ They often look like a little less than the Halloween costume on the sticks. Special effects such as these were considered poor rather than twenty years ago, but according to today's standards, they are not shameful. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time for all audiences, whether they're awesome movies. If you see a slasher movie, rent it on any of the "Friday 13th" or "Halloween" movies. Most of them are not very good, but of course it's impressive.
