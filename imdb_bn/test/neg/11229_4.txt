If you decide to laugh at a real bad film (worse than just Ras Russell's bad aspect), then you must try it out. It is successful to feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth, and you can just smell the urine on the floor. Catherine Turner wanders around a blonde wie, her kick gets two-bit hooker from "blame" (she really works well in the clothing industry and is hurt by humans so badly that she can connect), and Tony Parks is a violent Can act as "Pastor" who may be going to be a murderer (yet another film that ends with dragging with Perkins ). Annie Pots looks and is enough to hate this movie which is not allowed to provide an ounce of its normal intelligence. Love the weird sex scenes, so rent the Eurated version in the red box so you can see that Turner gives a copy to his copies of the club club (I had to stop the VCR until I stopped laughing).
