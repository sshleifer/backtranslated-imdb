This looks perfectly like "amateur" hours. It is beyond me how this piece of trash has been released: Acting, story, character, inferred special effects etc. It is all wrong. Why Lance Henriksen admitted that it would be a great mystery of movies. Maybe he was in dire need of money or maybe under the influence of some illegal drug. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, this stinker smells like a straight-to-release video. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs! 0 * 10 * out *
