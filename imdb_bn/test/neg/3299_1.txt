I saw the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was desirable to replace the "arrested development", boy, I was frustrated. It should be clear to everyone that this show was spreading "grounded for life", "Titus" and "married ... with children" because they were similar to plot and overall mood. The so-called "punch lines" are all repetitive and formulated, even more so, those "punch lines" are not even funny to me, they are even more along the lines of cross and crude. The main character Dave Gold works like a white trash thug, who thinks he is fun and cool, which he is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) told this episode "Gaza Strip". <br /> <br /> On this episode "Dream Crucifix", Hillary wanted to be a singer (but actually quite bad), Dave and Vicky are happy then she She decided to crush her dream by telling her sucked. Then, she wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Wiki and leaving the room. When both of them were laughing, they also told about the first episode of Dave Hillary's "black" boyfriend, "Does he really think that we let him go out with this guy? I will drink my own urine" The line drowning in the line is television history, and Dave continues to make a fun of breaking the fourth wall around Larry (his son) because he thinks he is gay and c He also did not forget that he had fun with Larry (fat) girlfriend Dave, no matter what he wanted to stand for his son. "The War at Home" is the worst TV show for the family without any doubt. Why the exhibition should be rejected as it expands racism and homophobic agenda. The program wants to be so entertaining that always keep track of that silly smile when someone says something, but the lines are somewhat compulsory, stupid, and young children. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the show is awesome? Acting, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan terrible, terrible actors. While in front of the camp, Rapaport would almost always have to move his hand, he did not do this, but he did it with his "Boston Public". Whenever Sullivan works, he speaks and acts like a kind of robot (he also has "Malcolm in Middle"). <br /> <br /> To upload this whole thing, all of your reasons are wrong with this event. 1. It's unreasonable 2. Acting sucks 3. It's not even funny 4. All jokes are the same 5. Lipy script laugh 6. Characters are unfortunate and unlikely 7. A father of father Archie A rip off bunker <br /> <br / > Fox tries to shut the trash Because something better.
