Like the beautification of the jungle, Jessica Alla shows a great smile and warmth on the film, but they are only worth two things to watch these two films. When in theory we should look for descriptions. <br /> <br /> Plot is slim, and hard to believe. Jessica is beautiful like Ela, she does not add a spark that she inspires in the credible 'Dark Angel' series. From the Dark Angel it turns out that the album has turned into eye-sight only (but eye-fat!), And the only reason for putting it in movies. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​sleeping dictionary is to take 109 minutes of run time with this world with great and impossible, small character development (or character). Despite the small running time of the film, it is able to think long and very fun. <br /> <br /> It seems shameful that Brenda Blathin, Emily Martemar, Bob Hoskinson, has just lost a pulse in a threadbare story. This film is a technique, an exterior setting, a lot of beautiful craftsmanship, and the importance of the theme and the use of 'civilization' dual concepts. But there is no short story to speak, no drama, no love is seen in the love story, the story of Kamarar and happy to please the woman without question. If you allow Jessica Alba to sleep with her, you will be honest, do you seriously think that you can concentrate on learning tribal languages? There are big problems, both suspicion suspension, and what are the limits and decrease of female characters. Take Jessica Ela's character for example, for the emotional and physical suffering of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, even though what we see is to show her one minute beautiful and curve, then lovely and curvy, next to a baby. <<br /> <br /> It is a sad matter to see that a committed movie is not living around anything near its potential. I can write the film flawlessly, but it hurts me. The film looks good, the evidence can be made in a lovely movie, but sadly it can not be.
