I can appreciate the mockery that goes against my opinion but it must be discreet and well established. This picture ... I can probably explain how. It's subtlety, very little intelligence is not the least effort. Actually, it's rarely horrible. Dead soldiers come to life but they are not interested in the brain, only in voting booths Why? "Bad president, bad defender, bad Republicans" start the uninterrupted flow of the most stupid, barbarous, leakage fungal fungus. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "point" of this episode, the liberals will simply say they enjoy watching it. Then again, determining a degree of intelligentness in the mad, angry, hostile, anti-social and somewhat semi-normal liberal spectrum itself is a long way to do. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a liberal conference.
