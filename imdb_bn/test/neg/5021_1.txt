"Inuyasha" was awful. This show was incredibly over-hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless, story lines are annoying and endless. I think it might be interesting if something is interesting, but it seems that the show is in the eyes of Ayesha and her stupid friends show the author has more purpose to fight with some monsters and then cry for his sad love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and The same thing is almost the same round again. The script is Chess and Fools and Animation is poor. The character's design is very ugly, I do not know why everyone loves it, everyone is the same face! : A line such as large eyes, nose, mouth and usually anem haircuts. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly annoying and stupid. This will be the most overrated animated show ever made.
