The biggest problem in this movie is that it is nothing like Bruce Almighty. The first movie is played daily in the premiere fantasy, which enables viewers to control regularly. Ivan's experience is quite different even though. Jim Carey is fooling around him and instead the stories are not in control by the neighborhoods of faith. It's good now, because the first picture was broadcasting the same message. The problem is that it is the cost of relief for Comic Relief. And to put an insult to injury, it also put politics into the plot. You've got a distinct feeling that you have a clear message with this movie and its main purpose is not to let you laugh. The composition of Eddie Murphy's "The Destestence Gentleman" and Charlton Hesson's "The Ten Commandments" failed to upload this movie. I'm not sure if Steve Carroll blames here, you've got a sense that it's his character that limits his power as a comedian, the former news anchor Ivan Bakster does not seem funny, he is basically a playwright, in this case only about this movie message What is supposed to be added to the confusion.
