I sincerely wonder why this image was made. A Bulgarian version of a Berlin-Italian co-production set, where all Germans speak English with German and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words is not believable. English vocabulary is basically "worse than fuck you, bastard" and acting worse than anyone can imagine. In addition, ethnic tensions can be an interesting topic in Germany, but in Germany I know that no gang shoots each other in the middle of the street in clear day light. And if not enough, a serial killer is also going to kill those who kill Turkish children and paint them white. To create some excitement, we see the serial killer and hear him in Schubert Lulbi but we will not see his face. <br /> <br /> I do not believe they actually shot in Germany. There are several street shots in Berlin, but actors are not seen in those shots. Perhaps there are some German signs here and there in Bulgaria.
