This is the worst movie I've ever seen and certainly the worst movie Nagesh Cooke has created. I can not believe that a man who created a movie like Tin Dewarin could create such a quiz. <br /> <br /> The film plots are really defective that the genetic has to be found compassionate to find Mira and help her husband escape the execution of Saudi Arabia. According to the common logic, genetics can not easily locate Mira, so the Saudi government will not be able to get it, so Jeans can safely create Mirror's signature or thumb print and create it in front of the Saudis. Another interesting thing is that Shankar has given wrong address to his passport, so Indian government officials can not get the address, but after some time Mirza got Sujdar's suitcase through the Soudi government. How nice! Is not Saudi better in India than Indians? <br /> <br /> Seeing Magha who plays a little more in photographing on Naga, and looking for Mira's father-in-law, Girish Karnad (this man has just been lost) to help him keep her. <br /> <br /> Nagia can not speak Hindi and she helped other boys to translate English conversations written in Hindi. At this time, it seems that his associate was in serious depression, when "Iman ke Chalong" (honesty imprint) wrote a dialogue. In a few minutes, for the worst nightmare of ours, Mira does not take this honest jump, she tries to "iman ka dance" on her legs. <br /> <br /> One of the only bright spot movies is its cinematography and really nice hues. But since Bollywood Post-Production has learned, almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely mixed backdrop, so there is no big deal. The conclusion is that Chess is not limited to Chopra making the movie or ready to impress Johor or Barjatya, Nagyas and everyone.
