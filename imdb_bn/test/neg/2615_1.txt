AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When the strike will stop? That's the start that I really sucked and said somewhere in that part of the movie. This picture has robbed almost all life from me and I have some really bad movies sitting through. I'm coming from the true puppy master fan, I want to talk to myself, but this is true. Plot insane, special effects horror, most benawl in the soundtrack, Satan Totling I've ever heard Oh! I almost forgot about acting, it is so bad that I forgot that it was, Naf said. The only freedom fighter in this film is the doll itself, and they can work just like Ralph (the doll) and although you can see their wires and strings, they carry me on a painful start. Retro-doll master finishes. While closing, PM7 is recomended for true fanatics who are happening to be the mochochists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
