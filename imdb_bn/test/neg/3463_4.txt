Leatherheads will be more suitable for self-flagellate after purchasing a ticket to visit this effort, but seeing a vigorous effort at a leather strap entertainment. As soon as Clooney's autobiography was threatened, he became calm, because his disagreement meant that he had something else. Perhaps other actors play the role of Clone, the film may be a little preferred. Sorry George, I suspect any Oscar nods at this time. George Clooney, of course, is a fish outside the water (unless you mention him in his politics). However, Clonie fans will enjoy seeing the most enthusiastic leatherheads, the rest will stay for the silent film for a long time.
