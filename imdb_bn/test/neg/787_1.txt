This is my first review of IMDb.com and probably the first written review of a movie that I have personally compiled - not for some classes. I think something about this movie is saying ... is not a good thing! I'm not a seasoned journalist or critic (although I've seen my fair share of movies), but I thought it was so difficult to see this particular movie, I had to avoid the experience of my own peace of mind. Where is it better than IMDB? As I forced myself to sit through the film, because of the inability to connect physically, I was sure that some "light" would be at the end of the tunnel - which would be explained in a magazine. Was going on The movie was over and I was enlightened as a dog **** I did not understand anything after reviewing several reviews after several reviews. I wanted to scream myself "Does anyone think this?" I advise not to waste your time, but if I used to be you again, I'd probably like to feel it myself. If this is the case, then bring a crossword puzzle or something so that you are not bored.
