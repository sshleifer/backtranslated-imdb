I was invited to see this picture on a small art museum screening. There was no source of what I expected. Initially, I was hopeful of opening credits for Jod Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Can, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flan-Boyle. But after some annoying ground-out scenes (which adds more to the story progression), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. The helpless arm's story of useless rose is never really improved. I patiently kept waiting for cash for this film. Eventually there was a small salary, but endlessly gross, weird, sexually distorted, screaming in your face, to invest and to spend too much expensive (even for free viewing) to spend. What was this established actor doing this horror film? The direction of the industry was very believable and awesome. In very short period, it should be only 75-minute film. This is a movie that will embrace Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.
