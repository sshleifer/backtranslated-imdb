VHS and DVD cover (at least in Europe) does not show a scene that has nothing to do with the real plot of the film, the act is so bad that the movie is crying for fun. If you do not have anything to do, you are with some good friends and you want to laugh about the movie, it is considered to be serious, see Tycos and Peter Anori, a person who teaches you how to hurt the bad boy. Empty carton box! Dennis Hooper's Shame follows the example of Travoltus by acting in his own "Battlefield Earth". For those who want to see a good movie to destroy the earth by terrible power, please do not choose the ticas, but give your opinion on your own and see "Armageddon" for the 20th time!
