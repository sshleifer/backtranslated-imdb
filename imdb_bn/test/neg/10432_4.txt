I saw it on a screener DVD a few months ago it was released. <br /> <br /> I like major characters and overall stories but many scenes are quite vicious and confusing. The set was fitting, but like some of the frequencies and jics left over, a cell phone reminds me of a commercial shot in the middle class home. Definitely the DVD cover does not claim that "Next Stunner can be Classic". <br /> <br /> Dresses and hairstyles have been well done and yes, some of them are beautiful girls, always look nice to look a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost all scenes have just droned and guitars that are there. Sound design was a bit poorer. I think I've been less well.
