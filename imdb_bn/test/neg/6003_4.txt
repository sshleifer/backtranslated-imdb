If I did not know any good, then I would think that the revival was sold in the late 80's / early 90's, when Hippie was sold as a film. <br /> <br /> Why do not I know why Christopher Lambert He talked about reading cue cards and whenever he was encouraged, he became a fountain. He was easily the weakest aspect of the movie. Other actors were right, nothing was horrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where the maximum budget was: Special effects. The killings look pretty, but the film's ruthlessness is not created quickly. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that resuscitation is a carbon copy of Se7en, but it certainly has a specific match with it. In the midst of a modern Crusade religious psychological murderer, investigating investigators of his work had to rely on the biblical paragraph and Christian history, in order to assemble the assassins' riddle. The resurrection, however, the story of Se7en's cute story, cinematography, acting ... well, makes everything good. Instead, the revival is false to the audience and using the mystery Scooby Doo system to surprise it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the resurrection was as bad as it was to me. I feel bad about criticizing this movie because I knew it was going to be bad, but ... the case against me.
