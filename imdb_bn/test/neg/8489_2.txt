I liked this movie, not good, but the worst ever made. Although everyone else says it's one of the worst movies ever made, I thought it was okay. There are a lot of incomparable jokes. Sometimes wants to be fun, but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is OK. While young viewers may find it hard to follow. <br /> <br /> The role is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horror actor most of the time. At some point, it's even ridiculous. Alan Kunming is perhaps the best actor here. He is funny when he is supposed to, but his line is terrible God. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was the story of Team Auer when he was captured by the mask. Voice hello Also, the scene that he has been so illusory is that it is almost helpless. I'm sure they can cut it, and it will not affect the movie in any way. <br /> <br /> Overall, you can live without seeing it. It's a nice movie to watch, though there is nothing to see from you. They can definitely go without making a sequel, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
