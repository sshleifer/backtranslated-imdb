Depending on the Stephen King novel, the necessary things give you the plot and intensity to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man (Max Van Sido) arrives in town and soon becomes most talked about citizens. Is it Satan installed a shop as an ancient businessman in a small town in Meine? This role that dominated the Von Sydow screen is masterful and dynamic. Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedellia are also acting. Harris stays and Bedeelia deserves your attention. Also support jetty Walsh and amanda plummer. Not the best, nor the King's worst worst adaptation on the screen.
