Definition of Jeff Spakman, Dulle Definition !!! <br /> <br /> Blue, character, neutral situation, dull aspect, dull actor, dull cinematography, dust music <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? If the speaker wants to stay in serious movies, then the experience acting and writing levels are below your average TV drama. And there are some common "Speakerman Pamiling Bad Guys" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the movie depends on a credible play, which is completely wrong for the speaker or very poorly indicated that it does not work with it only. In the end, this confusing film shows and feels very nondescript and bland. The worst side of the experience is music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith vanabe, his pompas and melodymatic scores, which are not just about this type of lazy film. It seems that the producers knew that they had very dusty goods and they asked the composer to feel more compelling and dramatic with his score, which shows the whole movie more confused, stupid and lazy. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time to see if you're a Jeff Spakman fan.
