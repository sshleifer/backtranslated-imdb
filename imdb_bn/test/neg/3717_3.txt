The film has an insurmountable amount of dialogue about strange boring characters, curious unexplainable slapstick, and smoking. The film is a vicious plot of inquiry for the love of a wicked, empty head woman (Jane Triplehorn). Although who would like to read Jane's character, personality, or dialogue, I can not really say. She likes to smoke without him. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker performs an attractive character (who likes smoking). Dylan McDermott is superb and the soul (as he smokes) makes his best work. And, hey, what are you doing Jennifer Aniston? Oh, she's not really enough to care for her. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> This is the waste of some time I do not know how I could sit as much as I was sitting in the movie. I can not believe I spent the time writing this, except to warn others. Anyone need a cigarette?
