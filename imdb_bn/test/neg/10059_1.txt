I have never used so many talents and money to produce such a bad thing in my life! As it has been said in other commentary, Christopher Plummer, Festoon Duneway, Donald Swiechland and many others, who had thrown together in a film that is not recognized as the story of Augustis Christie. I'm thinking about how it can be with the same cast, I've done the right thing. <br /> <br /> The film has fewer intimacy than Christopher Reeves 'Superman' films. Large cast makes the shiny production even less effective than these films because there is not enough time for anyone to know. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack was broken if the wrong video was in the case from the store. The music became more and more aggressive as the plot progressed. It was more aggressive to tell the soundtracks of repetitive information than the previous scenes, or it was difficult to tell the annoying technique. Anyone who saw most Christie's movies (which attracted me, it was something I did not see) would miss it. This is not an Agatha Christy movie. Golan-Glabas The English mystery snug is more suitable for flickr making wrestling rather than the atmosphere.
