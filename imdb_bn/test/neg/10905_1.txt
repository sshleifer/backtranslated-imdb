I often do not write reviews here, but at least I can not stand still without trying to warn them and do not allow other people to enjoy through this film. This movie is awesome and not because "I do not know how the director is trying to express" or "I'm too stupid to realize this plot"; This movie is horrific due to poor aspects, screen writing and acting. This is a "trifecta" to create bad traffic and that is why the video comes directly to the video. It tries to do something like "high tension", "hostel" and "TCSM" but it does not work. I'm not going into high expectations or medium ones film but were still very disappointed. It can be very good with a nice setting and a good idea for a movie, but it was lost.
