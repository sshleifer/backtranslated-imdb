We're seeing this horrible movie as we say. This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever broadcasted in my house. I am sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. It's not awesome. It's not funny. Not dramatic It's nothing to appeal anything. We have 49 minutes in the movie We've only seen 2 critters. Only one person died. This movie is a big letdown. Nothing about this terrible, terrible movie wants me to see the rest. I'm hanging over a movie. I hope that anyone who does anything with this film can be killed. I just do not mean actors. I mean directors, producers, studios to fund this movie from the president. It's the perfect, worst movie ever. It will create 100 bad films at all times in IMDB. At number 1
