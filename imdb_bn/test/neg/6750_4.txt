It was probably a low budget film. It shows each scene. What is nice to see where it is made Many photos were shot in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Sanora, CAA, Colombia, CA. Some pictures were shot in nearby JÃ¤mstadt, CA, near Colombo. Jamestown has a railway museum and they used some of the old trains in the photo. "Hi Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, as was "Future to Back".
