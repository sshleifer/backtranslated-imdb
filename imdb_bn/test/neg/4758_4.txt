This sweetheart romantic comedy is based on the story I liked as a teenager, but now it's rather unexpected to find out. In connection with the May-September attachments, there is no doubt about the main party's mind, both of which are the desires of either passion or old age or both. And the smallest probably looks for parents that he (or he) is as poor as the child. This intrinsic agenda now seems more sad than romantic to me; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the age of fifty, he played the role of trying to romanticize a young man. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a fingerty - as a matter of study, as a dishonest caution presented as "gifts" to honest and honest, honest and honest photographer - fancy and sticky and venegar filling. Its encouraging performance wrung from a better rating than otherwise this film deserves me. Ann Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful but frustrated drunk, and his small role suddenly took over. <br /> <br /> Some conversations were quite fun, so it was not total smoke. <br /> <br /> 5/10
