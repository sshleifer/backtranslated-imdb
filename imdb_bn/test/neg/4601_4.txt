There are some good lines in this movie, but Dylan wants to see me as real as seeing Rouce in a disguise. I like Marisa Tomie but she is not dicey. <br /> <br /> Also, in my opinion, the number movie rules are the character of any character to take care of yourself. You may not love the character, but you have to take care of her. It was achieved with a delightful running gag about fights with Eddie Bertender. When the main battle of fact-room is completely overwhelming, Lily Taylor leaned towards the character in the bar, dropped him into form and called her as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> The whole thing did not work. . Again, some great lines - some smile-out-loud fun - but as a film overall it's a failure. Mediocre attempts to reconsider anything that is bright, and you can not get past. Next? Let's start breakfast with Kate Hodson in Tiffany.
