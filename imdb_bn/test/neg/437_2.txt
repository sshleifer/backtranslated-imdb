AWiP tries to be funny, terrible, mythical, and romantic ... and every respect fails. Acting is the best of the best, but mostly fools. Special effects are not enough for stupid plot instruments, and * no * chemistry between characters. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be crazy yourself, do not pay money to see it.
