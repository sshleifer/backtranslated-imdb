As bad as this movie, I really like it. Poor acting, dialogue and action it is so funny I loved John Travis from the Omega Kop, and if they could not speak, then spent the night watching how the Death machines checked in the airport, probably had to jump to security questions. Actually why they can not speak? It fails to comply with a movie-making convention that makes it weird to watch - many people die around a very different plot around the tenant murderers - such as "machines" and the strange faces / mountains that are not in front cover and trailers will not be displayed. ! I do not love a good person up to half way in this movie and I love the many pointing scenes of the landing of the plane - many people die who have nothing to do with "plots" and no explanation about anything - do not expect this film to understand. Instead of praising how the main good guy can not handle an old man in the bar - who is being presented as a bad guy, though he is speaking against Berman's decision to hire barbaric women to dance badly for "entertaining". - All the best guys seem to enjoy this! Why old man could kill our hero - and why the random block decides to help the old man in war? Why did the hero fall into a pond under the old veranda verandah, where the flow of water goes to the background, as if it seems to be coming from the mouth? Definite Top 20 B-Movie, a part 2 must be checked for.
