The film came out in 1996, director Mark Lester has been making strict, sharp little-action photos for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the great "truck stop woman" from many other small gems since the '70s; Unfortunately, he is responsible for this ugly. Embarrassing to see talent - and still smoking hot - Theresa Russell has been lost again, but she is still the best actor in this film. Eric Roberts shows for a while, his Erie Roberts thing goes away, it is not entirely unreasonable in an image with Eric Roberts. Frank Stallone is not really bad, which will give you an idea of ​​how genuinely this image feels to you. As mentioned by other critics, action scenes - due to which an image like this is made in the first place - almost completely unreasonable and unrealistic, besides being somewhat inactive, Except for some "vintage" clothes and some old cars, it does not seem that in the 1930s, this film has been set in this era. A number-number script by boring laptops in logic and miniature historical accuracy - of course it is not a documentary, but the filmmakers have at least TRIED for at least recognition and grade-B grade school for performance this cheap little quickie release Sunday slots on HBO 4:00 At, which is exactly where I saw it.
