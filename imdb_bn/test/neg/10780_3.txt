If you are at home on weekends, you are very annoyed and lacking will, you have nothing to do with your life for the next few hours, you can enjoy enjoying this movie. Acting in this movie and creating script and general movies is not really bad, so it really can sit through it. This is a movie shown in high school health class to teach the risks of ex-marital sex. Or they could show the dangers of luncheon music to show it - that 'rock' band Brian Austin Green is really terrible, I think a lot more threats for society than unwanted parents.
