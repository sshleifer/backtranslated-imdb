I do not understand how this garbage was found on the rooftops of the movie store, this is not a real movie! It was incredible, I decided to see a group this night and friends and it was stupid thing that nobody ever saw of me, I could not believe it! We saw in the first 15 minutes of the horrific fear that someone actually thought and then turned it into a movie. Are they on the crack? My guess is yes, huge amounts. I highly doubt anyone could like this trash. Is this supposed to be a scientist or a comedy? I do not do stupid things that are taking care of this, they just have not decided to make a film and see how many drivers can use it to see. Well, we have put something in the film so let's bring it to the movie store and see if they actually put it in the cell - no, no, no. It is not made in the movie. Like watching the wooden dolls moving around and reading to read from a book, it's how bad that is. I think going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back, no one can endure this pain. So I'm here to warn you - do not rent this movie, it's the biggest thing you have never seen!
