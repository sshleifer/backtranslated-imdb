How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such stupid movies? Nimrod's answer to the answer is: Armed. Six colleagues in an Armed car business decided to steal a big shipment of cash themselves. However, as they get the first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With such a plot, you think it can not be very bad, for at least one action movie. However, for the first 40 minutes or more of this film we can see 6 normal, everyday types of sacrifice. They joke, laugh, gather some drinks. Etc., we suddenly learn that they are planning to loot their own business. Due to Ty, (Columbus short), cold, cruel world, it is a well-equipped veteran, beautiful man, and reliable employee, although sucked into the scheme. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular boys convert almost all money-crazy psychos, willing to cash each other's cash. In the last scene, Mike, (Matt Dillon), carried out suicide attacks for something other than killing his former friend. There is no indication that these men are these ruthless and bloodshed before the end of the audience. It is quite incredible and there are many kinds of "B movies" for this type of sugar conspiracy. I do not waste your time - very bad someone made the same suggestion before Laurence Fishburne, Gene Reno or Fred Ward making this picture.
