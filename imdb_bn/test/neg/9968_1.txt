The only subject of interest in this movie is its subject. From family point of view, Monson is a big idea to look at "family". However, trying to create a feeling of absence is something that can really be done only on a MasterWork - and it is not. <br /> <br /> There was probably too much information on swimming in a scrapple, this image was completed in a wrong documentary style, it was re-inserted into inactivity. The problem is that writing and instruction makes it impossible to establish things that are worthy of viewing movies, such as characters, stories, themes, etc. Worse than that, there is an incredibly poor sub-plot that later follows a little band of monsoonets, since they go after a journalist who is working in a story about the anniversary of the killings. It is silent and vain, and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> All this, this movie is a big waste opportunity. A Sunshine star, starring Marc Pittman, who played in Texas, who actually killed most of the real life. In the 60's flashbacks, female characters are closed as Giggli Airheads, Pitman moves to express real feelings. <br /> <br /> In short, do not get bored with this movie.
