Garden State must be rated among the most convergent and captivating films of all time. The plot is a simple one, in which a young man is involved in the return to home after the death of his mother and the discovery of love. But really, the plot is not important. What's important to Jack Buffet - writer, director, and star ?? He allows a 'indie' or 'arty' film to hang from the plot of all the necessary accoutrements. We present incomparable, clever and playful characters and scenes that are not available due to the development of plots or characters, but only to give some artistic credibility to the film (Aa la Wess Anderson - or so the hope of the brand). Unfortunately, with a little bit of surprise, many are not fooling the staff in IMDB, but some critics who really know better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the strange use of the staff is not just the Garden State. Bad film. What really makes the Garden State a stinker makes the script of the script. To carry this film, she does not have the skills to write only, and conversations and character traits are uncomfortable. The brush devises the blunt to achieve what can often be achieved through writing and will adopt symbolism. For example, the atrocity of the character of the character has been shown to us by the indifference of the upcoming aircraft crash (it can not be done in the plot and it will be in the dream!), After he showed war back against his circumstances by screaming in a sizable volcanic era (life = a slangy lazy , Very clever Mr. Braff). The two scenes that are most definitely to be seen in the most ferrous and film screen. <br /> <br /> Plus as well as playing the cast, despite the lack of working elements with Cast. A script means), and I appreciate Natalie Portman for her efforts as an interest in love - a character is so badly written and impossible that she is a little more than a silent doll in her fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> The blog took three years to clearly write the script for the Garden State (3 years to write this script - it's really inactive!). Hopefully, it will be some time before he can make another movie.
