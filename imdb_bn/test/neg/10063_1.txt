Producer Golan and globus openly be ashamed to release this piece. I know it will be a neat noise, but compared to that, the first "Hercules" in 1983 seems like a mature and thrilling epic! This "series" is morally, cheap, incredible, child, stupid, unknowingly and badly ACTED A landmark in bad movies, and some of the few movies I have seen are not eligible for the lowest possible rating: There is no star!
