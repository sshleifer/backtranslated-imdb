The last sentence of this review is a major spoiler. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Joe Dante from Piranha. He made a big deal of funny parodies that was both fun and honest. <br /> <br /> But it is pure shit. Such ridicule - thank you for the smokers - it's so literally and directly that it does not leave anything) to be frustrated and b) to leave the audience to think. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, because the plot and ingredient is so rich, intelligent, and intelligent for comments. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to shoot Anne Coolter's character for the main character. The end of the film It's ridiculous just flat out.
