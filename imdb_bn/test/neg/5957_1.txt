Spokilar <br /> <br /> This movie was hired as a joke, and it was a joke. The image is based on a dog catcher, who is looking for El Chupacabra. Dog catchers props are so ridiculous. It looks like he has perfected his hat and for some reason he showed his muscles inside. Throughout the movie, mostly on the night, you can see how the light was bad. They are a car which is shining brightly and they are driving in pitch black. Often you can see the camera shadow of the camera on the ground. Clothing is terrible, terrible in light, and acting is terrible. This could be a good movie for a laugh ....
