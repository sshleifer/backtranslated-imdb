FlashDance is one of those terrible, stupid movies that you really enjoy, because they are so painful. I just looked at the TV and my friend and saw how Dopi was. It is true that Don Simpson and other producers have come up with a lot of cheap, downward flick concepts (great quality) to help sell soundtracks of pop, so Flashadens is a pioneer pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lynn started advertising and it shows because Flashadence is a commercial for itself. You've already decided to watch it, but the film is a weird, scary, though it is afraid that you can change your mind at any moment. It always sells itself to you by using commercial-style editing and shiny close-ups of jogging nipples. The story is made of the slim (I really do not think of any other film that I see with the plot) and it does not give much knowledge, but it is a very narrow, calculative movie, so it is consistent Thinks People say it's dated but flashadence was always garbage. At the beginning of the 80's, the visitors knew that it was only Chess T & A, but it worked on its stupid fashion. There are sappy romance for puppy crowd and oily stack, writhing female bodies for their dates, all set to beat a pumping disco. How could it fail? It helps to make the conversation in vain, so that you can grab a popcorn in the absence of a chief, and if such things are not your cup of tea, you can always laugh to show 'interpretive dance'. The scene where Jennifer Bels had stitched us in a step-by-step / 'dance' and white shoes make-up in front of a TV in front of a TV for a Stan-in. A genuine guilty pleasure.
