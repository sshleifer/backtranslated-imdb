I do not usually write reviews, but I had to make this photo. I am surprised to see the acting talent in this step ... this script was scary ... the edit is awful ... and the plot is very thin. You are thinking of the first half of the movie, who are talking about who and what they are doing in the world. The next half of the movie has been reduced, but it does not have depth or feeling. Only mercy grace is beautiful, but still limited to CGI, and location being London. I gave 3 stars for him, and the real actors still tried to do good with their drill. If you lose within a few hours of your life, including the medieval populated disaster film entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. But instead I would suggest to do something else with your time, like viewing the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
