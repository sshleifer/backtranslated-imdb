As far as I've seen, in the thousands of movies, this first made me think about the "spoiled talent" expression. I've never seen so many good actors giving such a terrific performance (Frederick Pierreot, Elsa Gilbertine, and so on). The "old age" make-up is quite awful and, to make it even worse, is widely shone. Use of music (eg love for young helpers camp at first sight) Sometimes there are so many miracles that I can feel the greatest viewer around me. So far, Antonio de Queens has been a great actor, but this one and "Les Morser de L'Oub" seem to be thinking about leaving him. Please Antoine, to leave that "balantree master" project; I suspect you deserve it.
