If you like three stugs, you undoubtedly prefer this 17 minute short. Of course there were some fun moments, but like all the works of Stugas, it revolves around their special artistic imagery style, and I must admit that Stooges never really did it for me. Their graduation always takes anger rather than fun, and although it was obviously fake, it seemed more likely to hit rather than creating their antics smile. In short, he wanders around finding a slopstick Shape (who is a music professor in this subject) because he has inherited half a million dollars on condition that he will be in 48 hours. One of his students is interested, but once the word of succession comes out, suddenly the longest line of possible wives is up, and a good fight between them begins. Fans of Stooges will enjoy. For me, it has all the ingredients that drive all the nuts about them. 4/10
