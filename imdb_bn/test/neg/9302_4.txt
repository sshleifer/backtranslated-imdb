According to the title, there is a running philosopher, metronetic thread through this film: If a person has a genius and wants to find his way to society and money, but if it is denied because there is no X factor, what can be the result? This question has been disagreed with the adaptation of Patricia High School's book and kept me colder than the way. <br /> <br /> Repeat the title of Matt Damon and separating his path to the funding of the Jordanian fund, his commission target is under the spell of Dickie Greenliffe (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity are a violent conflagration which spreads to all and complexes themselves for the rest of the movie. Pantro is great as law, dameon and dick girlfriend. I like the Camio-Is Freddy match with Phillip Camu Hoffman, a friend of Bluff society, who can never be replayed. The problem is that the story is laminated without any pressure - or for liberation, the thing - which makes it difficult to melt. 4/10
