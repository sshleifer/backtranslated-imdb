Should I expect something other than a nut from the cow? This was the worst movie I ever seen. It is by the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Board Chairman" has not added humor to my attitude, but rather it ignited me. Okay, the cow's top is such a bad comedy that I got mad because I made this guy a movie.
