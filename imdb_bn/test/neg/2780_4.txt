Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made up of a bunch of random amusements that is closed as a semi-professional movie. Unfortunately poor effects, woodworking and a pair of stories makes this very very middle-heavy slasher. In any way, Dark Harvest is my worst horror movie which is never seen, it is not something special and it does not have any part of it for any second watch or the hope of a squeal. You know a director is suspicious of their own horror film, when a) some vague nudity and b) movies are so small that they add some annoying outtakes to the last credit, that does not really matter because this movie was not good! A little better movie than I can not imagine, Dark Harvest's inspiration was the eight-part movie 'SquareCro' which is an open movie but still quite a bit. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some other opinions are saying it does not seem to be entertaining you too much. I would like to make a comment about this, Angela's character is really awful English pronunciation! What was that point ?! Maybe it's the specific touch of the class? Yes right The English are not saying "Wahhatah" when they want to say "water" and I do not care about any part of England! If you can not find a real English actress or a non-English actress who can have a bright English actress (many of them), but take the other! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
