The life of Megan (Jackie Crisler) and Dylan (Shane Eliot) has changed between Reno and Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. They stop eating at a tasty spoon where they unwittingly learn about the infamous area 51 by the owner of the caf√© (Jonathan Brake). After the 40-year-old Lincoln returned to the street, the radio became a little crazy in Hitler's 1836 Summer Olympics speech, and in 1958 a military bulletin of Elvis Presley was created. The car breaks down slowly and both are afraid of their life because in the monstrous radiation-poisonous desert the mysterious disappearances happen; Nuclear test residue. Megan met a lost little girl (Channing Nicholas) and an injured WWII soldier. Night travel does not end there. A degree of Kresler and author / director James Lay makes use of the impressive Patties clay tunes good use. All in all, medium-sized sci-fi.
