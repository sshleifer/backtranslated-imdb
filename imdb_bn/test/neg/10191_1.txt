I just went to stop this photo and checked IMDB for more information: Score 6,7, good ... not too bad. Genre: scifi ... well I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was watching the flick watching it on Sunday evening. But but ... no. <br /> <br /> As a summary, it's not a movie. It is a religious advertisement, which includes: Jesus, God, Satan, the end of the world, etc. Surprised. The film begins with epic abduction story: night driving, car stop, bright light and so on ... well, it was actually the film. In the end .. mama ... in fact I do not want to say it ... there was a conversation about the end of the world and the last verdict. These TV-promoters say the same thing to you, but these are "good". <br /> <br /> If you do not want to watch anything with Sissy Films or UFO, please stay away from this "thing". It has something to do with them. If you want to hear some Kaku head's opinions then what will the Bible say and what to do. Then go ahead and see this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> it's full bull (And evangelical Christian campaign, as other users said = OK ... I have to give other users opinions before getting the film. <br /> (27% voters rated this "item" as 10. Yes , Okay, please run your campaign elsewhere)
