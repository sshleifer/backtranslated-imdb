Shaw Sayen (Pam Greyer) told her telegraph that her father might have problems. Sheba, a private investigator and former police, went to help her father. But no one will stop his father to run outside the business. The attempt to show their muscles has become very bad and the father of the father was shot dead in cold blood. These boys hate the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I can describe Sheba Babi, then I would love to have the best performance with Pam Greyer Lite. For a Pam Greyer film, Sheba Baby is incredibly embarrassing. It is not as close to fierce as it is in previous movies. The palm images are illustrated by putting a small revolver or razor blade in his Afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can not catch some of Pam's original villain candles in front of his previous movie. This is strictly made for two-digit and almost made TV. As bad acting, the bads that confront the palm that I saw as irrelevant words of their delivery. As a result, characters like a pilot do not come as a threat because they need to work for the film or their needs. <br /> <br /> It does not mean there is no moment or element in the baby's baby. Not enjoying (palm branding for a drinks and a spear gun in a wetswitch), it is only when compared to other Palm films, coffee, Foxie Brown and even Friday Faster fails the picture. One final observation - maybe I'm more sensitive to these issues after 9/11, but I do not think aircraft guns can take a full suitcase, even in 70 seconds there is no time for insecurity. When Sheba leaned towards her father's help, she packs a surgery in her luggage!
