Starting with a tearjerking poem and image of an American missile, hungry children and perverted palestinians, I quickly realized that it is not going to be a motivational documentary. After the GÃ¶tchenburg riots, five young men were interviewed and they gave a very confusing explanation as to why they had to degrade the city center and then (my god) paid for what they did. I am observers and many questions have been raised, the trial was done properly and what the police did they did? Many questions asked ... and then dropped. There is no interview with the judge for interviewing or judging with judges. There is nothing. <br /> <br /> Briefly: Not every new thing is seen in Swedish on television - just a poor campaign.
