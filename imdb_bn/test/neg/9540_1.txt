Manos moved on. Boogens behind Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of the teams) is still there and always will be there (if anyone does not make a signature to Zarco's Invaders) it will never tell the worst movie. This thing is the only horror watching it. I wonder if I was an attempt for someone to see babes by throwing a movie. If in this case, babes are not just like innocent of a movie. It's Drake. Do not wait I dishonor the word dreck by calling it Drake. It will be called "uber dreck" or "Schei√üe" by Ulie Lomel (Boogie Man fame). It should be used for torture of detainees. If you find it on a shelf in a video store, feel free to go back and inform the authorities.
