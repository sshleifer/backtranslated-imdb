Recently I borrowed a copy of this movie from a movie, which took me three sessions in three days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what do I say? It included a game of memory, which requested the player / pair of pairs of animals to be added to the ship. However, each time the selected animal publishes it, the screen asks the player to find the player (or it congratulates the player) "it's companion." This is a spelling mistake, because it should be "mortgage" as a universal pronoun, it is "it." No shrinkage of it. It's an annoying error to keep repeating 16 or more times to finish a game. Of course, it's really a kid's activity, but to teach kids the wrong spellings. <br /> <br /> and, oh yes, do not change the game. It's the same game with the same creatures at the same time as the same game. Plus it does not solve the score, as it is the number of steps taken to solve the game. So it has no permanent value or challenge. This packaging list is just a feature. <br /> <br /> Simply tell, this "special" feature can be more thoughtful and cared about, such as muddled film that may have more thoughts and care.
