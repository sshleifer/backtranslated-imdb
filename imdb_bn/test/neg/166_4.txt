Diane Thomas is a weird, deliberately stupid musical that we hear more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to bear the exposure of a raw character seen through our wife (Siena Miller) and her proto-great relationship with childhood love (Keira Knightley). Thomas Rhys with adequate charm Thomas dramatically indocates us against his spontaneous interests and Cillian Murphy makes a firmly intense lovetet up. <br /> <br /> This image does not determine where to go. There is no pressure like a videotap from one end of the war to the other. Merry is interested in her two female leaders (who do not want!), Who unite her and then divide them. Miller's two choices (I got a good friend of Knightley, but then I could not find her sympathy) but they both offered a terribly inconsistent Welsh accent. Other interesting decisions William (Murphy) included too much for the irreplaceable characteristic of Archie production (for example Double Crossfaces), which is not any influential, symbolic and old sticky work that is not boiling footage. 4/10
