It was a very frustrating movie. I would definitely call this worst movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Acting and writing was poor. And the jokes were not funny. <br /> <br /> I do not see why it was broken into the earth. I'm not a crazy person and I can enjoy stupid things, but it's just too stupid and easily scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
