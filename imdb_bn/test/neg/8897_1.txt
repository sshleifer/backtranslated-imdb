My only reason for registering this site was the opportunity to write a comment on this movie. I felt that I had to delete some of my writing from me. <br /> <br /> The movie "Buzz Bella" I have seen for the worst movie. I really believe that the script seems to have been able to make a pretty good movie or at least, but something happened somewhere in the line. It makes it more curious that Caste seems quite right on paper. Both scripts practice and fail to provide cast. There are many tasks, many things will happen and you can not help to wonder why this could happen. And then Cast, the actors made a poor effort that you almost started crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time, I would say you can see it. If not - no
