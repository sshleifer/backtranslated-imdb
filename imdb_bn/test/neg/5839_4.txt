I'm not a slouch in the "retrieve social value" file. I do not know if I want to suppress any book or movie from Hotfin or Hit of Darkness from Haq Finn / Darkness, deep throat or last hostage title is not, I would not sincerely want them. I'm not as pornographic or violent-entertainment, but I have no scope for them. I want to avoid camera angles, cut, pan, light, rhythm, almost fear or elimination of titles, sometimes even missing filmmakers or actors' intentions. Even the footage can not argue even reasonable people, I can never learn anything. I wonder how much more about how a film is about it. Maybe it's my fault Wiser but difficult to deconstructing the unpleasant movie, may be seen on the one and the integral, cuts, pan, etc. with no matter no matter. I asked myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Political filmmaker, fascist and not Manipulation with light, space, and sound to change all perception and mood. How different is their goal? What is the goal of the film for real abuse to use as a campaign? <br /> <br /> When my Ally Long (ANL) trilogy appeared in my childhood, I left it for almost a year. Curiosity has made me buy it. I showed a few minutes' samples of "1" on reaching it, it is actually a strange sound-influenced road corner, which seems to be an attack on the film's sensitivity, it is unreasonable but effective. I must definitely return it, of course, but do not expect expectations. Clearly, it was not a scary fear of curio, healing, Angel Dust, Line, Raw, but the traditional Evil Dead Trap, the political work of Kozi Wakamatsu, or even the terrible superstition of the brutal superstition of Cronbirge. </ br> <br /> What is the word "attack" maybe? Matasumura does not attack its characters, but its audience. Abu Gharib (I think that I think the video has been proven) and I do not see this at the moment in history without taking into consideration the hostage videos, but the oppressors of Gadad (selling Le Petit?) Are just one work, a fraction of a person's working day. And then there is a description of the long story of North California, which I rarely remember but can not completely forget because it is very "movie", strong in the infamous pair of serial killers, if the recommendation video does not play with my memory then the video will be for themselves <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not see the ANL3 follower entry. ) Through the first two proposals, I used to imagine a camera in middle or grammatical school with a camera that attracts war scenes or other persecution. (Or has become a writer-director of revenge-mad characters of Matsumur, anyone who sees it as someone who did not see Michael Powell's peeping Tom.) But the ANL3 seems to look at the mainstream. Matsumura's hero enhances fishery plants, which usually allows Japanese cool closes up nature shots. Matsamura is a traditional boycott sequence for the first time in the film: the woman's boss of Kiku remained silent and began to look at the customers of Love Hotel. Kikou finds herself unhappily sandwiched in. She is a middle-class voyeur. Short adventures come from the voyeurism level. There is even a philosophical / poetic junk sizer, a rubbish voyeur, whoever remembers me all the time-such as go, go, seconds-time virgin poem. <br /> <br /> I'm not going anywhere with this, and it has got a way to comment on my other movies. For years I will visit Matasumur's archaeological site in the archives of my local film, I can not avoid being skeptical, maybe learning a few things that I'm losing is hosting. <br /> <br /> does not it matter whether the director "easily" gets his lethal fake hero? Will he even understand them? Maybe to get rid of a director's job, then let the critics, sociologists, and all of us leave the hash items. Maybe a directory is wrong or a fool's idea. <br /> <br /> In my final struggle with this thing, I thought how a man thinks of this adulterous male exercise in the world. We overwhelm women from Star Wars to its cataract and its caterpillar and on and over and over, but what is something like a man like All Night Lunge?
