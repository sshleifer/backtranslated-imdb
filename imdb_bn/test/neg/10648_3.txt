After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth", in that chapter the franchisee was called 'death blow', another embarrassing cash cash-in did not come as a surprise. Explaining a neutral effort between a film that runs under 90 minutes across the literary centuries of the history of each mystery and puzzle box in Pinhed ... The sub-par of cruel acting, the sub-par of the humiliated B-movie, the special effects, and the dark hilarity are a ridiculous and Insulting efforts, while still trying to keep the whole project completely serious. I wonder, how scary this thing was? There is a lot of screen time in Poorh Paddy, which is completely lost in the mystery of this symbolic character and every bit of danger. After an hour of lecture and dramatic posting for long hours, we only ask the man to silence! Especially in the first segment, definitely the recreational, this mess is made for the TV splator flick for a while, feels cheaper and ugly and starts and ends with the most ridiculous way: Pinhead, along with his pet Cenobite dog, shoots Idiot's cast ... outer space! I am sorry, but the true fan of the first two films of the series, which can be ashamed of this abortion of a movie that is more than 3 films. The note that follows, a film that follows; "Heyler: Inferno" was a wonderful, intelligent and stylishly-made film-piece piece that was brilliantly reinstated as a master of 'pinhade' confusion and cruelty, and brought back the idea of ​​the underlying evil of mankind, which was the center of the original film, and the whole point of the story. For any serious horror fan, see the Illusion I and 2, the third, and leave it and go with 'infra'. You do not miss a thing by skipping this trash ...
