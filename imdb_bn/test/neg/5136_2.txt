This film has good intentions, at least in the message "Do not be afraid, how difficult it can be, no fear that it can happen." The fear will kill you till the end "This is a good message, but the holder is so bad that the message gets squash bad performance , The complete lack of credibility of the feeling, the way the dialog is distributed, as it has been sent, it reads instead of the breathtaking No, the living man. <br /> <br /> It is harmful as slow motion compensation. Acting lacks credibility and thus, lack of mental force ... <br /> <br /> Its suicide episode still reminds me of a low-budget movie in the 90's, when lesbians (at least celluloid) live well, The tendency to catch up on the happiest life and the highest top plays in total separation, death, or prison involvement. <br /> <br /> If we feel like how we focused on the reward of living (and how others think we live it), it can be less dramatic, more inspirational. But this is not, it focuses on pain, loss, and leaves the message only on a theoretical ideology. <br /> <br /> I can not see how this film can be inspired to come out or overcome fear and refusal. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a great movie that discusses the fear and courage to live your life, go back to the great "heart of the desert" (better: read the novel!).
