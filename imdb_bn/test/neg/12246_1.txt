I am responsible for the comic book for someone who has enjoyed David Movie and Epic Movie. You have encouraged Fox Studio's frustrating parody movies to keep slow, and now we're dealing with the most lazy and most frustrating thing that can be. Combacks barely qualify as a parody. Hack, it just qualifies as a movie. This theory is not a comedy, but executed. Someone, even the people involved in this mess, probably could not even think of fooling themselves. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has really made a little worse here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I heard his name in the first few seconds of the film, I knew I had a long film I was Funny names are rarely funny, and you become less interesting to hear them. Lambueo is one of the world's worst coaches, but he has given his best friend Freddy Wisdom (Karl Weathers) another chance to train a Ragga High School football team named The Comebacks. Lambo will not only lead the team to leadership but will also teach the path of their inspirational sports movie clich√©s. She hopes her kids have alcohol and alcohol problems and they do not do it when they laugh at them. When the team seems to have played the big championship toilets (playing this 10-year-old script?) Ball, when Lamboau suddenly got to know that Freddy was the coach of the big team of his rival team. To play against. Frankie suddenly encouraged Lambo to take up coaching work, because he wanted to lose the Kambacks. <br /> <br /> Cambox is a movie so strong and kind, I had a hard time believing what I saw. Spoof Movies has recently become a game of "Movie Reference Spot", and this tradition continues. It can be done as much reference to other sports movies as it can, but it tries to compress it, but it does not do anything with them, pointing to our screen and laughing out of contact, or it tries to be fun and flattens on it Face Reference of Dreams, Bend It Like Backham, Rocky Bulbo, Friday Night Lights, Stick Brick, Radio, Miracle, Smith Titans, Gridiron Gang, Ingenious and Doszy: A True Underground Story. But waiting, did Dazal already have a parody of inspirational sports movies? So, in other words, we're watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies. If this gives you an idea, then you are only looking for viewers for this movie. Some of these films have been mentioned in the plot, and some are thrown (rocky one) for any reason because filmmakers want to try to mention as many movies as possible. The film also feels the need to explain us in our conversations, only if we miss clear references. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You do not know even the first and most important rules of parody - you have to play it directly. The actors do not pretend they are in joke. Why do movies like Classic Junker Brothers Airplane, Top Secret, and The Naked Song seem so memorable because they were serious actors like Leslie Nilssen (yes, she was a serious actor before comedy) and Robert Stack and then throwing them in a ridiculous situation. It is interesting that they did not act as a comedy and turned the stone face toward the oddity around them. If they played their role broadly, those films would not work. Comebacks prove this because all actors are forced to play their roles so stupid, that they shout to laugh at us. David Cochrane carries his arms, pierces his eyes, and shouts at the top of his lungs that he is impressive, like someone who is trapped in the last comedic death and he tries hard to pretend to spend a good time. . The film does not understand the art of celebrity Cameyos (it is also important for parody movies). What kind of cayos do we get for lessbacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman <br /> <br /> As long as the film "does not pause anywhere" for any reason, and extremely timeless cast musical numbers, theater door is ready to walk out of the door. I was the only person in my screening, and the thought of this movie completely led me completely towards the house completely abusive. I sat in the rest of the combox, and I was not rewarded for my efforts. Sadly, Fox has not yet killed a wonderful series. Later, they have a parody of 300 meters called The Spartan. I would say it does not get much worse than this, but I saw the trailer, and I do not want to get your hope.
