The film was so neutral that I spent half of it in IMDB, when it was open in another tab on Netfix, someone saw it trying to find out which boring, scholar, camouflaged movie they've ever seen. An alert: I actually could not finish it, so this is my impression for 54 minutes. <br /> <br /> Care Nightly gets screen time load. As the others mentioned, her mother wrote this script (probably in the case of a drug-induced stupor, in which emotional statements like emotional and emotionless conversations seem to sound like an interesting conversation), and it seems like a showcase for this movie nightlife. Oops! Although I agree that he is lovely (his teeth are unreleased ... his painful tooth worries me and fears) I have to accept his responses and have a weak time. For example, William or Dylan has done some nice things ... stop ... huhah with de kles and a playful arm jab. It's like a minute too late. What? And he does not match the serenity of Sylly Murphy. She really looks at her and sees that she is fascinated by her and has fallen in love with her, even though she feels completely disconnected, she is almost communicating with a mirror. That should be tortured, the opposite of the fact that your opposite is not the same power supply. Do you know what torture? This movie <br /> <br /> Nightly looks spectacular about its shiny timing "I got a 1940s pin curl and a hot dress. Let me sing!" Shot, but what is the point? Is he an altar or an actress? When he says his strange words, "Oh, Meherster Dylan. And what's going on?" It makes me confused because the pronunciation is so mixed and irrational, even so thick I have no idea (or may have slept) when I say it. If someone does not know who took care of sheep or some, it was so important to give him this valen? It refrains from all the rest of the work (just doing fun) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But awake Instead of being attracted to the world, "Man, that dream was so funny" and tried to repeat it. Then someone warned, "Your script needs work. Anything that does not happen will create a story or necessity" and the writer is all, "but this is how I dreamed!" It's like a children's awful fantasy, it's one of the wild and gorgeous yarns that you can gain for your intelligence. And then William went to a fight and then the sheep was a child and then used to drink some blonde chick too much and there were many planes and there were kernel pins and everyone had red red lips and ... <br /> <br /> Dylan Thomas The character (so bland that I can call him all), why does he have no line in this fool biopic? What she does, she drinks beer and smoke cigarettes and wanders with Siena Miller, that is so wild and artistic, she will cartwheel in public! Get out of here, you crazy poet! (I understand that he is not a poet, but he and Thomas are a wonderful unit of crazy people, like crazy sailors and Hart as Wild to Lulla.) If someone wants to buy this film, then the message asks on the board. . I say it Keep it in your shelf and use it as a weapon to add drugs to children, adults, or comfortable home guests. <br /> <br /> PSS. In the character of Marfi ... When someone asks you if you were "You ** **" then you can say yes because your war footage seems to be shot in land land.
