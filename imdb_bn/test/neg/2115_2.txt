Will Spanner (the fifth actor to play the role of David Bearers) leaned towards another malicious case, this time involved vampires rather than normal dais, werlocks and friends. A girl wheel attacked by a vamp when she hit an injury and hit her friend's boy in the hospital). He helped Detect Luitz find a case that wanders around a secret vampire company so that they legally own all bank blood banks or try to get a business exchange to make some fools. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is returning to nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As expected from this series, I guess). So well acting, or complaining about the lack of plot plot, even the lack of convincing characters, I doubt, will fall on the deaf ears. If you see this movie you are not concerned about these 'frivolities' and want some 'steps'. Unfortunately, the film also fails in front of it. All women are compelling enough but the way the scenes are illustrated are just oppressive. <br/> Eye candy: Both Camber Blair and April Brainman show less or less practice. Unconditional ray looks full! Aline Kassman and My-Lise Holmes only show their breasts <br /> <br /> My grade: D.
