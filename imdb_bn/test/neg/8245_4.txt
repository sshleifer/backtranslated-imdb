I push my brain, but I can not remember any other movie like Ganges Valley. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? Why do you think John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> Plot ?? When searching for a mythical little horse for his circus, TJ Breckridge (Gillah Golan), Talk Kibber (James Francis), and the rest cast / characters enter the weird, lost valley. There they can not find only the smallest horse, but some other, more dangerous creatures also find. Dinosaurs ruled this place. Now there will be no attraction in the TJ Circus ?? Rex a caged? <br /> <br /> I do not find a bad movie in the valley of the Ganges, I do not think that I enjoyed many others who commented on this movie. I actually have some part of the almost unwatchable. For the first half of the film, there does not seem to be much running. I was not bored unnecessarily, but I want to happen something. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. To top it off, the movie features a very invented love story. The author decided that men and women should meet together in leadership. But the Valley of Goyangi is not the total waste. I have really enjoyed moments. Who does not find the horse-riding cowboy's trying to lose to T-Rex. You just do not see things like that every day. Ray Harhausen's animals are impressive. Interacting with the smallest little people of the harness and the horses. It can not represent the best of his work, but the effect is very beautiful. Still, at least in my mind this is not enough to overcome negative momentum. As soon as I hate to do this, I will pay a rate of 4/10 in the valley of Gouni.
