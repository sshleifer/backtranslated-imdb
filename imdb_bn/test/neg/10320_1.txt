I saw this one DVD remastered. Sandra was a big picture on it and "Starring Sandra ...." seemed to be a big part of it. is not it. She is barely of it. She can do with the script, but that's not so much. <br /> <br /> The word was awful. By that I mean things do not go together. The shot will be fired and the number of shots was not similar to the word. The car is moving in the car while it is running and the shot is outside the windshield but there are no motor words, no noise on the street or any other word. Strange kind of <br /> <br /> The score was horrible. It sounded like a few similar notes over the same. The dialog is really awful <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, I could not believe it. The battles were like a Batman comic with "BIFF" and "BAM" scenes. They were really poking. Shooting scene, I mean with firearm, ridiculous, literally. I fast-forward through a lot of these movies Even then, it was too long.
