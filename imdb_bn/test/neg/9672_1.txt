When I did not think anything as objectionable and / or annoying as Billy Mess Infirm, I had an intriguing experience of breaking this trash. Peter Barnes and John Irin should be prosecuted for smuggling this script in public squares. Actors need to be charged as charged, serve the public less than a lifetime to the eyes. <br /> <br /> This product deserves to be added, which adds no drama, that "for the dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with some facts" or such insufficient statement completely binds you to a recap of a Bible story. What they added is enough to create your IQ. During the viewing, drop three full points for every five minutes. <br /> <br /> Getting "poetic license", the characters make such a strange discovery, but you can not recognize anything except a few names and of course the ship. <br /> <br /> For some reason, both Noah and Lot are living in Sodom, so maybe Abram has been holidaying in Switzerland on a skiing tour. Harry, wife of Lot, who played Carroll Kane, and when she turns into a pillar of salt, the lot breaks her finger and falls just like a baby shower fountain. If it is "poetic", I am a Kumkat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Noah - Now the quantity of those who could help the ship maize, has begun to drink wine - the building project whines about the tough work, he awakens one morning to God enough to lighten his burden precut wood supplied. At least I think it was God. It looks like a delivery from 84 long, neatly stack and bundled. Maybe 84 Lieber really is the agent for God ????? Instead of carrying the goods of the ship instead of carrying you, I'm calculating the pirate attack on the ship. Inconsistent, what do you think? This movie is filled with such insulting dirty. After an indefinite period on the water, Noah spies a pirate ship on the right title for them. And who can be the blue sea captain? Well, duo, it's a lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not. If you're going to kill a plot line, kill it all. Smuggling attempt failed, and swashbuckling is not charming, was unfortunate. I think it was around the sign that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymore. <br /> <br /> An ugly, stupid, stupid distortion similar to a biblical account. On the scale of 1 - 10, this movie predicts the abuse of the mind. Stupid and insulting, you will be more entertained to read the Yellow Pages.
