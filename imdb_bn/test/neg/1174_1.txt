I would hate to see this movie "inspired by a true story" and have painted any decision about the true facts. Some of the things they found were printed by things that were not right. Ed gin did not pull anyone behind anyone, did not meet anyone in the graveyard and did not kill them, no proof he did not return body parts to the graveyard. What he did was terrible, why did he try to make it worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is in my 10 worst damages. The film "The Light of the Moon" is a better film than this, it is more real and the actress is better than this.
