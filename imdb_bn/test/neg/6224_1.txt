There is no better way to describe the wonderful experience that Mamata Mia can see: Hitler must be shown, the pseudo-director Failida tells Lloyd, 'You're a monster, what have you done?' <br /> <br /> Movie is wrong. Just ?? Wrong! Even its success, which is unavailable. I understand that when the ugly parody movies like Epic Movie earn their minuscule earnings and they get profitable (of course they are!). But when something like Mamta Mia makes around 450 million dollars, you think 'what's wrong with the world?' <br /> <br /> And we think our Merrill Strip, one of the best living actress in the world, is it? What did he think 'I need money', he can say. Then, one of your grandchildren sold, even that would be less embarrassing. Maril is not a crushing piece, wrong, 'Cinema' is not good. He is destructive! He sang, even though he sings, it is ridiculous. Worse is his peers, Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now she is doing her father songs in the violet spandex during the worst movie credits. Really? And when I mention to the father, I have nothing about the band and their music. When the actor starts singing (bad), dancing (bad) and after adding extra, it does not help them (although they pop out from somewhere! Often!), To represent a terrible musical sequence after another. The music starts when you want to cry. And I love the musical! But this is the first section where you pray for real silence. <br /> <br /> I could go. The list goes forever. You can write a Stefan King novel with this complete list of errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> See this for a group! Really! You understand !! And it's already a huge success, if it makes a few dollars from you care? And you do not like Satan sell your soul. That's what Meryl did before For all mankind. And now the end of the world, because we've done the worst evil and we must destroy.
