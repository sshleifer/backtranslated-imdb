It is very broad and feels a greater amount of patronage. The whole plot is very compulsory - especially to protect the "great" effort from the destruction of the college, and the moral overtones (especially by the leading women) have a little stigma. <br /> <br /> One or two comics are moments that help relieve the annoyance, and the dance is quite funny (especially for the accused athletes - hah!) <br /> <br /> Shop owner and spectacular dancing Young youths had special highlights. And I liked the impression of Peter Laughton and Peter Heiss of Ronald Coleman.
