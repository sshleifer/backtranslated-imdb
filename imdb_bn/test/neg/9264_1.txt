Well, after filming around the movie and after labeling the sun film as path-breaking, I had some great hope in the theater. Boy I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the role of the movie is so strange! Did any wife do kundavi (astrology)? A stupid, co-quo one? And what was the condition of her when she and her husband were fighting with her child (Baby Sharia)? What was the purpose of that scene? A rude shot to "scrub brow" to start? The atheist dancer was not the only music, it was not necessary to play only. Not everything! Secondly, the first half did not actually contain any stories. The whole first half was a fREAKING drag. The film's true story has no significance in every scene of the first half of the film. And how does Aishwarya (role-playing) change so suddenly? And how did Gautam (Sun) and Kundavi live happily together after six years even though they were so dissatisfied with each other's marriage? And if Gautamam would love Aishwarya, as he claimed, why did Kundavi marry if he wanted to die for his uncle? Why? When you look at this question you are asking! And the end of the wealth is justified? At the end was Gautam's first wife? Director of the film, Krishna, has claimed that he has worked in this script for two years, but his script became filled with flaws and completely annoyed the audience! Third, the mysterious screenplay of Krishna's extraordinary picture is just frustrating. Surprisingly, Anthony's edit for the song "New York Nagram" (usually superb) is frustrating! I saw the whole song as a slideshow made in Microsoft PowerPoint! "Munebe wa" Ranolio chorus was lost by playing Gautham's football game !!! Who wants to see the Freaking Dude while playing football during this beautiful Coraz !? What's more, the whole movie only needs two songs. Munbe Wai and Crocodile Adi Other music is not needed, including "Machakhari", "Maja Maza", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kadhal". Rahman's fine efforts in a stupid film directed by an actor director are easily spoiled! Rahman's fan, why are you coming to Bubal? Seeing on the way to portray his songs in the Colvideo, why would he want to stay here? The more annoying thing is that Krishna decided to include Makakhari in the film, the song was cut in half, which is really real disturbing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and packs into a so-and-so performance. His expression does not really like to sing singers during the songs he has shown. Did Jyotika play in the film? What was all he was CRY! You crying cry? One of his worst performances! What's more, her new hair is not suitable for her. He was looking well at Vietaadu Viliaadut. His clothes were closed during the song "New York Nagaram". The role played during the movie is just superb and justice for its role. Bhadivelu Comedy Anoning When someone sees her, someone wants to face them. This is the show stunner who is at Constantine scene. And why did Sukanya also agree to play a small role that only one can do? And why is it so heavy when it has its perfect color? AR. Rahman is just awesome. "Machakhari", "Munche wa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kadhal" are eligible for special mention. Rajkrishna's cinematography is fine and is not as good as its earlier films, although the "Kommi Adi" song scene is particularly notable. Anthony's editing is really frustrating indeed. The film is so scary and it can be trimmed tightly. Dialogues (AC Durai and Krishna), especially the part where the heart expresses its love for the sun is too pure to digest it. . Screenplay and scripts (Krishna) are scary. The film never moves in non-funny motion. And the black script is only filled with vague sub-plots. <br /> <br /> And for love, why was so much advertising in the film? Pepsi, Maggie, Suzuki, you name it. Did the film's producer (K. A. Knowledgevale) have low in the budget or was he disappointed? Overall, Jilunu Oru Kadhal is a damp squib. With a headline like this, one heart expects warmth and cooling love stories, but what you finish is a painful loving story. Really, really frustrated.
