Horrible direction from a terrible script. Even the DVD looked ugly and focused out. All ridiculous pronunciation on the map. Like most other commentators I do not think these boys were in love with clutter, but that event immediately became clear from the opening scene and all of the nude or tiny men were lovingly gloved with shot-out shots, usually wet or sweat, looking at each other completely.
