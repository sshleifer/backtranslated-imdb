I just wrote a comment on "ACES High" (1976) and it was released when I reminded the movie; Since then I have seen it once and it was enough. Like Kevin Good says "it's a complete waste time". In addition to dog-fights, the rest are done nicely, but a sequence of bad scenes with lottery scripts and equally shy-fighting actors. Kevin I do not remember the silly Germanic utterances described in his comment, but it is another unfortunate mistake; Karamen used German artists or dubbed those parts when trying to strengthen the characterization of German pilots? On the other hand, a very good example of the brutality of Hollywood-style films that are clearly identified with their "villains" is not only by their cruel acts, but by their extraordinary accent. <br /> <br /> The "cruel action" was a ridiculous scene. Lieutenant Harman Goaring murdered English nurses were an annoying part of the entire campaign, including an "attacking history" during an attack on an airbase. If you want to see a real, moving, very good acting and directed film about the air war during the WWI watch "ACES High" (1976) or that wonderful classic "Diwan Patrol" (1938), you will not be disappointed.
