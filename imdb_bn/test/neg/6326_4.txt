I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it 4 ratings, and in my opinion it's a lot more for a softporn shotgun. Like the real plot hockey (who would otherwise expect), but Hafran is so incredible, and he provides everything from cyborgian voice so that it is easy for him. Anyone written script definitely had some intelligence! I laughed a lot ten times, and because no one would choose this movie. The only softporn movie I have seen is any other talent than a beautiful woman (and believe me, Emmanuel Drop Day is durable ... just cover it!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How poor the plot Considering how bad it was and acting, the film was not designed to entertain the artist, so to say it got at least four in my book. I want to say, who will stop, stop before! Or will my mother shoot?
