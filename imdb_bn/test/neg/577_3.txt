I want to be honest, I like the romantic comedy, but I did not have what I expected. I thought Allen was the biggest part of DeGeneres, which should have been, because I did not like two struggling bed partners. It was a strange thing. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to act in a film, which was a lot in the film, when he was there and Alan was in most of the film. They were only trustworthy ones. And only the funny part played them, Kate is not a caption and the avatar guy .. Cool coming out of the virgin waist, I thought it was a wonderful surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw him in the cable and I'm not paying for the rent.
