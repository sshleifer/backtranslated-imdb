I bought this movie's DVD because I was a fan of William Deven and I was really frustrated about "Christmas Visitor". The movie story is so annoying and gradually you want to close your TV or DVD player after about half. The dialogue is really bad and involves a daily soap opera but not a TV movie. William Deben was right in his part and he is performing well, but he did better in other films and projects. Meridith Baxter was horrible and could not really bring the warm heart to the audience. Instead he was very cool game and was not better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. Extra your time and your money for this.
