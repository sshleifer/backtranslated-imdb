At any given point of time, the movie plays a prominent Left or Left, it is 10 to -1 which the director brings him because he does not know what to do in order to keep the film interesting. In this case, the featured little guy is not all bad - he guides her to maintain her dignity for most of the scenes (in the part where she places leading men under the dungeon stairs), but the film itself is like a dog strap toy using it. The problem here is less common with budget exploitation films - here's a decent idea, but the director and screenwriter do not know how it can develop. A good director will take elements of different stories - brain replacements, secret labs and a lazy, car driving, boxer, slowly psychic Frankenstein style assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy etc. Exciting, cheap thrill and fun film full of involvement. Instead, what we have found here is that a long man, walking around and dispute between the doctor's lab, then the operation of the sugar where the patient bloodshed the thump, then some are roaming around and arguing. In the doctor's lab, there is also a few other driving vehicles and accidents near the other sub-group of the primary community, followed by a counterclockwise view of the black hole. That often runs a woman behind her shoes, then followed by a confusing series of Chase (the real high point movie on the roof where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everyone else, then walks in the countryside, where everyone turns back and attacks, Attack or escape from everyone else, later, good, or more. <br /> <br /> here Somewhere there is a horrible peroyakide blonde in white, a great meaning heroic type, which looks neatly beautiful, three feet lab assistant, a big lock with a mass of molten rubber, one side of his face, a little child, much more of "Frankenstein Factor" In the middle of the movie to give a surprise, a hero can fall in love with the hero for some reason and pug himself Doctor, who must be the most fortunate person in the history of the evil super-villain because he does not do anything according to his plan, but things also work for him ... and for all reason he thinks of stopping an electrode in the transplant brain at one stage of the operation. Do it. . <br /> <br /> This is none of the worst movies I have seen, even the worst exploitation film I have seen, or even the worst-produced exploitation film I have not seen, but it is there, perfectness and eloquent embarrassment at every point, and There are no real reasons for bad movie enthusiasts to see it.
