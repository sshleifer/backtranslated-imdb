A family (a teenager's son, his mother and a stepdad), decided to get rid of the city life, get away from all and move to the mountains to have a new start. However, their ideals are separated by three brothers and their authoritative parents, who do not have mercy on their patch new guard. They started only when the objects and the streets were threatened by their windows, and the youth decided to make things worse with their relation with the terrible Trivi sister. The law is reluctant to do anything and the violence is increasing rapidly, the boy agreed to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> Wildly fierce in sunny and desperate, one of these strange absorption movies ever made. First of all, you characterized characters, especially overwrought bad guys, and some humorous dialogue may be a chocolate hamie. But then, your son gets totally unnecessary scenes to rape the child when his son is forced to be forced, or the thong sister beats up by his siblings to dare to sleep with our younger hero. Actually, the whole attitude of women in the film, which seems to be the sad creatures, that many screams and can not protect themselves, are very hateful. But of course, there is compulsory naked scenes, which this time a young lady involved diving into a bridge bra-low under a very thin T-shirt. Who care about the continuation of the plot when you have some willing young starlets ready to hang his tips. Right?! <br /> <br /> Teenage age climax center, who is still unable to sneak without jumping, suddenly Rambo entered the cloan and kept his attackers alive, on the right, and the gang is being held hostage to save his father! It is totally impossible but hey, everything else in this movie .. so at least you can not complain that you are not consistent. So, instead of finding the logic in the place where the word does not exist, see IMDB pages for Gentle Line Green, Beyond Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Cromby etc. Notice a pattern raised here? All of their careers end dead dead. Why? Sit through this, and all will become clear. Remember the children, if you want to continue this business, hire a decent agent and they always read your suggested script. Please .. 3/10
