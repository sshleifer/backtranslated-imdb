Harlan banks are thieves at the top of his game, but after successful career, he decides to sit down with his wife and decides to retire. However, he decides to take a last routine job in Las Vegas. He has to do what he has to do and it seems easy. Unfortunately, someone advises the police and after a great carriage, he only sends down the winds to the slam to flee, and take revenge on those who betray him and take him to the first place. A common action-festival takes place. <br /> <br /> Steven Sigal dressed himself in a groove coat with a broken bone broken iDodo and playing himself (surprisingly!) playing his favorite cotta 1911. Coulte and Ikodo were always with him, but for the first time I reminded him with a trench-quote 'foreigner'. This is not particularly impressive, but it adds a little bit of lethal surgery to Begumson Seagull. Or cover it with extra pounds that pack it. But if you choose look at it. His main friend, Trach, played a new role in the action movie Rapper in the film, and both of them resorted to a little conspiracy by the law enforcement agencies, and gave their rights to every wicked person. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that it is painful, and I'm really harrowing, irrational. Sigal only follows the clandestine plot throughout the film and even leads to more dust with the film's progress. Then the final scene remains absolutely ridiculous, since people suddenly killed each other and thought of death, for some reason, started to talk. Damage in the sense of sound in the word. The only real positive thing here is the liberal opening - cars in Las Vegas, police cars, and usually a car charging with recreational eloquence, but after a short brief you saw it before. 3/10 <br /> <br />: Random: constant violence and prejudice
