This second addition to Frank Baum's Oz Film Personalized Trilogy. It's the same childhood as the other two pictures, but I think it's even better than others because it's short. Like other movies, performers at animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy and if the cameras are stuck, the characters and the plot jump in everywhere. At this time, a magician dress in the center, who wishes, and the boy made by a woman is made king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are seen at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography. And, there is a man in the Church who looks like the years before Georges Mills, most famously, 'Le Viegen Den la Lun' (1902). The effects of Melis' fantasy imagination and creative tactics made him the pioneer of the primary films, and the photos he made at the end of the century were much better and even better developed than this durable Oz series.
