Before canceling my post as "not getting it", tell me ... I'm one of Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone" fans. Danny Darko is my best favorite ever and I think the Southland Tales was the moment. I am a huge Sci-Fi fan. I was very excited to see the "box", I could not wait to get it out. <br /> <br /> I said ... "Box" is terrible. After "Hell to Take Hell", in 2009, I saw the worst movie. And it just will not end! Whenever you think you have reached the end, another change in the plot and you have been subjected to more torture. I was really crying at the theater at the end of the movie ... I could have taken it more often. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the "box" is that you simply try to remove it or justify it, it simply makes a little sense. Believe me, I found it, I realized what's going on. But this does not mean that it means a lot to see it again. Take the basics for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Merceden, playing soft and Arthur Lewis. Diaz lost her money in her job, then her husband got saddened that she "check to check the patch" Well, selling your husband's car to Porsche! They live in a beautiful 2-room house with a nice sub-division. Marsden is considered to be a high-ranking job in NASA and Diaz is a successful teacher. And, yes, Merceden is a very expensive car drive. But they somehow check the patch behind?!? Press any button, just cut your high-priced lifestyle! If they showed the couple unemployed and serious loans then the movies would work well. Instead, they are quite frustrating for money ... all the time I say a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... Do you understand what is going on, yet it is still a little intelligent! This is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible scene in a library that I would be down as one of the worst parts of the movie's history (terribly acting terribly). It was stupid, unreasonable and out of place. I can not even begin to even describe it completely, so I'll go to a sub-region which involves the nose-bleeding and body occupation by the alliance. (Yes, I'm unfortunately serious). A child is a naughty and laughing smile in Diaz's class (a laughing smile that completely ignored by everyone in power at school). She started asking Diaz's personal questions, literally her embarrassing in front of her class. The child is not punished ... even after the class he was not even asked to speak! Then Diaz is in a party ... and the same child hired help is a ... iron shirt, aperan and all! I do not know many foreign-adult kids (who seem to be present in junior high school) that they are sponsoring the team and school officials as the boy on the moon light ... but we have found one here! (See what I mean ... you can fully understand it, but it still does not give any sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the baby comes and goes ... there is no real explanation about him , Not the end of his character. Moving ... A woman then went to Diaz in the grocery store, telling her that the test was going on secretly and her family was one of the test subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if the aliens take the power where they can take a body remotely ... and the aliens do not want to help Diaz ... then who receives this body and gives advice? ! Again ... the lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... then who is controlling his body? Not explain Do not talk again. No no !! It's over and like this, what I like about, 2 weeks. It will not end! I wonder if this movie was a massive re-shoot at a point. It is badly edited. Diaz's pronunciation was a minute, went to the next. Start sub plot but do not end. Many push-backs of the date of the release obviously show the problems of the end of the product. This is really a train-debris. <br /> <br /> Pass this one ... no price can be paid. 10 out of 3, just because I like Diaz and Sci-Fi! But it's probably worth 1 to 10. Thanks for reading <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Z.
