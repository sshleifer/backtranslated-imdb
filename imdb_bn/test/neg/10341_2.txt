I attended a screening of this movie. It was working with clich√©s and very weird joke and set-up. I think other comments that worked in movies or cast members of the cast would certainly work. I am surprised at the price of this film $ 3- $ 4 million without any real star. Where did the budget go? It probably does not go to rewrite the writing. Big Fat is a good idea to the bank on the success of Greek marriage, but a major Miss. The main characters did not have little or no spark, and the excitement was very good. The instruction was unclear and a student looked like a film. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that everyone wants Italian. That's a real saying. I did not hear it.
