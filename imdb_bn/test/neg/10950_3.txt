After watching an annoying movie on Saturday afternoon, I did not understand why so many people liked it. It was not "heartfelt" or "tricky"; It was only a movie, despite the fact that "learning something about each other" despite all other "combined people" and their ideological difference just as they were coming together during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Characters in Stereotype Bullybys - We have Black, Hispanic, Jewish, The Asiatic, and Lesbian - and they do not do anything that the characters of a movie want to do this. Black Mother declares that this is "OK, then" when it is mentioned that instead of preparing dinner, another black character is in the church (because it loves all black churches), then Hispanics seem to be able to say Spanish, when each other's greeting or Wonderful, lesbians kiss and kiss without doing nothing (and wear one of them bandwagon because all the lesbians bring Iphranakora like a dress), and a video store has family in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "what is cooked" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of Thinksiving Dinner that should be considered! Black mother wants jackfruit and macaroni and cheese, Hispanic rolling shows Tartila, Vietnam family deep fried spring rolls; I was surprised that there was not a bottle of manhandwiches on the Jewish table. These are shown by the time-honored tradition of "musical-montage", where they can play the "Wiawout" of the Surfer, which quickly switches the instruments used to reflect the culture quickly. Is not that nice? However, once the director is finished, how different each one establishes, he tries to show internal humanity that every fate of every nation, religion and culture, we discover impossible and extremely dramatic conflicts for every family. It will be a plot-killer to mention what each of these competitions say, but of course, they will be surprised at the fact that you are sleeping for the first half of the movie. The theme of "disrespecting the family" is powerful throughout life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Well, you still do not like this movie. If you like the extended mood of food around the table, you have to keep it in the Netflix rows. But if you love stereotype and cleanies, make sure you are asking for it for Christmas.
