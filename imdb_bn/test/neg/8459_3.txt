Unmatched and beautiful stupid film that is mainly compilation of clashes of science fiction and suspense movies. Clips and unnecessary shots of Donald Plansense and Nancy Allen are visible among the viewers who visit the camera and explain why we love horror movies. There is no bad idea, but all the explanations are clear ("Helps us to deal with the terrible real horror of the film", "You are seeing the beauty of the filmmaker in a theater") and the fantastic trinity. Also the clip is shown very quickly and the change is of jarring types. And, the context is shown out, this bit is not too scary. And it's really short - I saw it in a theater back in 1984 and I paid $ 5.00 for the 84-minute movie! Since it has been quite well edited and it seems like Allen and Plansense enjoy themselves. It can be interesting and interesting for those who are interested in learning more about terrorism. But if you are a horror fan (like me) you probably will be fooled by vomiting Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). I give it a 3.
