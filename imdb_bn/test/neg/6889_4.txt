The video case for this image reads "A Story of Beauty, Emotion, and Banned Facts". Are they talking about the same movie that I saw? They did not look as good as they were, but there was no emotions and also for the fruit, it was hogwash to encourage potential viewers to see this movie. If I only have some passion or some life in it, then I have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was a bit slow and funny especially that I do not want to see it again. This is not a bad film (it is very well-crafted after all), but it is unclear beyond belief. I'm looking forward to some exciting or interesting events, but then the movie ends. There was no excitement, mystery, or nothing else - only one overwhelming story about a young girl who became a servant and spent the next 10 years doing slavery.
