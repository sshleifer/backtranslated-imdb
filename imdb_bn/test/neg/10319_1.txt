Tonight I have seen 5% of this movie and you can tell me that I have to see the whole film to understand, but I do not really think so. <br /> <br /> What is this story? Movie? I've seen many people surrounded in a factory, shooting everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Okay .. <br /> <br /> 1) They are turning to the terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but a single bullet on the metallic surface is not sparked. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal v. Metal Richts are bound to make, but apparently no one is hurt by terrible bullets. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic Bullet? In a scene, a bad person stands in front of a good person while another good person goes out of the bad guy and he fills the metal. You go out of his chest with bullets, because it spreads in a bloody fog, but the good person is not hurt in front of him! 4) Just after spreading a man across the wall, two good folks watch each other jokes and they look like playing with smiles and soft guns. <br /> <br /> 5) The word? At one stage, good guys cut a wire and closed an alarm (just cut a wire to set an alarm?). The lady shouted, "Sector blah blah alar alarm" and the bad guy's boss says, "okay .. this .. ..not .. .. drill .. bahay baha" very, very amateur type. Oh, we're attacking terrorists, it's not a drill, but I'm going to hear, I'm not drunk. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! At first you see bad-people load on the arms. For some reasons, the same person gets the same wiz twice. Wrap or loop in the scene? You literally take every kind of weapon to the same kind of weapon and they lock and load in the same way. Arms dealers clips and pops up additional numbers of bad guys. XX lock and load. When they started to open fire, you came to see Barrel Flash. Boooring !! 7) Actor or dummy? A good person remembers throwing a smoke grenade for some reason and certainly bad people are suddenly inside the smoke because they are blind or some that they do not see it. They cough and cry as an anthrax in grenade. Then a half-boss bad guy comes and he does not cough even when he smoke, he just pushed another bad guy and they suddenly realized that the smoke is not anthrax. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think yes! A man shot Wazir in his right hand and shot down a metal pipe and shot someone in the height of his eyes. I want to see a person with a hand of a waze and I want to keep his hand behind him. A B-Flick kinda way extra bloody gore mess. A small hole with a short * pop * and a knife shirt indicates that this man is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, but a well-known man who had a highly trained white lash, he still felt the desire to empty his clips in the dead person. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these trained soldiers hides her with an empty clip! How can you be stupid ?! Always check your clips before encountering an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Annoying scene. Barrel likes flash scenes and likes lock and load scenes, the film is visually visible time of people running near empty buildings. If you are going for a B flick movie, cut this step. <br /> <br /> My two cents in this movie
