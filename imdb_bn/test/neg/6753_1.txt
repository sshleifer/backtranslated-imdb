This so-called movie is awesome! Actors can not work. There is no plot. I believe they will have to scratch and start film again. I hope they can correct the flaws in this movie. They want to see the trailer after it shoot again. Maybe there is hope for it. I do not feel hurt out but I believe high school kids can do a good job. Clothing can be a lot better. Sorry, but this is not just for me. I usually enjoy the trailer from this site but ... This one I can not find recreational. I hope they will face criticism because I believe they get more from others about this movie.
