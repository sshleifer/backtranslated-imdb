What does Sambandala's connoisseur show when the creator of an animal wants to understand what their fans have failed? I do not want the 1920's Evil Nazi movie as a fan. What I liked to see was a real final showdown between Ed and Dante because we do not really know about him. I liked to bring Ed to his world very quickly and finally got the chance to become normal. You know, raise a family with a specific blonde Mechanic, that sort of thing. No, instead I'm mysterious, fritz's lag, and almost ten minutes Al, Ray's Mustang's CÃ©imo do not hit Win with a joke and only one Armstrong rig, a short joke and no reference. After all, it does not seem like a full-time alchemist to me.
