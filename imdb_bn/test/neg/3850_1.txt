This movie is possible every kind of kindness. Bad acting, awesome script (was a?), Terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the movie 'The Wishmaster' a few weeks ago and I think it was a dead pigment for the worst movie of the year. Then, I saw 'pest' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' does not seem so bad. <br /> <br /> Bad bad. Excruciatingly bad.
