Most of the prediction films I have ever seen ... very annoying, it seems like I have seen one hundred movies with the same story. Good acting is okay, there really is no action and definitely there is no thrill. Eligible performers with terrible scripts feel that this may well be written by the 10th grade. I hope that this film will have something that is ready to separate from all the other junk, but it is also suitable in this hip. The whole film was waiting for something better but it never came. I never rated movies and I did not review films, but this movie was so bad that I had to log in here and some poor souls had to post a review to try to waste time (and / or money) with this movie. I pirated it and I wish to waste even hard drive space. If I spent 10 rupees to see it in the theater, I would kill myself.
