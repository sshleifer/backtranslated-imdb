This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have seen about 300 movies of my life. Acting extremist, the only bright spot woman seems to be judging the physiological power of castmembers. After watching this film, it is proposed that the audience should not be driving heavy machinery, at least 24 hours of driving. Also a bottle of Valium will be recommended so that you do not feel so bad for 100 minutes of your life. The plot is nothing but the dialogue stimulus, even the arms seem like sub-parameters. Help yourself and go to your local blockbuster and burn any copies of this awesome movie.
