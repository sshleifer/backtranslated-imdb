... so some people might argue that this is never the worst movie, and it's not. I saw movies with weak plots, bad acting and more. <br /> <br /> Why do I hate this movie? Well, this is basically a man who kidnapped for many years, and when he came out, he asked who and why he did, to take revenge. My problem with this movie does not have to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** If you do not want to know but the main speakers stop reading *** <br /> <br /> Our main character Basically, he gets entangled in a sexual relationship with his own daughter and wants to cut his tongue, so his enemy will not tell him, because he did not know. It is so insulting as he deposits constantly like a duck like his gathering. And why did he deserve this? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister, a humble moment - in the wrong way. He went and told some people, so he committed suicide. And viola, it's the brother who kept our main character through all of this for us. I'm surprised: I probably hate this movie because I think his punishment is extremely harsh. Probably, because I think this film does not condemn cruelty, but this way it is confused with love. <br /> <br /> *** End of spinners ***** I'm very serious you know that some movies just go down to your skin and stay there? Well, after seeing this movie I felt dirty, and I did not really see it. I stayed with me for a few days, and someone might ask: Good, or the purpose of a good movie? Ability to influence us in such a way? Yes, it may be, but this film did not make me sick, it violated me.
