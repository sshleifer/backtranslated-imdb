Why do I hate this? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pikford but a 32 year old woman is only fools. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> lots of ethnic and ethnic slurs <br /> <br /> Fights for a "family" movie were very violent ( Pikford loved it when he was tearing it with the little boy!) And humor was just stupid. <br /> I seriously left for 40 minutes and stopped. Atrocities, racism and little children came to me by throwing bricks to each other. There was also no plot that I could see. The only thing that can be seen in this movie was William Hines, who was a prominent leader in silent era. <br /> <br /> Just painful. To avoid.
