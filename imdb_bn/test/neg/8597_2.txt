The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, by stand by, I showed a lot of people in a movie and they liked it altogether, but he did not like it for some strange reason. He gave me a movie called Backdrop and he told me that he showed it to many people and they liked it, instead I hated this movie. I do not think that I hated a movie in a while, how much is the rating of this movie more than 6.6. I could not keep up with five million stories here: Billy Beldwin is an ordeal, random siblings challenge, random love story, a fiery story, investigator, fire, whose personalities have their own personalities My problem is that there is a problem that can not continue with this story, they are not attractive enough to make the film attractive. If this film is a firefighter or investigator and how he did it, and how he did it and why I liked it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, big brother, he was seriously injured in the fatal fire. Brian, the younger brother left the academy school a few years ago, then started a few unsuccessful career before returning to be a firefighter. He is looking at his elder brother, who hopes he will fail as a fighter in his new career. Donald "Shadow" is a flaming investigator dedicated to his career at Rimgel. He is said to have some similar connections with some of the fire. Martin Soyzak City Council Elderman There is a clear expectation of being elected to the mayor, but he has to pay several tax in the fire department budget. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that they made are endangered by firefighters. However, Syazaz has initially been successful in portraying the fire department, such as the arson and ineffectiveness after being killed in the fire fire again and again. <br /> <br /> I could not read this movie, I do not know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and illustrated all the wrong fire extinguishers. I match this action to match the flick to clich√© every step of the book how they like. Donald Sotherland, an extraordinary actor, but it was such a strange introduction that could accept a gifted person in a short time. I knew Ron was going for a very good quality, but I think it was wrong to cast such a big actor in small roles. When I was watching this movie, my favorite joke was how the doctor of the background might have been Kevin Spacy. The fire was so unreal and the movie was right, I did not enjoy it and honestly do not recommend it to the people, I will be in the recommendations of my relationship from this point. <br /> </ br> 2/10
