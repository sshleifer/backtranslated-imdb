If you really want to see a terrible motion picture, this awesome motion picture (if you can call it) is in your favor. A movie worse than postman, wonderful beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazam, fair games ... well you get my points. This movie is directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastian (25 IQ with Jerry Springer), it can be considered really the worst film ever made. I hope Tromas or some people in the US will distribute it, so that the USSA can enjoy a valuable language.
