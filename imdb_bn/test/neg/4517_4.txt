I found this long forgotten 'show' my tape. Apart from theme song, 'Additional space from disco beer'. This show is barely watchable. Just flipping through the couple TV channels, just as you would be flipping through the channel. This is a parody of TV. <br /> <br /> Beaver cool. The female Dracula, dog dog experience with her dog's experience and discussing homosexuality shows that the woman who shows us something wrong on TV. It's all BAD. Beaver from outside, as it seems to be lost in this new world, you too will be. ***** *** ****
