This was the third hit feature of Hitako, and it seems that he is still not able to sit on the continuation pattern, to spell a foreign journalist from the fictional adaptation of the classic novel in Rebecca and romantic comedy "1930s" in this scrabble-style <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> The official method of Hitcoke has now been fixed so that it could be deviated from it. (Or at least reluctant). It was unknowable to go out of his usual style and romantic comedy was particularly inadequate. Rebecca was really great to see Hitek promoted by producer and source texts, but he was forced to launch his strategy in heavy Gothic play, but For Mr. and Mrs. Smith, there is a huge gathering of forms and materials. In other words, Hichok Arnest LÃ¼bitz was not there. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The depicting was great. This is a subject that produces many previous movies, Rich and Strange, a few hits that do not really work for a hitcoak non-thriller. The hit is not so good when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. Need a light, flexible touch and do not hit it. <br /> <br /> Second, take a comedy. Of course, the hitkoc movie may be funny ?? Perhaps the best example of Lady Vanishes ?? But only when the curiosity was sprinkled throughout the story. The mysterious master is simply not a comedy director to create a film that has fun bones. He cut the scene up as a thriller ?? Opposing the vibrating people to speak, putting off-and-off close-ups, point-of-view shots ?? But comic does not allow for the focus on timing or gags. For example, the carol bombardment with the explosion has shown us a few clashes with the business, but they also release plots points for some time and there is no any clinical effect. Occasionally the hitkoch style combines with comedians ?? For example, arrangements for club scenes, where Robert Montgomery thinks that he is with the attractive, sophisticated woman in the next table? But these moments are less and far away. <br /> <br /> Even Mr. and Mrs. Smith did not have the Cast criteria. I'm not sure that Robert Montgomery had the power, and he's boring here. Carole Lomber's power was "Queen of Scrub", and although she is clearly acting, the scenes are not able to hold comedy performances alone. Even Jack Carson, who could have been delighted while allowing permission to go in front of the camera, failed to fix everything. Of course, none of these subtle comedy actors are helped by the playplay, which can not really laugh for the first time with humor, even if the basic story is fairly good. <br /> <br /> This problem with the only complete Harry was made by Haqqo and such work was done because it played on mysterious mysteries. But when the story came into existence independently of humor, then was the original structure mysterious? As in Lady Vanishes or Family Plot ?? That Hitchcock comedy was able to do well.
