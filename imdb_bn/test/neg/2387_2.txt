If you see the title "2069 Title of a Sex Odyssey" in the video store, be careful! The cover contains Tory Wells and three "80s" porn stars, and there is a copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you do not), you're "80's porn Tory Wells?" Deceit !! It was created in 1974 and German star W. There is no mistake in the German pornography of the 70's, but this is not a cup of my cup, and it is nothing that believes in you that you are going to believe. Once upon a time I got angry about the extremely confusing jacket, I saw it anyway. This is a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I guess I did not really get angry.
