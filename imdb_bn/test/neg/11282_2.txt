I walked out of a number of movie screenings and the movie became one that I could not bear to see. As far as it wins the awards, those given by the Turkish festivals are not trustworthy in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens Festival Award was that in some way a level of comedy was "acquired in the translation", because subtitles helped attract attention from horrific performances. <br /> <br /> I was present at the beginning of screening, the presenter spoke briefly about the history of Turkish movies and at one point it was mentioned that the Turkish film was properly known as "stage cinema" because the filmmakers and actors were involved in the theater scene. . <br /> <br /> Harmingly, this movie is only within that department. English-language speakers can read subtitles that may appear in a naturally high language and movie featuring all the screaming features, but noticeable native commentators will be immediately noticed that all the actors are very loud and loud aloud You can mark it as a feature of amateur nature, but the biggest character of "yelled-out-dialog" is the main character, which is played by the only professional actor of the film. Wonderfully is not his background theater. My guess is that in response to the delivery of his line, all other amateur actors raised their voices, so the whole film turned into a continuation of irrelevant performance. <br /> <br /> Keep all of these up to a graduate story, you will find a very annoying movie. <br /> <br /> I say there are personal problems with Turkish movies that reflect the rural life completely with shallow uneducated characters. One of the Turkish films "Juggart Aga", since Turkish filmmakers will not be able to avoid the country's rural application. It is only attractive in small doses and it is beautifully arranged with beautiful writing and the jagurta is directed towards it. In most cases, it is very annoying and definitely embarrassing for local "urban" Turks. Rural communities create neglected, neutral parts of the country and it provides good material for the comedy, it comes in large quantities in the Turkish film. <br /> <br /> Western audience member whose only communication with Turkey is that the film will undoubtedly feel that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I hope filmmakers will realize it and leave their emotions for the story of "rural populace" and remain faithful to most of the country, who will live in embarrassing cities in the metro area of ​​Europe.
