This direct-to-video video rental, I did not expect a wonderful piece of cinematography. (There is no movie in the movie just waiting to be told.) This story follows very rarely in epic poetry, this film takes a unique on the story of monsters and super people. With a combination of medieval and post-apocalyptic (Mad Mac's monuments) the general photography can be summarized as a conflict. With a rock and techno soundtrack to boot, there comes a bit feeling away. The war scenes, though unbelievable, are entertaining, and Christopher Lambert's most striking film coordinates, which I have seen in movies sometimes, though often a practice is inefficiently incompetent. The special effects used for the monster-granel are surprisingly effective and one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert gave the average performance of the boudoil. It would not be anywhere near as memorable as the Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as the castle. Supporting cast is rather neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good action-adventure story with a complex and compelling plot, I will not recommend this movie. However, if you want a flick full of little material, hanging fighting scenes and somewhat predictable plots, find a copy of this.
