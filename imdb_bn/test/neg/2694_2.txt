Before watching Venice in Teluride Film Festival, I saw this movie as a sneak preview. Your feedback will depend on your attitude to respect Shakespeare's text. Plus side: Casino actually gives a very good performance as Shylock; Lin Collins is a fine porte; And the film has an incandable look. <br /> <br /> Negatives are expected. The most difficult of Shakespeare's plays, "Venice of the Venice", is the most difficult in today's phase, because of course we see it through a distorted lens of 20th century history. Romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem. Shylock's character is because we lack the lack of original references to Elizabeth's viewers. Shylock is a human character with an abstraction of people's qualities and motivation and the poor quality of the old act simultaneously. When he said, "Not the Jewish eyes?" She is a character; When he declared "I will be my tie!" She is an abstraction. In the final scene, the longest path of music and cosmic harmony (transferring here and cutting of ribbons) is the key to the game, so that it restores the universal harmony of crushing and evil (Shield of trial scene) forces. Repelled. It can be possible to create a sense of Shilok's character that Shadows are gradually appearing and the trials can revolve around the scenes while moving around the monomaniac - what is the time to be sympathetic to him. <br /> <br /> Passino's performance almost does this, but not quite. The film can not strengthen its mind - on the one hand, there is a right movement between Shylak's character and on the other hand, with extraordinary footage of the Jewish misuse and the Venetian Ores (no doubt to show the fall of Antonio et al) with silver nipples. Shakespeare was not writing an Ibsen-like social drama; She was writing a comedy following the symbol of marriage by classical pattern, disrupted social order, and social order restored, with a theme of love versus love versus Shailk Plant center. <br /> <br /> The senses in this, the film is frustrating - the sports and direction of the radford routine often turn us away from the meaning of the game. (At the beginning of the final scene, it's the most extreme, and the most extreme example of moving it before the trial scene.) There are other significant issues. Jeremy Irons plays a fine actor, Adonio, as if he has passed the Sedatives. Nice but shallow as Joseph Fiennes Bassanio Most actors lose their conversations, except Collins, passino, and acting actor Duke. <br /> <br /> The final verdict? A nice film with a few decent performances It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad explanation. Do not really value your time or money - although as Portia Lin Colin redeems it around.
