A friend warned me that this is the worst movie he ever saw. I was curious, because it was a bit better in a ritual situation. I liked a lot of weird Indie culture movies so I gave it a shot. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of dung. I am sorry for people who love this movie, but if you want to watch a tweaked indie film, I can recommend better things. Try Peter Jackson's Death Alive (Ur Branded), Cemetery Man (Ukil Delmont Delmo), or modern vampires.
