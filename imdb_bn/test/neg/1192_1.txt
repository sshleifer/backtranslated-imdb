Do not make mistakes, I like the TV series of the League of Gentlemen. It was fun, rolled and completely inspired. I was waiting for the movie, the premiere was interesting and I saw what they did with the character and where the wicked stories they took. <br /> <br /> There was total disappointment to start with the three weakest characters in the series, the boxer and it was only part of the other bits for other characters (why Mickey and Pauline, Dad Paparro or Tib and Edward do not opt ​​for the main parts? ). It was full half baked gaga and poor slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> The real clinic was a simple humorous play / comedy (and I'll use the word comedy). It felt unwanted, not confused and painful unfunny from the main story. The direction of the movie is frustrating, and often it seems that the lines are distributed in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> <br /> Then three plastic-esquirean monsters. What was that about all that? Smiling, it seems the league lady finally tagged it. <br /> <br /> I looked at my watch and everyone laughed with my experience of the film. Once what a wonderful television series has been tainted by an awesome unfunny film. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10 Do not waste your money on this.
