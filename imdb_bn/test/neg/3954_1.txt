Bad, bad movie When I saw the synopsis I was hoping something like the tape instead of the only video game with the ring. Nothing happened happened. I will accept the idea that it is interesting and it can become a good movie, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The first is to choose the true lifestyle, count the ball, the stupid steps that do not add absolutely to the story. Anyone who is wondering about his story will start wondering why and why this Hungarian sailor is in this movie. Choosing the spirit of a generic vengeance, will be much better. <br /> <br /> Then you have complete as-die-real-life-you-kill-game-concept. I said before interesting stories like the ring. But instead of promoting it in a good story line, it flows without explanation, why this game was created, why it was created and created in such a way. Waste to good ideas. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie is not a funny part that can not save at least at least the horror movies for viewing. Death scenes are very fast and long to be very fun. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
