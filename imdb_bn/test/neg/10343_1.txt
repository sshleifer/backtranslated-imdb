Theft is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Cobin Barsson are seen going out with them. I did not even see this movie, but I do not know how to suck it, but it stole the story of another movie or the story of two movies, this is a calf scourge (and if IMDB allows more impurity than just bruising) that I'm angry I'm filled with and feel like I'm throwing myself in the window and ending it all. Ok that's a little more but stealing is bad. <br /> <br /> Pondulupa ever seen? It was this awesome little junky film made in 2008, this radio host goes into the work, and then this happens to attack the zombie. We only see what's going on inside the radio station, and our only guess of what happened outside is the Cain Lone (the most fun moment in my mind) and calling for an update on the BBC situation. From the conversation I have read and to my friend (who watched this movie and Pantulum), this movie was similar to the story here, there are minor changes here and there. So throw basicity and creativity outside the window. For zombies, or infected, whatever you want to call them. They are exactly the same thing, because they get infected because they are infected and never end up for meat. They are the Zombies. Jumbo !! <br /> <br /> Jumpy !!! Many have one, but this crappy movie is back. 28 days later, the hair is better than what I have heard, another good movie, their crazy anger and even more insane waist of flesh. Jumbo films define themselves, where the story does not matter in a zombie movie (unless you take the idea of ​​other movies). Certainly such a zombie movie with Pontiflu can be enhanced, but the zombies will be essentially. After 28 days the zombie zombie insane insane started. Without Pantulupul I can not begin to explain those people without destroying the film. Evil Dead, I think I need to type the name again, because it's going to bring Evil Dead. The master of romero, and the Dead of the Dead of the Derry of the Dead, from the painted face Zumbi, he went through different kinds of jumps, and he gave each of his unique styles. So, after talking about another great Zumbi movie, I think this is about the time I am explaining why I hate this movie even if it does not. On the right, this movie steals the outline of Pontiflu's real story, which I think is called stolenism and is illegal in this country and many people have kicked from school to do this thing, but it is approved and apparently allowed in Hollywood. It is not the only film that outlines other movies and just trying to tell it differently. As for the worst time of the previous 90s, sure that it had some gems but it was not what the decades were, and because of the fact that all the movies were the same. My favorite movie movie is so big that you never guess it at all. They force you to supply a suspected food, it seems impossible that it is not someone else, but then, at this time, this guy was, you just wanted to see the scenes where he was not, and then he wanted to come out of the blue mysteriously, Say, "Hey, what did I miss?" Oh! I have not seen coming! Well, I will leave a cliché as my closing statement. This is definitely a movie you want to miss.
