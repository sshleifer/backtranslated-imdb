I do not believe! It's a good sign when I have a baby in the Jim Carry movie but instead it's a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This world should have sh * t's 'crappest films'. Thanks to God, the same director did not make it, because it is so stupid that it is not as funny as fate of cartoon parts, nor urine and dance! I laugh at this reason that Homer Simpson has fooled the man like a fool! I want someone to make a remake of the mask boy with such a plot! The mask guy (Jim Kerry) and a normal baby who has a boy with his wife. When the baby finds another mask he became mask, and the mask guy tried to get back his mask! This is very shit so I would give it 1 out of 10. Fu * King Shaw!
