One of Fortune's most interesting things is that one of the main characters is the author's block of Louis (Urdu) and apparently the scriptwray writer for the film. It's sad, as well, I guess, I think it's a comedy or dramatic, but it's the most memorable thing I can remember. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home, two people call their fortune "Gypsy", as they call her. The third friend stands, when those two lives fall apart. Then, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I will not ruin the film there, but in reality, this very low budget, bad movie, when it started, there was some idea but it went deeper. Hell Yes, I'm strict. Indeed, it was not bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The above author was boring to watch, although he only delivered one or two two funny lines. Clich√©d "female man," the only one that did not tell his fate was just boring. The only bright spot, the rest of the friends, the married father whose fate was told that something big would happen to his son and he would have to be prepared. He was the best actress in a fun, genuine, and definitely film. Unfortunately, it does not say much. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm very cruel. Hack, they got an ambition to make a movie, went and got the funds and some done. Unfortunately, by the way, I can not recommend the film based on, there are thousands of other independent films where there are thousands of good ideas and executions. This literally had 81 more annoying minutes in 10 minutes.
