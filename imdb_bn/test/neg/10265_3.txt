(Chances are more spoilers than you really figured out) Something really important is yes, it's really weird I hired it at Blockbuster because it was not a complete description of the movie behind the box, but there was only a list of song bands. But after that, I had a Dickens at the time of finding out even in the IMDB. I'm confused with "night of monster", but you know, they're basically the same thing. <br /> <br /> The most part of this movie was the whole thing in the garage. That black gym guy was sunny he screamed all the time. Even when screaming was not really necessary, he heard a "Doors rope with Cars !!" And so, they will run the head in another car of the car. But, then he got a basket and shafted by a zombie with a basket stick I believe. The part that attracted me was that part of the accident outside the building which does not want to come up on girls ... What is the significant aspect of the movie to us? What was it Why was it? Why is the studio man on TV the movie ended with the broken people? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was far far away. I mean, he could just stop the TV. Yes, this movie was a scandal and yes, I hated it. Good day...
