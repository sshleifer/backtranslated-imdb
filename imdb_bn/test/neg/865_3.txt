I watched Carrie a few days ago at the annual Vestus Film Festival held in Dallas and expressed my dissatisfaction. The opening caption tells us that this film is a screenplay for America's South American countries (in present-day Costa Rica, in this particular case) of aggression and North American oil companies, and both of the economic and environmental negative effects of this attack. The main character is a married couple who maintains a banana farm in a simple, happy life. Early, a woman comes and declares that she's half-sister of the wife. I'm not going to go specifically about this (and to be honest, I do not think I'm hiding something with this review), but another key point is that the companies that distribute their arts leave them due to budget demand in a poor economy. So, the main contradiction in approaching the film is the rocks and the husbands in difficult places, trying to save their livelihood. On one hand, the Reynolds oil company has provided employment and financial compensation (mainly a bribe) to the city to use its public impact to encourage the city to start drilling in its city (compromising its community and communities with its permanent compromise) itself. On the other hand, he faced death, but protested drilling, beside his community. The length of this movie is given, it was just enough time to explore the problems described, but it does not happen, and I'll tell you why. You will notice that the film has won several awards so far, for one direction and for the audience prize. I'm not going to exclude Ishtan's instruction, it was not bad for me or the lustful about writing something was not enough for me. For the audience award a movie festival in Spain and the audience's rewards, I want to imagine that the Spanish people just excavated soap operas. Actually, as well as Central and South America Dig Soap operas, I know. I assume that Esteban achieved the target of taking this facility, or he himself excavated soap operas, because what happened through this film is so obvious that it can bring the whole oil company's plots. As if they were half-imagined by making this film it became tedious, because it seems that at least three supporter characters have compromised severely to roam around for scenes of sexual and crying due to the story behind them and the development of character. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at any time you can not actually find out which one he is. Often they are as small as taking out their screen completely from the movie. From time to time, they are toys with oil against the plot of the community, but these are good digressions. We can see more of the scenes of emotions, jealousy, betrayal, adultery etc. These themes include the story in a degree that the oil company 'sublip becomes unnecessary. It is almost as a romantic drama (soap opera) was a stunt of legitimacy by throwing a little political relevance. However, this film is so caught in romance that it does not know what to do at the end, so that it eventually ends so that you think that you are thinking about whether you are waiting around. If there was nothing to start. Here are two things I think could save the film: Cut half-sister or cut oil company. It is obvious that which of them was more interested. Or, maybe if the Caribee takes an hour longer, they could do all this. However, I was good with a straight-up sub-opera and I think it is a serious need to restrain the issue of oil companies exploiting foreign countries by the film community. Caribe both and not These two angles may work together, but they were equally consistent, but running around the circles with romantic intersections and oil plots will take about twice as much time, which can start with both parties. . Best of all, romance plot is not even solved. I want to say that I want to see this movie again to see what I missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know it. As far as I'm concerned, it does not matter if I saw Caribou more ten times. I missed it because it is not easy.
