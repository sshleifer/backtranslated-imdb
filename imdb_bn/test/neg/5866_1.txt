Man began, this cartoon from episodes, stories, scripts, an animation is the fool to me, the dameest and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney TV animation has ever created and created, I'm very happy that Twen Disney (2006) and Disney Channel to Stop Airing it in the United States of America in May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe it is a cute choice to cast a cartoon and black cloud, if you see it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br />. If I had to remove the part of my brain then it would remember the observer, yes it was and was bad.
