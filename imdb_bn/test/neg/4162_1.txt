If you are a strange person who thinks it is "romantic" and it is wonderful to have sex with your mother's genetic equivalent woman, she becomes pregnant and have sex with her again after her abortion and do not tell her related to you, then You like this movie. <br /> <br /> The man who got married and has a boy in his house - it is more hateful and unpleasant that he has no conscience, he can not do what he is doing by his job, his family, or Maria. He is a damaged. There is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it's fake and unbearable. <br /> <br /> It comes down slowly and does not come anywhere in the first half of the movie. I could not even finish watching this unfortunate excuse for a 'romance'. I'm glad we did not waste our money in this movie theater of the movie. 0/10
