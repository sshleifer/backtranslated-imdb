Some of the reasons for the making of this point are the actors, but some actors hope that they get the opportunity to act in good movies. Acting only good works of this movie, these three female leads are better than most horror films like this. Two scenes that may be unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Small children use mines to roam around the hole and dig dynamite. When a child dies, all the children die, Junky becomes. Adults in the mines are dead, why children eat meat? If still alive, they were scared before the cave, the cave, so they could express anger against any adult who exploited them in the mine. (<br /> <br /> Move around in a house near a mine, a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and who is those wonderful people who think others are exactly what is happening. Still no one seems to believe in him. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new here, you are normal clich√©s, predictable, too negative for this film, very less positive.
