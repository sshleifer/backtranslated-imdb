I have seen almost all the films of Kurosawa and also saw dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, this is the average of the poorest films. This plot has the characteristics of two warring brothers - in which I do not care too much for one - and who is too confusing, who is friendly with whom Music and cinematography are good, but special effects sometimes terrible - the head of the head flies with the same reality as the average high school play! Above these charges, the end of the movie deletes the entire image and covers the whole picture. It was found that the fact that it last but was completely "fudged". So what does that mean? If you have watched this movie, then understand that there are so many good movies, so do not give up!
