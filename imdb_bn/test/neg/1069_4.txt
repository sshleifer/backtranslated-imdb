I'm certain that some people will enjoy it and it will be strong, or there will be some kind of personal contact with characters and stories, but from a solid stand point, it's not very good. The film revolves around the antipishal anti-raided teenage boys, everyone is playing a different stereotype, which we believe will be like a teenager. We saw a bit of the lifestyle of each teen, but the entire project was very insane to me, whether there was a continuous low-angle shot of the tree branch or a black and white "interview" with students, no new or original shows were shown in this film, nothing else No need to see. Yes, it is related to some strong content, and dramatic scenes are well played and played, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it is about Van Sant's "elephant" (one related to suicide, another is a school shooting). I said, some people would probably enjoy this, and the director / writer definitely got some inspiration based on the closing of the film, so it was good to make the film something heart. It seems incredibly void, and when dealing with material that could easily be clich√©d to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
