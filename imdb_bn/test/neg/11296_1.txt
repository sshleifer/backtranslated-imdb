One of the worst theaters in the year, not all the time. Anthony Hopkins belittles herself by appearing even in this joke. I can not believe the name of David Maimet and Ridley Scott is seen in this quarrel. The best carrier move ever made was Jody Foster turning this one. Julian Moore was emotive as a female Keanu Reese. Gary Oldman is definitely his brilliant self. He's a painful victim of Honeyball and makeup so good, I do not know that Gary was finally over. But eaten by trained boars ??? Give me a break There are rumors that he does not want to mention his name even credits. And feeding and feeding Ray Leota to his own brain ... I was rude with irrationality, I did not waste this blur on the moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
