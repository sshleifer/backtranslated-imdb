Empty emptiness of John Irving's novel tries bravely for strength but becomes stupid. It's an ironic, hidden and diversified array of strings, trying to explain the growth of a human from the birth of adults and how he works with vices of varies and fanatism around. Garp was born to a pregnant single mother, Jenny Fields, managed by Glenn Close. (There are three young actors at various stages of the childhood of the childhood; Robin Williams is played before Garcup reached the adults.) The story follows the story of children in their childhood. Former school, where Jenny School's high school, wrestling, writing, and gender-marriage through her high school sweetheart, child, marital problem and career of writing is a wedding school nurse. Jenny has already become a famous feminist, espousing an overwhelming reason. The plot comic and tragicomic episodes and an abundance detail of the ornamental event. Williams gives a grim face-to-face performance. This script was not suitable for her wildness and anarchy and thus was the waste of her genius. He sputtering out of the control of a wounded bird, like sputtering. John Lithgo's role is transsexic, not even a father who can play a role. Because of the popularity of Robin Williams and its new entry in movies in 1982, the film was able to attract some reasonable attention. Williams recently spread his morch and mindy projects and gave more attention to stand-up comedy and movies. The audience was confused by this movie, especially by his deliberate and unacceptable completion.
