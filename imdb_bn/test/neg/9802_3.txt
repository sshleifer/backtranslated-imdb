As I finished the book, "Mrs. Virginia, by Dolphin Wolf, I saw that it was in one of the movie channels last weekend." However, what I face, is a movie that is annoying, ignorant and non-sensitive. Nobody can blame the film completely, It tried its best with its useful ingredients, but when the source material is Virginia Wolf and almost as well It is written in a stream-of-conscience style with a narrow internal interaction and an extended period of real dialogue, one would certainly think that it can not be a movie made because a movie can be made from it. Actor Vincea Redgrey is not eligible for any blame for the failure of this film, nor does any other actor make it a film. Which can not be made wisely from Wolf's story and should not even have tried. Do not watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br />
