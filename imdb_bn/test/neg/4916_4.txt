Not a good one. - There is nothing. <br /> <br /> This iceberg revolves around the real murderer's family at MTV, who will have to face their past to free themselves from the nightmare of the Amitivill. <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My beat is that this movie was made for some extra fast cash by purchasing a boat or something ... because it's the only ridiculous ... thank you, it does not kill or destroy the series, but it does not have any impact on the series. . <br /> <br /> I want to say that only the old, notorious house is being constantly mentioned, it is the only thing that can make it slightly better "Amityville Curse".
