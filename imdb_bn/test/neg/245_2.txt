The first 2/3 of this film was like the 30th and 40th American Mummy movies. In ancient Mexico, two lovers dared to deny the law and were destroyed to die. An agget became mummy, whose work was to protect the holy treasure and his lady love. And the lady was resurrected today and Mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the common mummy film ... though it is slower and slower than American versions. Oh, and of course AJCTi Mummy really got to see, really unclear. <br /> <br /> However, this standard but annoying movie has a super-villain. Why? I dunno - it does not have any sense to make sure. It looks like this villain wants this treasure and she drives the lady to masquerade and shows her that the budget treasury has been buried. Why does he need riches? Well, the dummy to buy nuclear weapons needed to build the army! But first to defeat Mami, it is necessary to make single mummy, because the soil is so close to it. <br /> <br /> You've seen these "human-robots" since they are huge camouflaged flash gordon and robots from other serials but they have a rubber head inside a supposed dead person! They have a huge fight between the really ridiculous funny look and the laughable Mummy and Equally Slow Robot, while seeing the conniving movie worth sitting through the rest of the movie. They have been destroyed like the two at the slow slow pace ... and it happened in such an insolent and intelligent fashion that it is bound to meet the chocolates - of course not thrilling. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie, However, for bad movie fans, it must be seen - it's bad but weirdly funny and nice to see and laugh with friends
