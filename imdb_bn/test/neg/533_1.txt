As a scientist and casual Angelina Jolie fan, I think this may be a low-budget movie, perhaps ... it has some scenes or a storyline that will be made for its other flaws. Please, it may be interesting to see Angelina because she started her star-studded career. <br /> <br /> Oh, I was so wrong. One thing I learned - at 18, Angelina Jolie could not work. So, to make him comfortable, the producers cast this whole film with people who can not work. By this, Jack decided to finalize the slance (can actually work). This is enough to burn your eyes in 10 minutes of this incident. <br /> <br /> Add a nonsensical script to horror acting and overacting, Insipid dialogue, the bottom of the barrel cinematography ... actually add <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He escaped from corporate headquarters with the help of his war coach. Corporations send them monsters hunter after them. Stupid things will happen. The end I will tell you more, but I did not want to waste my life to see this deck. <br /> <br /> I'm requesting you - it's not worth watching. It's not worth worrying about watching. Save yourself pain and move.
