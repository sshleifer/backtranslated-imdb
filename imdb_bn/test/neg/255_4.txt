I have two minds about the first episode of Christopher Nolan's film. My part praises it for spending $ 6000, but my section hates it for the Art House too. In many ways it reminds me of the romance film PI, a movie that I do not like, and I can not get my head around the central plot of a person who wants to be an author by following people around. Want to be a writer to sit in front of the keyboard will not be more logical to write? Well, I think Indi-filmmakers hope that they will not make any budget film because they have spent more than $ 6,000, two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and five hundred members will comment on it. But if you are not made by the director of the movie then you will have to think so much?
