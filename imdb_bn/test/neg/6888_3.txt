I like it to check out this video. Want to like it. I like foreign movies, I like beautiful cinematography, I know critics love this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I do not think of "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> All right, it's beautiful. That's good for me about which I can say it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the eyes are very meaningful, the actors are very hearty and it seems like a very long movie. Though I fell asleep, half way, I woke up, grabbed the tape again, tried again. It was a trial, but I finally made it. I did not like it any better.
