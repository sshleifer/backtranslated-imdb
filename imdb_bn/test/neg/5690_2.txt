I will break this picture for you ... <br /> <br /> A 15-minute showcase for terrible special effects. I'm not the one with nitpick on special effects, but what you have to understand is that if you do not have good effects, your film should not be anchored around special effects. Starships are less than enough to count each other with your fingers, taking care of each other with color fires, stock explosions, and many fingers in the past. You have no idea what's going on. It does not understand <br /> <br /> <br /> The second act is a woman who walks through the desert. At this moment you will be treated with folded scenes, and illogical, annoying war scenes. Nobody talks Nothing interesting has happened. The aim of the hero is unclear, and is very compulsory. It lasted for about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> After five minutes of Montage, he entered the enemy, dragged himself into a rocket, destroyed the weapon of judgment, failed and died. <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A very large number, learning the secrets of mankind. After that, we see the first and last five-minute segment of the interaction with the people in the film, then the new heroine is forced to tell whether or not to take part in this material, which is big bank or not. You know Because when the universe is breaking down, you can decide whether you want to be part of it or not. <br /> <br /> She likes yes. But the Manchold Survive Memories in a Capsule Maybe we will not repeat the same mistake, right? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. The lead role can be nicely filled by any old wind-up toy capable of having the right side while walking through the sand. <br /> <br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here are a few movies to burn There is a good idea, but it stands, it swollen with a completely irrelevant detail. This two-thirds image can be reduced to 45-second resolution. Instead, the narrator has filled up the values ​​of a novel's values ​​that give us no reason to care for any characters. There is a good idea here, but no one cares about the film to explain the pictures neutrally. People saw movies for entertainment. Do not entertain this picture.
