Joe Cool Review - The Healer: Bloody <br /> <br /> Starred: Bruce Ramsay Philip El Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas Angelique, and Doug Bradley Pinheed as <br /> Plot: It follows the timeline of merchant's blood line starting with Philip L'Merchant, which creates a box that opens the door. When Pinhad first joined the businessman in the early 18th century and tried to break down the blood pressure (he is the only person who can stop Pinhade, you see) and finally, Paul Merchant finally found out. <br /> <br /> Opener: This photo has so much hatred by those who have made it, they announce the legendary director Alan Smith as the credit director. They drag Smith away from woodwork only when they think they've made a terrible movie, such as Classes the Birds II: Lands Ends or Bloodselling Forces Pittsburgh. Not I do that up How do I like it? As you read this, I'm sure you want to know what you want. <br /> <br /> Good: This movie is not bad that you believe. Oh i'm not going to quote sugar. This movie was so much feasible and ended as a disaster, but there are some positive issues in it. Cooler cenobites start as shoes and giant Angelique at this time, almost for the near. Pinhead is still a major role, and still has good lines ("Pain has a face, it allows you to show up") and it somewhat across the whole of entertainment. Gorehounds will love the movie because it supplies endlessly. Although there is some consistency with the rest of the series, you will see it hard to see. Chatterrer dogs are extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Bad: But for the story of Hell, the enemy's blood line of bloody enemies that could close the gateway forever, it was really complex and was bundled with tube tapes. Nothing was completely exposed to it's full potential and some really stupid things were included. Pink kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! Random death levels show more blood (not always bad things, but not for stories). Pinhad is his worst here, he's rants and rants and rants even when he's dying! For the very smart monster he was not, he was not reduced to Bond Villeen. Hellraiser fans needed a reason why he had moved into a camio like a role, this is it. Bloody ruins it for us all. <br /> <br /> Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin ripping, drilling, impaling hooks, beheadings, and more accessories. Chatterer dogs, while terrifying, reeks bad effects during the Chase scene. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: This movie was something great, even the Hellbound levels were even possible prospects. But all that wasted was Who knows who went down to produce this salary, but we can only blame Allan Smith. <br /> <br /> compared to the rest: This movie is the worst of the series. Just for the completists. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1/2 * of *****
