The film is committed at the beginning. When Jean-Paullet (Ana Mogulisis) was born, he heard the story of the day that he had increased the likelihood of being the daughter of a famous pianist Andrey Polsky (Jackson Dutton), whether or not he was set to find out whether it is true, and that he is also a piano Provide true that there is not a remote idea. Jane and Andrea and his wife "Mica" Müller (Isabel Huppert) and their son and they met with him that there is some secret in this family. <br /> <br /> OK. We've seen it before and it's done more interestingly here. The character of "Mika" Müller has left us out of understanding the purpose of her work and she is not very attractive enough to care for her. Piano scenes look fake and do not add anything to the full piano sub-plot characteristic, but it allows the film to be made more than ever before. <br /> <br /> <br /> Too frustrating from Chabrol, who can do better than this
