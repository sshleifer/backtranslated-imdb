This is an incredibly western western, which features characteristics of some bad acting, dull storytelling and stupid actions. <br /> <br /> How incredible this film can be. It features all the usual clich√©s, yes even a bar war and the movie really does not have any surprise in it. It creates a neutral and weaker Western clock, it's not at least because it's too bad. <br /> <br /> This is probably a small production and it looks like a movie within 30 days. Instructions and edits can be called bad and all the actions of the movie's featured performances are incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This is a beautiful friendly western (not so blood), for some strange reason everyone seems to be against younger brothers, who are being portrayed as a good and friendly person in this movie. The story gets sillier and sillier as it heads towards its end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Young gang, among which were the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Actually they were not friendly in real life as portrayed in this film. In 40 minutes it was custom only for the people of choice characters. In fact, the true main characters of the Spaghetti-Western era did not really become corrupt criminals. Incredibly enough that the Chief VC has been contacted over the early western side, which is the main character in the right side of the law. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie original is actually shot. Color. It's a unique part of the '40's western and still gives the movie something extra. You wonder, why they are this western full color shot. The film is still black and white in the western western style of early west and I believe that if this movie was done instead of black and white it was more credible. <br /> <br /> You could easily do this without the west. <br /> <br /> 4/10
