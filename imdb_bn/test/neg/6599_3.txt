This movie I have seen in many biopic TV movies: formula, excessive, bad work, and most important, is happening very soon. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> . This probably made a great end of this doku-drama. However, this movie has bitten even more than it can chew, increasingly expanding in this extra ambitious project. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film tried to say too much within three hours, and it was not necessary to say, it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex could play Alexander Jackson, but he preferred more like the SNL character, Tim Meadows and Emmy Poehler. Find out that it would be very difficult to find a person without having to meet Jackson properly with Pop King and study the mad methods. In a shoe budget, however, only people depend on what they see in tablets and those who do not give the correct presentation correctly. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the director's attempts to convince the director to look like Jackson are completely stupid. Caucasian makeup on Alexander's face shows him as an opposite minister's show, and everyone in the grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander. It is also amazing to me that Jackson is taking Jackson under the knife for cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene Alexander has the same size nose. This kind of suspension of discontent that the 21st century directors could not expect from TV viewers. <br /> <br /> When it was really Michael Jackson's footage, it was even more confusing when a child in a balcony in Germany) was actually scattered throughout the film. It was a great try, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> If this movie is released in theaters then it will only benefit from its benefit. It's even a pen compared to "Mommie Dearest", and that's saying a lot. Above all, this is a film that was probably made, like most TV movies do not have on HBO. If it is said about one aspect of Jackson's life, it may have been better. Even if the child's complaints of sexual abuse are covered, it probably would have been better and even more curious.
