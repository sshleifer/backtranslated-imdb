Seriously, if you want to watch a cliche horror movie then you have to guess this one to see. It includes "the horrible part where nothing happens", "the type of non-living who actually do not die", "the boy and the girl are coming together and living", "face the old child-fear" etc. I can go. I wanted to watch this movie because I saw a video game mix and a movie would work. I guess I was wrong. Which makes the movie more bearable? It's only 1 hour and 17 minutes so if you're bored it might be a good idea though I'm rather annoyed. Why not see it? Frankie Monitors Ukil Malcolm is just as annoying as annoying. I can push the man and it is very sad that he did not die before and he was finally back. See something else!
