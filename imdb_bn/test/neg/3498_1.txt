This movie was PC, expected and closed. I could not imagine a movie that is about Hollywood's mysterious, brutal campaign. If you do not see it, do not bother watching it. If you have, show some courage and tell the people what is really awful. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the underlying and inaccessible racist message of the film. There is nothing to do with the real world in this film and if there is anything, then there will be a discussion on racism in this country. Instead, it is a cheap, exciting cone that is promoted as a deep and challenging thought. What kind of bubble do you live on this all looks fabulous?
