This movie was so bad acting. Jeff Bridges, what was with awesome and incredible. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The script was in hair. While traveling from Jeff Bridges to a heroine on her lover's grave ... are you kidding me? After disposing of his lawn body, how convenient Jeff is to bring home his dirty swollen. Do not believe these people just call the police? Okay ... why am I going into the car? Duh! Why was the bride's daughter involved in relation to her father, is her soil bad or just empty? I did not see the original, seeing this movie would be difficult to prepare myself.
