This is the only piece of garbage I've ever disliked sitting. The story was embarrassing, the graphics were horrific, and the acting ... I have never seen bad acting throughout my life. A kindergarten class can come with a scarier, good writing, and more entertaining ideas than this. Anyone who spoils their time in this film, as well as those who do not agree to work. It is clear that they were not given the right direction. The authors must have spent their time in film school playing Piccolo playing "back room". Many professors waste a lot of time during these two times. I really knew that I recognized them.
