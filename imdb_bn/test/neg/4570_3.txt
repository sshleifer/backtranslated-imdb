Andrew Grauband's "Cheats" is his fantasy "true story", which is the four high school friends who run fraud in the exams. The fourth is the challenging school: the hateful school hate Trevor Fleman (as Handsome Davis), his similarly handsome face is Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), his cruel school-heating kisses Ellen Henson (like Sammy), and the hypocrite Martin Star (Appleby As)). Adults include High Level North Points, Chief Mary Tyler Moore (as Mrs. Stark) and pornography-loving father Grafin Dunne (as Mrs. Davis). High jeans Mr. Fehmerman and Mr. Laurence starts with a teacher's grade book. Keep this one below the heap; And, be grateful that it does not go on to a permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gerland ~ Trevor Flemingman, Matthew Lawrence, Ellen Henson
