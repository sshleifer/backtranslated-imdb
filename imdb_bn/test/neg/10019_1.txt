It's really, too damaging, sometimes the worst slash movie ever made. I know, in the 80's, a trend was started on "Friday 13th". "Pre" copies the eastern film in many ways. Wooden setting, killer, fools thirteen, Gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But you can expect as bad as "love". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The situation is rather annoying and lacking, gore, violence etc. It just does not work for a slasher flick. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply horrible. Score awesome! The combination of annoying instruments with the tunes of Chess 80 ?! I do not mention the technical aspects of the film because I believe, it seems that it costs only $ 20. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and something to say about that. Thank God that it seems to have disappeared from the world.
