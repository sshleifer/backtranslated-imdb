This seventh (yes you read right - seventh) puppet master movie shows how dolls will be demented groups; One French puppet who used to take revenge on a group of ancient Mummies, once knew that he kept secret information about life. Before he died, taught him by a magician. He used this power to bring the normal puppet back to life. This signal is largely meaningless, like most pop-up master signals are torn off. Due to the rating of PG13, we do not kill any recreational dolls. Come to think of it, no dust dolls are killed. If a franchise was cut that was needed to cut it would be one. No more ... God, please do not do anything else ...
