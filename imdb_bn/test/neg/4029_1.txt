It was a painful film that I had no idea how it got to takbir, they gave importance to keeping the movie store there! If you are not on some serious heavy medicines, the story does not give any idea at all, you must do something to look for this whole piece of garbage so that you do not care about what you're going to do on TV, almost a coma. Writing like the 5 year old is far better than listeners and acting grade school plays. They were so stupid that they were trying to make a great impact, it seems like they spent the whole $ 5 to create the whole movie! Oh my, that scene is an old man with 80 hairstyles and ugly girls in the rubber case, my friends and my friends are so lively Did anyone really think that it was a good idea to be made in a movie? I found it hard to believe!
