Ripper's hand <br /> <br /> Addendum ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwinian doctor (Eric Porter) Jack using the new Fundamental Friedian analysis <br /> <br /> Hammer is awful, in which a picture of a respected society is not attracted to a beautiful young Wife scam, even if it is a young girl who is the daughter of The Reaper ... When he kills everyone and runs through various types of lethal surgery (broken mirrors, hat-pin etc)! L.W. Davidson's Scrappletty breaks the lethal theorem (obvious attraction at Porter's touch) on behalf of commercial carnage, moves from one murder to another without aimlessly, and the voice revolves around life. Some of Hammer's grave scenes are surprisingly brilliant, and these were clipped from the original US release (despite rating from the MPAA to R rating), although the full version is now available in home video. Porter and Reis give excellent performance and the final measurement of St. Paul's Cathedral is a specific highlight, but the rest of the pictures are strange and inefficient.
