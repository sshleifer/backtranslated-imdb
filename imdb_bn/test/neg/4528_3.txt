One of the greatest artists of television, Peter Segal, made a giant, another tragic attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash. In the context of the context, if anyone does not see Bruce's work, then the film will be a big budget film, which is not sure whether it wants to be a fickle joke and a stupid comedy or just a simple action film that does not go forward. However, a young generation Yayer, who recently spent over two months in the 60-minute TV show Gate Smart's five seasons, was disturbed by the moment that I entered the movie and Steve Carroll was trying to ruin the part. Backstories, agents received 99 plastic surgery and 86 years ago as analysts who were previously mortified, forced complications across the roots and made a flat boring re-evaluation of them. It seems that the screenlines can not be really fun in both dialogue and situation, Don Adams sets the set of lamels for famous lines, fat camps flashbacks, interview styles of camera parts in camera corners, and a women's championism lying flat on their face. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the author of this movie thinks they will include some memories. They mention the doors and phones introduced by Herbie, Fung (now a great dog of the Carroll Coves), shoe phone, silence cone, and its classic red car and the show. Classic music is back, but now everything is updated, usually for the worse. Silence cone is now some strange blue teleconnectic ball field, the control headquarters is right under a museum that saves the past of control. The film does not have any creative random tech technology and it replaces it with the Swiss Army knives. Most of the "comedians" of the film hit Kell himself, or hit another character, although Carroll spent two minutes in an accidentally shooting himself with Crossover, or interrupted by security guards, or hurled into airplanes. Basically, the smart one will insult a big enemy, attack him without any success, and try to befriend him before being polvored. This one, he gets attacked and pummeled without success. It seems that screenwriters do not realize that humor was established with dialogue and not in vain violence. They can take names from the show and spend all that they create in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides the head of the carrier's hathway. Likewise, the movie is far from anything that can make it better. They distinguish classic music with over-dramatic steps and romantic music in large budget films. Although the original camp is felt, it replaces the quality of the huge dose and pound sound effects of the signal explosion. I was really looking forward to it, I just finished the original series just two months ago, and it's ranked at the top five of all times. However, this was a big disappointment. Credit says they cooperated with Mail Brooks and Bak Henry, but what I read on the Internet, they are mostly excluded from the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to cash in on your money with less money and do not respect its name, go for it. But do not get ready to think about this journey. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush's laughter. They refer to "Nukulora", working in the fine industry, working for the president's vice president, and solving the problem of real problems. If you heard the same joke 3-4 years ago in the form of big budget movies, here's your money chuck.
