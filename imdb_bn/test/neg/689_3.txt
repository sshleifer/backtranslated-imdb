This movie Gangster clich√©s is a cinematic collage. The text is manufactured without grade j and plot and story care or argument. It is a dirty pastiche of stereotyptic gangsters (think of dirty bunny cartoons) and fool-proof characters (Lady Doctor and Writer) There are a lot of good bogart films. In fact, Bogart looks like he slept through this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think that the directory advice he received was "he is a bad guy." This man is equal to the era of the dar warder; Clear, evil and anti hero. Do not waste your time with this one.
