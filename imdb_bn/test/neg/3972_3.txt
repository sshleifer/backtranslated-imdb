Graves are a clone of the brothers. After a debate about what to do with him and his evidence, he returned the benefit of finding his girlfriend (which was more foolish, innocent and ready to host talk shows according to the SOL crew.) Since the beginning of the film, he has been captured like a Nazi-build Rated friend and entered the cold storage. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a collision in Graves' brother's house resulted in many deaths, including the grave. Reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. It seems that the conspirators have won a bit ... <br /> <br /> Then Peter Graves is able to survive running with a metal poker by the miracle of clone parts, and a 'vote' <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
