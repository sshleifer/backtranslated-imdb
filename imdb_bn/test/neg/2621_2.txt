The retro puppet master started in 1944 in Kalevig, where puppet master Andr√©e Tolen (Guy Rollolf) and his living puppet plans to flee to Germany, an in-doll master master remembers Toulon his early life and the point where he learned the secrets of donating in 1902 In Paris his dead spirit (Greg Sesiro) ran to the Thiet Magique, returning the life of dead objects. She has served the last love of Afzal (Jack Dannar), a 3000-year-old Egyptian magician and young woman and beautiful Illasar (Brigata Dawe). He told the story of how Afzal had sent his life gift and gave his life as a part of the theater magician's own wooden doll. But the gift of life was a curse, like the ancient God, whose secret secret was stolen from Afzal's first place and those who have learned it all died ... <br /> <br /> I became the first Poppet Master Bandar, the first three big fans As I have decided to see the remaining part of the franchise and as I have seen, Puppet Master 4 (1993), Popet Master 5: The Final Chapata (1) 1994), The Pop Master's Curse (1998) and Master of the retro-pop pet a couple of weeks and his place was hard to get through them, especially in this series, it's worse than that. The retro doll master thinks like a cross between the puppet master III: The final chapter with the setting of the Toulon Revenge (1991) and the attempt to kill everyone involved in stealing everyone involved in the eventual life: Puppet Master 4 and Pop Master Master 5: The Final Chapter. There is no further consistency here, and there is no green serum displayed in the previous films and in the year 1939, at the beginning of the original original original puppetmaster (1989), he looked alive and well in 1944. Most of the story is considered as flashback, and Andrey Tollen is concentrating instead of dolls, the film focuses on its relationship with Hilsa and is aware of the secret education of her life, and it is honest and hard working. Even in 80 odd minutes the retro pipette master is long and padded with no real speed and there is no central idea because the plots never stabilize and are often hopping. Then, of course, the incredible dolls are completely annoying to rebuild, I mean, why would the makers take such a basic thing that the pupil master makes movies so memorable and complete it? Dolls can be seen briefly at the beginning and at the end, otherwise we see these garbage wood characters which are not as quiet as their modern reconstruction. It is never explained why these dolls are used more than these dolls. All puppet masters love, although one suspect that the full moon is still hoping to make another signal to deal with this same question. <br /> <br /> A bad story and a complete lack of our favorite dolls was not bad enough. The full moon decided to leave it for PG-13 rating. For this, Retro Pop Master Master is the only Popet Master film that has not rated 'A' in the US. They have their own movie ratings system) and so there is not a drop of blood in the whole film, dolls do not kill anyone, there is no oath and no nudity. These kids are tamer than stuff in all ways. There are no special effects series post in addition to the garbage itself, there is no stop motion animation, there is no CGI computer effect (certainly the 1999 CGI was cheap enough?) And all impact rigorous rod doll type effects I think that whenever you see the walking of the pupil, the camera is always above the waist so that its legs are not shown, and perhaps some production assistant is pushing the thing, which is complex and has special effects like industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently doubled in Romania for the last century in Paris which impressed Bucharest in Romania. Acting here is terrible and probably the worst in the series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first seven films and it is an excellent way to stop the series, which is three extraordinary And separate small killer dolls started so well with the flip. Do not be bothered by this, just look at one of the first three and remember only the best times ... the killer puppets will return to the terrific spin of Flick Poppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
