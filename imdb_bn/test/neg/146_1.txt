Exceptional stupid workers with Brandinde in a story that fits SpiderMan's filling issue. Action sequences do not really flow as they should, leaving some cool bits and orphans in the ocean of anger, which is not meant to be understood. I really wonder how they got this one from the west. Sam Lee craves like crazy, new comer Edison Chan does not yet display the acting talent. The robot is not violent and very impressive, and CGI effects (though done by US SFX-people) are ridiculous, destroying the remaining suspension of complete disbelief. I'm not looking for Jen-Z police ...
