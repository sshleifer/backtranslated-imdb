This movie was so awkward, so annoying, so badly custom made - it did a lot of work to create what should be sure of such a mockery. I love to play Lucile, but he stunts perfectly in this movie. Very old, could not sing, sing, even when a truck sounded like a dumping tombs - and all the biggest sins - he was not drunk. Even little. The studio shot herself with her legs and to destroy the wonderful screen version of an enjoyable stage musical instrument, some other body parts could be injured as well - or perhaps they were already lacking in those parts. That can explain it. But Lucy began to think that she was right for a part of the throne that needed - well, it's all the sadest thing. It's a very good thing to know about your limitations. Even a legend can not come from a stinker like this and still smell like a rose.
