A holiday in a boat, a married couple, a rug waiter and a ship breaking because this movie started. <br /> <br /> I like boobs. Any questions about that But when it is the friendship of the main character with the highest fish at the moment, in most cases they have sexual intercourse and continue to play the role of hunting, my anger goes only to a completely new level. Take two boys (a husband and another man), place a pure bomber in the middle of them, advertise on a secluded island, reducing all his moral problems, give a whole bunch of moral issues to men and mix it in a big bowl, arguments and fish A gimp lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. <br /> <br /> Acting, I would say, well. There are some bloopers but as far as I can see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to its lack of moral standards. People with the most fish get their attention. Although one of them is her husband, she does not see any problem betraying the manual because "I have to do this for survival". How can your husband be 30 feet away when you justify having sex with other people for fish? And what will he gain? There is absolutely no problem for justifying the woman's character. If he does not get approved for his action, he is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is a kind of movie that you can create just about anything else to see a great movie experience this year.
