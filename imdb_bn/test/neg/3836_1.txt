The worst movie I've ever seen I still do not understand what Dennis Hooper and Michael Madison want to do. Maybe their money was billed ... The best and civilized part comes in a flashback that brings us WWII time when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. That's the beginning of a common serial killer life! It appears that in the early 80's it will appear but then a new bitlot will appear ... amazing! This movie was directed in 2001 ... I am sure that the film took less than two weeks. I heard that Dennis Hooper's wife wanted to see her picture and asked Michael Maderson to face the heart of the soil when the actor was admitted as a man under the Yellow Baseball Hat. Poor!
