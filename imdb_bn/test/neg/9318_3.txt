Okay, last night I saw Paul Scraper's World Expeditionary of Exorcist: At the beginning of The Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. It was highly anticipated with all tensions around the film. <br /> <br /> The director was there, and then most stars (except Skkgor). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie is big time spent. This was a real disappointment for me because I had a huge fan of Sharada and Fredkin's original (RIP) 1973 film. What was wrong with <br /> <br />? It's actually the most. FX (You think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly transformed!), Editing (no real motion or rhythm), acting (only the squareguards can sometimes believe). The script was set up to interpret the African scene, an IMO, original movie. So the movie was feeling a set-up scene, it only contributed nothing. <br /> <br /> What I liked was the foundation Strawar's cinematography, though I saw it better than it (now Apolletipus). <Br> <br /> The time I was thinking was roughly cut, a work progress. And that's probably what's given (well-known) scenarios. But that does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to meet Scrder (very briefly) but I did not have the courage to say what I had to say about this movie. I was very nervous (this guy who wrote a taxi driver for Christ !!) that I forgot to ask to copy the copy of his taxi driver's script !!
