This movie is cash in. Depending on a cash theme tune made for the previous classic. Yul Brynner jumped long ships and so have most of the production standards. Lee Van Cliffs plays the main role of Chris. Compared to Van Cliffer, I can not think of a low-acting actor like Brenner. Hey, he could have cut his hair at least and only lost his mood for success. Some corrective centers show this movie to punish criminals. Line one step and Magnificent Seven Ride! The front is brought and protected. They are not trying to make this movie look like a TV movie! Bottomless.
