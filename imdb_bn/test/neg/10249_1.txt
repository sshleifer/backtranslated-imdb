... if you take out the sex and leave bad conversation, cheap sets and bad acting, then how will a porn movie look like, you will have a galaxy. <br /> <br /> If this picture is real, then Star Wars has proved that there was a market for science fiction. This instead be some gems such as the alien and a revitalized star trekk. Unfortunately, it was also directed towards some bad movies and it was probably one of them. (I say clearly, because I did not even hear this picture a few days ago. I missed it after I got out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> The underlying problem here is. Dorothy Stratton could not act, so for most movies, they even did not let him try. I understand his tragic death gave the film a state of unwanted culture, but I do not understand why for my life <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film tried to spell Star Wars, Star Trek and Alliance, but they clearly understand No, when you make a mistake, it will be frustrating! This movie, or at least, was not funny at the time of comedy during the curiosity. Science fiction is ripe for parody as spacetime and galaxy quests are proven. This movie, though, did it badly.
