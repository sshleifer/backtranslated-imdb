For those who can send me a messy e-mail, run it for them. There is a trend in Hollywood that produces very playful movies that are integral to criticism. Garden States tend to be one of those cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, the jazz band, rather than the sitcom star, surprises people with some genius behind the camera, but this is not a compliment that does not guarantee that a film like this is being taken. The stories are often rendered by many thin and shallow, no real insight. People compared this film to the graduates, but such people tried to overload independent movies. Indie films are subject to the same hits and miss mentality, which generally hit studio movies, but people forgot a lot more bad indie movies than they forgot well. The Garden State is not oppressive, but it is not great. <br /> <br /> First, the film is very fast, which resulted in the rapid restoration of large scale in its former life. Ten years later, people continue to act in such a way that he never gave up. Where's the oddity? Of course, the situation is quickly resolved by the drug dragon scene (which I say is properly illustrated). This image seems to represent many mental inequalities, this idea seems to be deeper and better in our mind. However, it failed to reach those fronts, because our decisions and moments were quickly resolved, we wonder why (like Peter Sargfeld's grave trends) surprise us. It was not completely unrealistic, but maybe we should stop praising such a movie.
