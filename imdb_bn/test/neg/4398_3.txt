Jeez, when I heard this movie national lump, I thought it was going to be great, but I really said it was the reason for frustration. From the Christmas holidays, they watched most of the movies from Van Walders, and this movie is their worst movie, really bad actors and an intense film. This movie is probably good to see, if you see it with the crowd of people who have made it and laugh at it, but if you are like a good comedy then I do not recommend this movie, I would watch Van Bunny twice the second or third time, watch this movie You've been warned ...
