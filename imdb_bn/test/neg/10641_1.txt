It is true, someone really expect something from the sequels. But this is a terrible movie even with low standards. <br /> <br /> Originally a mythological film, The Fourth Saga of Hellraiser Saga tried the same as the original series and the entire series as an air-up. Time. An aspiring idea. But they do not have enough screen time to do any work with any character, and the interested manager leaves the film instead of drug into Yahoo's studio. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even has the problem of protecting fanboys. Unless you have an "Allan Smithhee" fan, avoid this one.
