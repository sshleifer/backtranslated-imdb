For me, it just does not seem like JI Joe. When I saw it as a kid, I just did not care about it. Actually I had the credit opening opening in the best choice about this one. They changed almost many incidents and introduced stories as well. The Cobra commander is frozen in the cracks of reptiles or elsewhere in Andorchica. Although I always believed that he was a normal person when you saw his eyes in the series, he seemed to be surrounded by a flesh of normal color and blue was not his face here. There is just too much rage to try and create this spectacular movie, but what I saw in the first place for me is only destroyed.
