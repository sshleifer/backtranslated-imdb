If you've ever heard of this, "The book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to this rule. I believe the description of the film novel was very easy for me because I read the book with my English class aloud. We discussed great detail in each paragraph so I grasped the idea fast quickly. I did not understand the plot while watching the movie. Because there was no discussion in the class, but I think this is also why I could not paint my own picture about the events of the novel. If you are a well-known person who believes in that well-known story, look at the heart of the dark movie from your to-do list.
