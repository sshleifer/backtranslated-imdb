Consider the most non-movie-related topics that you can do and it's 10 times worse. A woman must fulfill as many cross-word casts as a day. We can not see the questions and remember our own, we only see his struggle. The woman is so worried and seems early to the crossword, but for some reason she could spend time walking errands across the city when she could focus on the house. Terrible acting, actress huffs and puffs as she tries to think of the word, and we have left the darkness completely. The scenery in New York is beautiful but the movie rely heavily and it gets old quick. The movie plays like a rejected NYU student film. This picture has no freedom fighters and I never recommend it to anyone.
