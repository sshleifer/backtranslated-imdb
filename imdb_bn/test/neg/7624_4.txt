After the success of a nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wesce Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be the TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director; The first exposure to the blooming side of the left side and his modern slasher scram may sit well with me, but the rest of his work is very hits and miss and I do not hesitate to call him a master that others have labeled him. The original theme here is Citizen's Freezing, although it is a more springboard for the plot than an important part of the movie. The original effect here is clearly amazing in the 1974 Jambi film Deathdream and we focus on Miles Criton; A trader has been frozen for 10 years before the accident, which means he has to get immediate reduction. Miles is a part of a project for the sick people; In the future, when they can cure their illness they give up frozen hope. Miles have been successfully revived and it can be seen as a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not a frozen person, just as the miles return without spirit. <br /> <br /> This picture was quite decent, it was judged by the idea behind it, but instead we have been given a plot that does not have much to do with it and it should be said that Craven does not achieve the best from the film's feasibility. 'Spirit' is the main focal point, but it seems that there is no soul and only one killer's purpose / no sympathy is the same thing, which seems somewhat unusual. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly nasty and it is clear that it does not cost much money because the whole production seems to be very cheap. Michael Beck has never been a very popular actor, and his performance here is not surprisingly triumphant; When he is portable, he basically lacks charisma and the central role is not weak. This plot does not fluctuate very badly, but there is a real lack of authenticity and / or tension, and things are too slow, which makes the film boring at times. It all boils down to an expected end. Overall, I must admit that I was not influenced by this movie and as long as the Cravan Filmmakers go away, Miss Chilar will miss with Shocker, Scrum Seagels and The Hills Hei II II.
