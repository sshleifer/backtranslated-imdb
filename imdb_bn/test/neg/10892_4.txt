If there are horror films, "Stest Stop" can be good in many levels. Director / author John Shinin shows that perhaps when he started it, his best intentions were. Unfortunately, he was not sure what to do with the material, or perhaps he was under pressure from studio or Baxter to supply a different film than he wanted. A lot of DVDs have been completed, but unfortunately, the selection for the last product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The concept of Sycho Roaming on the back streets of a remote part of California is one of the very first possibilities. After Jesse's disappearance in the wonderful rest, things came out of hand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jess has desecrated the neglected penis and makes them dirty in the neck of the wood, which is not well appreciated by the negative. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk. There is a lot of pride for this continuation.
