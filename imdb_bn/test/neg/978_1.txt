I saw "Deadly voice" because it was after David Sauchat enjoyed his "Pirot" series. And Jobs Acland is always worth watching, so I went to the movie with the expectation of it as a potentially suitable movie. Well, it was not. <br /> <br /> I will not be disturbed for criticizing the performance of the film, panning, cinematography or any other structural aspect; Here others have already given their opinions to those elements. The only thing that I want to deal with is the film's message, because it is based on a real story that in this article declares that the hanging of the film's supposed importance <br /> <br /> "Fatal Voices" is primarily a poor black African people named Kingsley who wants to go to the US because he believes that he can earn money there. Nothing, nothing less - his motivation is completely selfish. (Certainly some people would say that he did this for his family, but he actually decided to take children to earn children in Ghana, so he really made his problem.) As a result, Kingley would make a ruthless decision in the stream of Russian freight ships bound in New York. While doing this, he faces tough situations, racist crew members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But this image has disgraced me. Why should visitors expect to care about Kingsley? Just because there is a goal? Goals are not rare products that should achieve the goal of the woman whose house has gone with that privilege, captain of the ship or his newborn child. King's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government! It is illegal that it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it in the US, it will be involved in a system that he has not kept. And if he is caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I am very much concerned that any stove will take care of the activity selected for any other activity. They are clearly out just for their own profits. At the beginning of the film, he spent $ 1000 for the legal succession of US Dollars and applied for accommodation and work permit. Instead, he took the illegal (and dangerous) route. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the journey to Kinsale can not be invalid, selfish and morally reasonable, why should we be concerned about his or her generosity? Just because he faces the challenge? Why should challenges should be given to the challenge of going to New York without challenge from Russia's shipping company? Because he's black and white shipping company? Because Danny Glover (film executive producer) and others seem to be involved because he wants to root for Kingsley, as if he becomes the hero of any kind of great journey. But once you are not eligible for illegal immigration, theft and stupid mission you can not really take care of him. <br /> <br /> If someone plays a race card before, I assure you that I want the ethnicity / nationality of the parties involved do the same thing. Imagine that a British man decided to move to a train under Bhutan, collecting "unwanted" Buddhist myths to return to Britain to tear and sell across the border. How sympathetic was the challenge that he faced? Very small, I bet. So why should we think differently for kingly? Because he's black? Because he is poor by American standards? The filmmakers have shared our opinions that the final finances prove justified and a shipping company fined $ 45,000 is overwhelming compared to the unlikely prospects of uneducated workers. Stay in my own home. I do not buy it for a minute.
