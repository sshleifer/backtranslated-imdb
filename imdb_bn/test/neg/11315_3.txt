Jackie Chan's Super Kopp Director Stanley Tong, Bronze Rumble and What Do You Get? You will find a series of Kung Fu war and a series of lack of madness-like madness. <br /> <br /> The limited plot Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put an international plot, where he stole a world famous gem. Of course there is no idea what he's doing. Actually, he had no idea that his gem was there. <br /> <br /> You will be very annoyed to see it within thirty minutes. There are some funny moments when he's cooking chicken. You will be as close to Magoo as you wish. It's a fun movie to watch but most of its disaster! You have to love Leslie Nilson because she had some fun pictures. This is not his best, but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a fun film, and because it should be recommended for children's kids, they would probably think it would be too funny.
