A good idea given below by heavy hand production. <br /> <br /> Because of the sound level of music / background, there was quite a stranglehold of dialogue, and it did not help this critic. Not to pronounce wells, at times quite impenetrable. In the end, I lost the desire to continue trying to follow the conversation. <br /> <br /> This movie does not know which French or black comedy can be - and they need different methods. Some events of this incident were so thick that they only made a cry, some were so incredible for such a plot that they would not fix the story. <br /> <br /> The acting was good at the time - although the Americans came back as a clone of the mad scientist "back in the future". Little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I have seen everything but God knows why: I can not remember being laughing once.
