Tarantino should be ashamed to be involved with this terrible film. All the third rate of acting, direction and script - to get playing like an excuse for the entire movie writer / director / star Larry Bishop. Perhaps it is probably made due to its cooperation with the QT. The film's plot is quite brilliant, and in vain references to the older B-movies, and some like David Carradine, Dennis Hooper and Vini Jones try to survive in Kymo. Everyone is vulnerable to their performance, especially Hooper who is currently in full-time profits in his career. Savings grace, if there are, but the script is so ridiculous that it can be entertaining. The bishop tries so much harder to get that trademark Tarantino banter and just fails unfortunate, at which time there may be quite ridiculous and grating at others. If you like bad movies or if you really are in a biker movie then I'll just check it out.
