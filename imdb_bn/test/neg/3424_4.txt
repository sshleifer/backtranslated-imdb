Macbeth's story was one of the most successful Shakespeare writings. This may be due to some of the features that are slash, murder, murder, murder, murder, blood gallons, sexual relations between main characters etc. Even more than that, the original game is very interesting considering it (just half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth, for which we are limited to care despite its bloody nature. The game will feel like the base of a movie. It is not so long that it gives the director an opportunity to explore many levels, a good actor can play his lifetime, this film has a deeper meaning in any historical age. Unfortunately this has not been the case with Macbeth. The Polish version comes very close, but it is very important in medieval times. Welles's film is very personal, with an interesting turn towards overallitarianism, 1990 or so TV version is very shallow. This is no exception to the 2006 movie. It is far from Shakespeare's film, but it is interesting to see how the director understands the story and keeps it in contemporary life. Nightmares in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars. Many drugs and tripe music replace the night's fear in the main play. Macbeth's idea is so simple that it does not require Shakespeare to apply it in modern day life and to plant it. The worst part of the film is the line. The most harmful scenes in the game, such as Dagar's view, are pruned so much that they seem stupid. The knockout looks like fun at the door of the doors and horses with cars. If they want to create a movie about power and its temptation, they could do it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth, a brave warrior who wants to be brave and ambitious, who does not seem frustrated with brain injury, is ready to kill and fears and frustration. The film does not allow Lady Macbeth to be madness, it does not give any reason why some characters fear Macbeth and his "terrorism" (because there is no hereditary rise in throne, no throne and all) and it keeps Macbeth in a painful position, since the leadership of a gang So far this whole film is far from Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two strong ideas that will not match the complete filling of this movie which is ultimately in vain ... Do not stand on your order but go!
