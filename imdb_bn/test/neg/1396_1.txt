I have not seen this event for a few months, but for a little while I was forced to see it every day because I liked the roommate which I liked. So maybe this has always been a major development, although IMDB ads and 4.2 ratings are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was very quick replacement for the Chapel show. Even Mensia also said so. And when I was not even a big fan of Chappell's watch, his joke was at least basic and clever (and was far away from Menscik). Mencia's joke is completely irrational and barbarous. If you can not see it, I think there is no hope for you. But to be justified, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> - Mensia Chapel's Lille Blown John Skit Slowly. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" creates an episode about the scientist. A week later, in Mensia, he has a joke about how objectionable he is to scientists. Remember that joke is not about scientist, but how much he has offended his show. Until this point, he never made a solo scientist joke. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP pictures go around the Internet where a black guy "Looting" groceries and white ladies show "Find them out". After WEEKS, after millions of people already seen it, Mensia presented it as its show as it was present and it was shown for the first time (there was something like that in a day in the daily show). More brutal than Joke theft, Carlos preached himself and his show, he said that he is breaking any kind of PC blockage (whatever) and if you smile You can not manage any joke about the nation who will be a weak preude. Yes, Carlos, because you are not funny, because we're all laughing laughing (if really true, why is Chapel show so popular?). If he does not get enough smiles, he repeatedly reminds his audience of "not always getting it" and often repeats and reveals his trick, a strategy that closes most of the comedians who are under 14 years of age. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that Mencia does not seem very intelligent. It is a tragedy that there is a lot of fun, more intriguing curiosity where this guy is trying to make it while earning money. His show has been given the third highest rating of the comedy center, which is boring (again, it's 4.2 ratings on this site). Where did they get this number ?? Comedy Central tries to bilize itself as a "pure" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the least audience, it will never happen.
