Again, this kind of zero budget digital video cam trash. And again I was trapped in the headline titled "Zumbi" (German title: Jimmy Attack!) Story: Some people visit Halloween "The Museum of the Dead", it is a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill people, everything is in aztec-religion Attached. So they fight against some zombies there. <br /> <br /> Very cheap scenery: some aisles with black tap. As a few dilettantish drawings and few skulls you can find each of them fun stores. No actor, just about any idea of ​​the low grade model, almost revolving around. There is no effect. The ridiculous make-up, your local hobby-make-up will make it even better, for some time it seems that there was not enough money for enough color, otherwise they could not fix it, people, they have their "zombies" Understand the appearance of it Some ridiculous martial arts zombies, fights with slow-motion. OK, when the director wants to scare it, he uses some digital-video-cam effects where everything is fine. Incredible! 10 out of 0!
