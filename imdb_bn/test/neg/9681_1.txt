This image is a completely wrong image of Noah's true story. The producers probably did not read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned in the Bible, but film authors gave him "name". This movie happened to ruin Saddam 1000 years ago, and what about Gamaura? Sodom was destroyed at the same time. (Perhaps the producers thought that Gamaura is not to be seen in the story and "Sodom" is a city that you know-which will bring more fright.) This movie is full of abuse and mixing God and the Bible. It is a wonderful thing that true Christians would like to take part in the Bible's subordinate, hateful, rebellious drug product.
