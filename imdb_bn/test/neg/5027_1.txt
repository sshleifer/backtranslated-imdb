Oh man I have seen this series to be the worst anime ever. <br /> <br /> It starts fresh, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yisha was funny and hot-headed <br /> <br />, it became even more enthusiastic because the series was growing ... and I'll tell you why. (Alert: Spylar Alert !!) <br /> <br /> Well, they primarily destroy Inu-Yassar relationship with Kakam, revive his 50-year-old girlfriend who is frustrating, sad, and total waste time <br /> <br /> They introduce a distorted identity called Miroku, which could be a religious personality for the show. (Which really baked me because it was absurd from the place.) Then, they introduced a demon killer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his intelligent brother. <br /> <br> The worst of the show, Naraku, really started as a bad guy, after a while lost his touch. (He got pretty old pretty fast. And it bothered me that he was the only Baddie to hear.) <br /> <br /> All the characters became wooded, and became indifferent. And then, there was a disappointment of an Anime fan at the end of this awesome series. Nothing happened. Naraku has never been killed or defeated. Kakam and Inu-Yasha have never been in love ('because they still love their 50-year-old dog.) Plot holes were open. As the series progressed the animation got bad and bad. And nothing changes the plot. (I mean, they drag it into more than 150 episodes and nothing has changed in the plot ...) and they were expecting me (and as well as other fans of the show)? I was disenchanted, disturbed, and disturbed as a shit. I had at least high expectations that I'd like to be good for the series. Instead, all I got was a drag-out commercial for Manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about the sword and its like stuff, I strongly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". The program that progresses and goes anywhere, plus it has really good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this blood excuse for anime, as much as possible as possible as you can.
