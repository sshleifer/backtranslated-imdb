After watching a movie of my class and talking to the filmmaker, I found exactly why it was bombed on how the image was made. Filmmaker film "8MM 2." There was no desire to call. Originally, this film is called "Wellness's Velvet Side of Hell", but the movie makers have changed into Sony 8 minutes and 2 minutes without any comment on this matter. By doing this, it excludes the theatrical releases and it is devastating to direct video with minimal advertisements. <br /> <br /> Again, it is not me, from the face of the filmmaker, so I can not really tell what the truth is, and what is the hippe? <br /> <br /> If you see the film as "Velvet Side of Hell", it is not bad. It's not great, but it's not horrible to God. It is basically just a B-movie which loves to display boobs. But as a signal in "8mm", the film was seriously unsuccessful.
