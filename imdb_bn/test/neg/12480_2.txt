Lucio Phuli was famous for her Italian splatters, mostly in her candle-making films such as Zumbo or The Bound Here he managed a black comedy, but there is only one problem: its annoying. I would like to know that I'm walking dead city (which is gross but not like this). A compulsory gimmick disrupts ugly romantic and wealthy women, steals their money and steals their money and gets money for their habit. The film makes this plan look that simple. I think women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash. After the murder of nineteenth century, I started to suspect what I heard about Phulchi: she hated women.
