This is total swill. If you accept The Devil's Rejects and suck all its good and add to many thick, weird slavery, some rape scenes and one or two serious scenes of horror and you can get this movie. People say this is a Reporter of 86 Hitachi, but I can not see it. Even the worst hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. Here is the main problem of the show, there is nothing besides a few directors like director cinema. Do you think a girl shot of girls should be scared and tied up, afraid? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I'll only watch a good movie, which is not clear at all. The sad thing, there really is a really good thrill waiting waiting to be open, but only a few. For example, before the onset of slavery began ... If you ask me then it's pretty good And the scene that hits the hemoglobin kill Enmopho girl (can not remember the name) is frustrating, challenging the Devil's rejection for a very cruel, even helpless anger on one side. How can the rest of the movie be that good? is not it? I really need to stop renting stupid shit like this. Closed Messages: Just die this gutter trash and forget it forever. Not recommended.
