The film is rarely horror, the film was just an hour long, and for about 25 minutes of the film it was simply a random snowboarding clip that does not even attach the film. Completing the story "Resume", my 5-year-old cousin might probably write a good script. I do not understand how anyone can finance the production of such a movie ... awesome It's certainly the most shittiest most horrific movie I've ever seen in my entire existence. I think the director of the cast, took some random kids out of the street to act in this movie. The direction, acting, production and writing for this movie are all really bad. I feel bad for the people who waste the meaning of this garbage financing. U can not pay me again to see this bad.
