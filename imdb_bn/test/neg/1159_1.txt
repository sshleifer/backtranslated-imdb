One of the most famous serial killers of all time, Ed Gin was the inspiration for famous movie killers such as Norman Bates, Leatherface and Bepphil Beal. He is one of the most ill and annoying murderers of all time, I saw a documentary on him, so I know his story very well. When I saw it, I was weird because I thought it would be like a documentary rearrangement, but I have to say that it is a desperate waste of time only. First of all, the events were completely wrong, with some minor exceptions, and secondly, the real incident of this horrific murder took place when it was just a stupid Hollywood story and they turned it into a cheap cash. Note that if they were going to create it in a horror movie, it was a bad job! Ed Gin is known as Planefield in a small town in Wisconsin, but he has a secret secret that the whole city is affected by it, digging the dead body and brutally killing people. Bobby is a deputy, in the case of Ed Gene, only no one knows who the killer is at first, after crime scenes, have just found crime scenes. But things become "personal" when Ed Police starts hating police and friends. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was just ridicule and totally insulting. I always thought that bad acting was a necessary tool of a horror, but for this story, not to mention it should be a well-acting film, it was more of a documentary than a stupid clich√©'d horror picture. Please stay away from this movie, it's totally shocking and the story of Ed Gin is untrue. <br /> <br /> 1/10
