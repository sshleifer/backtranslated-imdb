Another movie from the Swedish hill country, which is always the northern part. If black people were shown this way, then good words about racism would be spoken and for good reasons. <br /> <br /> It will make you laugh at a French and "cute" French class. But it's mostly tedious. A gangster comedy with bad Russians (as always) and bad (and stupid) Finns Based on Stockholm's bias, the Norwegian must be the most foolish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not funny. This is not even exciting. Very raw to make a burlesque you no interest in any way.
