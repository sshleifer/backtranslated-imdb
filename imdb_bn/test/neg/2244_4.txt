The first half of this movie was good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. Comic book revenge story came to the whole circle and we saw many comic characters and some poor "good boys" ran out of them. There are many violence in this movie. I'm embarrassed about violence but I think at least one movie should have a purpose. Here, there was little intention of violence without creating a series of films where we see many people immersing themselves with the rifle. We are supposed to be glad by this anyway. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the reserve dog. There was a movie where violence was effectively implemented. It was realistic in the world by creating the film. There was no top-up-top sound effect. This is a criminal film that it played directly. Miracle Basterds should play it straight but not. I was rolling my eyes on how to amaze the eyes and face with extra effects and extra bullets. <br /> <br /> The story behind any Basterds is really explained, they are either simply hunter hunters. We really do not like any of them because they are very busy and shoot people in front. It's all about "revenge" and very little about another. <br /> <br /> There were 2 1/2 hours to work on, but some of Basters's were deeply tested. It just looks like a revenge watch was pure and simple. We have seen that "death proof" in the end of Tarantino's "Death Proof" which I do not care about. It enjoys the same problem. The letters were almost inexpensive. <br /> <br /> The first half was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploitation of Englishgrown Basterds across Europe. I was presented with many Lama's films about the protest movement to protest some of the comic book Nazi revenge when they all went to a movie premiere in France.
