I really hope I've read every review before going to see the movie ... it's one of the most annoying films I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the movie for 5 minutes; I should follow my instinct. The film did not give anything new or cute, it was boring and very cliche. I was surprised that it was driven by a woman! Characters do not represent any woman that I know, they are boring, bitter and beautiful. The film was unreal and depressed and wasted time and money. And the actors looked tired, poor make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to the movie Sex and In City; It was not even half as well. My suggestion, do not watch this movie!
