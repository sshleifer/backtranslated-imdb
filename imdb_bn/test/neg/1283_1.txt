This movie will go down in the history of fiefdom as one of the worst ever. I have ever seen every movie I made because I will never stop saying it's the worst movie. I can not claim such high till then. The story is stagnant, the act is horrible, well, some of the "special" effects are fewer than the LBS. Dry ice and a fan. Someone will be related to someone to create this movie. This is a mail on Mr. Bus! The dog is well-trained and clever, it never creates its only release quality in the movie made. Two hours of my life and $ 3 I will not get back.
