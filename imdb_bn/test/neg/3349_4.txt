I saw this in a cheap DVD release with the title "The NT Force". I enjoyed the Chess 80's horror films because I thought I was for real behavior. Sadly the image is quite annoying and you are constantly waiting to see something happen. It has finally become somewhat interesting, but it is at the end of the film. It's too late a case too little. When the action happens, it is not big, what we found is that the bodies are 'floating' along the ground and chasing the girls in the tomb. It's not the worst I've seen, but you can do a lot better. I'll only recommend it to the stale collectors of the Chess 80's dead body.
