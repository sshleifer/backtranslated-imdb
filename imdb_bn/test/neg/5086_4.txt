** WARNING - This review can have spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is good - young boy is taken by the hoodlum and treated like a lethal pitbull, <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meet with the blind Pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who always wants to be the most confident fool - with his intelligence, Continuous leftist, rather illogical rituals, Victoria (Kerry condon). I was so scared, when I was 18 when Victoria was 18, she found me at 25 - 30 years of age. There is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny again wanders, wounded, what Sam did, but took him home directly. Danny out for 2 days, but does this nit-wits take him to a hospital? Nooooo <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny is not a mentally stable person, this thing has become clear, but Sam takes him to his home, where both are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> I said, Kurt Burte bursts with the bullet which rivals Boni and Clyde's death Shot. We think he died, but no <br /> <br /> <br /> Then we had another car accidents - and again, Ol Barte became illiterate. Besides, our Dano has a half-dozen tough boys fighting at one time, plus the scene where Danny decided that she does not want to fight anymore. I'm not worried about the person I do not want to fight with, when it falls under your wager or you die, I think someone will fight. <br /> <br /> I talked about this title - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundaries of reality that we came to know about. It's not just an act of suspense belief - it's totally out of it. <br /> <br /> I never realized why Danny has become a beautiful lady, but instead the message is said to be busy. Birt and his gang got up and got shot. Maybe it was my fault, the scene came, I was confused about that time - but it seemed impossible, and Bart could ever cross the path. <br /> <br /> 4 of the 10 stars - and that is generous.
