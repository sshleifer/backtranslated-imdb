I have achieved this image a few years ago and have tried to find out some information about it that even the powerful IMDB has not listed it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tie with the rest of the film. Out of the three stories, the only part of any entertainment value I have is the second episode, which is derived from a male's frozen bacteria. This episode points for some points of humor and it has won points for odd proofs. Then there is a conversation car (Bland and Direlessless) and an episode where a girl has an episode with a unique dating agency (my dog ​​guesses this last end) <br /> <br /> Other comments have been mentioned, 18 ratings are completely unnecessary. There is nothing to humiliate here. If you are after a good horror math, then look for asylum or crampo films instead.
