With dialogue in the dubbed version of this movie, I do not think Shakespeare is a big danger. This is an ancient ambiguous Mummy's story which has been denied. His things have been taken and this really ticks him off. She is a gyrating person who is doing it while she is raving the entity. I like two dull people who have found mummies and are determined to destroy the animal. These funny cemeteries, cheap crosses and other junky have all these scenes. A grave where mummy is kept. I can not begin to reproduce this statue, in which a good dog has a sprinkled snake hole (with a door next to it so that he can crawl out) the robot, the mass of a person's metal canine inside Dialogue is awful There are long breaks in lectures, as some people are giving their lines back. I love the scene where two little kids accuse their soil for going out at night (she goes to the zombie state or something). However, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh and do not take it seriously, check it out. First there are a couple beers. Want a direct line from Mummy's tomb, "See this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will be lost." What more can I say?
