I am astonished to read these amazing comments about this movie because I hate it. I stuck it in the end, but it was painful - especially the child heard that voice. Commented as Sokac-1, although the girl wanted to be in Chicago, she was not a Chicago accent - it was more felt that she tried to imitate a New York accent - but it failed as well. I was so confused that I was waiting for the punchline. Why did they choose this among all the wonderful actors of that child actor? And why do you speak like that? It was not even pronounced, it was scripts, made for him alone. Because I will also choose this movie because the plot idea appeals to me - this era of history, the type of characters that are poor and uneducated, setting - and love triangle. As far as I'm concerned it could be and have been much better. I could easily read that at least one other person felt the same way I did about this movie.
