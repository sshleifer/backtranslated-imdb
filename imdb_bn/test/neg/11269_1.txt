"Yagyu Iichizoku no Inbo" (Let's just say "Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere in a terribly annoying and mind-painful painful. As a historical epic, it can have a lot more potential than a rich Saga ... but it is not actually more than a real-story-incident-story story and an ipch-spying Sony, with another cheap 70's action flick. Chiba- Before half the point of this movie, I was tempted to even sepu! Like thousands of dogs crying in your ears, Anneo Mikeron (which is not insulting to christians) tunes the melody. Zoom lens is more annoying than the use of cinematography. And in terms of action, this is nothing more than a series of cruel attacks and not oh-na-star-threatened. What a terrible movie
