Do not even hit 'low', but only a bad movie. A silly-old man's filmim equivalent. Unreasonably: Unimaginable scripts, static point view, portrait clothing, terrible hair, impossible actors, and one of the truly abusive rape-and-strangulation scenes. The director has a boring feeling, but it is not implemented consistently; The movie only comes alive in its cruelty. Women's rent is particularly bad; Director was a superstitious proof as 'frenzy' can be used, although I have given a better explanation that probably started from the beginning of his TV series and 'Psycho' - which he described himself as an acute exercise, a television A test crew could shoot a portable feature to look at - Alfred Hittkock was quite a lot of abandoned industry and Settlement for trade. Thinks of being mad at the Great Master Convention in 'Frenzy', trying to go back and forth and give viewers what they think - as unexpected nudity, sleep-pitching, and general addiction. I am not an old man feeling embarrassed for his rest, but I do not want him to feel tired and lazy and scary - and while watching 'Vertigo'!
