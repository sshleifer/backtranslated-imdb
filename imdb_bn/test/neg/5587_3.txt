I'm sorry, LL fans, but I was disappointed with this concert in CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's a beautiful music-based, but the presentation is simply boring - big time. Most songs are almost the same as the word and lead singer-writer Jeff Linen animated as a store manager. She has a happy voice, but she does not have much to watch. He is standing in one place and singing for one hour and 40 minutes. Songs sound like Babbalgum stuff like the 1970-1980s: not pleasant but exciting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> : "Roll over Beethoven." Now, if only 22 songs have seen that tension, then it can be a better concert DVD.
