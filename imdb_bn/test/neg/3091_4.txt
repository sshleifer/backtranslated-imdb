What a shame What a terrible shame The table was set, the candle was burning, the guests came ... and then <br /> <br /> ... there is nothing really good. Only provocative drivel. It may be great, okay okay, but it can be very good. All the ingredients were there but the bottle was empty at the end of the day: no light! This is a mystery with everything that happened in the director's disposal ... <br /> <br /> ... The story was quite brave, though it was probably necessary to work enough with most complete rewriting to correct the story, and the characters were very consistent And the only thing that was constantly and unnecessarily tight was cinematography, but I'll get that). But the side was frustrating, the acting was right: _a-CTin-G_ heavy parts of cheese and a lot of ham, and then cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... look good! But if you are in the film school then "Cinematography 101 will not use a professional movie camera under any circumstances". Clearly, the student fell asleep through the presentation of the speech and only "... use a professional movie camera ..." Then the sentence was completed after returning to La Lande. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Finally amateur and persuasive! Appeal like Chuck Falk means I can only see this picture because it seems tragic, but then flattened and eventually ended up 'sad' (as an excuse for the movie) ... so that even 'girls' This will not be fooled by schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is far better than her imagination compared to how she allows this movie, although she was completely mistaken. Actually I'm sorry for everyone else in this movie except director and (you guessed it) cinematographer! I said, the revolution comes when the first against the wall for them! All right, not really, after all "it's just a movie" but perhaps a good "turn and pastor and running out of town" can be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
