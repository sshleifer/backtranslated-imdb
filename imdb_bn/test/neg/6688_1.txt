Without any doubt, one of the most racist prejudiced films I have ever seen, as he has leveled the prejudice against Headley Panettiere as he has moved into a solid inner city school. She is constantly called "white girl" and other slurs based on her color. Firstly, if this black girl is an abusive butt, how will it be allowed on the other hand? And secondly the stereotyping of racial kids from internal city schools is also an insult. The authors apparently expressed the desire to show their "hip" that internal city schools could win cheerleading competition, not by genius, but by their white opponents. These surfaces of film take away from the expected side of a harmful lighter-weight comedy, suitable for audiences, which gives no credit to the participants. Hayden Panetta has a star quality, but I'd be surprised that among the rest of the classes, there could be more. All the time a waste that is a ruthless film all.
