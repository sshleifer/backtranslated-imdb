This show drives me crazy. Even if it is intended to be a comedy, a family should go against everything that goes against it. The show seems to follow Dave and Wiki Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Baron), because they highlight Hilary, Larry and Mike of their three teenage children. A comedy is a good premises for yes but it does not mean it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I think I have ever heard cruder talk from kids to parents and vice versa. The only dialogue shown on the program is the control of children with parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a matter often spoken by teenagers but it is often raised in almost every episode with almost no episode. The only one episode I saw was that a girl from the parents was involved in giving a car to Hilary, once they talked to each other and how they talked about how Hillary talked like her slave. <br /> <br /> The event was most successful in the comedy stage. I'm not frustrated at this event once, how many times I have tried to see it, and I am a person who gave high quality films such as animalism and dum and dumar. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he chose to destroy his career by making this village show this piece is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Parents, your kids are never sure and I do not want to say that it will never see. Teenagers, you can probably laugh at this extraordinary sexual references but nothing goes out and then you feel empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
