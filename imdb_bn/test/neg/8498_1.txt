This movie is conceivable as a story of graffiti and friendship in a gay love story. In one study, this film was not described as a lesbian romance film, and this is the weight of the plot. I do not know what it was not to be ridiculing people or else it would be reluctant to sit on it, the film is expected to become marketable ... The film is beyond the reach of graffiti culture, abusive and graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yes, graffiti sucks too much. This film was a tricky way to hide the illustrations of young boys being gay. Look at the other films related to the director, everyone has the same content. Boring as hell, I do not expect.
