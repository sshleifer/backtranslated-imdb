I went to see this movie on this potentially interesting topic, Good Cast, a director who has already marked this movie as "Once Warriors" and loved for the silent-film films set on L.A.. Fifty and Fifty I would kindly argue in this film section easily; I appreciate the style classic but I would like to sit through and enjoy a semi-decent as well as enjoyable efforts. However, I found this movie completely helpless. <br /> <br /> Despite having a good situation to keep the story, it does not seem to be painful or entertaining for two hours. Good actors are disgusted to shamelessly break into an endless view of the dialogue ranging. The narrative sinks in silent and helplessly, and any of the phenomena that are represented are sufficiently directed to do anything other than the death of the audience. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no excitement, no entertainment at all, and ultimately I do not care about what has happened because I do not believe in movies anymore. <br /> <br /> el. After one year, privacy comes out and, despite the fact that a version of the story is a true real life, the next section gets a suitable creator for its superiority in every division. In contrast, Mulholland fails in every section of the fruit, all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved in an incident. If they ever show it on the plane, then I'll still be out.
