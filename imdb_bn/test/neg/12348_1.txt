I was looking for a documentary on the same journalism as Frontline or "Fog Off War" (by Erl Morris) Instead I was very complicated and annoying people and his governance was concerned by this shallow and naive account: Alberto Fujimori. This movie should be called "Fujimari's Return". The director feels that he has created a "perfect" film because it isolate supporters and Fujimori groups of both parties, when it is actually a very impartial and irrelevant job. <br /> <br /> Some important information in this picture is incorrect: <br /> <br /> He used the so-called "landslide" election of 1995, in which Fujimari was re-elected with 65% of the vote, the popular support of Fujimori For example. But we all know now that the result of very organized election fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) Cinema Lumuniso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, according to the final report of the Truth Commission, 69,280 people died due to political violence in Peru. 33% were created by SL. That left 67% of the police, military and other groups in the hands of other groups. Fujimori is using the same misleading information that has been used for over 10 years that it is actually another example of how terrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Any person with some education in Peruvian politics and history, Fujimari is definitely a distinct manipulator, a misleading character and unexpected egomaniac. His constitution was far from being democratic. He is still a danger to the Peruvian. Despite this incident, director Fujimori tells stories. Not about how to set up the camera, but the film's description and direction seem to be part of its political program. She always seems to have the last word. There is no journalism "cojones", just soft questions and unchallenged comments. Where do we need Oriana Falaki? The director, when questioned after screening, was impressed by his impressive and intelligent Fujimori, he did not hide. Yes, he must have been impressive by him, and you can tell this picture. It is clear that it is a very difficult time to digest a number of information that refers to his duty to corruption, murder and cheating. The Gospel assures the audience that Fujimori was truly "patriotic" before some few years ago, the Perimeters were one of the leading Peruvian journalists, told us that the latter was a "treacherous". He said that despite all the complaints, his name, etc., did not get "single dollar" in any bank account. It once again heard of the same gang, who ruled the country for 10 years. Master. This is a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This picture has done injustice to history. It is humiliated by hundreds of dead people, invisible or unjustly ruled by the Fujimori regime. It is no wonder that he later admitted that all the Peruvian intellectuals betrayed him when he was making the film. Except? The word "oportunistic", "na√Øve" and "denial" instead comes to my mind.
