This picture was a total garbage. I was sitting in this absolutely furious observer that this was funding. They explicitly spent all their budget on special FX rather than script writers and directors and some actors. <br /> <br /> The first act was soft and rubbish. The audience of the story was not quite relatable. Rather than the perspective of the storm, the official figures and the army said more about the description, which is not really the means of contact with them because most of us hate politicians. The authors tried to add a little theorem to the father and son and tried to add a human element to the unreal characters, which failed completely. <br /> <br /> As the instruction ... Oh God, tricks to try and create tension and obstacles are repetitive and at the top. Clear camera movement and then suddenly flash bolt faces a character when some horrific incidents took place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> There was no story there. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to be embarrassed to see it, boring and british film industry.
