I went out of this movie and did it a couple of years ago with Australian movie Sweetie, 20 years ago. After about three minutes I felt like killing the camera guy and I could not believe that the film was actually shown anywhere and - guess - two independent souls were nominated for the prize. What ??? Regardless of how real the dialog is, (I will not use the word "dude" again!) - Who wants to listen to this conversation? I do not go to the movies to get annoyed but what I got. The only good thing I brought up was realization that if this film is to be done in the Sundarbans and other festivals then one can do it. Well, wait, it can not be a good thing after all ...
