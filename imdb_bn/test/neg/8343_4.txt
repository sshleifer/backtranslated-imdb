This image is okay, fairly stupid and lightly accepted. But I can not stand the innumerable heroes and the unsatisfactory comment of the boy at the end: "Look, they all look the same". Does that pass the standard of good taste? I thought it was a rebel, as some of the people of this film did heroic, selfless work. I'm not saying that it would not be like this, but zooming on all the bravery makes my stomach steal.
