Media has a growing tendency and men tend to ridicule. One televised advertisement and program plots look at it. Cheaters is a prime example, they found lots of female cheaters yet huge majority of men, why? The main threats of any government power are in the male population, they are less likely to comply with the authorities and the threat of physical war is more. One way of reducing the threat is to spread to the mass media through society. Other examples of psychological propaganda are criminal dramas, which include large religious aggressive women, including full religious policemen, each of whom question the severing of their rights and who thinks the man as barbarous. Most of the top male sports stars in Australia have recently been arrested for suspected attacks and drinking charges, arresting their heroes to the government, and strengthening the dominance is another example of the public control of men. Fraud, away from the political tactics, and the violation of the rights of privacy, and most of these women attack men! On the other hand if people were in jail on the road !! If this is an honest exhibition, they will find the deception of women, because they are generally not happy with any strings attached to male lovers and they leave without the boat. Men want to own men and want to control the owners themselves, and in this way men are caught in the same way.
