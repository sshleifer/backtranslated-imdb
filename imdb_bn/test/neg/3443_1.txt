I honestly do not know why this program was going as long as it was. Oh good, humorous eh? But yes, if you ask me this show is incredibly unfunny. Team Allen boring. Jill is boring. The boys are annoying. Al boring Neighboring neighbors It's funny then just more annoying. Plots are all the same, Team Jill makes crazy and has to make things right again And next season? Who said good about them about low, would those cancer be good for a bad sitcom? Yes, shocking great ideas. So yes, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I would like to see you go to News Radio or Seinfeld. If I want to rate this show then I should see 1/10 because it did not let me laugh at all. What So yes, it's still good then Nanny though.
