Nickelodeon went down to the toilet. They're saying things like kids "O my God!" And "we are drunk" <br /> <br /> <br /> This show encourages the hatred of those who do not look good or not in the crowd. By slobbering it on women's shirtless boys, sex inequality is okay to say. The overweight son does not mention his shirt takes off. The original character basically leaves someone out of the ordinary Karl's friend Sam, who can be a homosexual, who crosses his path, hits the snow, which says that it is a ** ** ch. No one will see that there is so much negativity in this show! I think it's 10 out of 0 !!!
