All right, so I've recently collected several Vipco and Hardgor titles in the DVD and I want to say that this is the most frustrating one. Hardgore catalog was a direct release of this in a recent movie than other titles. I was always interested in El Chocolate's story because I saw a documentary on it as a teenager. However, this movie is a terrific shot-down shot and the story is terrible, terrible in Taki's DVD, it lets me go three by watching this movie. The cheap 80s and 90s are not good because of their cheap budget and comedy. <br /> <br /> See some other headlines in the series, for example, Bonnard is old but much better.
