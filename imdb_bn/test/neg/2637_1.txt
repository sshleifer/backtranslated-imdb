Stay away from all the costs of this movie. I was impressed to see this movie on a BGB, which was one of the "worst movies of all time". This one needs to say that one hand won down. It's long and drawn, and there's no purpose or plot what I can collect. There is no room inside your VCR for a movie about a killer kid from a fetus raised outside the womb. You are highly annoyed and have no life to watch this movie. But if you rather keep your distance, stay in the sky.
