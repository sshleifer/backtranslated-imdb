One of the best books I read is the book "The Watchers" by Dean Kitz. Sadly, the painting of the film is a painting of the book. Confused medieval hero and single spinster with whom he has found the meaning of his life, some innocent teenage boys, stoic security agents and wise sheriff are gathered into a mad villain in the film - do you get the picture? Moviemakers have embarked on an ongoing story of love, horror and adventure and turned it into a Z-grade horror flick - very bad - in the grief market Buy the book <br /> <br /> and enjoy reading many hours - it would be much more rewarding than watching a movie. <br /> <br />
