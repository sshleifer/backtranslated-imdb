Although I recently tried to avoid German movies, positive reviews brought me to rent it. There the German media has become stupid again, which roams repeatedly. It's no surprise to me that anyone wants to see this shit abroad. The idea of ​​creating this image is not at all (I think a female magazine article about some goofy dating). Briefly: Characters (which are not), conversations and content are so stunning, trivial and cliche-raided, I keep seeing because I could not believe what I saw. BTW mechanical statistics (of course, from the above mentioned magazines) will be simply wrong to call the flat ses call delivered. Acting is so extremely top, I can not think of it worse than that of a long time screen. You have to guess the director / there is no needle. Surprisingly, distributors and producers around the country are still wondering why German movies (rare exceptions) do not create any interest worldwide. Why? Because it waste time and money.
