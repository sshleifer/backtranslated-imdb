I was really waiting to see this movie, having spent some (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona. The compound is right in the cottage - a distraught and annoying young person enters the world of equally confused and distorted young people. But the weak spontaneity of the symbol, philosophy, and social commentator was completely out of the mark and it felt us confused and disturbed by the audience. Bravo <br /> <br /> If this movie is presented as a European "American Pie" flick, then I can stop my brain and go on a journey. But on the right side of the bat, the director highlights the symbols of our embedded highways and brings out our deep senses by introducing the contradiction of "internal self" versus "public health" (one's "mother tongue" versus one "secondary language"). . In addition, it braces dives into issues of ethnic / national stereotyping. An interesting start off, eh? <br /> <br /> Wrong. As far as it goes. These interesting topics are again mentioned again without the abridged epilogue-type end of the type which again seems to be the subject of floundering to get back to the subject. It reminds me of a scary speech that does not go anywhere, but the speaker says, "So in conclusion, I hope you see how it relates to my original thought!" Also, like other critics, betrays the cynical jab itself at stereotyping. If the point is ridiculed by the ridicule of national stereotypes, then why did a crocodile-speaking, beer-swinger English brat represent the director Preggodyish's joke? Why did the director portray the Americans as condemnatory (literally pushing him into his chest and at one point made the words of the sky), did the Europeans make him very tolerant? Why is the British girl talking about such people that she is talking about all (French people "frogs" and shouted French language)? The answer is that this is not a deep or good thought film. This is just an English English in English. But in reality it is nothing different than ridicule! Now there is a funny taunt to consider. <br /> <br /> Along with philosophy, philosophy, and socio-political commentary, I was still very annoyed by this movie. One of the girls' lovers has a very interesting gagan associated with cheating, but I was very humble away from him. The only reason I finally saw it was because I want to brush over my French and Spanish. (You see, Americans we integrate may be stupid, but we try.)
