So one day I was in the video shop, I was looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a movie I did not see or even heard. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The most inexpensive and inactive mode I've ever been involved in, despite being extremely cheap and with all slasher film reviews and terrible acting. Now sometimes the above mentioned features may appear in a photo and some benefits may still exist, but not here. Awful boring example of home made.
