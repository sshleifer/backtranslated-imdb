This picture is another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced US drummer. All of the characters were really weak, especially the uncharismatic of Goa and Badme's bad interpretation, who were just as French classics when its classic interpretation was just right. <br /> <br /> Just spent money is a good film. I guess it was a low budget film. Certainly not recommended. Maybe the director has to think a little bit, whether the movie has meaning or not wasted money before it is wasted. Maybe they are not bothered about profit before filming them. <br /> <br /> There is no hope in the movie ...
