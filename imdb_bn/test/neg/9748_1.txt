This is a shadow of suspicion that I've ever seen the worst movie. I've been watching this for a long time, but the joke is not funny, the plot is painfully neglected, the main characters are stupid because of their intelligence upgrading ... Ogg! I wanted to erase Tom Arnold and wanted to cry to him because he wasted my life two hours when I saw this piece of cinema hole. I never wanted to know why I wanted to see it, but remember if you see this movie, do not say I warned you. <br /> <br /> The character of PS Tom Arnold singing this song "I'm my own grandfather." Naph said.
