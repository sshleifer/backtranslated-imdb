Mr Bean is just a bunch of slopstick humorous slopstick. This is the most shallow humor TV series made in history. The scene often sends disgusting and terrific canned smiles cold through the spine. Mr. Bin is a selfish and rude character and he can only be sympathetic. It is unbelievable that a TV series of low quality standards can last for 5 years. It is also a complete time to watch the 1st episode, and no one can help but express anger and why Ryan portrays himself as a two-dimensional, irrational and ridiculous character. Or regret yourself why you were even bothered to visit an episode. It's a provocative experience to see.
