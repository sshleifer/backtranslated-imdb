Actually, if you are looking for bad acting (Hitrah Graham can never live in it ... it has three titles for one reason - to protect the perpetrators!), Beautifully bad conversations ("What do you like .. ribs?" ), And a plot can only approve a mother, this is your Friday night entertainment! <br /> <br /> My room hired it under the title "Tariffid" because she liked Heather Graham, but she feared what we felt after the final achievement. The film is not a scary cause, because the movie actually pays to create a movie relay. <br /> <br /> Awesome movie. There are some unidentified actors who offer some weird comedy, but there is nothing to see. Heather Graham's dramatic mountaineering is one of the most cruel and annoying things I've ever seen. I can award no point in this movie, and God may be the mercy of his soul.
