Before I really slag off this film, I just want to say I absolutely love it. <br /> <br /> Firstly, how many chars are used in the image "You are right" I'm sure I counted out a few hundred people before I left out and again started watching the film. <br /> <br /> Second, what are those blue monkeys? All right, so the Dansen family lived a very private life, and a brown eye had a blue eyes, but since when does it transform the living souls of the lower zombie zombies? <br /> <br /> And finally, 'here will be the old faithful protect me' Oh :)
