Is it possible to get a movie worse than this? There is a bunch of surface area, the idol of ******, supposedly played and we are supposed to laugh? There are no plots to go to the first place. Even when women finally appear, there is no sign of progress; The most anticipated event will happen and after the movie ends, you may be asleep. Be careful: this is not a trashy culture movie, it's trash-duration! I can not believe that it has a signal! <br /> <br /> 1
