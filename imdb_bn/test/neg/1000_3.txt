After all, I want to say that I was a fan of all the actors present in this film and the time I paid, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason that I was so disappointed was that the outer box promised me a mystery thriller. In my eyes, a mysterious thriller for British films, Ruth Reneel's novel, something that makes a lot of dark wrapping and turns away and ends the viewer that can not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This movie started with a promising note for a movie. Our main character suspects a person he does not like, to hit and kill his friend's husband. Although his idea is proved to be correct, his wife may be involved until he confesses to him that he was part of the crime, so that such incident did not happen to him. There was a good mystery thriller at the moment right now, but from there I felt that the film took a different direction and became a kind of light about soap opera about a real relationship and who wants to be with it Became. The outer box talks about a revolving lover's triangle and this film may not be labeled as a suspense thriller but it may be enjoyable to me. It was like a soap opera story and at the beginning the setting seemed to be a light deviation. The real content of the film I felt that this film has done a lot better than that. I felt that it continues to viewers on a big event that has never been implemented. So, I'd give a rating less than that and say that it has lowered my expectations.
