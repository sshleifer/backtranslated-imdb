This movie is really bad. The hero can not play You see too much that he learned his walking patches by heart. And believe me, he traveled a lot. For 45 minutes, nothing will happen. He just walked in places and walked out .... The story was so small that they wanted to expand it by adding to the vague and annoying "scene-like-suspense" view. <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue is very poor. I counted "many" and "hang on" in the first half of the media. <br /> <br /> Blood is like orange orange, you keep the kids in the blister. And the view is not followed by them. Bloody neck on a scene, following a clear throat <br /> <br /> The story has been improved. Yes, I mean, what's the story? <br /> <br /> martial arts? Where? Is that the martial arts? See how hesitant and slow is !!!!! When a kick is taken and a punch is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fast switching scenes that give you headache in most action movies. <br /> <br /> Lots of budget movies are awesome. That one was just making money. Nothing else.
