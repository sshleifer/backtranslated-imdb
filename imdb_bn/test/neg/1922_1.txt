*** Spokela *** *** Spirir *** Here on earth / (2000) 1/2 * (four out) The movie containing. Literally every genius, cliché, and acquaintance plot are here somewhere; There is nothing unique, original, or fresh. God, sit through an agonizing motion picture; I watched the movie during his theatrical release last year, so it could have achieved the worst list of my year. This is a film that instantly makes the story itself clear and encouraged by opening credits and the worst is taken seriously. "Earth here" is clearly one of the few horrible, painful films that came down. <br /> <br /> "The world here" is a teen heartfelt film, so it's enough enough to take a role in a movie as this movie as some of the most valuable young people in Hollywood who are attractive and inexperienced. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnet change the description and play a major role in the storm. Klein plays Kelly, a wealthy and helpless student who is a wealthy father (Clich Number one). He graduated as Valedictorian and followed the footprint of his father (Stuart Wilson) at Ivy League College. This set up "I do not want your life", which the father tried to control his son's life, where the son resists rebel. Kelly's dead mother was cut off, who committed suicide a little. When her father brings another woman home, she silently tries to achieve her goals ("No mother can replace"). Josh Hartnet played the opposite character of society Jasper. To Kelley. Her family is a local diner owner. Enter the waitress's waitress covered for her longtime love interest, Parine Kavannagh (Lley Sobisky) her sister (which has no intention of controlling the scene below), when Jasper and Kelly act like children's work, and (Oh no) in the diner Crashing, it's the reason for the bursting of fire. (The number of conflicts between rich and poor will be counted as three.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They get disturbed by the law, but considering the need to be present in this movie, the local judge thinks they have the option of giving time: they have to work together for the reconstruction of the diner. <br /> <br /> Two guys are hot during summer and working hard time getting a nice nose. Kelly is caught in the eyes of Samantha, and the romantic spark flew away. Jasper is jealous, but wants the best for his true love (King number 4). Her parents (Annette O'Weal and Bruce Greenwood) denied her little romantic triangle (five of the Cliche number), but she continued for two consecutive times without Jasper. His father can also be a local sheriff, how wonderful it is (that means that the Melredramatic naggett check number is six). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But feudal relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can any romantic tension be? If two youngsters are involved in a feudal film, then both characters should be seen from both sides. The film depicts Jassaar as his "real love", and as a confusion in the case. It is clear that Jassaar really loves him, but it is also clear that he does not love her. It absolutely kills romantic tensions in the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lily Sobiski does not do any harm here; However, its charm and type performance are not fit like a two-time character like Samanta. John Hartnet is also good for Jasper's role, but the film does not let him do nothing except the celine biker. Chris Klein gets a crap for himself here; She spent a lot of movie shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately he does not show his acting ability, because there are probably very few. Support cast is very gifted. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance of the movie, but there is not enough screen time to save something without a few short moments. I enjoyed acting by Stuart Wilson, who perfectly fits the role of a rich man in controlling the father of high quality social status. <br /> <br /> Then we firmly about one hour and ten minutes of feudal knee problem (another spoiler ahead). What is this, he has a serious sick illness (yet another revival in the film, about eight). His terminal disease combines two rival youths into a friend, well, at least I think how to show this film, that two nimes could bring loss of love together (not cliche number). <Br /> <br /> Klein rehearses her characteristic to show her character more than a shallow stereotype, but we've seen it many times before, I wanted to choose a deep character that hides the real feeling (actual number, um, Was it ten?). Conflicts between Kelly and Jasper are frustrating and intrinsic; A "Your Mom" ​​comment triggers a fist fight when they reconstruct. One has been transformed from "Armageddon", such as Samantha and Kelly fearing in an open field, horny like hell, because he is slowly moving towards his fingers around his body, after the US cities, he is naming the area (why the number is not number 11). The film uses alcohol as a way to increase romantic tension: A drunken coil falsely stalks with feudal feud in battle with Jasper, but next day he just wants to dance (number, oh no, I'm losing counting).
