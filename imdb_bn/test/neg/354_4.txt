You know very little that MGM had divorced Narma Shearar in a day which MGM had learned from tech. How far did they come in a year? CHENEY is a very basic stage on stage. The camera comes very rarely. Shearar plays a romantic role in his usual charming self and the charioteer. They are very careful to talk clearly and slowly to the microphone source which gets crashed into the usual dramatic scenes, but the game has a strong and funny Warner so that someone can enjoy themselves if one's expectations are not too high. Oh, however, this plot involves a ring of high-quality jewelery thieves who enter their own societies to become victims of their prey. Some cute tricks and true love of the script have all the conquers. An Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay Adaptation
