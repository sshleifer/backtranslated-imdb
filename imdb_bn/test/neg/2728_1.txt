It is a little hard to believe that it came from the same director who gave us a heliester. Where Style, Foreboding, and Charm? I mean, the heliester is not a great horror film, but at least it was something. Nightbrood has been mercilessly executed like a big force with bad bad ideas. There is a problem with the subtlety from the opening: the first shot of the monster is shown! The opening dream sequence looks very much for too long. Our hero does not show professional acting skills (but no one is expecting from this shocking section). One such killings that one wishes were more interesting. Then we have David Craneberg. People are not really meant to be actors. He has filled the role of strange psychologist in sufficient quantities, but he did what he did behind the camera and saved the disaster. Then we came to the media, a scary fake cemetery, on which there is an exaggerated fake gate. This thing is not a huge improvement in graveyards outside Plan 9. It gets worse when we fill it with animals. Here there is really no mistake with the character design and make-up effects (well ... without a scalp, a pointy cold and forehead and dark circleed greaves around its eyes) problems are the way they work and the terrible dialogue is given to them . The photography of the underground city of Barker has become tired and could make this part of the story even better. Some SPOILERS could call the following. We wait for our hero to die and to become "overnight" (he will fly and see things that will fly and see), but when his time of change comes, he apparently sees his hero as a modest animal design. With the celebration of "Character" of Craneberg, the story gets less interesting until the fight against the ideals (which is just bad). Barker's myths here failed him. There is no talent behind the nightbrands and little originality. The image can use a big budget, a serious script and character design that does not tell you "oh ... oh, how lam." What a waste Not awesome, not cold, not too dark, just weak
