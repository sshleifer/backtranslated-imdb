Oops. I rented it because I thought it was a beta crop (1981), which was recommended. After the emergence of Passasi Kansit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it's viewable, because the original characters are very sexy, but the acting is awful. Stephen Belvedin feels full of fun, which can be understood as his co-star. Is Patissy competing with Leigh Hurley for the most obviously vain actor title?
