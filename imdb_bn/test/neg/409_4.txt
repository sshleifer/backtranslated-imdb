After passing the preview show, I did not read any books or saw the first movie, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> 'Angels and Demons' is a confusing, film direction or any other credibility. There was very little character development and I did not find myself concerned about the plight of heroes; The opposite was true, I was more interested to see how they would be successful as the first half of the film, because why they are why the eluminity is why they are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> Location with a little explanation or reason and the audience should believe that when everyone in the movie is first to meet it, it will be companion. An analytical mind can understand that it is extremely unlikely. <br /> <br /> The final measure is very sticky and asks what happened and there is nothing to wonder why no one cares about it, it is very difficult and unnecessary. <Br /> <br /> Actors are not particularly believable in their roles, because in most cases it is difficult to believe that scientist, professor, and church men will act as they behave without consequence of their actions. Though the event was not the slightest, the motion of the film was suspicious of the characters screaming during the intense schedule and I was asked how the playwright could get time from time to time. <BR> <br /> The most delightful part of the movie is cinematography, I found a beautiful movie to watch it but it was a mess, which I saw was not right to pay for watching the theater.
