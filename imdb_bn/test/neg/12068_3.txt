Obviously the author and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher film is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashes. Everything in this movie - a group of young men who want to spend weekends with fun, alcohol and sex in a deserted summer camp called Camp Blade, warns that the old man does not go there; And of course, with March is a mad assassin who has none of anyone, some of whom, some of them, some of whom have none of them. 3535 mm film shot with special effect acceptable. But instead the special effects are done badly. Walking on Sunday afternoon, the murderer continued to roam and the only good thing in this film is the gifted main actress and initially sex scenes. Without that - dull and forgotten Jasper P. Morgan
