Most people think that I have seen this movie and the reviews I read were considered as a very entertaining thriller so that more people have to meet. I did not expect this photo to blow me up, but I'm not expecting to find the middle of the film, which is it. <br /> <br /> I am unfamiliar with French films and have been studying them as students and so I am aware about the clich√©s and corny plot twists that can be neglected by the English / American audience. There are some great French movies that should have been widely released internationally, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> This plot is both complex and very smart to start, so you really feel every minute of its 2hr and 5min run time and time is finally revealed to you everything you are cared about. In the main character, there is no realistic beauty or even acting talent lacking that mainly stays your attention and closes its journey at any time so that you consider consuming even the main plot twists, but it begins to dawn on you. . You've lost your time! After the film's climatic reconciliation, switching seemed really in mind before the credits really started - it was that I was sure that I often completely ruined my time. <br /> <br /> This image is not all the bad things I have seen but it seems completely overrated. For example, I read somewhere that this Bourne identity considers movies as suspense or even 'wall-to-wall tension'. I can safely say that some people are highlighting this absolutely silly movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I have a liberal consideration rating for this picture, and since I saw some complete and stupid stinkers, I'll save 1s, 2s and 3s for them.
