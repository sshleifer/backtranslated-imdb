She seems to be a control freak. I commented on him "losing control of the show" and told another person that they came alive with the creature that had a rule - "there is no snake." Her joke is in hair because she needs to hire a comedy writer. The only reason I see him is because he has some great guests and the band. <br /> <br /> I saw Craig Ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. She likes to play ** ** to burn time. I do not think people have a lot of future in future talk show. <br /> <br /> The daily also has its tongue biting out annoying habit with its lips. She has to do it in a show at least 10 times. I like the Joe Furman band. Carrons need light up too late before the daily.
