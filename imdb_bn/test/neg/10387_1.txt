This movie was a very short moment in the real drama. After the opening minute, the film fell into a spiral that did not take us to hell and could say at least than look back. Acting was more horrific than the film's content and sometimes I could not laugh. The continuity of some scenes was terrible - the scenes disappeared without letters only to be replaced by other characters, which was something else a few minutes ago. Of course this Exorcist was a fool. The church collection collection plate should be signed for this sign up for Egypt Rasso. Can i speak latin And you Brutus.
