The door to hell has been opened in Moscow To find the gateway of a priest, managed by Vincent Gallery, go to the town to find a lost friend in the tunnels down the city. While traveling around the underground, he and his colleagues had to deal with the tunnels of both human and evil people. Better ideas with a good cast of second-level actors do not go much more than the tones that their settings like. I have seen this twice now and I still have no idea why it seems to be scary when people do not talk too much about evil and we see shadow forms. Nothing clearly and honestly, I did not see its point of view except for providing a Czech check for the perpetrators (the second bill was a few of the harmful scenes in the Bill Killer, which is nothing but permission to stay in it). The idea is really good, performance is fine, the script does not go anywhere . Suggest some of the characters in the film and do not cross the river to see it.
