Italian filmmakers love to snatch American cinema All of our movies, and as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying as a slur against Italy completely, but I would like to see more that the Italian film industry itself has done great harm by allowing foreign countries to go abroad. By the stars in the world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the remote "Jaws" (as you do not know) ripoff <br /> <br /> Dive into the plot (drink it? Ha ha ha ...): This is a cross between an octopus, a shark and a Steven Tyler, a huge giant swim on the coast of Florida (for example: Italy) The American (i.e. Italian) attacks and cruel, beer-slewing peter (Soapqui) is carried out. His unaware, beer-slewing girlfriend and other beer-swirling people whose main purpose is to eat animals, by killing a mysterious force, those animals who want to live alone or just stand nearby and otherwise make useless (and needle beer). Or be a doctor in this movie who repeatedly died without waiting for his paddles to recharge (20, possibly 30 times in the row) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a movie which was directed to a backtrack (by Bava!), edited with an onion helper, explosives of Driftwood ( Beer-swelling) edited and written by piece Ena (primebala beer bearing) people sometimes sometimes a typewriter, movie studio, or major cities around the world should ever be given. If the people who make this film think that they are working in real situations, they must have made several zombies in them. Or drank too much beer <br /> <br /> I say this movie is bad? It is: Green Cottage cheese is like bad; A formal wedding is bad like a Hawaiian shirt; Bad Dana Akrorid used to host "Saturday Night Live" like "Bad Theater"; Bad weight gain tablets like Calisa Flockhart - get it? Good. <br /> <br /> The Mike and SOL gang have raised this beer-drunken beauty repeatedly and revealed this "horror" movie: Horrible. Although the European character was associated with a European character, it was seen by Europeans - especially a beer-swinging. <br /> <br /> Dead star, known as "Shark ROSO Nell'Sseno", is a star for MST3K version ... and now, for any beer? <br /> <br />
