My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. The people who eat the plants have been repeatedly made HundREDS. It used everything from Nintendo to Mario to Gelda Metro Metro. It's used in 50 low budget budgets compared to the lowest of the Godzilla franchisee. And pieces with this plant makes it a completely other level. I do not know anyone who went outside, but I know a lot of people in some parts of this film, because of the fierce laughing out. I was one of them. Do not deserve terrible shit a little better than some terrible section of this pile? <br /> <br /> Characters are easily copied / pasted from any other movie with the hostel or collage kids with False Turn or Wolf Creek or bad luck. Yet it is considered "characterized" when the film takes a few hours of your time to tell you that there were hundreds of characters before? Do not you want a letter that does not pieces of forgotten pieces of flesh? <br /> <br /> This was not poor. A guy cut off his skin. Eating! (No.) A guy gets his legs broken. Eating! Eat! (No.) I have shown some movies that hated everything that my mother hated because she got sick, and she said: "I look worse than PG movies! Why was R rated?" So, why was it rated? <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only plot of movie / book: The collage is drinking, being sexually, naked, curled, bleeding, and eventually died. This is probably the most typical example of a cheap, incredible horror film, though people are called "mature"? What . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I do not think I've seen some less original ideas than ever seen a beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> Have you ever not been sitting there and wanting a scary genre, easily do some of the most diverse things. . . Well, different? Some really original? <br /> <br /> I want the real horror of more horror movies, not only the cheap collage parties do not keep movies with some splatters of fake blood. <br /> <br /> 1/10
