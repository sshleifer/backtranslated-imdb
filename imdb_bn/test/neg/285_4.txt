Each James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Only every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And screenlitters maintain the integrity of these rules that do not break the rules. With the complete unnecessary plot junction, the integrity of both ocean movies is read between the airplane 2 and the Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And he can fly both safely. <br /> <br /> Entertainment? Of course, for a Roadster cartoon. But it will never happen in Spielberg because it will destroy the film's integrity. More importantly, it will be aroused by the audience. They were already sitting on the edge of Indiana Jones' film for 3 hours and they counted them in India to stop that bridge in a credible way. If fly away? People used to come out of the theater, similarly what man did in the 12th ocean. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Julia Roberts' ether, Tess, hiding herself, enters a museum ... Julia Roberts?!? A cute turn? Three hours after breaking the fourth wall we introduced these letters? Multiply this nose at 33 and 1/3? This is a textbook example which can ruin a whole movie in a cheaper laugh. But wait ... if you have not gone out yet ... <br /> <br /> This movie creates suspense throughout the last hour - how they will pull the hijst - there are only 10 ... 8 ... 5 ... 2 days left! And then within the last 12 minutes of the film, only the recreational part of this movie we see that the hasst was made earlier and that Matt Damon has been dragged for 30 seconds all the time. Last 10 days? A complete waste of your time. <br /> <br /> Bridge on the Indian jacket phone ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the original stones almost a month ago! Besides, I firmly believe that you are Kate Capsule! <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not already seen it, then cut your losses and watch the Polar Express. I do not want to destroy the end for you, but there is really a Santa Claus. Do not be afraid.
