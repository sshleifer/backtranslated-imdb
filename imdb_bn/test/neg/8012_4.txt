I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincent Minerali, and Gene Kelly, but this movie kept me cold. I was expecting another American from Minnie Paris, so perhaps I was much more expected. <br /> <br /> The song was short of concise and impressive dance numbers. As Makoko of the ship I was influenced by the very evocative Kelly dance. I was impressed by Nicholas Brothers in a clown, very bad songs were very annoying. I also enjoyed Kelly by attacking Judy with Brick-A-BRAC. <br /> <br /> In fact, check out Lorna Loft's autobiography about the film's most annoying song of Cole Porter, especially what "Neena" can be. Also, Judy and Jean Yale are constantly like scratches children. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin - music is the same - but it is not preserved by impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I doubt the best part of this movie was left on the floor of the cutting room. Please, find some movie retrievers, movie bits, and show us what has been shown!
