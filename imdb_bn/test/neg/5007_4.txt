What is wrong with the CURACAO (I do not have any idea of ​​the reason to change the name) One of the ladies is telling her boyfriend where <br /> <br /> <br /> baby, I'm trying to sleep "<br /> <br /> It's not a problem that it's a problem or it's been distributed, it's actually central European accent. There was nothing wrong with her until her character was released from Fieldlephia in the United States. What has hit me about this thriller - the ways do not match their characters. In addition to Filipino women with the German language, we also see a South African with an English Act, a local police chief who thinks he is an Irishman and George in the guise of a Guerstein officer. The one who is the worst of the C-Scotts is a person who speaks with Dutch or British   টা দক্ষিণ আফ্রিকার সঙ্গে আমেরিকান tinged হতে পারে মত শোনাচ্ছে। আপনি শীঘ্রই পর্দায় যা কিছু অনুসরণ করছেন তা ছেড়ে দিন এবং তারা কোন অদ্ভুত ভাবে কথা বলার কারণে কোন জাতীয়তা একটি চরিত্র হতে পারে তার উপর মনোযোগ কেন্দ্রীভূত করে। It is interesting to note that this site did not encourage this movie to any country. With different actors from different countries, you think that it was produced by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Even if you are not weird about pronunciation or dialect, you probably have to follow any steps because CURACAO Plot is less. The incidents are like a blast in the boat, and a hostage situation and the hero are being designated as agents of South African intelligence, but you've got your head fit that hack is the leading. I was lost
