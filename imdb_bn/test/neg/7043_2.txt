If you have enough time to kill your friend free and the DVD provides you free, you may still need the courage to watch this movie for which there is no good script or humor. <br /> <br /> Imran playing in front of time / acting frozen, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this film. Rashal was good in the film. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the college campus, where Imran is a bad boy, Nur Tussaar, who pretend to be contrary to their nature, and so the story goes on. <br /> <br /> If you do not have any work and are running it on your local cable TV, just watch it.
