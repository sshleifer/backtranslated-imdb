This is an excitingly boring, slow movie. We can feel some sympathy for socially and inexperienced and painful tomakes, but Magda's motivations are very difficult to see, and at least I was intimate. <br /> <br /> We all talk about the need for love, but I'll get more from the better of Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I said that there should be at least ten comments line, so I'll add that there are some interesting shots of relationship between background citizens and government employees and organizations. I think it means to publish this image before or after the fall of the communist government. Finally, for a silent way, look at gas companies from the gas company to see whether Magda has gas leak.
