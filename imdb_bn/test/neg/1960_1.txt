Please, do not do this if you are planning to rent this movie. If you are thinking of watching a few clips of downloads, If I have my way, nobody can read this summary. <br /> <br />, the high points of the movie still remained merciful even after one. The director was a sadist probibl. Wicked fishing equipment was something that you would expect from a house in the anti-social and socio-social evening of 7 years old that could eat paint chips for breakfast. The problem with this movie is that it is a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (in any case, do not attach these 2 movies) it is very interesting. But it tries to be fun at the same time and fails so much impossible to do so that your sense of humor is very disturbed for doing something, but your gag closes the reaction to save yourself. <br /> <br> I could have done a lot more, I could describe it in detail in detail how terrible it was, but I think it will be my wishful way to remember me about it. If you need me, I will stop trying to warm myself so that I may feel clean again ...
