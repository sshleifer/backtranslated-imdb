This picture was originally shot in 1987 and it was created, but it did not hit the theaters until 1990. I have seen this picture, the good things I have seen can be seen, but I think the camera did not have much talent or experience behind it to do it. The story was held in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are told that their land should be released so that the railway can come. The role of Dennis Hooper, William Barnenhagen who paid for the land but was depressed. Ziancarlo Jiannini Sebastian Calgero and he is proud to leave and asked other farmers to stand up and fight for their land. Berrigan fares a bunch of thugs to indulge in indifferent growth and leave. These lips are headed by a man named Andrews (Bart Young) and he does not hesitate to kill anyone to give him problems. Andrew and his men killed Kologero on one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) swore revenge and returned the land for everyone. Marco blows the bridge which requires railroads and they destroy a tunnel and it sets the project for several months, and Berignans now start getting heat from other investors. This film is directed by Peter Mastersson and "The Trip to Beautiful" as well as the best performing career. He is a fine actor but here he seems to be on his head. It was a film that needed to be paid in a lot of detail and it was not easy to see. Roberts hairstyle is perfect for 1980 but this is estimated to be 1890! The painter Tomomichi Kurita who ended up as a good cameraman, but it was only his fourth movie, and he certainly did not learn everything at that time. It does not have a sharp film, and I've seen several shots that the sun is going to be somewhat closing and the scenes are not just misertions that help in overall appearance. The script is not just a revenge story and no surprise during the movie. We know that the Zayennee is going to get it and it seems only a matter of time. Cast top notch and they come across as their best work but the entire film uninspired. This is promoted as Julia Roberts's film debut but I'm not sure that's right. He may have previously appeared in a film called "Firehouse".
