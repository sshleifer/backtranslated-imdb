Having a buff history, I rent this movie because of the subject. The idea of ​​Alice Island's experience at the beginning of the century attracted attention to a small group. Unfortunately, the movie flashes fall. The story is mostly annoying; Nothing happens for long stretches. The director uses secret imagery (proposed in the form of deadly ends), with explicit efforts to break the glansial pensing, but instead, it conflicts with the film's pure looks and feelings. Characters are also badly drawn. Finally, we do not really care about them as much as we should. It is shameful that it was not even that. I still like to see a good movie about the experience of American immigrants, but this is not the one.
