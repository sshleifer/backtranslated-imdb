It's an embarrassing debut, its first anointing under the rumored spy / comedy of Barry Hamfries's infamous Sir Les Patterson character. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of Batti / Hoffman Stinger Ishtar (1987). Humphries must learn from mistakes made - if you are going to change gears in any concept, do not use sparrows! Like Ishtari, promises to do something different from the first 20 minutes or more. It is very nice to see Patterson walking around Australian politics to be unaware and proud. One of the letters also indicates that Paterson has a date with the current time - you think Humphires can make a commentary on the government in Howe (I can only see a scene in a drink contest with Poterson and Hawkeye). But instead of a movie that is shining and even an impressive look in the world, we see Patterson going around the world, as James Bond is trying to save the world from the vapors outside the world half before the vapor. <br /> <br /> frustrated
