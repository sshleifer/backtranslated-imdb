Ioan Flux was hilariously entertaining and there was a better way than Pabna on Wednesday evening, I was pleased that I bought one ticket for free. When I went, I did not know anything about the film, actually I did not even know that there was an animated series before reading this site, I was ready for some, and as some other viewers mentioned, trailers were well illustrated, showing good looks, interesting pieces of the movie I got dragged. Though halfway through the film, I was frustrated, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also think it was lacking an extra bit of depth and kept me blank. Feeling. And the pointless and little annoying gun fights, if you're going to do their job, but do it with some style, not just explosion loads and unarmed guards. Personally I did not see anything about city stories or people, or would like to know more about how to reduce the chairman more than the long and superior gunfight.
