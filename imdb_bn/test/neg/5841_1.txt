Obviously, these agents did not see the dollar sign out when signing up for their clients for critical complications at the 117-minute * AUGGE * door. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is fine, $ 1 million has left it. Seriously The amount of checks does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and "love conquers everyone" promises no marriage can never mean "to be rich for the poor, to the ants as honesty". Otherwise, imagine the story, though: 2 kids, flat-breaking, unlimited "frustrating" and totally stupid. They clash with rich business people. Children's marriages are disturbed by the overwhelming period and by some of the losses of that husband. Write Mr. Tixodo, twisting and stability - a virtual magnet for a chronic biological watch - and the temptation of his wife, excitement, mystery. Who will he choose? Maybe, under those conditions, I can actually care. Like, as well, Redford's selfish and manipulated foreshadow shows the sympathetic character in the air. A woman who sells herself is entitled to a person who blames her wife. The offensive proposal makes the husband a total offset, which is lacking in every positive male character and makes the wife a cheaper stampet inspired by money instead of confusion of other possible love, moral center and self-respecting women. <br /> <br /> All impressive talent (acting, direction, cinematography) has been lost in this picture - and it's an impressive amount - it could not save its splashy-but-very-trashy $ 1 million pitch line. If I see this turkey at another bridal shower, I'm going to roast it! (Or perhaps cross it with Titanic and pitch the sea tape!)
