Gore a graduation I saw this piece of horrible, spoiled, worthless, junk in 1980-81 or 81 at the Camio Movie House in Washington, Avenue of South Beach (now the famous Krraby Night Club). I was 17 at the age of 17 and my three friends and I laughed it horrible, gross, trash pieces. The theater was on its last leg and most of the drinks were graduating and sleeping there. They do not miss a darn thing. Worst performance. This actor deserves the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean the role of the worst performer in movie history. Joke was, another Mi Mi Lay in the theater (at least a great name!) Stinker ... barf city showing. Enough said. If you are under 12 you might get a few cooler More than 12, you will graduate after opening credit. It's just amazing that anyone has spent a cent to make this movie. And to remember, it is considered a "genuine" classic. YUK !!!!
