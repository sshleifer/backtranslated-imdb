This movie is one of that on the floor of the cutting room. For one, the opening sequence does not reveal the subject matter of 'gang'. If it is not guessed at least, then they got that part right. Second ... all the glazing on the left side and what's on the right ??? They even do it in the synchronous style. Somewhere I did not see a member from a rival crew, walking around the bar, looking for someone, looking out and seeing that he is Barbie and all in the bag of bags and walking face to face, will go alone 'for what? '. I've lost money at the price of the rental and I'm glad that I did not buy the DVD myself. <br /> <br /> If it is made by college (TAAAA) students, at least they try it out of old Australia. Good luck next time.
