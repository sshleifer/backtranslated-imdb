"The Polar Express" was a horror movie. This film makes the worst a hypocrisy for presenting yourself as a "innocent" name for Christmas, as a harmless, sugary and harmful story. I have never read by encouraging Chris Van Usberg's book, but the most frustrating thing is that it was directed by Robert Zemkis, who was a fantastic "Who Framed Roger Rabit?" It was an extraordinary movie where he proved that animations can be praised equally for kids and adults, although this film seems to have been a victim of his ambition and he has given much importance to creating an interesting level description than an interesting story. I'm sorry to say it, but "Polar Express" has many artistic levels like a video-game or toy promotion campaign. Everything in this movie seems lifeless: Character can look like a human, but they have no life, and there is a helpless touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... the "message" in this movie. You can see it in some parts of the movie and believe me, it was unclear. For example, in a scenario where a child refuses to enter Polar Express. Notice that the character like Tom Hans gives a gesture, "Do not be stupid to accept my offer". Secondly, when the girl says that the toys are "warm" and things like that Kids keep talking about all these difficult movies about how big Santa will give them. There is a song about gifts! Swap is an irrelevant and weaker character. And, in the last scene, the character seems to be "discovery" of the real meaning of Christmas: and what will happen? What do you think ? Gifts! Many christmas movies are nearing something like this, but "The Polar Express" is a fact of materialism and greed. Seriously, I reject it as a "children's movie" because if kids are to learn, I do not want to think about how our future will be.
