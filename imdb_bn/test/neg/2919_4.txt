It's not an all-time classic comedy, although it's a very good small movie that you put it on the morning of Saturday morning but to see if anything else is okay. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Kob, coming to America, America is coming to where his father was a missionary. She came from China to find an American wife and planned to return to China to continue her father's work. Kobha has been recruited for recruiting as a mayor. His corrupt home city, when the existing political machine that controls the city, understands that he will create a perfect pattern to run against the current mayor who is also the head of the city's underworld. They think that there is no scope for conquering fools, cold Cobbles, and therefore the current mayor continues in the city and plans his plans that make them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd is not doing her physical comedy as she did in her silent movies. He has made a strong screenplay with Cobb with a reserved understated dignity. Acting was good from all involved and the story and the script were pretty good too. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Era, but this is not nearly half of the stereotypes I've seen from other films since then. <br /> <br /> Though not near Lloyd's best film, this movie is entertaining and Lloyd is very good as Cobb. You will not miss this movie but it may be enough for Lloyd's interest and you want to see more of her work.
