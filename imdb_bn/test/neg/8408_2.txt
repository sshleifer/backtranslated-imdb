The first film was a bit good for me, I mostly enjoyed it, but I think it was not really something special. However, compared to this mess it looks much better than a whole hack. Why did they feel the need to get out of the movie, but they should know that it does not match the performance of the first movie when they can only reinstate Roth Gordon his role. The story follows Rosemeer's kids and stuff, but in reality it's a mess, it's not a television movie, and the television appearance does not stir very well. It has a comedy tone which interrupts it as well, if they really feel the need to create a seagull, they can make it a rated film which is nude in it and in the womb. I'm sure it was still quite bad, but at least it was more visible and funny, despite the fact that the film was not trying to be fun. I had seen this one in Monstervision and Joe Bob was not really good to say about it in the article and there is not much I say to say. I want to say that it was a seagull that could never show the light of day.
