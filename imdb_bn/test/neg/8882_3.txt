With such a title, you will be forgiven for thinking of this movie, painter Goa. Then half an hour later you can make more decisions about Roman Catholic search. With more latitudes, it's probably just a snapshot of time. For the greening Characterization of many characters and true devotion, Milos Formanoan is a colorful but snail, appealing mosquito that fails in three accounts. <br /> <br /> Mills Farman Jewish father Nazi concentration camps), a great director who portrays artist Mozart as a buffoon and left with it. In fact, it won awards for it. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste, a boring regime, especially communism. He made an equal over-the-top but rather impressive, One Callo's Nest Flow. So, at the age of 74, how did he come to give us this mess? In Goa Goose, Goa is one step away from buffoon. The main character, Brother Lorenzo, plays Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is equally vibrant as the whole model ins (and later on film, her own daughter). The uninterrupted connection to Goa is that he will portray both. <br /> <br /> The torture of Lorenzo (and then rape) that he suspected of being a Jew. His father tortured Lorenzo. Napoleon Dash is Spain (short). The church has left him and finds a search dungeon for his child. Goa still draws but the deaf has gone. Its main preoccupation Ines seems to be helping. And so <br /> <br /> Historically, Goa was an historian. The fountain sadly adopted the idea of ​​the biological biography of Goa, but could this truth be used to pull the entire film together ?? In Goa, a major part of history is seen. But the painter is very durable taking any weight. Similarly, should a devious document be completed? Compared with other reprehensible orders throughout the time, the holy view has been forgiven with a barely confession. Although know whether the forman is capable enough to be credible with a real account. <br /> <br /> "I thought it might be the heart of a wonderful story," she said at the production notes. "We lived under communist society and there were many parallels between Spanish investigations." But the story is very weak to keep our attention. Against our expectations and some big background (a great painter's life, the horror of justice and even with the French Revolution), we are told to experience a fabulous (if kind of) inspiration instead of Goa. As a result, we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Backgrounds are handled unexpectedly. In 1729, Goa became deaf (when the film began), 15 years later, not only. Believing as Napoleon cut out from a cereal packet. We showed the Church the verdict of death (when the general method for the church was emphasized by the secular forces that did the dirty work). Battles are very dancers and stereoscopic appearances. A peppering of undesirable nude bosoms makes it very early for. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production values ​​are mostly good. The colors are vivid, excellent pacing is excellent (at least we do not give up to find a suitable story.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until the overdraw as a crazy woman. There is not much to say about Goa, even though it seems to be beautiful, even if it is very nice and quite irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I've had a drunk conversation at night, where my friends and I asked each other, if you can choose a director to portray your life, then who will? In his record, Farman should be down with my list of sorrow.
