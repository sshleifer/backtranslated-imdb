I'm a guy who likes Hood from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from B grade to Hollywood. But this movie was something different. I do not hate and this movie was enjoyable. But some bits were just weird. Good acting was not good, Hawker's age (better than Silk) and new Jack and SVU (great) Shockers performance won the Ice. The scene where the corrupt (ice) wants to be a Jamaican couple kills him and burns ISIS and the other two in the fire, it kills Jamaican, but ice helpless, other similar to ice. The movie Nagar Menes (both of whom were both actors) were the supernatural, but there is nothing that is like a monster in a corrupt way. When MJ (Silk) smuggled for the first time, he struggled, but then he usually fought and knocked on the thigh with blood. And when MJ admits to killing a policeman, the police upset her beat, Ben was amazing, Beni was not seen in the film, and the scene was not in the film. The corrupt M JK wants to kill why he keeps weight but still makes you skull. Wayne Jodie wrote a letter to Mrs. Jones, who did not mention what happened after explaining what happened next. The other two main characters are MJ and Lisa. The film showed Hitler's horror and poverty - which greatly influenced the life of Latinoos and Blacks - it was a good part of the film, although the clips of the projects were reused thousands of times. And the scene where Miles crashed his bike at full speed (not helmet afterwards) killed Latino brother and my Latino brothers ran in the car and killed him. The film was like a movie Mansion film, and half of the actors were both films as well as the production team. It was OK. But I'm from poverty, I like movies, but if you do not love M, I can not see it. The thing to save me from walking reminds me of the first movie that I've made with $ 100, and my love trend. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Peres
