This is the real horror scientist / horror movie since 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his horror films have received many campaigns, this turkey is bad as the worst of wood. Now the acting is somewhat better than you in wood space (like Plan 9 and mind breed), but special effects have been significantly worse than wood! However, bad movie aficionados would be happy to hear that it is so bad that it still looks nice. Like a wooden movie, it's great to see this shit-festival and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> However, nowhere else, a UFO has been torn through the radio, and this report has created a panic by Air Force. However, later, they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a brown! However, only after these planes disappear completely, they realize that there are some of them there. <br /> <br /> So far, the film is not great but it is worth watching. However, by the time the terrible flying demon appears, you know you're watching a turkey. First, through the terrible use of stock film and crappy models, the aircraft kept changing the mid-flight. Someone will not be disturbed by it, but with the air lovers like me, flying in an F-80F-20 for an F-80F-20 makes me crazy - especially when the planes do not show anything like each other. Second, through "cute" cinematography, you can actually see everything in the genie Faz for half of the film! This is frustrating and when you finally see it clearly, hopefully it will be worth the wait. Well, this kind of luck !! "Giant" grocer's "U Beat Euro Life" shows less realistic or terrible than ducks from the TV show !! Actually, it is significantly less realistic than the Japanese giant monsters !! In fact, big birds from "Sesame Street" are even a bit scarier and realistic !!! This can be just God-fearing in the way and the worst movie genre in history - as bad as (or worse) robot monster or outer space as TEENAGERS! The following line is a horror film that will not love San Bad film fans like me (who's a crazy bunch) will probably love it! Everyone ... be afraid, be very afraid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You may see some clips of this photo come from other scientists. I'm positive Washington monument scene was stolen from Earth VS. Flying Sweakers But I have seen several other scenes with the oath of some other films. What a hack work!
