You can stomach in the camp, this movie should make you laugh quite often. It's for me, at least I will only mention one of my favorite ingredients: "fish" "water shots" of "swimming". <br /> <br /> One last note: William Catt is actually a beautiful actor. I hope he will get another day of the sun; My childhood was a fun part of decades, seeing him as "The Greatest Hero Hero", and he was not very visible since then. He felt depressed in this film. Someone give him a good show, or something to do a fun job.
