Some who prefer baseball history, especially in the early 20th century, Kobbet was a major figure and I was looking forward to watching this baseball movie with tons of colorful characters. Well, it was not a baseball movie, which was frustrating. No, it was only an athlete's account with Cobl's next year's calendar, when two collaborated in a book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were many demons to fight. In one year, trying to reduce the chances of winning the batting champions, he hated his own colleagues so much. Nevertheless, a leading screenplay on this person. It almost makes him something like cartoon <br /> <br /> An old man sees and hears, fools and humiliating entertainment for two hours? No, it's not. For some days, I want to see Cobb's real biopic that he was shown in the days of force and if he wants to portray him as a bad guy, but they are just here to see a bitter, repressed old man making an ass himself in front of a fun man Is not it.
