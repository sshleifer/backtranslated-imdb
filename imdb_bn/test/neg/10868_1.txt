I asked myself when I saw this movie. I had one thing in the amount of nudity and sex but there was a lack of saga in the other part of the film which was its style in adult art. I really just wanted to continue the whole movie and leave, but I continued. I am hopeful that the story will probably be better, eventually it may be a good turn. But I can not be more wrong At the end I was steady because I thought I could write a bad review for it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I mean that there is no mistake with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director shows that the audience wants to see it with a short story, it is all our humiliation. It seems that we all are so shallow, that only want to see Burles from the rebel, immoral of big film artists My suggestion: Rent a different movie.
