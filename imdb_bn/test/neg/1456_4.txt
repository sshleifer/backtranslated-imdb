Have you ever tried your friend with a kind of food that made your friend and then said to yourself, "Wow, that was not a good mix"? Well, how did I feel after seeing this movie? <br /> <br /> Many visitors will be very uncomfortable with this strange mix of crime and very funny comedy. See it almost m. Rogers is a cruel gangster, very strange game. Some are just mixed and this film clearly proves. Here are Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Beldwin, many good performances, but this is not a nice film due to lack of balance and parallelism. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Dammam has done some nice work in films such as Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be coming out of his element with him.
