Andrea Roussein was an expert in French Calls "Theater de Boulevard": where you find the eternal triangle: male / female / (male or female) lover Most of his plays gave him some of his best portions on Elv's Popesco stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason for watching them, because Roussein is not a gaetree with a long shot. The French audience thinks "non theater cory sori". <br /> <br /> still with me? Rusin's plays were not portrayed. And this is a pretty middle element, even if the scrollbakers call Luis Carroll for their rescue. I like Stewart Granger and David Neven and Awa Gardner eye candy. But this may be their worst movie, weird, predictable - even the native (interlude) interference is also humorous - a not-out French around Menezes. Troy is a desert island in which Granger is a kind of Robinson, Niveen, Gardner will be his daughter on Friday and Friday.
