The opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. Many can be forgiven for enjoying some pictures, (60 shot hand guns, heroes with super human power, all women gorgeous and half nude) but Puyulius "Atline on My Intelligence 13" came so far that I imagine the second day of filming was shown. <br /> <br /> First, how would these people be the police? I'm based on fools. How the main female character Detroit is half naked in the middle of winter or they justify the hack wherever Actually no character responds to any of these elements in this film. There is no window, no electricity (which miraculously comes back unpredictable) during the century's storm and they are comfortable in gardens like all holes. No technology exists that disables all cell phones, radios, and brain functions. It could be the same power that Maria Bela could walk on her walking vehicle and walk without any dress anywhere.
