Some movies just ??? Apa These movies have clearly emerged in a cell phone with great virtue and potentially great ideas, but not just budget budget and / or professional cast and crew members are not settled to do it. "Strangeness" is definitely included in this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and humiliating movie of the horror fans of the 80 must admit that the film reaches the median level due to neutral atmosphere, clam slop-stop effect and inefficient dark painting. There is a rough real conspiracy and setting of "The Strangence" (well, just like "Buenos Aires" but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hilman has deliberately trapped a fellow 80-bit colleague) and the players are also giving encouraging performances. miscast me An analyst with amateur speleologists went on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike Mine. Many years ago, many mines died mysteriously there and the place was abandoned since then, but there seems to be a lot of gold hidden in it to stop there forever. Shortly after the entry into the mines, the group members met the small ruler of a Gold Spike mine; An Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward. During most running time, "The Strangence" is a boring and incapable mess that is hard to follow due to the complete lack of light. Characters are weird and mine retains a mystery because only the light effect comes from the spiral helmets. In the first hour there is a very small step or scary experience, but director Hilman has impressed the audience's attention by showing giant bits and pieces in a spectacular break. As soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacles, you are finally destroyed to keep watching. The creature is realized with the effects of stop-motion, which I usually worship and worship, but here in this case they are very weak and sad. The person responsible for special effects will pay more attention to Ray Harryousen's work. Death sequences are largely off-screen and there is very little doubt about the whole film. A horrible flick with such a setting should benefit from clustrophobic atmosphere and unknown sound effects, but there is a lack of "curiosity". The biggest tram of the film is oddly beautiful actress Terry Barreland's beautiful look. Like Mother Theresa, I feel like a spirulist, but she must be looking at her tight white top and beige pants.
