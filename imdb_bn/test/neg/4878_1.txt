After watching this picture, I did not want to refund my money. I wanted to return my time. I wanted that half-an-hour before my life - it was the most surprising, terrible torture I've come to know about how much my life was worth in this life. I was mad for life, and since this "film" entered my life since I had problems sleeping. I'm trying to suppress the memory, I really am . . But they want me to burn something. <br /> <br />
