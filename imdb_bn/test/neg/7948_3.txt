Precinct on Assault 13: 3/10: A moment that we forget about a remix of A classic action movie on Precinct 13. Assault taken on his own merit completely is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Start with the Rio Bravo style scene. Nearly a dozen people are trapped in a detrimental police station in Detroit (if Detroit has closed the robot's heat and Fiji now, but it can easily be said that the beginning of the credit and nothing has changed.) The fact is that the last bit forest will be more knowledgeable.) Our bad guys are around; Corrupt police <br /> <br /> Now I know what your thoughts are. Corrupt police? Nazi and drug cartels were busy on that weekend? Of course this is no ordinary police. These guys have the right to cover the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yup we have body armor; Helicopter; Laser sightseeing; Night vision goggles So our thirty SAAT Members / Special Forces armed with 4 armed police (drunken mind you new year Eve), 2 party dresses and girls in half a dozen criminals <br /> <br /> How do our heroes protect themselves? They can not be true. They all will be dead in ten minutes top. (There is no rude habit of running behind Windows to know the inside letters.) Now there is no reason to pan an entirely absurd picture of a movie esp. A B-style action film. But unlike Lawrence Fishburn and Ethan Huq, all other characters seem to be comic relief. (At least I hope they were) <br /> <br /> The characters of JA-Rules and LeguZamora are bad enough. Aisha is a small miniature exhibition of cakes. A small stereototypical African American character displayed on the modern screen. Her performance is similar to a frat boy in Blackface and the actress pulls Ghetto. <br /> <br /> A gang member caught an ice cream truck in the original estate and shot the little girls in the neighborhood. I have never had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this attack I have a perfectly reasonable fear of remakes.
