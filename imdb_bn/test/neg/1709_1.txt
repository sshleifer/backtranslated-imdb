Sacred Sweet Murder This is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. You can take my word as true because it is now running on television. It's really one of the most kind of productions I've ever seen. This flick has a single redeemable aspect. It's just a lack of humor. Perhaps what is happening to it is only impossible that it is completely disrespectful. Actually, I'm just sitting with some ridiculous sub-plots and I can not tell the truth about what I'm going to say to you. The only reason I can probably remember this movie is because it is ridiculous, it will depend on my mind forever. <br /> <br /> To be absolutely missed. If your friend wants to show you this, shoot him and save yourself boring.
