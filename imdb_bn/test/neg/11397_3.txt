They said it would be a bigger film than Turk's fruit. <br /> <br /> How dare they are? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting I felt sympathy for the only character <br /> <br /> Angela Shizoff's performance. His performance was the best in the film. The story may be interesting, but it was not. Some scenes are very nice pictures (lights and cameras), (for example <br /> <br /> open view), but bad acting made magic <br /> <br /> Invisible <br /> <<br /> < br /> I do not understand why so many people voted for this picture.
