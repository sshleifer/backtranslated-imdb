Insulting, shallow, material meaningless. How can women (and gay males) enjoy this garbage? No self-respecting man ever wants to live with this neurotic gold digger. What is more than that is that many critics say that they are related to women in grief. If the future of women is done, the Lord helps all of us. Showing freedom and being respected with men should not be spread with different people every three seconds on your own feet. I think these women defame and do not judge them. But this review is no rant against women. Supporters of this event say that it is "ridiculous" and "holesome" but every time I saw this show I struggled to stay awake. Despite the story of a reporter woman, there is no such thing at any stage of the event that might be considered as reasonable thoughts. So, it's not entertaining, and it's not informative, so why would you be bothered to see it? Ten big one out.
