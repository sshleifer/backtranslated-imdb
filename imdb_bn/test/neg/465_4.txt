I must say that I was not impressed, because perhaps I expect more from this movie. Maybe a verses on religion versus science or the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you want to think of something after watching this movie do not do it. It's more emotional than the philosopher. In the end, I voted 4, it cleared a bit and because I have great respect for BBC documentaries. Actually there are a couple of very interesting scenes giving some ideas. It was a great idea to add a theory about the theory of evolution, it is very bad that this is not the main issue. Ah, I just wanted to say that for 1 hour, the movie is quite annoying and cruel on one side.
