Although Charlie Chaplin made some fantastic little comedy in the late 1910s, others did not make it. He remembers his new job and examples like Shanghai, and I'll be the floorwalker in this section too. <br /> <br /> Charlie makes a mistake in the department department manager (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from cash articles and drives one for them, and Charlie blames only for a worthless person but stealing anything else to hide something hidden. <br /> <br /> There are not many people with a great view of the escalator, laughing at it without the last few minutes or more. For the others, quite frustrating. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
