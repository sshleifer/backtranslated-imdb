Kidman and the law lack chemistry to create this brutally managed, poorly written romance / melodrama compose at any other level outside the grandiose. Kidman Paute and <br /> <br /> Pisces for his absent boyfriend law wistfully. He jumped to fight south of civil war and he exchanged only 5 sentences and one kiss, but they were completely hurt. The main aspect of the law seems to be 'zero and shell-shock, but sensitive.' Ren Zeljgar is about the only Spark on this drayry script, but he's very broad and high on it, as he gets 'Annie your song.' How are ya ha ha boy Something about his character seems to have come from a 'Holy Grill' in the Monty Python sketch, where the peasants do not spend their time without making any reason for making them pottery. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of the way she can go. Together, their scenes are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian era novel. <br /> <br /> Whenever the action is full of tidium, almost all the writers shout 'Simon Legi-type villain'! 'And Tig (Ray Winston) is not coming out of his unexpectedly brutal way to work, such as the incredible God-fearing urban villagers who are cruelly killed by the name of loyalty to the fastest fading. <br /> <br /> <br /> . All the other time, he is missing out on action, which is also overwhelming in this cornball script. Most of the other talented actors who have trusted performances in small titles are mostly. These characters join the character because he has done his Johnny Apelisade Tray from the front line, where he disappeared, from Kidman's expectant love hug near Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, this letter does not matter. The law has no time for them or their life. Each of these miniature movies has the same tired theme: The war is gale-duro heck, and otherwise it makes suitable Christian people into detestable animals. <br /> <br /> and the script is very expected, very heavy. Moreover, the pacing of the story is horrific slow. For the inevitable reunion of the Romodo and Juliet you were waiting for the whole movie, Kidman grabbed his hand and started laughing, the law exceeded incredible curiosity and doodling bullets. And finally comes when you no longer care about. You are thinking about how much you have to bear this watch. <br /> <br /> I give a five star out of the fight scene. Here's a strong anti-war message. The unbelievable lack of concern for the concerns of the loss of life of both the parties on the conflict is strong power. But it's only 15 minutes for a 150 minute dog.
