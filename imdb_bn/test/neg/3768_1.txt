Experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky has a phrase, who says that some films are arranged like a camera mounted on a dog's head, which melts, and everything softens along the way. <br /> <br /> This is how the movie is. The structure "started as a child, then he became a child, then a young man, then a film director, then he started to create 'masterpiece', then he grew old and finished." To illustrate the output of the Qur'an, many of the words 'Masterpiece' have been used in this film, which does not explain their * movies so well / superb. The off-screen tale of reading a script simply says that a movie is a wonderful composition, do we want to kiss her back kisses and take a particular movie in a great film of 20th century art? And one more point. Paul Schofield's voice is used as voice of Kuruswaw, when quotations from the director's memoirs are to be screened. She brought the texture of animal Shakespeare tone ... but why? Are you making a documentary about Holiday Holiday, you use Dame Judy Densch as her voice ????
