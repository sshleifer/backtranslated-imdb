I like the original P. And Bladings (2) and Ashes Ashes (3) were somewhat satisfied, then I saw part 4th. Oh boy ... As a pumpinghead enthusiast, I've tried my best to give as much credit as part 4, but it's quite bad. The wedding reception party on the right in the beginning of the film is a terrific mess for one thing. Hatfield and McCau's story is impossible fools and cliche. How can the producers get away from the tired family using fud tales? Wow, incredible. Acting without Henriensen, down the average. The plot and script is mind-numbing. Actual execution and cinematography mean, as the average. I mean, the film is not a total loss. As always: I really enjoy watching Pumpkinhead, I love seeing Haggis Witch, and like seeing Scary of Harley in action. But all three letters were the time too during the screen. I thought Haggis and Hurley would go out of an evening club to eat and drink food on one evening, just as there were so many friendly friends in her cabin. The bottom line .... I want to have all these characters in this cruel source dead in 20 minutes at the beginning of the film. Where is this so-called "film production professional" science-fai? I could do a good job of writing a script stone cold drunk. I was sure to have a limited budget and everything, but come! See if you have a fan of three, but only once. And then go back and original two stick. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
