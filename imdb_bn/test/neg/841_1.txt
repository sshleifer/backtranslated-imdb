Okay, so one night I and some friends really decided to get the stone and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we 'go to Ernest Africa.' I do not have so much laughter in my entire life. This movie is beyond the bad. I've made good films in literally meaning than going to Ernest Africa. <br /> <br /> <br /> The highlight of this photo was at least an open order for me, when Ernst faced face-to-face. When they showed him with a torch size head, I lost it. Perhaps I found this fun because I was the most at that time. Perhaps you are right. <br /> <br /> If I can guess George W. Bush's favorite movie, then I would guess 'Ernest goes to Africa.' I do not see any other movie on the stereotype of 1950's color man. There was a time when the word ran away and I was just scared. <br /> <br /> I saw it, but I was not surprised, this movie is meant for children? Educated adults actually see this? How could possibly the full franchise of 'Ernest' movies? Is it really my life? Is this real? <br /> <br /> I hate this picture.
