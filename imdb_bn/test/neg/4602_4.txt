Clearly, this film was made for a new generation that might or may not strengthen Charles Bukowski's work. In the Bukowski's stories, the autobiographical Henry Cinzki character is portrayed in the 1987 film 'Barfly' as Mickey Rovers, which is played by Dunaway. Anybody who has seen the 'fact' must definitely see 'Barfli', so that Bokości sees his character better. The lack of weird seedlings of 'Factotam' Bokoosky screenplay and fearless despair of his inferior hero. Unintentional humor that does not work due to the dark frustration of the mischief of Chinsky, Dylan does not work, because it is highly appreciated for bloody blooded blood of too much medication. Rook's character defines pain and pleasure of last night's misery as a place for another deadly day of drunken maternal uncle's unknown author's life. The Dillon character misses these symbols for the ultimate, handsome, relatively clean looking author, which rarely passes for any moment in the story of Chikkasi. Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda ne'er-do-well Henry perfect complement Factotam women can not hold a candle in Dunaway's 'annoying goddess' and the use of more sexually explicit sexual content in 'factotum' is proven to be irrational confusion compared to the raw and non-scientific hat of Bokości. Defective relations portrayals. I was surprised to see how many scenes of the same scene were used in 'Facttum' (Merissa Tomomi purchases all things and charges an old man, a proper rip off from 'Barfli'). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best Bukowski story in the movie, look for 'Barfli' and 'Love to a Dog Hale' (also known as 'Crazy Love Title').
