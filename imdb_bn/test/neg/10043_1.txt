In the first scene of the film, the first 5 minutes of the film looked unique and curious to look after, I could stay there and walk with my life. He got some interesting comments and feedback from his subjects, but not enough to get involved with the film's legitimacy. <br /> <br /> I also think that he went a little more left with a lot of things. If a person makes a bad comment, takes him or makes some annoying gestures to him, then I will go for him, bring him down, he is a dry. Although he bothers me, he will clean the clothes and roam and people will be surprised when they look at him. <br /> <br /> I think that he is attracted to other people's sexuality and we are all who are a big part. Men will look at beautiful women, especially when they get dressed excited, just as women look at men wearing a tight tank or a shirt. <br /> <br /> Some women may hate me for this, but I do not hope. I have many respect for women. I was raised by one. I come from a Spanish family and we are very maternal. My grandmother was my family center for years, but I do not think that I do not think anything about helping women's rights and what the filmmaker said, some women were offended by her project.
