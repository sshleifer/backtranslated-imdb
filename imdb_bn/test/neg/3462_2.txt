OK, where do I start? I saw a screening a few weeks ago and I saw how bad this movie is. If you like Beverly Hilbilis and Green Access, and you think they're the best TV show in the air but you definitely love this movie. I personally, I really like George's work and he is very talented, but the comedy is not his force. Some people are normal in the comedy and I'm sure they are funny and funny to work with, but the comedy can not pull it on the big screen. It was an intelligent movie but would I have to pay $ 12.00 to see it? Hrl !!!! Now I have seen that I will not recommend anyone to spend their money. George, friend, I love you but please do not do any comedy? There is a lot of these scripts, lack of great ideas but just do it.
