In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Bealles) goes to the apartment of his boyfriend Bill (Christopher Casinos), who lives with his children, teenage Lacey (Sarah Rohmer) and son Jake (Matthew Knight). The next door, the strange thing happens with their neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Gray 2" is a scary woman and the boy has scary words and visual effects, and I was surprised by the movie several times. However, the complex scrapple with three subpages is completely confused, which makes the Antibin story completely messy. There are too many letters and situations, and at a certain moment I was completely lost with lost and isolated stories. Finally, I was completely frustrated with this confusion, but the spectacular film too. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("Scrum 2")
