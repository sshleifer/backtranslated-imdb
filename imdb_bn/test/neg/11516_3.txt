'Stay with me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. Talk among themselves and whenever you want and it will end it back at some point. <br /> <br /> Well, I've seen it alone, and so I felt that I often saw the worst, longest and most harmful emotional beer commercial in the world when I was able to keep my eyes open until finally the credit rolled; And then I operated in a few moments of wake up to see 'thank you' at movie sponsors (which is Asia Pacific Brewery). Ah! Methot how wonderful it is * that * - all the shots of Tiger Beer are included in this most forgotten smoke in the movie? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, dialogue begins with people with STAB, but in the overall story of the film everything is not known for special progress. It seems that anyone can switch at any moment and come back later and worry about the overall progress of the movie, in that case you will not miss an exception which may be part of any disrespectful attack or its plot. So the final "wallpaper movie"! <br /> <br /> I'm surprised ... which movie have you reviewed positively? I am surprised and amazed continuing ... it certainly could not have been this arty of the uneducated Singapore excuse for the camera's rolling. Slowly, "Bea with Me", "love, tragedy and release" is supposed to be knit around things. But all the things I saw were all boring, half-baked scrapple, which toured the message of the gourmet text messages, and the only release was when this complete vain movie ended. What a stunning waste of time, it ended up being! It was also said that the characters of this movie were fantastic except Theresa Chan, who was "a great woman who had won the problem ...", was not disrespectful to Mr. Chan, but she is such an extraordinary and extraordinary character, why the most relentless efforts of integrating screenplay into their life Other than the characters to be involved? Yet it has still proven to be an almost unbearable movie with highlights that include rolling credits. Rather than grabbing the fate of all characters, I really felt that the film has almost made an impossible effort and can obviously be associated with the engagement of the observers in the rectum. <br /> <br /> I'm usually an industrial-house movie fan and usually slow motion (which is no lack here, believe me !!). I hate 300 movies, such as Transformers, Fight Club, but consider, Eder, Eric Row as a great filmmaker. So I hope that my perspective keeps in some perspective. However, there was no redeemable feature between concept and delivery of the whole film, which is like 'Stay with me' every minute as soon as it drops slowly on one's eyes. See this movie if you need to feel like a waste of time. Otherwise your life will be someone rich to miss it. 3/10
