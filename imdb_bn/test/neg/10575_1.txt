This is the most painful movie of my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this picture with my friends and if the film was not a single person in the movie theater - there were many people there watching this horror movie - "Wow is good movie." Someone actually went out! It was absolutely terrible! It was boring and I hated every minute. After the scene with Rick on trim peeing, he was enough because my friend is putting his head on my shoulders towards the end. It was not all fun. Believe me I went with 11 other girls and did not like this one of my friends. It was ridiculous! I saw many movies but it was absolutely bad! I think a scene in the movie is made with an old man in a coffin with a dead person. I just can not do this thing up.
