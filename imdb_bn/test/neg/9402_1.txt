Please do not see this. I was very laughing throughout this movie, but they were all due to the unknown comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so how bad was the development of character. Passino played Casino again and was growing up most of the time. In the scene of this movie it seems that they were merged into another 20 bad films by the poor poor editor. There is no continuity and I thought about myself why I was not 15 minutes left in it. <br /> <br /> I never d J. Caruso. This was really awful.
