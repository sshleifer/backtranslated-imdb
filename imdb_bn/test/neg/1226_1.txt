Was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lomnome Dove but this was total trash. Cinematography was terrible. Very tight way shot. The Grand Canyon was almost through a fixed telescope. The editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. I do not know whether the dialog was terrible if not Macmarty screen. Actually the Wall of Keller's Vat Eurep Doc Holiday Screenplay, but what was the hack with this character on the Crow Moon? I have no idea. It looks like it was shot in a sound level using the old banana set. How did the director of the main Lonemore Dove become so wrong? Where was his head .............. can not say much for acting. It is embarrassing to surround a beautiful West that might have touched it just like it. See other reviews are read and others feel the same way. It's not even strange to see the next few nights, because it's time to waste the first night. <br /> <br /> (second post) .............. .... OK, there was nothing else on TV, so I have to be honest and have to admit that I I saw the moon last night at the moon moon. And I really want to say that I could not finish it at the end of the last two episodes because I was asleep! I can only admit that I see two main characters very closely and I can choose some of the methods that Steve Jhan did while acting, Dulal did such a wonderful job. So I must lend to Jhan. The screenplay of Karl Nagar .... Easy Dead Meat. Only once again can I say that I am very disappointed because I cared much like the original LD ​​and others ....... I really protested the real feeling of the West.
