All right, I read the directive of this movie (Featured as 'Most Commented'), and I must admit that I can get to know her position. <br /> <br /> Michael, I hope your career will be a special hazard to rescue you and you went to other, good things. I saw the form of MSST3 in this movie. Even with all the continuing continuation and undergraduate comments of robots, I've seen a potentially decent film, with an ambitious set of efforts for limited budget and limited efforts under limited actors. And it is one of those movies ("Mitchell" another) where MST 3 takes many cheap shots in the crew lead character, even when he was really good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Are not eligible) to keep it from <br /> <br /> But it's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the writer / lead actress for whom she It was necessary some years before his performance and writing skills became more mature, as he would be able to drag such a vanity project or carry a feature film. Writing and characterization is amateur and slapdash, and the dialogue is often up to the special value of ABC Afterschool. Cruelly earnestly makes it their best effort, and in general, acting must be on the head and shoulders above conception like "future war" or "space rebellion", but there is no professional level performance here, except for the exception 'Big Joe' Estevez, who are hammy but intensely intense. I did not see the entire original cut, but the MST's sample of "Sultan" was enough to represent these events easy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Robert Z. has this picture. That's IMO, a real 'Kiss of Death' for any movie that will be taken seriously. Yes, he is looking big and scary for his role, but I hate the guy just as an actor. (In real life, I wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> I like some about this picture. For example, camaraderie among male leads and her dead friends adds some warmth and humor to the movie and makes it more viewable. The concept of an elifrier in the hospital, which later opened its doors, was the motivating way to invent some vicious sleepiness without springing for special effects, and I respected anyone who respected the work that was done in the script to manage the budget. This does not really work, but it may be with some more techings. So anyway, Mr. Risi, good luck with your other projects - I can not hold you because of your involvement with this muffin 'buzz' was good if you were from some other observer. And there's nothing to be ashamed of Miss Miller - he was young and ambitious, and the movie was not bad.
