I have read all the other comments which made this movie an excellent movie. I said that excellence is shown nothing. I thought it was long and annoying. I try twice to see it For the first time I was asleep and second time I finally made it in six minutes and gave up. I think this was mainly my fault with great hopes, but I do not think that it completely destroyed the film for me. The movie was just blame. It was spectacular or nothing that was unique to it. The plot was not half bad, action sequences exist, dialogue is compulsory and the film has gone forever. I would not recommend watching this movie.
