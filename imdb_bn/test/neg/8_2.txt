Although I'm not a big fan of musical instruments, this might not technically qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give love to the movies of war. It was the best. <br /> <br /> Hudson came out completely from this role in the role. It just does not work for me. Julie Andrews probably played his part as well as his part, but I find it hard to buy him as a conniving, fraudulent spy. Sorry, I know that it is classic stereotyping in my part. But I think July is looking its most beautiful and feminine. I always thought of being more than a mother tongue, but then definitely the role of Sound of Music and Mary Poppens. There is no doubt that they are trying to get out of this type of cast in this role. He was quite beguiling to look here, but I still do not buy him as a spy. <br /> <br /> I can not keep my focus through the whole movie and getting myself tuning in and out - and having conversations in my room (which I usually do - I'm always all silent). So it tells how much you held my attention. Do not waste your time!
