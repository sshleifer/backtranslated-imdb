Originally harped as a series of "The Slumber Party Genocide" series, this film fell flat on his face with a new title. First of all, if you are going to include the word "genocide" in the title of your movie, you will be better off distributing it. This one certainly does not. There is no power, no screen killings, and no chain, because box art will guide you to believe. Instead, we get the ultimate overdone plot of a thin, one group of cheerleaders who stuck in a abandoned cabin on the way to the football game, only one after the other. Again, if this film is correct then the guru's compute is a bit more. Directors, especially those who are flicking straight to videos, are afraid to show me outside of anybody. Now, I'm not a huge fan of Gore, but let's ... why would anyone hire a movie called "Cheerleader Genocide"? In addition to that problem, the film is suffering from a shot-on-a-home-video camera camera. It looks cheap, sounds cheaper, and the actors do all that well. It tries to throw off the track that could be our killer, but even that failed. The end is a ridiculous mess. People, if you run across this movie, then walk and find out the original "Slum Party Party Genocide". 10 out of 2
