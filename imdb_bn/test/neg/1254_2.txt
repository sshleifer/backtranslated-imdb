A week ago, after reading the book "Wonder of Wond", I was thinking, "It will make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players". I was totally surprised when browsing in the video store last night. I did not really have any idea of ​​this turned into a film. I caught it immediately and saw it with many prospects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, maybe Ugar might be a burning creator, but he was also a brilliant thinker who can naturally read to humans. That makes him so impressive. Why not focus on that? <br /> <br /> and talk about the truth about the truth below the water. This man was absolutely extraordinary about everything: medicine, women, gambling, hunger, lack of sleep. From evening till dawn, he gambled at the sporting event, he was absent for a few days while hanging on a crack dancer, his body was frustrated forever, and if he ever needed money, he could only defeat him by playing a card. Now it's a story! <br /> <br /> He spent a lot of time in his childhood and personal relationship (though his relationship with Vincent and his daughter rarely touched) and there was very little about his drug (which was too much) , His crazy gambling and his incredible card-playing ability. <br /> <br /> It's probably too late, but I hope someone will reinstate this movie. I had no problem with Imperioli. She is excellent. The script just left him with nothing interesting to say.
