Plot: A trucker (crucifixion) bands his fellow truckers together to fight a corrupt Sheriff (Borgin) and builds an unstable coal for miles and quickly creates national media frenzy. <br /> <br /> Negative: The film's setup is weak and the end is even weak. In this process, there are all good-boy-boy / trucker clinics without adding something new. It creates smoky and dots look bright and inspired. Kristofferson may not be too back-to-back and pictures for a leading human role. Borgnine's character is portrayed oddly. At the beginning, he found the real shock of a sheriff who influenced the whole thing on a minor challenge that started rolling. Then he is a bit more sympathetic and even secretly tolerant with Kristofferson, which does not work at all. In any case Jackie Gleason is a good actor for this role. Although the worst part of the film is the effort of throwing a 'deadly message' into one of the stupid activities of the director Pikinpah, which does not slow down and bombard the process. <br /> <br /> Positive: Only in the whole picture is the sequence of war between the good truck stop restaurant. Director Pekinpah kept a funny spin for his trademark 'slow' violence and the result was fun. Unfortunately, in the rest of the film, gradually it all started until the end of the work is tiring. McGraw is always delighted to see, but unfortunately he is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> The following: If you read the summary mainly than the movie 'Meet' The song based on this movie is quite good, but the film did not add anything and it should not have been made. This is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director. <br /> <br /> Routing: 10 out of 3
