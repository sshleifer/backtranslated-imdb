One of the following is one of the classic B movies one of the 2 hobos. It's really cheesily and big stupid is running off one liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals his every scene as Cripazide Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is going to the launch crowd and the father's voice 10 octaves ("You Like Him?") Danny, the Big Stupid Project, is a stupid fool, but not as flexible as our lead star. There is also a diverse scene of a man in Diner's ants. Joyce Meadows is sweet, nice girl and probably less annoying. And those ruffles yellow (RAWR!). Oh, and sweet stupid according to the dirt is bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is hot. See MST's cover and respect the Crow's awesome!
