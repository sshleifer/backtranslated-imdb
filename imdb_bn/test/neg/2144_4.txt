Black EYE (2 outta 5 stars) It appears to have been made for television in the movie '70 of the unmountedly depicted ... only occasionally a theorem for Kos sounds and homosexuality that you actually see in the theatrical film. Fred Williamson was a tough guy who became a tough guy private eye who is the former police. He stumbles upon a few murders and tries to assassinate links with a mysterious rattan. There are also some boxing, a Bullet-Inspired Car Chase, a fairly real elevator scene and Williamsen's affair, while facing the lesbian lover of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). Williamson ransacked a poor old man by plundering some precious old-fashioned photos of his monumental shop and also saw a scene. Yes, the road, the tough guy ... maybe you can find a shit to kill later? Of course, "shaft" (this and almost six thousand other films) cash for success, meaning that there is not enough edge or enough fundamental to make the most of the film.
