This German horror movie I have seen to be the wonderful one. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but it is supposed to be based on the real character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is repeatedly beaten by his father in the face of deaf and silent. He has a doll idol, but I can not find out from that. His colleagues find him and make him very angry. <br /> <br /> During the day lightly accountant, and at night he is suffering from grave and funeral homes and drink blood of dead girls. They are all interesting, of course, otherwise we would not be worried about the issue that he usually wears his clothes around the waist. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange movie that is very dark and very slow, Warner Pothath never speaks and blood during his time.
