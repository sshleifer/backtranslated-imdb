When I first saw I was fairly scary about it bit. But the horrific incident is frustrating that these malicious teenagers are so annoying that you do not really care about what's happening to them. Angela's statement about some really good moments such as the monster, and in a short time the monsters themselves are effective. But this does not really stand up to see repeated or close analysis. It's all quite durable and cheap looking and often ruthless, all too often awful replacements of pornography and illogical wiseracks. The music is excellent, however, and the episodes are interesting, but there is not much to recommend this film, it has only been added as another Jason-type stock-and-slash fare.
