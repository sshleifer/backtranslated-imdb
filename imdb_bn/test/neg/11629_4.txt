Let's get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and spent a lot of time in church and in a very religious family, and talking to priests as home. It was beneficial in two ways: to build a believer atheist from me and give me deep, insightful knowledge about the church and its dogs. And I say: If a Catholic priest is witness to the assassination and clearly see the murderer's face, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer then accepts it. He can not reveal what he said in confession, but he can talk about what he sees outside and confession is in vain to keep his mouth shut. So, here's a movie completely sustained on the lies. And there is no blame for another lie. According to the Catholic Church, there is absence of sin for as long as there is genuine repentance. So far, this weak thriller's biggest plot hole. <br /> <br /> People will often say that if this movie is developed then Bob Hossin and Alan Betts will change the role. Naturally appropriate to play Haskins gangster (I would not be too embarrassed to miss that he lost favor with Al-Kieron's poor performance) and Bates' attributes were perfect as a priest with a gray past. But apart from that, I think this movie became even better, life in real life was part of Alster Native Liam Nixon (then most of the audience was unknown) in Mickey Rour. Not only is it not perfect to play painful characters in his face, but he wants us to believe in the realities of character, Raukake can not do anything. At the end of the 80's, Rauaukek was not a bad actor (later losing his talent with his face), but he was one of the actors like Brad Daurif, who worked well as a director. And as a former IRS terrorist, there was more to play Rouke. It seems that this movie was created just three to six years later (when Nissan achieved moderate celebrity status with the "Shindler's List" in 1993, with Sammy Raimi's enjoyable "Darkman" and SuperStormam in 1993, and Roure is very beautiful One has been forgotten), Liam and Mike could have shared the switch in more parts (Roor was given the role of Doherty support, but this film Ratike leadership can not be taken). Yet another missed opportunity, and another movie about the possibility of being a classic, which immediately became forgotten rent. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, often critical score (by underrated musician Bill Conte) works for me. I found it overly-melodramatic, but suitable gritty and beautiful. This reminds me of Howard Shore's score for "Lamb's silence". Here is the talent of Mike Hodges, who has created "Garter Carter", yes, but do not forget that he has "flash gordon" as well as mastermind ... <br /> <br /> It seems the genocide has shot the Katia room (it shows That some parts are really sticky and confusing, and others are not just glue) and are waiting to see a director's cut light. All right, but I seriously doubt that it will make a great movie, because we still have bad casting and false evidence. 4/10.
