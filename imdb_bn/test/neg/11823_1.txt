This will be the perfect worst movie ever seen in my life's life. Writing and acting is just sad. It's sometimes made right with the worst movie Uncle Sam all the time. However, when I'm able to do this on a video, it inspires me to follow my wild dreams of filmmaking because I know that I can do better than the killers of the killers.
