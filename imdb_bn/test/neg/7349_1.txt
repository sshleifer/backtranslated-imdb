I've seen this show for a while, only for my cousins, and I hate it! First of all, girls wear the same style dress, and their first letter is in the name. (Come on, I could have been better than this!) Then Wilen (let me go), first we have a monkey with his (small) brain part, then we have a gay version of Satan, a pink hill, another gang green gang (White, ironic, this is their name) a damned princess (again, ironic, her 'her name'). I saw that there are no male heroes on the show. (That's not sexist or anything ...) I'd rather see the sailor's moon, it's much better than this. If anyone else wants to see the show in the room you are in, then find ways to break television. Believe me, it will save you half an hour. <br /> <br /> Ratings: I'm blaming it, it's 1 in 10. Whatever you do, do not see it!
