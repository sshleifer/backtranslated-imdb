Why ???? An intriguing movie from a supposed movie ... It looks like a cute movie from a poster .. no frustration .. who is male? He looks like an old retired retired police .... I'm a policeman and I can say .. people can not work ... there is going to be a policeman ... there is no screen present ... why they have seen their bare ass , As he did Mel Gibson, not hell ... the filmmaker is left out of business .. This guy does not have any business to make a movie ... I seriously doubt that the woman None of the gay men ... that makes him interesting is the movie in which no talent hack hack hack has no leadership. It is great that our white boys have always found Asian women, but why is a ugly white guy not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as a white boyfriend? Why do I see Asian girls like ugly white guys or black guys ??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ugly Asian girls who think they can work hot and ??? <br /> <br /> At the end of only two actors in this movie, a hot white chick in the host's host and massage house, TL Young and Kate Holly Movie wanted to move towards the movie. <br /> <br /> Asia character is ridiculous It seems as if he could be a gato / sexy black girl ... here the original word is "trying" <br /> <br /> <br /> You can not work and you can not work for this type of role Sharari Way is not hot enough. You have to be characteristic of character and more modest. <br /> <br /> I think actress Gina Hirazumi ... I saw her at IMDB and she is a great Asian actress ???? If that is the case, I do not want to see what bad Asian American actress is ... <br /> <br /> No wonder Hollywood's Asian American actor !!! If they are good !!! They won the Asian Film Award for any kind? Pause me ... It looks like they have made a movie for cloaking Asian girls. They are not even hot ... Guinea ... you are not hot .. stop trying. Play the role of character and improve your performance. .. you are not a leading woman ... <br /> <br /> If these movies can fly money pigs .. Sorry for the curiosity but I think these actresses / actresses are both curious Leaders must work on their crafts: except for the two actors, I have mentioned who should be led under the leadership .. I love the love for Asian filmmakers of these movies, please tell your parents what to say and go and be a doctor / lawyer / engineer. ... and acting next to fun. Hopefully I'm doing what you're doing now. I do not mean it, but hopefully it will be read and you also get good people or do any other business. This movie did not even have a message even morally. <br /> <br /> If the "soap girl" secretly ku klux I'm not surprised if members of Kl are paid by members but Asian Americans hate a special campaign clan. <br /> <br /> Otherwise Asian people must hate themselves .. Watch this movie I am grateful to the audience that I am not Asian ... ..your people are tragic. Some self-respect to the Asian people.
