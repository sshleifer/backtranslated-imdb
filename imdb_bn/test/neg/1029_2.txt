It is hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey created this junket, the candle can not hold candles in the show in the past, including the Enamorle Legacy, Rachel Ray is not the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in TV history. Since Anthony Harriet was a horrific cooking show host, I saw at least Anesely Harriet has some good moments and some styles, there is no such style, it looks terrible as a host, disrupts the kitchen, the article is awesome, the top of the telepoli and the opening credits are so bad; Makes me sick Now I enjoy the style of cooking style, but absolutely nothing of it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
