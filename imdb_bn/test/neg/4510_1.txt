I rarely see one of the very badly translated works on the screen. Violent customs of B-Movie and Seitcom Exxurs seem to be just as bad as Jewish custom. The worst is Melissa Gilbert, you hate scenes and do not develop sympathy. Should be mentioned against acting like this and should be used against actors willing to work again. Above all, the TV made for a diverse, low-budget TV-made film that gives television movies a bad name.
