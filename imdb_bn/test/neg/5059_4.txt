Mr. Motore has a fairly straightforward forum in Gambell - when a mysterious mystery is faced with a stylish murder, the more mysterious to solve the case. Until the moto <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the number of positive reviews of Mr. Motore in Gambling at IMDB. Because my ... well, I found it extremely frustrating. I enjoy Mr. Matto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can not say that I take care of this naughty mascara. For the strangers with the story behind Mr. Motore's gambal, it was originally called Charlie Chan film. But when Warner Oland was backed out, then Peter Lor and M. Some scenes and actions of the motif are rewritten. I pointed out that the last result kept me uncomfortable. Mr. Mito Chen He is more mysterious, he is more athlete, and he is more exotic. So trying to keep moto in the Chan film is trying to fit the square of a square in the round hole - it does not work. And try to deliver one of Shan's trademark euphemisms to the Lorre / Moto listen-up, just end up fooling the word. Add to this that I have already made about 10 minutes of the runtime of about 72 minutes in boxing scenes (something that I have never enjoyed) and you've finished a movie that I can not help but hate. I would point out the performance of Keye Luke if I have to say something positive. But he is not too close to save Mr Motore's gemball in my eyes. Sorry, but 4/10 I can give it the best.
