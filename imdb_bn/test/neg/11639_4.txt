On Blackface, a man lands in a spaceship and lives a few chicks with a monkey as well as a girl. He hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to do Charleston. Then they fly back into the spaceship, leaving the rear monkeys. On one side of the Cringe-inducing blackface, this short film makes no sense. I think it's a plot, but I'm not sure by a long shot. Despite its characteristic humanity, it can not say at the time of Renoir's work. Good use of slow speed, though. NY film Annex's experimental film Video series 18, I believe.
