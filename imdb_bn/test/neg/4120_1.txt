Tedium can only do it as Fred. I checked my watch for 7 minutes for the first time, and if I left 143 minutes, I also told to walk. I will not even try to discuss the "plot" or incompetence of characters because almost 1 hour, I did not understand which of these is not in the standard. It is not self-motivated or induced, it was a vacuum. Vacuum sucking a soul. This image is a gift to save, no enjoyable character, nothing funny and sad. It's not smart enough to be a drama and there's no harmful moment at all. The most curious thing about this movie is how it is managed to get mostly shining and positive reviews. I was tricked by those reviews, but you do not have to be gentle reader. I want my three hours back for Christmas.
