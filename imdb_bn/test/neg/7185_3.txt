I'm not writing too much to tell you that many, many, many, Lucas (little heroine) are walking and seeing something! Yes And you will know that the first third of the film is meaningless, meaningless, and much more is ignored for the rest of the film! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most humble person among them is all young Lucas, being blind and needing an operation. See, he is confused, terrible delusion! He thinks a killer is preferring blind women! He walks around a lot and works like an incredible blur! <br /> <br /> There is no patience with this movie. In the end, the plot and events are just confusing and neutral, and it is very difficult to understand what the meaning of a night or any other night picture. Nothing is cleansed, the film moves at a snap speed and it throws me with the same effects of hangover. <br /> <br /> The British were not fooled by "frightened of darkness". Americans do not like; They make annoying.
