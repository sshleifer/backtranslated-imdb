Along with this, "Guinea Pig" was not created as Flickr (it was inspired by "Flesh and Blood Flowers" or "Devil's Test") and does not promote any real philosophy, this video feature, which is not only a length feature, adds hardcore sex ( Mosaic Sensing) with its inspiration. Special make-up effects, which include stomach slitting and isolation, are quite good, if overlit is. The feel of the amateur's production is a distraction. It looks all cheap and lazy. The light is rigid and sound and editing is sloppy. The simple story ends in acting a real snuff movie in which a porn actress involved. When he gets tired of abuse, real torture will start. In the film's hero scene, an actor opens the womb of women at the graphic closeup, stuffed her inside her and proceeded to do her work. I could not find "Psycho - The Sniff Reals" amazing. On the contrary, I find it a great effort by one after another "Guinea pig" and his bloody opinion. Interestingly, it is distributed by a leading fetish producer Oroma.
