I saw this picture on TV yesterday. I finished reading the book where the movie was supposed to be. In opening credits it said "it is a free adaptation of the novel of Ec de Quiros". <br /> <br /> The concept of "free adaptation" of Vera Sacramento has turned the story about the influence of the Church on the people and the hypocrisy of man's claim of morality at the end of the 19th century. In a story about sex. In fact, the only thing he accepted from the novel was sex, which was only silently mentioned in the novel Iqa de Quiros. And, of course, the name of some letters <br /> <br /> <br /> As a character, in the novel, Amelia and Joan Edwardo are affected by the church. The Amelia Father was immersed by Amro Aro and all the time it was controlled by. João Eduardo, his mother tongue, was excommunated by priests, because he dared to criticize them. In this movie, Amilia meets her and pleases everyone, and the father Amro is just another victim. Joao Eduardo drug and illegal arms dealer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento created a novel that was wearing an era's moral dress and one of the other (bad) sex with each other Made the movie. Even worse, his story was completely empty of ideas. Two hours cut! Eça de Queiros certainly did not deserve this.
