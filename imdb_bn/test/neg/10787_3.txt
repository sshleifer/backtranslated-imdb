I think the manuscript of this movie was written in toilet paper. There is no respect to any important details which creates the underlying movie. For example, some Serbian terrorists (which I remember) are named by Qadadan Maldik, Ivan Sacha and Leo Hesse. What kind of name is that? Of course not Serbian! On the way, Kadan Maldik !!! What's the name, I smile to think about it. Perhaps an effect on Karadzic and Mladic. Second, there was no incident of terrorism by the Survians. A journalist like the main character should know that. Thirdly, acting actors of Serbian terrorists are not even universal and they do not even talk in the summer-summer. All this aside, this movie is played firmly but the story paper is thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense !!!
