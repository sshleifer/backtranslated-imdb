It was awful plain and simple. What was their message? Where was the movie going? It has all the elements in a sub-grade movie. From the plotless story to the poor performance of the slow-mo movie screenplay. I would like to see a movie like Godfalus, a Bronx Tale, and even Grease very soon. There are no favorite characters. In the end you just want everyone to die. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
