This movie was so horrible that I do not even know where I start ... The only positive thing I can tell about is that Luke Larry has given a good performance. The entire film was everywhere, there was no explanation for the reasons for the explosion (theory only), or the rational for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! The relationship between all the characters and them was so sugar, you just want to laugh !! They had no background. The "love" relationship seems to have been added to the script, it was so painful. There is an army man; Big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, "Stylish! I'm human!" Attitude, such a merciful bad guy Two lateral, who are supposed to be talented, are acting like two 16 year old gentle boys. And then to make some steps, they decided to drop a rock on someone's shoulder and for the rest of the film, they are coughing so that they are dying in pneumonia or something ... and then the hero (everyone's best view !!) Help for ... This is not a good sign when you see yourself smiling in the middle of dramatic scenes ... briefly; Do not waste your time!
