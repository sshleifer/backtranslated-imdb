Mummy's Curse Khariis Mami is the end of the series of films, and creativity seems somewhat dry when they made it. Khariss and his companion Anaka ended in the Gulf of Louisiana, and during his resurrection, he found his beloved princess. It is not completely clear how they are finished in Louisiana, but different people try to find them, the viewer can be guaranteed to kill some mummies. <br /> <br /> I saw mummy's curse, but it was really not something special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I would have seen this before. Quite obviously, except Boris Karloff's main mummy, Mummy's film is not my favorite among the older universal voices. They are not bad, but they are somewhat repetitive. There are some great scenes in the film (for example, Anaa was taking a life of swimming), but overall it was not enough for me. <br /> <br /> If you want to be full and want to see all Mumi movies, it is valuable, but otherwise you want to go to it.
