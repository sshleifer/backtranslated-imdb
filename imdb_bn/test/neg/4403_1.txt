A Brazilian Cable Television is presenting "Yann Ellea" this month on its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer and heard about advertising, and decided to watch this movie. Indeed, it is a strange bizarre altercation with the classical conflict and the "Saltangalar" together, they must be the worst movie I ever wanted to see. I really ruined forty minutes of my life watching the first half of this shit, highly guided for enemy torture. How can this movie be rewarded and nominated for the award in the ear? My vote is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenes Divine" ("Divine Intervention")
