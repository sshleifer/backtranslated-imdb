I do not get too Barnens O ?? That's the weird one I saw. Soundtrack was quite unusual as well ?? Written and performed by Jean Michael Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. I have to admit that I am going to change it often and see someone else instead? Sometimes the movie seems vague to me, or is it boring? Or confusing. Does that movie have several sexual references ?? Empty they are kind of messed up too. Perhaps the only phrase that I will remember, "When you're alone, you can control things"? And "I'll show them" - or something like that. Was the idea that the boy was not growing in that movie? "Last summer as a baby" thought once she ?? And he sure maximum lives in it. So if you have a few hours left you can watch this movie? But if you do not, you will not miss a lot.
