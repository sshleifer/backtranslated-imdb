Well ... Marlin had some cool, vermicultural face shots, his "frustrating", sex-bendere stuff (then absent from him "transmogrification" in humans); But, overall, in general, the generally disrespected plot and dated performances - less distant than the "Berriton" voice of Miss Dyierich's voice - is a little smaller to ensure a permanent place for Pantheon in my mind of the blond Venus memorable movies. Cary Grant - Still in the Symmetrical Childhood Lip - It seems he is looking for "to find himself" forever, although Herbert Marshall was probably not born until his birth, after the birth of Herbert Marshall, there was nothing. Naturally, from the historical point of view, it was fun to see Golden Venus, as long as someone could keep aside ... "Great prospect".
