This film is clearly an agenda, which can be summarized in this way: sometimes do not exceed the boundary (physical or metaphor). Let's look at the wall or fence or something else, on the other hand, evil, devil, or drug dealers by pretending to be all "greenones". All those outside of the country (and especially the US border) are dangerous, helpless and people will hate you, or jealous you or try to steal or steal anything else. Based on "true facts", there is only one reverse tag which can be pinned to something in order to hide some of the credibility or in this case, just below some terrible throats to help prevent the ideology of the film. The film's catastrophes actually diminishes the country, people and others all in very black and white stereoated sections: Mexicans are dissatisfied, Mexican police in a bunch of corrupt policemen, the right-wing body of the People's Republic of the People's Republic of the People's Republic of the People's Republic of Hippi is almost humanist and so forth. Is there anything good about the film? I rarely think, but you might think differently.
