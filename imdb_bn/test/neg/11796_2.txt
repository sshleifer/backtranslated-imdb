This movie has a repetitive dialogue about "cold stain" (a ghost warning) in this movie, and the letters are surrounded by white light to protect themselves. To revitalize the feeling of the film, I will repeatedly refer to the cold spots throughout this review. I've seen a bad movie than St. Francisville's trial, but it can be one of the most forgotten * ("it's cooling!"), Which actually moves around from sleeping in some 20-night rooms. It is pictured as a supposedly real documentary. This is probably not real, but the house has some cold spots. Spinners- (You will not be able to predict most of the plot!). Not much in this movie. As we fear a warm up-up of a "practice" audience, jumping out of a cat's time-honored horror cliche hiding around nearby. People roam around the flashlight, sometimes they take a moment to remind them that they come in peace - which means they can not harm the soul (or cold spots). Now and then a swing off the door and rush to someone. Of course, ouija board makes a look. They chat with a ghost named "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a joke on it. More cold spots. Another door closed, and some people closed the blurted door. Skaff, scuff, he says. Oh my God, someone says. "Surround yourself with white light." I acknowledge that there is a good view of the Atik (where a ghost opens the chair) which really guards me. But except for some funny bad conversations, the only good thing in this film is the chair scene (the actual split-second when it is open, not before or shortly after a moment). But there are still some cold spots here. Finally, the movie ends. Nobody dies No details needed. I was not the big fan of the Blair Witch project, but it seems to be an excellent composition next to the examination of St. Francisville. You can not even debate whether it is a real documentary, but whether it was funny or not. I still do not know. But whatever it wanted to be, it failed.
