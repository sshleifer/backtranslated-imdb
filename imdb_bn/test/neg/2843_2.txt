At first I thought that the story was considered a comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bathroom standing with her again with the lady but the film continued, I got more flat. The plot was stupid with a person that the price of real estate has increased, so now he calls some radio psychiatrist and his anger goes out because he is not good at doing anything. Then the law is involved, and we think that they care about who they are and who goes out of their way to track this person. One suspect is charged with another. This movie is terrible and gradually Adrian B. and her husband's love scenes are annoying and I've got this movie moving forward quickly. Avoid it!
