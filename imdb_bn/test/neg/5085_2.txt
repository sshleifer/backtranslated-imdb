Although it was difficult, if not impossible, but would be seen and not shown due to the horrors, but they were illustrated. Imagine what Costa Gowers can do with this true horror story. The need to deny what I have said is enough, which I subscribe to. What is it about showing us with strong movie power? I think the filmmaker's enthusiasm, perhaps even religious anger, did not allow him to watch clearly from the point of view of the movie. Or, if it was a cinematic point of view, but I mean, a choice, then I do not like it. I was more annoyed by the shot than the movie itself. Well I'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not nearly enough.
