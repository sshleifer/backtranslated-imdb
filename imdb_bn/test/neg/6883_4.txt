It is difficult to comment on this movie. It did not spread to a level of only a few films (why it is hard to come up with one reason) and it was reached on its inaugural day in an inaugural 500 theater. Maybe the Dynaman was afraid that people will respond by responding to how the pieces of pieces collide into pieces. <br /> <br /> Roy Swar is a truck driver, until she rescues a Voodoo priest, a bad car accident, and instead, he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and sinking. Going to the morgue, Ray returns to life, and brings a group of kids to a horrific crash. <br /> <br /> What brings this movie down is the paper's thin character. I do not care about them a moment. Also, the dialog was less than Hu-hum. Also, it was very expected. Characters generally travel to a rock during stupid film characters, such as check crooks, people's name, and movement. I could pick those who would be the ultimate girl immediately. And whenever a person dies or whenever a killer is shown, does the camera have a white glow? <br /> <br /> What good? Well, there is a fascinating mysterious scene where the murderer is walking under the swimming waters to reach his victims and in a deadly sequence where the extreme girl should hide herself with other dead body powder when the killer shows up. <br /> <br /> But other than that, it is another August / September disappointment. I was waiting for it, but I did not get what I expected.
