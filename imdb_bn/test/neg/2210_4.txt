The total idiocy avatars in this movie. Still, I have seen this movie several times and planned to see it more often because, despite its uninterrupted, it is very entertaining. And here is my favorite hockey movie actor, Caspar Van Dien, who is here to complete his hockey-movie glory Here, Caspar Van Deeen will fully love Caspar Van Diane and him for him. If he did not live in this movie, it had become completely obsolete, or at least it was less vicious. <br /> <br /> The "science of cough" used here does not give any idea at all. Nobody else in the world has noticed that in addition to the big asteroid, the big asteroid near the Earth? Even thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers do not constantly search the sky for such things? An asteroid that is big enough to see itself in a pair of eyes even vaguely in sight which has been completely clear to himself. And a bunch of asteroids bounced off the atmosphere and nobody even noticed it? A rock that hit the atmosphere caused a lot of shock, which could cause huge amount of damage to the surface of the planet. Of course, someone will notice such a thing. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this movie is so ridiculous that since it works in any way to make this movie entertaining. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that despite the ebb heat, all the letters were not harmful with sweat and completely soaked with their clothes. In most cases, it seems that the characters went on a little spree to give a "sweat" with a water bottle at a time. * Not to be authentic * A goal that this movie is firmly and continuously for patience. Which, in a strange and humorous way, gives the movie its attraction attraction. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really valuable? Definitely! Guess, of course, you have absolutely * no * expectation that communicates with the remote. And, at this moment you are fairly stupid and luxurious your desire.
