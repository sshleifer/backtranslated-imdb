<br /> <br /> Man, I just can not believe this movie. I saw it completely (believe, I did it!) And the best part was the trill at the beginning (and I hate the trillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No plot, no acting, no no I was watching movies and wondering, "when will this start"? It does not start. <br /> <br /> "Plot": A dog trembles with bat and gets Rebis - OK, there is no problem till now, nothing is fine but okay. Now the rest of the movie will be - dogs will throw people behind !!! That's nothing else !!! Now join me with some bad acting / actors, some completely unreasonable scenes (and some other senseless, the child is breathing and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to look better), and a very hairy end, that's where you CRAP has ... ops! .... CUJO <br /> <br /> Please make a favor of yourself and some more worthy, such as hitting your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gibral.
