What is the point of this photo only? It started as a movie, then changed the track, a resolution in that movie tricked us and ended up like another movie, which is nothing but pale, many other sculls and horror flickers that you have ever seen. Overall impression is a great deal confusion to respect and hubris. Tarantino's screen, Rodriguez's direction, two of those who showed talent earlier, but now believe in their own campaign and think they did only what they did. But it does not work that way. You are only good when you continue doing good things. There are many questions to ask: How are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel involved in this pointless draw? Clooney primarily makes a playful bad guy ?? Completely ruthless and efficient ?? And it was interesting that going where that was. But, of course, we never do. And vampire film Cloni changes into a completely different character. That's not tricky or malicious, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks casually sick sickly throughout, and no surprise. Did anyone see the script in the studio before this project went ahead? Completely unpleasant (and why he thinks as a writer, we will find rape, horrific killings and an illogical hostage rape) in Tenantino assassination. At each level ?? Without technical These pictures stinks. To avoid.
