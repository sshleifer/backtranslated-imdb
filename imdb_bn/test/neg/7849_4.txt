Perhaps the director was trying for another perett (Good Garland and Kelly Musical) - but this crippled musical era was flat. Sinatra and Catherine Gresons do not mix well in the voice - and their chemistry lacks sparkle together. A sweet guy in love with Senator who tries to disguise his late "bandito" father, but it seems strange in the role. Here's an amazing and surprising key, how the sensors can accept a vague song and it may seem special - its phrase as a singer and you want to hear it again. When Grace is singing the same song it is hard to believe that she does not sing something different and is not nearly as interesting. His big moment is with her "love where you find it" which shows her perfectly suitable and her power. Photography is pleasing and appealing appealing as both they dress and set attractive. Co-star Mildred Nautique and J. Carroll Nash provided plenty of power to do the impossible task. As well as Sinatra songs, there is a weird male and non-dance dance with Ricardo Montlaban, Saeed Charis and Anne Miller. It's interesting and weird Montalban and Chauras were a wonderful dancer and these numbers were a real curiosity.
