Wow - thank you God I was an aircraft and could find out the windows. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, anticipated, horrific (played by a horror woman who played a wife?), Badly written, highly written. This film was apparently designed to appeal to a person who is particularly passionate about firefighters, "heroes" or knees instead of goddesses. I do not have enough bad things to say about this picture. It was not cheap, then, with all the stars in it, with those special effects and fire scenes. There was a fate cost, yet it still sucked worse than any movie that I feel. The funeral scene? Wonderfully bad. Courtship between firearms and previously horrific women? Corny, conrived, trite Firehouse is fantastic? We all are not willing to be both men and women at the same time.
