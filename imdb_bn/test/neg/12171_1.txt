This series broadcasts when I saw it mostly. I think it can be a long-running series of veins in "The Fujitik" and "Incredible Hole", where the hero around the country is being pursued to find solutions to his problems. In this case, the problem of heroes is the opposite of its progressive growth. I liked what I saw in this show. The acting was particularly good in the sad relationship between the main character and his wife. The problem is: They had canceled it before getting the chance to finish. (Or I missed the last episode). <br /> <br /> They did not get the chance to delete the story, it was canceled. Poof it's just gone. Anyway, I said before I missed the last episode. But on the contrary my evidence is this: I rent the tape. Where I left off the series The main character's wife died in a fire in a fire belonging to the famous Kingdom of the enemy kingdom Shopping. When the hero is abducted away. It understands that it ends with her friends that she needs to protect her from the shop. The end The last episode In the video: His wife does not die but escapes from the fire with him. When he wants to break the shop at the right time, he and his wife share a strange moment and then go out of existence. Extreme, silly and extreme extreme They just wanted to expel this video and eventually decided to tag it as not bad enough. They might as well just show some stock footage of the first nuclear bomb blast. About Pythonos <br /> <br /> The name of this show was a great opening title sequence set in the same name as David Bowie.
