But I can not tell how I really feel about the heap of this cow. Where to start. Film quality, no no. I saw clean pictures in America's modest home video! Acting poor, cow's effect is okay. Comedy Mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. Over the same thing over again. At least on Friday 13th or Halloween we live in a part of a major character. There are no main characters, just hunting. People, now we all come to the worst part. Killed the final survival shirt and found that it was his friend. Then when the police finally comes, they do not believe in him and he is locked in a rubber room. What kind of finishes that you call, shit, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing. The excuse, "It has ended badly, it's a horror movie." Or "we will have to end it badly to leave a series of it" just to thrust excuses and all that. I would pay blood of the chimpanzee drilling camp.
