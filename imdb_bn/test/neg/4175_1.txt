Although this movie was really fun it was not meant to be! The acting was stupid and so was the voice. Mostly it was some people, who were roaming around a half an hour in a cornea. They threw this stupid super natural thing that even made it dumber. It was not like a normal movie, this weird musical was going through the movie almost completely. Do it with corn bran horror films? I thought that corn was really scary and I would feel something like this, but really it was just stupid. The main character, he shouted out for these two little girls. And then at the end he killed someone or something. It is valuable because it is with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you are looking for a horror movie then do not waste your time
