Did the first trolley actually make money? This is another sequel (along with other storage lines) that nobody has asked. But we got it anyway. Siegel is like his predecessor, the whole brain is dead. It's also very annoying (remember the dinner scene?) I think I'm really sorry for Ritter, Yasseck and Warden. Do they need so much money?
