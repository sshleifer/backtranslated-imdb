On May 2, someone clicked on 11, and then 15 other comments on my previous 15 comments: It's almost like Turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> I write this, I still saw that the fun thriller is certainly under the impression I am I got a bigger case of jiggles, but I would try and calm. (It is very difficult to write when your nose spreads and the keyboard expands the sporadic drill on the keyboard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The young couple joined them but the bus is not actually a taxi service: it is a kidnapping vehicle. (Snicker!) Her driver hired a young girl from the airport who has been part of an organized "white slavery" gang, and they have five years Hold it up. (Do not laugh.) The same airplane For five years, in addition to the police or even the FBI, the FBI never gets its air (please, please, please.) Apparently, for the few years and for the same year, dozens of women in the same exact place are absent - and yet someone is targeting a trend. Incompetent? "Shuttle" There are three types of people in the world: easily abductible Blend, Fools / Comotose / Invisible FBI Agent and Public Psychologist Gangster (who Lacke back with a sexy blend hate). <br /> <br /> This is one of the drivers in mission just alive, and yet he has done - I repeat - five years, death or organ without a loss. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention the driver as immortal? I need to mention it? We all know that the movie Cycos has immortal DNA. You can prevent them, repeatedly bounce them against walls, pull them on their shoulders slowly with hammers, tear their 9-inch nail into their ears ... Heck, you can put a hand grenade on the face of the average Hollywood psycho, and he Still just like to escape with minor scratches. No, the driver is not a satan or even a tiny monster, but regularly with the ability to live with the greatest psychology of Hollywood, with the greatest survival capability of Hollywood psycho regularly. <br /> <br /> Outline of the original plot: A person lost all the fingers and in one hand a scenic scene. (A witch's bus which accepts mind and obey!) The passengers try to escape. They fail They get hurt. They sulk They argued. They try to escape. They fail They were injured. They argued. They try to escape. They fail They were injured. They try to escape. They fail They try to escape. The abducted driver managed to rob him from the gun! Well, they do not kill him because the Golden Hollywood rule of Gandhi-like doctrine bans them from them. (No riggling.) Another passenger active to be part of gang! (Stop laughing.) He starred in the Robber Jobby / John Travolta School of over acting and Sylly Mugging. She threatened to rape. Later, one of the cheeks hit him with a crowbar on the head, almost a dozen ... very difficult. Just a few seconds later he got back to the consciousness. Yes, he lives. (Immortal, remember?) He died a little later. (No idea, though he is not supposed to be a murderer.) The reason for the kidnappers. They try to escape. One of them escapes! Well, psychologists do not have too much God-like power in their power to recapture their prey. Game begins all over again: try to escape the passenger. They fail They sulk They look into void. They get hurt. They try to escape. They fail <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were many opportunities. At one stage these explosive psychos (remember: five years!) Even send a kidnappers to a grocery store! He left a message to the police. However, you ... you have guessed it: There is no police in the US City of this fabulous fairy tale. <br /> <br /> And as you think, the movie can not get a pebble - even join the army to lend hands with Luke LÃ¼ussen and Briano de Palma script - do it. Girls were kidnapped for sending some remote island (?), And it was acquired by transporting them as goods. Apparently, in this imaginary America there is no FBI, no police - and no borders. But immense criminals have more fate than immortal criminals. He had millions of opportunities to kill a blond driver, and he still failed. How did the victims of this stupid thriller hit them and never wished to end their immortal opponents? I guess I answered myself: they are immortal! So why not try to bother, he will have to worry ... <br /> <br /> Why so a blonde dies and another one is sent to the living room and alive (complete with a kitten box, and funny images of Demi Moore's primary school Pictures)? Could it be a tattoo? I think they killed the deadly one, but it's just me. Was his tattoo that ugly? <br /> <br /> I can not do that? Why should I search for arguments in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I think straight away even when I'm smiling at half-time? <br /> <br /> It's naturally it does not work in the 21st century horror / thriller, mobile phones ... Perhaps this stranglehold gang control is not only FBI, police, and customs, but also not satellites in places. <br /> <br /> Do I have to spell it? There are many easy ways to kidnap people. And a lot more intelligent people who should make movies. Give an ass a camera and he'll lay an egg every one time ... the kind of eternal puzzle that came first: the egg or bird-brain director.
