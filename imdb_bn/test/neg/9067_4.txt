There is nothing else in the world that can be more stimulating than knowing our weak bodies, um, hope for death. Spanish director Ignacio Sirada (a German colleague of his German colleague Jurgenjetragrette) surrounds our curiosity and invites us to have a ready ride on ready tables, scalpels, surgical procedures, human entrances and abominable hearts worldwide. <br /> <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I do not know which side of the film helped to achieve high enough ratings besides its infamous fame. <br /> <br /> It is fairly easy and straightforward to say in the story - one day of life (actually half a hour) annoying to do (or, perhaps, the assistant specialist or anyone) he duties on his routine morbid and right at his workplace, a Extraction of her stress in unauthorized fashion The authors are annoyed with a special message to provide this one-note plot. I suspect it might be inspired by the playful behavior of the character of Wolverine's Wolverine Wolves. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also suspicious. It is difficult to assess the measurement of an actor, which does not shrink the single word. Their emotions are concealed behind the medical mask. Great camera - There is not enough space for work - Basically, the whole thing is mostly open in four walls. Authenticity - makeup and makeup are impressive and setup very effective, but only a few treatments / forensic experts can decide how a truthful and physically disintegrate can be done properly (if anyone thinks). Undoubtedly, I felt that the body was autistic to check the condition of the organs and to confirm the cause of death. Now I know that the bodies are cut off, raped and insulted, the intestines are separated, the brain is retrieved from the head, stuffed in the stomach and mixed slowly, then the body is stitched again and washed - personal Nothing. And after these poor children, what would they write in their fraudulent autobiography reports? <br /> <br /> Shock and hate factor - it is impossible that obscure visitors will discover its horrors, watch out a graphic video manual that disks with his wife and kids next to a Christmas tree beside a Christmas tree that was intended. These vague items are only available, subjected by well-known people and not easily offended. Therefore, it will be meaningless to warn anyone for the film's hijacking. They know exactly what they are and what they want to see. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Apparently stunning and moody pieces with bit and interesting ideas. And I'm sure that one day he will win the filmmakers' hearts with his new, more mainstream-based elements. And sooner or later 'Afammoth' will become an irrevocable act for the impressive collectors of his "first" "warm up" work. <br /> <br /> But in between, I fear, can be strictly recommended for medical students or experts studying mental disorders and sexual deviations.
