The "fleeing from hell" is not made with enough artwork which it is: exploitation in disguise. Both direction and writing dusty: For example, during the fight between Sintia Loadey and Ajita Wilson, the camera-work is so bad that you can only do what is happening; Also, if a drunkard but heartwarming doctor did not kill Warden, then the guards would not follow him, and even after the girls escaped - the "fake plug" scheme still fined, but it was only to destroy it. I could give 4 of the 10 out of 10 (the sweaty gay scene is not bad and Christina Lie has an amazing look and body), but the disgusting scene of abuse has forced me to cut 2 more points. Certainly something sick would take that as a recommendation. Finally, some people more troublemaker than this movie actually gave it a positive review!
