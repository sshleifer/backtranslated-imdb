I have seen this movie about eight years ago when it first came out, and the only memory that is about me is: 1. It was awful. 2. That one scene Linnea Quigley applies Suntan lotion for its arms and legs straight for about 15 minutes (it seems in any way). 3. A scene where a character gets rammed into a sledgehammer in his head. In this scenario, the hammer connects, smashes like a head glass. It's pretty bad.
