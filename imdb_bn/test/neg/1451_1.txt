I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was probably one of the most annoying, unreasonable movies that I've ever seen unfortunately. First Matthew Modin most of the worst actors and movies have been destroyed, on top, the plot is very stupid. The only reason that Alex Beldwin was checked in this film, and his character was very quickly eliminated. If you are not a fan of Mitchell Fifher, you probably avoid this movie like a plug. Many people can not praise this movie well enough, but I do not understand that people are so horrible about it. If it is a black humor, then this movie makes it so awesome, but I think it can pass some time for the comedy today.
