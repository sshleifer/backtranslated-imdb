I took my 14 years old to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated at least R. But I was not that rigid with the movie, this was just a lot. It was a waste of money. I thought it would be some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but it was more than crude. I was sitting there and reading (a specific subtitle that really got me at the beginning of the movie) and I could not believe how angry it was. I can not believe that the 13-year-old is right to read and see this content. I do not understand how the system system works. ??
