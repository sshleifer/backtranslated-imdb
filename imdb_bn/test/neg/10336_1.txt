I would not know in detail why I can afford to get a horror rating of this film, many people have already done it. This seems to be enough in more than 400 films owned by me in the DVD, this is the only salvation I got - it was so worthless that I do not want to see it again. <<br /> <br /> However, I have a comment about ridiculously high average ratings of 23 (according to 3-15-06). Reviewing 4 pages while skimming through I saw no ratings at 3 stars higher. By watching the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 or less. Some people seem to be stuffing the ballot box to stop the movie from the IMDB "100 below" list. It would be interesting to see that 30 users have identified this movie as 10 stars (no one has written reviews of the film), actually active active users. <br /> <br /> Do not fool the movie is not worth your time.
