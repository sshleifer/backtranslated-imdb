Please do not see your life for six hours this way. What I did is not a very good reflection on me. The only redeeming acting act in this clunker was by Wes Studio. How to 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as Lonsov Dove is beyond me !! It was a distraught, rambling, inconsistent story. Plot lines were not improved, action scenes were almost ridiculous and big ends (frustration) were suitable for this mini series. Val Kilmer, who I think is an honor actor, plays a strange role that I've never seen him. His final scene at the show was to be a filler by the director. I have been reading this review over the years and this show prompted me to sign up !!!
