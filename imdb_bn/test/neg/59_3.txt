I do not like it, I hope so much, but I was expecting a big budget movie at least for a fun mobile phone. This is not even that. This item is the bottom half of all vampire movies I've seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, something of little thought, almost unincorporated plot (and that there you can drive half-truck through the hole). Sure, its action is there and loud, and more actions, and more words, and blood, and actions ... this thing alone is not a good (or even half decent) movie. Some people might say that it is sometimes the best vampire movie made - I can assume that they did not see many. I instead recommend to look around the dark.
