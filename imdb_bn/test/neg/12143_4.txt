I will pay Billy Dee credit for trying to pull this off. It was a Blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain prospect. I knew it would be less budget ... acting sub-par ... but there was hope of spreading across a few gems. If there is a diamond or gem in this film, then they successfully sunk under tons and tons of coal and possibly under pressure. As an actor and filmmaker, I often cringed when I was able to destroy potentially harmful moments with violent activities. Yet I must admit, I could not look away. I do not know whether it was like a car break or some mysterious energy that you can not turn around from your eyes. This image was wrong, a good case for a wonderful story. If Walter Cranketta is called "Aristocrats", it will be a total flow, though the joke itself is ridiculous. Let Dave Chappell say it, and we are all rolling on sunny floors. This film is a "Chapelle." Now, you need to say, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for dollars, then do that. It's worth the money. Perhaps I'll take another dollar, purchase the rights to this movie and rebuild it. Who knows ... it can not be any good, but it certainly does not get any worse.
