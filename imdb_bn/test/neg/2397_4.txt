Your time and brain will be good for reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's fight. Philipp Simmur Hoffman, the most enjoyable character of the film, Greek, and he acted as the actor. The book's gestures, hard-core and their minds are completely free to speak In the movie, he did not even see Charlie equally important. And the poor Charlie never showed blood donation (which he did every time he visited the camp in Pakistan). In short, the film is very beautiful, and history is old for our modern times. We are not really worried about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which happened despite the reggaan, not a result), a well meaningful group who was extremely willing to fight. We do not need a lot of text and hearing, considering how good the war is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan. (As I read the book, I was getting that feeling of feeling, without it the current day).
