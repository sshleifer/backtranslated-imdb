**** Possible Spoller **** <br /> <br /> If you create a strong film, well-known parents with three seemingly ungrateful girls, most of which are the most capable actors, great movies and a beautiful Midwestern setting, Now where do you go through it? Why, you must make a modern tragedy after "King Lear". <br /> <br /> What I was expecting. That was certainly not what I got. I was a 105-minute feminist tripe - a long annoyance to the woman's inhumanity. Why, there was not a decent male in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You can manage this picture as soon as you see, but you can believe that it will not ruin any of these subtle actors and artisans. Trite scenario - you just want to get along with their King Lear theme. But it will never happen; And if you ask me then there is a real tragedy. <br /> <br /> In addition to the glorious Grand Heartland Panorama, the only thing that could be seen in this movie was that the wonderful crawlline, British actor Colin Firth, practiced his Mid Western accent. Now there was a treatment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
