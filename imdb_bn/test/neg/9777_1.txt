When I saw the poster in the theater, I thought it was a "new line" in a horror story without the cost of a famous cast. But, after I entered, I wanted to go after 20 minutes. There were many senses and logical errors. To me, this is not a film that is worth keeping in the theater. It's not even valuable to see it.
