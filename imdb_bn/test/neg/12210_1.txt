While spending time on Saturday morning, "Looking for Lola" came to HBO. Though the film's description seems to be bad, I decided to give it a shot. I was even worse than the imagination. The movie was incredibly incredible and I did not have on-screen chemistry among the main actors who shouted in my head about 10 minutes. In the scene of Mick Greenbouem (Lead Actor), he left the bill in luxury restaurant and Lola (lead actress) allowed him to fool his wealthy people to use his bedroom, it was just as bad as him. Makarena people around her ("awesome"!) And two actors finally fall in love. I wanted to change the channel, but I was trying to give it a chance to become a cute love story with a few chocolates. It never did. In fact, it has become so bad that I decided to finish it, so I can claim that I have ever seen one of its worst movies, instead of being criticized for "giving fair opportunity". Lola tried for a dance part in the last scene was the end of the movie. She has come late after getting married (a scene where Mike tells the priest to hurry and then robs the papers only that it was consistent with the credibility of the film), and then give the judges "a look to him, how long the two male judges have already delayed. But after watching his wife on stage (okay, she is not nice, but not extra impressive), everyone lolla Mike's family, the other dancers, and even judges included * cough *. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad I had to write a review. View at your own risk.
