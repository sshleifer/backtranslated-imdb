This is my first Almodavar film. I admit that we chose it mainly because we knew it was an exciting possibility of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. Unfortunately, this film should be recommended. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated spectator, I like European movies, "art" films, and although I usually do not have my taste, it is able to recognize a quality movie. <br /> <br /> But this image was a complete blank for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters solved, the box called a "funny comedy" but I did not smile once. Built with a lot of shameless and awkwardly stupid dialogue. I do not get all of this - it seems like an amateur endeavor. Can anyone illuminate me?
