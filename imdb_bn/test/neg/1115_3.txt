I have watched Wight Little Things as part of Harrahafst's "8 Films to Die For" film, and this only movie disappointed me. To be intelligent, a mother, her little girl and her teenage daughter live in a abandoned house on the hills of Pennsylvania. Every night, anyone who finds the vengeful spirits of killed children in coal mines and kills them by killing them. <br /> <br /> I think the director feels annoying to his viewers that children will be able to kill pics and eat human meat (which is a great tribute to George Romero) because the film is not otherwise scary. Simply put, many of the jogging jogging shots placed on the site of their next assassination. If someone gets it in the barn, the kids will have a shot (Shahbag) and then move to kill. <br /> <br /> Think of it, why not? Children walk suddenly when they hunt? And I have no such experience, but I think shotgun blasts will throw a lot more children than this movie ...? The worst parents I have seen in a movie of mom "The front door lock is busted"? With your beer and mountain lions you have eighteen-year-old dowler! Fix IT, you die !!! Moreover, the mother and her oldest daughter look very closely at the age of age - even for a teenager to conceive, and there is an incredible death, some of whom are trying to drive from the mud with their butt. <br /> I gave it 3 because it tried. It's not as bad as a splatter film. But for good scares, go somewhere else.
