This movie is a genius and Hollywood budget waste. It reminds me that everyone in the movie is not giving any benefit to it because they were everywhere and denied the talent of this horror trash pill in a movie. This is an adoption plot that is not only unfortunate, unrealistic and fun or interesting. The only thing I was interested in was a big name in the movie that did not popping up due to any objectionable and there was no acting or good line to contribute to a film world. I hope to have some good things because all these people were cold in other movies. But it does not come through. This image should be shown as a prison sentence, but it will be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see many recognizable faces around such a terrific kindly script with flat lines and terribly bad acting. This movie reminds me of another complete waste, which has many recognizable faces from Big Trogl (2002), which will stop the reading-and-meter readable scale.
