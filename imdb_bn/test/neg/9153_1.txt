Who's talking about the store here? How can a producer / network executive / director be allowed to screw the most harmful plastic date tree in the history of a crook in the history of the film, which spreads on the Canadian coastal sand region and tries to stop it on us like a hotter? The trees were near the actual palm tree, which is the actual return to the Pink Tin C-Mart Christmas tree. And with Dermat Mullrini in front of the camera, gray hair over which could not play in high school? And does not a genius think of this gifted quality that he (Gregor) tells Gaj instead of gas while correcting the Canadian actor? Authors, directors, actors - Not everyone is involved with this ploding slug of "movie", but did brilliant work elsewhere. Extremely slow in the events, and beyond any emotion, slow, clear, exposed and exposed, without concrete - it seems to be just like the worst movie of the lifetime, which was presented with the promotion of all the red carpets. And I'm saying this as someone who loves life time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there was so much movie that if the movie gets 10 from me in the whole movie. Unfortunately it was only about five seconds.
