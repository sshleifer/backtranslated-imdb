Occasionally I went to television after "South Park" and I used to catch the ruins of the middle school laughing train, which is the "mind of mind" It was my only time that my room was clean because I would be able to find a remote remote from a distance. The truth is that the comedy Central was required to replace "Chappelle's show", and what they found was a show that appeals to eve-teats that they will miss Dave too much, they will remain in minority shows, or will be pleased with the plain "Mexicans tacos love "The joke that Carlos Mencia shovels every week. I understand, though there are some people who are actually Mensia * shodder * ridiculous. I firmly stand by my word when I say I believe these people exist only in the mythology. However, if you are actually there, I did not just enter my housing district and say these big differences between Carlos and "Chapel shows": <br /> 1) Dave was funny. You can highlight this one. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chapel show" was five minutes as much as Menia could expect. Yet every time a preacher, for his short show, did not see how he had never before seen how to do his own horn. You got right, Carlos. And not a good way. Chapel told people he was shocked and funny. <br /> <br /> Chapel was actually an ethnic joke, which circulates in the depths of various cultures - some things that some people do not know. Related. His "I know black people" segment of the game. The grand prize was some hair cream using black people. Deeper than Mencia that would never dive the dive. So brave yourself? If Mensia wrote that sketch, then Grand Ezra would have been frozen chicken and cool-ed. And my complaint has some qualifications. I saw a preacher for his show (which I affectionately came to call 'my TV monitor for 30 minutes to receive an SS)' a few days ago and it was a sketch of some stereotype Olympics, which I admitted myself was a pretty funny idea. Then I saw that the Mexican won the grand card as a grand card. That's it ?! What is there in the fire? Who can not think - back to the 7th grade? For the fans of the show, if you are always watching and you miss one of his fifty's - perhaps you and your friends are not getting old "du-de-tar" and not discussing as a part of the joke. Where something interesting will be the key to say - Just remember that fifty five lines have fifty likes: green card, taco, boundary jumper, lawn muwer and of course, du-de-dur. Just remember - what it was, it shouted. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Related to the two numbers. Every time he says something ridiculous, he will refrain from telling people (laughing at his joke) that he thinks he "has gone too far in the end". Then do not say it for God. Or let people decide by themselves. He kept shoving this tripe down my throat and comedy Central that he is more controversial than "Da Vinci Code" that shows this like-it-like-it. You are not You do not have to be. <br /> <br /> I never bother by the show's content. I do not have to pay that much credit. I offended that Carlos Mencia is not given thirty minutes of unnecessary screaming. Yes ... I literally got offended by that reality.
