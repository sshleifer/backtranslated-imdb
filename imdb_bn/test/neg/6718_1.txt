The Lord has mercy! Why is this film made? Why Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to it? The foreign thinks so curiously that it turns into a bunch of people. <br /> <br /> This picture has a very cheap look. A lightning was far from their reach like a budget. What's so bad is that the makers know it and try to see it shiny to compensate. As a result, a picture that does not look right. Steven Sigal is not so well-hidden, the scenes of the scenes hidden so stupid and edited have been 'segregated'. None of them is compelling or exciting. The conspiracy is dishonesty which is not interested in the slightest means or there is no unity in it. Eastern-Europe positions (the ruthless steps under the budget by the producers or the existence of the ruthless actions) are unpleasant and should not serve as a retreat for any 'action' film (no steps?). <br /> <br>> And what is the deal with the title? As far as I could say everybody in the movie was foreign. What does the title refer to? <br /> <br /> DVD 1.85: 1 Anoforphic WideScreen and Dolby 5.1 words. Even extraordinary enough to warrant a single rental. Your time is not worth a second for foreigners. The tagline that will look good! 'If they think they can stop him, they have died.' Sheesh!
