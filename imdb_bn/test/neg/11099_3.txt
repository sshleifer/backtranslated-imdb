The film is apparently visible based on a popular French horror novel by Arthur Barnard since 1927. I've never heard of it before but it was a popular topic before Belfogor's movie and mini series. In 1927 the first novel was released with the novel. Arthur Burned was a part of the writer's team who wrote and composed films and novels together. Belfogra's character is one of his best known creatures. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < She goes back to the movies like this now. There is nothing wrong to play in French-quality movies, because it came from the country but this movie is just ridicule. <br /> <br /> The problem depends on the film's good effect and especially for its fear, especially its special effects. . Well, horrible and special effects really did not have any good combination, though there are some exceptions. It's not like special effects this one is bad. This is simply good for a European movie, but it has simply shifted incorrectly, since the movie has a feeling, it can easily be done without its effect. It is actually made to watch the movie better and Scarea, there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about imagination or watch, since the film seems incompatible with choosing the right method. Sometimes the film likes a light and less serious method, on the other hand it definitely attempts to be a horror movie of fear. This is the main reason why the movie does not work in just any level. You can say that the film is a bit annoying. It all definitely gets worse towards the end. Shortly after, you took care of this movie and its story and you decided to look for something other than that. <br /> <br /> Edit is completely closed. It used to be very quick, without much style, when the quick editing was definitely intended to give a better, modern style to the film. Also, the time line is sometimes plain, such as some sequences are edited incorrectly. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I can not believe the composer Bruno Cullis is an Oscar nominated musician. The score of music is often annoying as the effect of his words like a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of many characters, which you can not just take less care of. A woman like Sophie Marsau does not seem to fall for a man like Frederick Diphenthal. The film also contains Julie Chris, which is beautiful, but does not add more to the movie only. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
