Hello coupe likes to pump out the film, it's not unusual Occasionally, several good films come out of them, though the majority only suck the big donkey. It is also not surprising that those bad films repeat the old TV series. Sometimes a surprise pops up with "The Fujitik" (who has seen the best picture?), But every "harmful", without any plot or interest, has the MacHill navy or any other completely unreasonable film. Mader Squad, in my opinion, has actually moved to the top ten movies of true Laosi films, where Hollywood would have to kill its deadly assault to create a good film. We have torn the right spot in the middle of a story which just does not seem sensible, it destroys talent, and the dialogue is just bad. We do not really know which of these characters are, and we can give them a flying f ** k about them. Instead, you automatically want to know who they are and what they're going to do. "I'm not too old for this ** ** line", it's just an ordinary fool For the end of the movie, we were verbally mentioned to my friend during clamoring. It's just an insult to the Hollywood movie. Grade: F-
