I like Eral Flynn; I liked the biography and I liked the action movie. These three featured ... but I did not like this picture. The last 20 minutes were nice, especially with some great low-angle shots in photography. However, I felt that it took six hours to reach that point, and I can not really say why I feel like this. <br /> <br /> This work is interesting, Iral Flin and Olivia Day Havilland fine. In fact, Huffilland actually refreshed his opponent to see Flann fans instead of his usual role. Yet there is a little lack in this film. <br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for its historical wrongdoing but I do not hear the same criticism for many other films. Indeed, when it is historically correct in a film, its RARE For some reason, this revisionist history has been offended by most critics. If the film genre really makes a lot worse, they probably liked it. Well, very bad. On their counter-way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could enjoy more but I will take on this many other Flynn events.
