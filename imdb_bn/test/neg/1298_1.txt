This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave it a star simply because it is possible to score the lowest score. Will anyone ever be a good film to flood? The director and the cast should be ashamed and then it could be a shambolic panic tactic of it all sinking towards me. Only the campaign could be bad this. <br /> <br /> The feature of the release of floods is fun story of horror and shameless formula. If only the letters contain the same depth created by the flood, they hear the sound of bumper from the sound bite without any emotional response. <br /> <br /> The tragic thing about this movie is that it may be a lot of good, informative, imagined and timeless. Flooding is the amateur stick found in many recent British films, where more attention is paid to pay even more attention. <br /> <br /> Where was Smith?
