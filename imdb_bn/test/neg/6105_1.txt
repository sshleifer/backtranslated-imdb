I do not know what the chassic movement is this picture? I saw this photo a year ago. Am I an Orthodox woman, living in a Orthodox chassis? Community and I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It's far from reality, it's scary! Directors can rent at least one chicken rabbi for at least advice before making a "realistic" movie about young people! For example, Dawning of the girl (morning prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding, or a Mikveh (traditional bath) customs. <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with a technical lack. But it is not those who bothered me. It's spiritual aspects The illustrative is pictured next to the Taliban. Women are powerless, but men are the ultimate ruler! Anyone can force a Jewish girl to silence her wishes! We also live by orthodox law (Halva), which clearly describes human liability towards his wife. Do not rape or rape! And no man (even Rabbi) does not allow the woman to make the final decision. The woman should not have a hand on the head, when she is bathing a show, then it is assumed that the whole body is immersed in it! The director is clearly trying to stick Ultra Orthodox! But what can he do at least in a beautiful and educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Beautiful! But not trustworthy. The dialogues are long and annoying. Finally sucked completely. For all the plays that I had hoped for at least a beautiful finish, I felt that sitting on it I deserved it! Obviously someone was trying to create a lesser conscious Jewish, or a beautiful spirit for non-Jews. (Look at those fundamentalists, they are very bad and meaningful ...) and they succeed! Short things short: a beautiful European (why the level) was expected for the movie, instead of bashing a tradition, unrealistic, misguided mischief. I mean, today we live in the free will, as never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka chose her. Many people from the unseen background are currently choosing Orthodox Judaism. Because, religion can be a wonderful gateway in this crazy world!
