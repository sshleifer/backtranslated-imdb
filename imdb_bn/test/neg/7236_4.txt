This octopus series. <br /> <br /> Puff ... okay. Stock footage is a lot, but quite well. I'm surprised that they were actually a monster robot octopus which was not really bad! I was really surprised. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was just fun. Octopus has never explained how big it is, and it is not linked in any way first. But it was still funny. <br /> <br /> Finally my friend and my friend laughed. Basically, once the octopus is run out, two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions, the highest stock footage, appear on the screen! We went to the Dollar Store and bought a 'Five One Missile Toy' toy! Believe it, believe it! Overall, just fools are fun. The price to provide an opportunity, if it is cheap buy then.
