This movie is bad as we all know it. Most of the time I usually like trash-comedy at the beginning of the 80s / 90s, I've listed ski schools, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and much more about this time. This is also the classic yet forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (U. Ski School Section 8 Instructor and Party Maniac in Summer School). But this movie is just slow. It takes about 30 minutes to go and we need to sit through half-hearted dialogue between Sindhu boys (E & C.). And yes, I've heard bloggers call me "trash to diving", "you do not see 2 and 1/2 men." Charlie was not at that stage during this flick ... only when Charlie supports her co-star Brilliant and Emilio is not much more than amazing amazing Bra offer. Indeed, this film is written by Emilio and it shows that this is not a real end. Come to illa√≠o, even ski school 2 authors have ended) How a problem has been solved, no hot babes, no bad plot, no vow to acting, I do not swear ... I'm tired of this tire now. Save your time and I Watch the movie listed above. You will enjoy many more.
