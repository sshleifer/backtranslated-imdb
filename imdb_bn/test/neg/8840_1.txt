I went to see this picture with great expectations, Spain's contributions to the Oscars-this year. Since being completely uninterrupted, sarcastic, kind, poorly written, edited, played and directed, the film is very long. It fails to deliver "messages", fails in storytelling, brutal historical settings and above all in its rhyme. There are many extreme disrespects that I have not seen in a movie in a long time (Lucas's story whose dead sister is on her head, divine references, all the incognito nonsense). Spanish-speaking Sriram grew up around me and gradually lost patience, and some of the comments I heard were that the Spanish Academy members did not accept drugs before selecting the film for the Oscars contest.
