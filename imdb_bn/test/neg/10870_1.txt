This picture is so bad that it's funny. I thought half of Hell Raid had it a comedy, although they could not actually take PSSs, or if it was a serious effort to really do something decent Notice that I am not listed here as a comedy so they will be serious! It seems mainly about a gang of pensioners, who wander in motorcycle shooting with each other and you can imagine the most delicate bad conversation. One scene unknowingly has two letters, hiding the bottle on each other's heads, and then each other has been shown 'Free from prison' cards! Also check the pronunciation of Winnie Jones, where was hell from there ?! There's a load of nude girls there too, because for some unreasonable reasons, this seems like nothing more than closing the ties with the skin of leather! The man who wrote and guided it - a Grayshan 2000'd beard and orange sunbed tan as a Peugeot Woman Hereman Latif, throwing himself in his own role for some reason - I'm probably not part of the joke, I do not know. In fact, the more I think about it, the film will have to take a P * SS. It was produced by Quantin Tarantino and it is possible that it was released as a sunny shoe. This is the total absence of the Tarantino style, but it has really been really badly done. Although it is very fun, and I think it can go down as a classical classic, despite being the funny parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style or something that is very strange fun. It will be believed.
