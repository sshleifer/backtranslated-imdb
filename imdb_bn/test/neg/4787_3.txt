After ignoring the rage about the show, I saw the season and it really hurt me as well and I gave fingers ... for about five episodes, then it started to become spiral. Why? Firstly, Ethan Sapli is scripted to act as a complete fool, which is sure to be extremely well-liked by semi-random staff, very well-expected. <br /> <br /> Jim Corpoli looks great, but if he thinks that the lips are stretched to explore the parts that he normally does not normally go to and he creates a strange strife to utter what he says, that way off Does it. Maybe he thought that his character would be very flat, faded and wanted to be colored and spicy, but made a flood of color, screaming with a lot of shouting and shaking my eyes, ears and intelligence. <Br /> I really wanted to love this event, as I said the prize is great, (Amelie comes from the same shell as Polain's fantastic fate) and Jason Lee is doing a great job here. But there is no way I can start eating 'milk' with some other actors and forget that this is just a show, because they show me the miraculous, extreme characters of Pressli's and Sullaly. It is of course valuable that their character and performance will be good if it is not a series of 70 parts and if it does not get much screen time.
