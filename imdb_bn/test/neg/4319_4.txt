Firstly, the details of the current IMDB plot seem confusing, about the film's group of girls, who choose a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They are standing in a small plaza, where they keep them hostage, but girls develop a deep attraction for one another. Violence ensues. <br /> <br /> I made this decision in error, it was another 2007 film "The Hitchher". Hitachi is not good, and I was looking for a favorite movie to look at anyway, but it was almost helpless. I think I could vomit a piece of paper and bring a better plot. <br /> <br /> I could not count how many movies I saw even with the same story, so almost painfully predictable, but really it was terrible what some scenes were ... well give me an example. At one moment, a door (which is very clearly) covered due to a 911 call and two police officers are watching 30 feet away from the scene, watching a man, covering the blood, walking outside the door, suspecting that it seems suspicious, but more Do not decide to investigate. However, this movie was not annoying, well-produced, guided and played with special effects, gratuitous nudity, and violence. I probably would not recommend sitting 90 minutes of your life to see this movie, but I was perfect when cleaning my foundation. Also highly recommended for crummy movie fans, and will be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than watching.
