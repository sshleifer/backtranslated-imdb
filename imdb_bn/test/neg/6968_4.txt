I recently saw Ed Wood Jr. autobiographical film Glen or Glenda that after many years he heard a lot about it. I could read about this image or hear nothing I could have prepared for me. This will be the most bizarre movie ever made. Stampeding Buffalo, the woman in slavery, about prancing the devil and about Lugosi, rambling as she can, "Bevare, Bevare .... pull the strings, pull the string ...", it was completely insane. The act was violent and the dialogue was weirdly ridiculous, what can be expected from the Ed Wood movie. The movie was so awesome, I told everyone, I had to give wood credit ... he was ahead of his time. You have to remember that when the movie was made in Transvestite, there was no discussion among the public, it was very less for the film. I read that wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure the film was based on its own experience. Bela Lugosi expressed regret over the ridiculous lines she was saying about the film, but it was like Ed Wood Jr., at least Mr He played acting while living in Logosi sandy. And a drug addictive and Hollywood would hire him for anyone else. If you have never seen this movie you will need to see it, especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
