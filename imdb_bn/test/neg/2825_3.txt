Good movie starts, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid, when all the plans Karen (the girl's name was right?) About pregnancy. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, my conclusion is: Not really the best eight comedy, no other movie except the other movie, they can make it better but they destroy it, if only the plot takes any other way, then they keep the pregnancy material And they are definitely destroyed, so the final Conclusion: I do not like.
