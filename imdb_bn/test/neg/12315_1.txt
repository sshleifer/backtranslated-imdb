Just wrong about this movie everything is wrong, wrong. Take, for example, Mike Moira. He reached the stage where you have realized that his shotgun did not change ten years before his SNL day. He's doing the same cutesy flow-consciousness joke and the same voice. Her cat is painfully unfunny. He tries hard way He is a comedy in some weird type, he is not that supposedly cool cat. Bad as the rest of the movie left. Set incredible ugly --- and clearly waste millions of dollars. (Backgroundboard cutouts for the background house have become more intelligent than the whole neighborhood and the main street.) Alec Belwin has tried to make a fantastic Great Santino impression, but he looks down and is showing disrespect. There is even an incompatible cheesecake moment with the wrong celebrity Paris Hilton - it's a dog-like story that tells the stick to the mind. Avoid all costs this movie, folks. It's not even an interesting train debris. (I hope they will lose Horton to Robin Williams, then we'll give a bad-sinus movie-starring-spacious-comedian trilogy.)
