"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and I waited for a while where I could come back and relax and see some "good" 80 slash gems, I and "Extro" Got the clock, do not meet any of them. I just saw it and my outdoor speaker was also able to understand. Do I just imagine thinking about my neighbors when "Felony" was hit by a 10 minute hit? I'm sure it was loud and I'm sure they look weird, and with shouts from chains and other movies. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful sub-movie, no mystery, no stories, some cool death, often turned towards the amateur side, I usually like movies like this, but it does not click on me, Now I will see "extro" for the first time and will be the margin! <br /> <br /> DJ Arst Austin TX
