This movie, like many others (remember Titans, Mirakal) follows the basic sports-movie sources: There is a guy, he is a blurry. Jerk does the worst job. Jerk will play by someone else's rule. Jerk, Jerk becomes better if anyone else changes his rules. Insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). The effect of the tragedy Jerk, makes her completely change. Jarock will now play the championship game Plenty of sweat player and close up on the ball. Win win Quotes from anything that explains the coach or news or title. No credit available. Did not you touch This movie can now be used for the sort of morons of society. Anyone must bear this in the theater.
