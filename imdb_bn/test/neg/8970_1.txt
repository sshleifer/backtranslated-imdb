I will never forget seeing this 13-year-old show. Even at an early age, it seems to me, "It's a bewitch rip off show, which is one thing that makes Beauach tolerable, it is worth the bath." Yet I was very young in those days, to be the remote holder of my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode, among which some runner gangsters are coming to beat someone with a submachine gun ... on the bike !!! As a thirteen year old I am not so frustrated with anything that should be taken seriously. Even I knew that the exit and killing of Uzits (killings) is an act that never comes before anybody gets a loan for the day. That has been the defining moment of this show. The common crime created by hack writing and the door to the situation so that they can take care of an incompetent hero of the fools around the world of crime clash. Do not get many figs.
