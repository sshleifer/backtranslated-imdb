The film's contribution to film worldwide should be searched with a telescope and then when something is found (according to the possibility and many fates) it will be analyzed with a microscope. <br /> <br /> After analysis it will be canceled for "Labrador bunting completely in vain" in the lab. The microscope's single atom combines all its movies. <br /> <br /> CB is very camping and deliberately so. Normal ZW Staff: Comic-Strip Dialogues, Simplified Plans, Funny Characters, Chewing-gum Pop, Acquisition, etc. Waters knows that it is impossible to create a movie, so he "is deliberately hiding behind the mask of sugar film-makar" - which supposedly makes him a special kind of "anti artist". But in the cinema world, anti-talent often went wrong for genius, which Waters had hoped for - and finally got it. It's a ear act. Charleston movie and modern pop industry infest the world; This is a plague. <br /> <br /> Perhaps John Waters has been blamed for inspiring Buzz Luhaman for the creation of these awesome, stupid turkeys. It's like a virus: One of the five water creates new bad directors, and then every one of these five creates more. Where will it end? With "dancer in the dark"? Could that bomb actually be topped?
