The film "Chaos" analyzes its name from Gleick's 1988 Pop Science explanation. Books related to book content or anything related to the movie "movie"? There is nothing. The filmmakers have schemmed this book (probably not understanding anything about it) to find a "theme" to combine a series of rushback movie performances that took place in place of a movie plot. In this case, the "Choas" film is "Cube" of the Canadian effort, which acts as an instrument for concealing a similar number of viewers to the viewer, so that the plot's laughs can not be seen: "Cube" A group of top scores can help viewers understand the lack of knowledge about their prime. Blame the deficit so that viewers blame their deficiency: The same procedure is taken in "Choice": Gickey's books Connection is disconnected. Bad work in movies is considered cruel. . This must be the treatment of the abusive behavior of the audience, and any educated audience of "Kios" who can sit through the entire film will be frustrated. How can a film be so bad? Writing in a novel, the story in "Chaos" probably will not be done on the secretary's desk of a literary agent. How (at least) thousands of dollars (and probably millions of dollars) have been thrown away, which can only be considered waste time for everyone except money taken from the film? Regarding what is in the movie, every performance phone is called. Save for technical glitches, it will be surprised if it takes multiple for single view. The story is also stupid: last time I saw the story of isolated, it was literally eight years old. Among the other serious flaws are: Bad people are asked to follow the police. He has no reason to leave such indication. Police officers do not carry or use radio. There is no reason to work in the concert with the bad guys's bad guys. Strongly recommend that no one will see this movie. If you like any movie (or even just do not hate) see it instead.
