Now the television schedule (at least in England) has narrowed down with the improvement of the house, listening to the victim of the house, and hunting for midday meal, a local broadcaster has the possibility to dig a complete ambiguity to grab a couple, in a slow afternoon, Is. But in the eighteen, the BBC did just that, and guessed, I saw it. And this is a rule about the horrible curiosity of this Hungarian-American co-production, which I still remember 20 years later. Initially, the celebrated heroes appear briefly in the opening titles, only for at least half an hour, disappeared. (Guess that the Anne American tile has been edited again, the filhelle will not be seen anywhere, and it will confuse you.) There is a very wonderful bit animation where a letter extends its wide wax tissue and becomes completely bos-ed. Due to the effect of a sound sound If you throw stones, it's probably fun, but a child, quite annoying. As the saying goes, the infamous 'Hippo Cool' scene is presented in an abstract manner - clouds are playing in the vaguely Happo shapes - but it is still quite unpleasant. In fact, this film is quite cool and irresistible, weird, visible production design, all dirty colors, stroller lines, swollen forms, and memorable unique European chaos of John Savangjajar, which are not only compulsory. Then, to tap all, we get OMand's song! This is not such a terrible movie as a deeply confusing one, it's rather not as important as bad trips.
