I was initially excited about this movie and it was perfectly expected as a combination of Aquilibrum and Fahrenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the depth of the plots and subopotas and lack of interest. In the middle of the film, I was divided into funny insects in letters and set them to avoid closing. I do not have an isolated culture and have to enjoy the premises of the future with separation and there is no. What could be a clever and intelligent look in the future, it's a mediocre cavefy channel, with awesome performances in midnight, cheap set and a final unused shot of team Robbins. Perhaps he should be involved in his socialist political style - it's all down from Shawshankar.
