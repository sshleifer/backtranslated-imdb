During the New Guinea campaign, the Australian soldiers were a completely kind effort to the dedication of the film. Total waste of money if you only see the DVD. Thankfully, the video store offers free weekly rentals on DVD but it can be a complete waste of money. Perhaps Arty is kind of created by and symbolic that today's Chardonay thinks socialist. Frankly, this movie is a shame of the memory of the brave Chap, which never came back. Provide funding for creating a decent film at least equal to private Ryan Reservation. Hopefully RSL will keep the distance between yourself and the film as much as possible. The story should be told from both Australian, local and Japanese sides - it is impossible to find the next to tell the truth about anything happening during World War II. Basically his garbage, do not see it, do not buy it. Walking away
