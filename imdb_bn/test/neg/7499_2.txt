<br /> <br /> I thought horror films often lacked things like big stories or good acting or even special effects. But in the film, these deficits are unexpectedly unfortunate on the way to unite. The sad story: The idea that raping a man is a rage that takes a revenge, but the author has made it stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad acting: actors move like marionettes. They look like those who play and look, but really fail to do the job. Completely fail. <br /> A director who made some nice films during his career, changed to dirty stuff.
