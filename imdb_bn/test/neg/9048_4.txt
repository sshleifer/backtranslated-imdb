"Eten Alive" Raggero DeDoto is much easier than "Canvallal Holocaust", but it is a much more silicon film. I mean, sometimes it may be strange to be funny, but the plot is so psychologically stupid that it was impossible for me to lose all patience. The poor guy Robert Curerman (Konyal Holocaust), Janet Agren (Hell of the Hats of Hell, here with intimidation) has tried to search for a firearm sister in New Guinea, who is a worshiper of religious worship (Ivan Rashimov). On the way, they witnessed (sometimes real) animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism. Directed by Umberto Lenzi, the film is so much more important to take it seriously, but if you enjoy a trash with some strange smile it is not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
