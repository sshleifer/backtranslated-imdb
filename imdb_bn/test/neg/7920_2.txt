First, they destroy it with the worst animation quality, then, they get a voice that is nothing like the original. They make so many movies sooo wrong. When the media is sung in the media, the drummer disappears, and then reappears, the Ichir shirt changes the color, its hat keeps changing position, the bridge is white, every fat in the background, the halo changes color and disappears. . Even the heavens appear differently. If this is not a low budget movie, then I can not handle the angle at the animation. They destroyed the entire ADGTH first. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
