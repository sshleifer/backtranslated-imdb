With the cast of most short-lived stars (Alain Dellon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), special effects (sure, it's 70 but "Allen" and "Star Wars" in the same decade) and a story so ridiculous that someone would cry Maybe, it was a "flight" which should have been extended. <br /> <br /> Even Academy Award winner Sisley Tyson and George Kennedy can not keep this "bird" aircraft. <<br /> <br /> The uncertainty of the third movie - the plane sinks in the Bermuda Triangle - more credible than in Turkey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
