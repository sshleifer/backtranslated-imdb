Such pain! There was a pain in the central idea of ​​its central concept, but it was not fully recognized and there was plenty of sand on your face. I will not directly call this video a horror of South African / Canadian / UK horror fix, but it is very clear, expected and very little memorable about it. This is a guarantee that you will forget it, not too much after seeing it. I tried to watch it last night, but in the morning it had to end, because I could not keep my eyes open. Even then I could not remember where I came from, which showed me from the beginning again. The only thing to hit the world was the sharp painting of Andrés Pulson in a huge, harsh and deserted desert location. A nice glossy slim does make an attractive visual sense, which can not save the film from that overall empty feeling. All the other lower-par and almost grating are coming off. The head of the animal's head is like the expression. Huh The particular harmful effects of the computer are harmful, and some of the scattered meat and bones are severely scorched. But there is very little, because there is no hidden information that the clipped script wants to think about the nature of the generic character for tension and uncertainty. The willed script was more than just basics, shallow Faffe, because it did not create any powerful, lasting mystery, but it did work unexpectedly. The lead character falls into the supensial and token support dispensable basket. It's your stereotypical bunch. Scott Bairstow and Warrior Greyer's performance are colorless, and the beautiful Rachel Sealy tried, but felt tired.
