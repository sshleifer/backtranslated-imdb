This is the most annoying and frustrating game I've ever faced, hands down. Each time you surround the game, take control of your character or create invisible walls that you can not walk. Cut scenes keep you in control of your character's movement, but only a little bit of degrees. Also, you will have to play the game for play about 2 hours to get interiors / tutorials. It's terrible! If I play this game, I'll be scared, I'll break something. This game sucks Graphics are good, but nothing special, play games, though, awful. I say this game will be a huge understatement to hate. I got it on sale, but I'd like to return my $ 20. What a waste!
