The first movie never commented! I'm not saying "Come on! It was not bad ... it was?" ... it was not really bad at all. I laughs and giggle through the movie for a long time, so I can not say with my hand that it was garbage. <br /> <br /> This is completely different, this and epic movie (the epic movie got worse ..)! "How's that?" People will ask. How would I tell you? This movie is not nearly pointless, stupid (and I say stupid because it seems to be stupid, but it is stupid) It will happen most often and with character it is actually enjoyable in this movie. Not the best around but hey ... What do you expect - look at the poster! Some people said, it's a fool, I've seen more comments (my own opinion) while writing a comment but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! Look, I'm not asking you to tell me and now you see the movie or you missed the events of the century. What I'm saying is that if you want to watch the movie somewhere, please do not cover your eyes on the opening credits. See what it's about - who knows, you might like it a bit. <br /> <br /> I can give me 4/10 without being so bad and let me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
