AKA <br /> <br /> Addendum ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 2.39: Between 1 frame (triptic) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: A Work class teen (Matthew Leach) is a false identity and a gateresse assumes high society, where he learns hard lessons about division between the rich and the poor. <br /> <br /> The autobiographical features of director Duncan Ray (Jackson: My life ... your failure) is an openness of Pre-Thatcher's elite, less tenants can be seen in the 'ordinary', whose global scene is transformed into higher classes by his literature . Unfortunately, the verdict is very rare because we did not already know about the excesses of the lazy rich person, and the description was only shaken in a short time with a handsome but self-destructive rental boy (Peter Youngblood Hills). He is not less deceitful than he imitates. Also starring Diana Quick (the working people believe that "feeling embarrassed to live!"), As the black sheep of wealthy families, Lindsay Kolsen ("Easter"), Blake Ritson (separate for girls) and Gerzina Hell flamboyant kaymoos, all of its flashing boobs and sundry, without care in the world! Unfortunately, most of the effects of Roy's strong influence on the effects of Triplex effect mellow (three different 1.78: 1 in Figure 2.39: 1 with letterboxes in 1 frame, each individual gives a different view of individual scenes.), Which shrinks from the events on the screen of viewers and watchers. A long, untouched film, very personal for the wide appeal, and was hampered by a cinematic process that failed to reconstruct the story of the hand. A single-image version is available (created in a tratically 1.85: 1), screen title AKA: like LIES WISHES.
