This movie is similar to that of Ridley Scott, "Cone to Two Watch Over Over", which is a classic. It's Tom Badnerger and Mimi Roger and Fugitive Bad guy. It is a good movie, with good direction and great acting. The constant contrast to this movie. This is the same plot, just adding a good acting and TV movie direction. I do not have to choose the gesture and interaction between woman. He is very reliable and credible in many dimensions. Unfortunately, that alone can not save this carbon copy of the classic Readley Scott film. <br /> <br /> Generally, nasty TV movies have some release quality which makes them the least spectacular. I think the price of this movie is Rob Loay and the main female chemistry. That and I was able to watch and shoot other quality film plot.
