Since this show has changed from TSS (Screen Saver) to AOTS (Show Attack), it has been down. Yoshi and Kevin Rose TSSS with Alex ... etc. The show is awesome, then they were fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switches to AOTS, it becomes less on computers and less about gaming and magazines. This was a band that did not hear or care about anyone. Finally Kevin Rose did not see me once again. She kept it interesting, but she went to do her own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts, and shows etc. on the RV3 network. See it REV3.com I think, you can get it at www.systm.org. If you want a genuine tech show instead of AOTS, then see Kevin Rojes or listen to twit podcast. <br /> <br /> <
