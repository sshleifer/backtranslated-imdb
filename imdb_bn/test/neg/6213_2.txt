This movie was recommended to me so that we can see it together. I will not call it a movie, it's like coordinating 10 different incomplete, unreasonable stories, which is not all fun. There are several characters in the film who feel important at the beginning and they disappear from the story. He is trying very hard to fit everything in just 1 1/2 hours. <br/> <br /> <br /> I think this movie is an extended version of "hit", padded with a lot more characters and dances. "<br /> <br /> If this couple is the best movie ever made, I am sure that I am not interested in any of its previous issues.
