.. good movie, good, memorable movies. It's not entertaining, it's touching, funny, interesting and sometimes a little sub-human. Principals work in another world, worse, when they seem to relate to each other and the audience. <br /> <br /> Initially enough is enough. The new kid gets a new car for the undergraduate but Dean says the car does not have the car until the show. Yet goes joy-riding, and locked in the diner on the wrong side of the track for quick arguments with local yokels. Cute donkey's hairstyle / girlfriend / girlfriend Suddenly they do not play chicken until they are three minutes before the diner (which is not five feet at all stations?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, to stay in the city 'out of water' The only reason for getting the fish is to meet this scene that both boys can help in rebuilding the diner. Worse, the wealthy child is with the children of unwholesome children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This, with his boyfriend, certainly did not bode well, and Not fully explained. Why do not you know why Sam (Lley Sobiski) Kelly (Chris Klein), or why Jasser (Josh Hartnet) is allowed. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerant, completely helpless in Layle, and Josh does not register most of the impressions. The character of most lives gives the sentence to Cale and Jasper to help rebuild the judge. He gets off at least a fun comment, which is more than anyone else. You will feel a bit mad if you think laughing during the movie. <br /> <br /> The end is one way to finish the piece, not the most basic, but at least it's over. I do not enjoy any movie trash that some small girls really love somewhere in the world, but I'm not the one to do it. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not nonsense, and even though it fails to comply, its innocence and home touches, fragrance dialogue comes from a beautiful place. 4/10.
