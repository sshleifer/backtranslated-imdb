Another bad movie about OMG, Larry Buchanan. The man did not learn to stop, did not he? First of all, he gave us zero-budget cipher films and gave false statements about the famous dead people and now he is exploiting Ness Mono as a harmful person. <br /> <br /> "The plot" basically pretends to be a Scottish camping out of some people in the United States about the south. Well, out of the fishing hole, Oops, I mean loach lanes of Ness, there is a killer inflatable monster that clams himself to be Nessie, going from the way of killing people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the crew of MSST 3K did not listen to this movie. Yes, it's very bad.
