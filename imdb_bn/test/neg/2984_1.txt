Yesterday night I saw this movie and almost stayed. No, it was not because it completely messed me up, did not I? It was absolutely spontaneous! Sometimes, you watch movies which surprise you that in future a human race will be - this movie is one of them. It was such that writers, actors, directors, etc. came together and copied and stuck their favorite horror scenes on Flickr, assembled them all and said, "Hey Shawn!" After watching this movie, I could not help them, but they can be tortured in the eyes of people who are called "actors"; Waltzing around some kind of talented artistic interpreters ... they will not be fooled! Do not waste your time or money !!!
