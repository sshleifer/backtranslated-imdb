I have seen it in a preview screening and want to say that this documentary style movie is the most loaded trip I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Completely lazy, low budget, annoying, rubbish script, terrible acting - The whole audience (young and old) was sitting without comedy for most of the film comotose ... there literally you have almost two places Many people have left half the way - Can 'do not blame them ... I was thinking that the film will take off, however, I did not, and I would leave. <br /> <br /> Humor was really hair, and I am surprised that it has never been a big screen. I'm not offended by the adult content of this movie - it was not funny. Those who made this movie are not really worth your money, so please do not pay to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not enough fun to watch on TV, also give a single movie. <br /> <br /> I want to give 0 out of 10, but the system will not allow ...
