I love the film, believe and Gordon Lewis's natural technological gore does not bother me, but it's not just a blove fist in his most stupid movies, I'm not kidding. Gore Gore girls are a crazy person who goes a lot (again) - Go to girls at night (again). A detective and a reporter tried to find out the big secret. Maybe acting here is the usual average acting H. Yes. Lewis is a little better than movies, but it does not say much. The camera work is even awesome. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Do not let me talk about what is killed and just do with nipple. You're going to laugh like someone with this But all this mess is a better scene that I just love in the camp: the pregnancy girl was attacked before many American women danced too Americanly. Although it is important that it is one of the first films to get x rating due to the violence <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh and want to spend a good time (but only a lot, A beer lots).
