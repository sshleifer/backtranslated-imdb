I can think of the only word to describe this movie. Waste is not wasted during the time (not spent any time spent with these characters), but the waste of opportunity will be lost. <br /> <br /> When I look at this movie, I think of all the star trackers that the plays were written, made better films than Saturn's choice. Setup was like an average television episode, when it looks like the last episode of the last movie (you can call it). <br /> <br /> Under the direction of the second-quarter, under the direction of the second-quarter, Spock - how he faced Cubansy Maru outside the classroom, and how he managed his live live now he had the opportunity to start fresh. Shatana could do the same with Kirk here, but he did not do that. We do not know a lot about Kirk, which we did not know earlier. Again, one of the novels was good - try "My Anime, My Alley" for our friend James T's very interesting character. The small letters are mostly used for intelligent bits, and the Scoti-Uhura concubine thinks outside the left field, especially the original series is the Salu-Ohura. <br /> <br /> Even the hardcore fans will not find much to enjoy here. Sorry, but it's true.
