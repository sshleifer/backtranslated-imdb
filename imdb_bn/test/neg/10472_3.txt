In sweet water, ambassador entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is building a resort in the middle of the desert in protest of Katnah. When three employees find some Indian remnants and bones in a pent on the site, they suddenly leave the monster skeleton like animals known as giant bones and their bones are devoured by the monster. Half-ancestry Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxlitner) AK K. Wolf is in charge of investigating the disappearance of workers, Crunz was pressured to arrest protesters. But sister attacked Ether and killed other locals, when the Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horses) seeks an ancient Tomahak capable of destroying evil creatures. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a long and stupid movie, one of the most ridiculous screenplays I have ever seen. Characters and situations are not well developed and things happen without any consequences. Normally in the style of Indians like Bruce Baklitner of North America (in this story, his grandfather was an Indian), he was spending his wrist (why? And where is the blood?) And suddenly the fierce throwing of the sister Eater, the destruction of demons and the end of the story Hope My last question: If the bones eat bones, then what will be the meat and cloth of their bones? My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Dos√°adoro de Osos" ("Bone Eater")
