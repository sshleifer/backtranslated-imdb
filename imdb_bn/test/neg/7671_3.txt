My Tech: One of the coldest in airport movies and probably the worst of 70's disaster movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More actions, stupid subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. Still trying to be its largest airport, Concord: Airport '79 is still the worst, and probably one of the most disaster movies of the 1970s. With the result of her bad box office, this section has made her welcome more. It is no surprise that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is backed up by some impressive shots of titular aircraft instead of Lauf Shiffin (in this movie The same plane used will involve a crash in July 2000). But then credit is displayed, and we see a glimpse of "All-Star" Cast, which is nothing more than a Hollywood star, TV actor and any popular popular actors. This plot is much more than ever before: George Kennedy Joe came back to Petroni's role, Concorde (along with co-pilot Allen Dellon) now on the way to France after the Summer Olympics. Reporter Maggi Vellan (Susan Blakley) on the board, who discovered that her boyfriend, famous weapon manufacturer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), sells arms to terrorists. To prevent him from publishing the world's news, Harrison sends his most advanced missile and best sabotors to avoid concrete landing. <br /> <br /> Cast / concerts are less than ever before, even soft drinks or noises in singing. Our Cicely Tyson is a cool (!), Martha Ray woman in a bladder position (and does not go deeper than the character) as a live human heart transport, JJ Walker is a pot-smoking saxophonist (controversially the most annoying character in the film), "old" wife Cyber ​​Danning with Eddie Albert, with Avery Scriber as a Russian coach with Deaf Daughter, and finally, the story of the love story between reporter John Davidson and Jimnand Andrea Marcovic (coach Mercedes is looking into McKenzie's eye). Plus also the love of the boat episode comes closer with the four (and his pet's face) and Bibi Anderson's Silvestr camos. Campless buffs are no doubt in this silly entry among 70 disaster film strains. This one, more than understanding the word, is a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * 5 to 1/2
