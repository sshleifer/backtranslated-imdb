This is not a movie. It's a collection of random shots taken in a compelling part of the world, dubbed with some random text. The footage is not that great and the text is not that great. The last product is frustrating lazy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> The crew is also interesting to read about the tremendous risks and hardships to collect this footage. Very bad it's garbage. But I think "Fata Morgan made" will be an impressive film, like 'Ed Wood'.
