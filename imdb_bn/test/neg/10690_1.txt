My friends and I saw this movie last night. It was quite incredible. In all ways, it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. At first, it was tolerant. It's BAD IMPROV's ST unk but it's very curious that despite being itself the film itself is very long and drawn out and terrible quality (I think about right above the $ 400 budget ...). <br /> <br />> The biggest problem came from the lack of a script; With a background of improv, I know how difficult it can be to keep the short and efficient scenes. What happened in this movie was that the actors were left to develop the scenes and when they did not know, they were only fools for ages. At first I thought it was because the film was short and their lasting scene was needed. With the movie progress, I realized it was a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were so many parts where I can see that the filmmakers had a good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent!!) effectively pull it off. Many scenes were taken from a shot (because you know, Improv) that really felt like a long time. So annoying! If you can place inside and a half thousand terrible impulse, then see it. It's really funny in parts but really stupid and annoying. Acting from the range is terrible. It seems that the only good part was the part that had nothing to do with the original plot; Strong child, who swears a lot, barbershop, etc .. But yes. Painfully bad. Well, I was literally hurting. One hour or so, my friends and I just got bored and left.
