Okay, here's a really short review: blow this movie. I hope there may be only a review of this simple principle, but you must give birth to the words of 'worse' 'clipped' and 'unwanted', with more bad review type words. When you are drunk, you do not have the kind of work you are watching or stuck on a desert island. Premiere here: Vice President is captured by a terrorist group in a play-off hockey game and can only stop the Van Dam crazy. Really, really terrible, but then again, I did not pay to see it for the first time, and only my father was felt in the absence of neck in his bathroom after this film. I actually hate him, a Republican and all, but then again, he gave me the horror to pay for this piece of garbage. OK, now enough space recognized as a review, so I adieu bid.
