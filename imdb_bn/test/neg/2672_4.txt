Not sure what I can say / think about this movie. This is definitely the worst of the series (still "Halloween 3"). The style is just too different and it focuses on other elements than the previous ones. It tries to interpret why Michael Myers freaks out on Halloween and started a slaughterhouse around. Well, all the material about Michael Myers was a good effort, but it was a good effort, but I bought it. None of the installments in Syria tried to bring any new explanation. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of pride in this movie. Actually it is common murder. If you do not see other Hollywood movies, then you probably like it for its blood products. But this signals can be seen very well for a truly Halloween freak. Terror was turned into terrorism and murder (while blowing up the head ..., you get points) <br /> <br /> The last (theatrical cut) is simply awful. Michael becomes a thief with a needle, then peeps with a pipe, then again he gets screwed again with more holes, then pits a bit more until he is out of his head. (This green thing comes from somewhere?). Basically it's nothing more than the $ 5 million trash. <br /> <br /> There was a good thing though: Michael's mask <br /> <br /> <br /> dedicated to Donald Plasense, a lot of disrespect. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
