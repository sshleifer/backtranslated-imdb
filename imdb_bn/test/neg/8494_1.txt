What about this movie? Well, if I did not know that "the son of mask" is classified as a comedy, then I will not have any sources! A comedy? A tragedy, it's still the right genre for another-so-called-sigellale. Yes I have seen "fool and dumb" but I never believe that anyone will ever make his headline in Hollywood. Yes, you've seen "the son of the mask" and you think .. 5 minutes - fools ... 10 minutes - dumb ... 15 minutes for the dumbody ... and then, the only thing to say after 16 minutes is: / I'm from here ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, nominated for my comedy Cop of the Year 2005.
