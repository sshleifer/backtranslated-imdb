I can not believe this show is okay. J. P. The first of Monox's dreadful work for David Spade and the voice of Pachh is very deep compared to John Goodman. Theme songs are so annoying and episode plots so stupid !!! The only good thing for this show is Arthie Kitt and Patrick Warburton as Ijma and Crank's voice. This show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. Half of the episode movie is copied. In my opinion, the emperor was one of the best children's movies in New Grove years, but the new Groves of the Crank and they were completely destroyed by creating this show. You should see Spagheb, Fairy Oppendents, Danny Phantom, or Kim potential programs but this show should not be shown.
