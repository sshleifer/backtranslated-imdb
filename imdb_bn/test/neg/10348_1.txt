I want to say more? The good Australian version of the talk and Kim has been mentioned that it is good, because it was the reason for the ridiculous fun element. Because this new American-version version is so terrible because it is taken directly from many origins. Not to mention the infidelity of the letters. The tone is meant to be a thrust. Kim is meant to be fat. Kel (or Fill They've Been WWW) is meant to be cruel. Bret (or Craig) is a person who does not behave as a heroine and ends the sentence with 'bark'. Thanks Szawanski did not sell his rights to Sharon, he would probably become a tall blonde who likes Kim. <br /> <br /> Talk and Kim Mom and Dawood. They are not meant to look different in 2 years. And they are not meant to melted like school girls. This disagreement is a disagreement sharing the same title as the Australian version of the show. America: Get your own television show.
