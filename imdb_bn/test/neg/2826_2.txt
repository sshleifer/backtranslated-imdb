I wrote an article in 1981, the year I graduated high school called "Last American Virgin". I had a friend named Nazi who prostitute in this movie. Apparently my daughter kept my article in my house while sleeping in my house. After one year, I wake up one morning and see the advertisement of this photo. I am 18 years old and based on my life experience. The film is a bit different from my article, but it is definitely taken from it. My english teacher m There was no proof of this except Vires, who gave me one in my article. I can take it and do nothing about it. I could see what I saw around. Arrangement against anyone involved in this film. I had to close my book, because I never told anyone other than my closest friend and they agreed to keep it secret. In the same year it came out and I saw the dynamism in the market, she was really nervous to ask me if I had a good story or script. Since I'm all about Hollywood, which estimates you can receive stories from. It was interesting to see though the big screen part of my screen though. <br /> <br /> Ghost writer!
