I can not stress how bad this movie is. This director took so much "cute" shots at every cheap little shots at the look. Why is their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get a cracking new head of the crack? You should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> I want to make this fool a terrible crime, throwing the real actors something like funny and lolliphies fun. Why would you ask Clark to tired of playing a crack? Why are they crying so much? Why does everyone mean so? Why are these kids so messy? Someone wants to be so dirty? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
