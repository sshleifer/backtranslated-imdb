Well ..... this is not terrible, but ....... !!! ??? The worst kind of a low-budget budget back-flick, sort of and ... so quite charming and funny to see ... at least my TV set !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschel Gordon Lewis ... ... say, I'm exempting ... this trashy movie can not be any kind of "beautiful" way. Everything is very wrong that it will only be listed in my collection of pictures with me .... Venice's death ... Necromantic ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Burning ... Ok !! ?? People want to buy other people for Opera with other small talent for adding poor events or sexy events, this picture should be selected immediately .... Surely a lean lil 'Son' is waiting here, oh maanan!
