As a part of this movie, I am a warm reader of books. Buck, Ray, and Clo are the main characters in the first two films, but the second part of the second episode, Luis Gasset plays the second noise in the effort of the President of the JR. At the time of the war, he was based on his meeting with Buck, in the worldwide book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is - this picture is terrible as the first two. Amanda does not come from anywhere and has a significant part to play suddenly (I will not publish it even if anyone can not read the series). Other unreasonable parts feature. I really want to make Cloud 10 good left behind the film but sadly it is very similar to all of the first 2's.
