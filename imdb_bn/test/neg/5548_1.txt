Well, this stripped my nerve raw, they got that right. In the 80's I hired this movie first, when my friend opened a video store that he could find every rare movie. He carried all the shocks, horror and exploitation that he could dig, and I gave it to almost everyone. Previously I saw Blood Fist and 2000 Maniacs and The Wizard of Gore. They were awesome (especially for the time being), and the GAR wizard got quite nasty. Gore-Gore Girls, though I think the most annoying hilarious. <br /> <br /> I hired a DVD a few days ago because I wanted to hear this comment and it might seem that some cool dances and clothes I have forgotten that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion disappeared. I also realized that it was a movie that I did not see once. It was a fun part, but sing! It was a lot more repugnant than I remember. I was very awake at the movie Gore but I got so many times and I looked away. The DVD is not a good choice for all filming and cleaning with good sound and photo quality. মন্তব্যটি অংশে মজাদার এবং আকর্ষণীয় (আমি মনে করি এইচজি বাজেট 6100.00 ডলার ছিল বলে মনে হয়) সম্ভবত এইচজি লুইস সেই দিনটি ভাল অনুভব করছিলেন না, কিন্তু তিনি সামগ্রিকভাবে ক্লান্ত বোধ করেছিলেন এবং কিছুটা বন্যার সাক্ষাতকারের সাথে তার স্নায়বিক ঘৃণাও পেয়েছিলেন। Ed Wood Jr., sorry friend, but you're not exactly like Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She can not stand her). Haney Youngman owns a strip club. There is a bunch of really ugly murders happening. /> <br /> I'm going to apologize in advance <br because I do not want to mention, as I would be to light, but this movie was so bad *** "male company" more than me, Ed. Basically because of the dislike of the main character and director of women - and the audience - just oozes from each frame. It's not just murder. কোনও আপত্তিকর কারণ ছাড়াই কুকুরের ময়লা মত মহিলা প্রতিবেদকের সাথে তার আচরণের পথ থেকে বেরিয়ে আসা অত্যন্ত অযৌক্তিক গোয়েন্দা গোষ্ঠী (তিনি জর্জ ক্লুনিকে ঠিক মতই হুমকি দেননি) এবং তিনি এখনও কুকুরের মত তাকে অনুসরণ করছেন। তিনি ভয়ানকভাবে বিস্ফোরিত শরীর দেখে ভীষণ ভীত হয়ে ওর দিকে তাকিয়ে দেখেন, তারপর ঠাণ্ডা সোডা ঢেলে তার মুখের ওপর তার মুখের দিকে তাকাতে পারে। Later, he called police to the crime report: "No ... hurry ... he seems to be missing ...." This guy hero You can imagine how other characters can feel about women. I could go on and on but you might get the idea. Please note that I am making this movie more politically correct (and more interesting). This is actually more. /> <br /> Most of the actors cast to pray <br, they do not take away their clothes is not very easy to the eyes, so you can not see the movie to see nudity until very picky. Go-go নর্তকী সব দেখে মনে হচ্ছে তারা দৃঢ়ভাবে দৃশ্যটি শেষ করতে চায় যাতে তারা তাদের $ 10 পেতে পারে বা যা হারের হার তাদের দেওয়া হয়েছিল এবং তাদের ড্রাগ ফিক্স পেতে পারে। All right, it was not quite bad, there was a dancer who seemed to think that he was probably a pro and another dancer, which was with a huge Afro, which was not tragic like the other, but still was not very exciting. The only little thing that was a little amazement was like a laughing smile, for example, when a policeman was charged with the murder scene, he screamed, "Come out here before arresting me!" Not a bunch of journalists but some other police are quietly going about their jobs (though they mutter and walk). Heiney Yangman is kind of funny, like Levi, he said that his line was so fast that he needed almost subtitles (I'm sure he is trying to get the whole day fast so that he can pay and go out, where he is seeing some nude girls Do not seem to be.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are really big HG Luis fan Bang or someone of low budget movie makers think that is attractive. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you have seen it and you can go to other annoying but more entertaining low-budget movies in the early 70's ... This film does not even come close to say, "Pink Flamens" when it comes to the skip-the-popcorn factor Comes. If you do not see the HV Lewis film then I suggest you try "Blood Fest" first, you have a lot of time. <br /> <br />
