This image is supposed to be about the frustration of filmmaking. It certainly disappointed me with its endless annoyance. Setting an interesting Spanish beach resort with its usual big welding. The script is very weak text or perhaps there was no script. All ads-lib only <br /> <br /> "The Day for Night" was created in 1973, in a long way about the frustration of filmmaking. It shows all the delay and how Cast will behave in a tricky way. It does not encourage viewers and you will be comfortable with the director, in any case, the film must be completed.
