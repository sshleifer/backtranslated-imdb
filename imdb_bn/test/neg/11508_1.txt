Whenever I pass this program on TV, I want to completely and truly close my eyes and tear my ear. It's so incredible horrible. Jokes are not funny, acting is terrible and the entire whole show is a big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's frustration, and I just want to whip his face or whip him with his knife. She is a talent, less IQ, big waste in society, and I think she will make the world a favor, if she only * ceases to cee and goes for a long time. Please, I say with all these hearts, I can not even see an epside of this show !!!!!! Your life is not worth more than 30 minutes and there are thousands of good things, including to kill yourself including watch this show for half an hour.
