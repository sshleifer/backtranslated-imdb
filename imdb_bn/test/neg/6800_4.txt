If I did not like Diego Arba, I could have liked it. <br /> <br /> Did not really capture Arbia's unique visual aesthetic ("The Shining" with Twin Girls at Stanley Kubrick Hallway, which is a direct tribute to Arbitus's most famous films, and none of the terrible qualities of a movie in this movie), and of course Some of his characters (outgoing), screenplay (thin and Jewish, or Queen Kidman), or save some of the many places of worship In the similarity, he was in a fashion after which "freaks" and "exotic" photographs in much more. This film is "stylish", as a symbol of painter and personal power, in fact in shallow and expected fashion. Outside of it, it might be an interesting movie about middle-class fetish, but I was very upset about care. <br /> <br /> It may be less annoying if Arbia's name is skipped but she did not have the title, there was nothing to be interested in seeing it in the first place.
