After watching stop-loss, I found myself so disappointed that I found myself in frustration against Hollywood. The 1940s are proud of the glorious days of films, which are proud to be an American, who seek victory in the country and wish for death in the country. What we have kept in the mouth of the violent anti-Bush radicals The story tells three young men to return to the war. One is insane in fury in his control, culminating in his death. The main heroes exile his country during the war, and at the same time destroyed his best friend's relationship with his drunk. Thirdly, the protagonist of this story, elected to continue the war that was brought to our coast about eight years ago. What makes this movie worse, is not played, but behind the premises. We believe that the sorted soldiers are actually hateful to our country. The rebellion was like a kingdom during the war, and the principal drama flirt with her throughout the film. This rebellion was designed to weaken the audience's response to the central law of the film. We can not find fault with kings, because they wear medals, but their works simply do not qualify, but rather cry for it. He is not anti-hero. In order to take the film, the audience must admit the frustration of frustration because the story depicts the King apart from heroes. I can not accept it, because it's like calling me yellow in the sky on a clear blue day. In addition, the real hero is laughing for, the person who re-enlistists and continue to serve his country. I would recommend only this stinker that the damage to the Hollywood needs is guaranteed, because it is a clear example. No wonder it fared badly in the box office.
