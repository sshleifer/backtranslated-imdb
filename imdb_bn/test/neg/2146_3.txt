After watching the 50-year-old UVID movie, I came up with a few simple rules for making good films. <br /> <br /> 1. Must present your original letters initially within the first half hour 2. Keep your letters short. If you take a novel, combine the character and actions of small letters <br /> <br /> 3. In person 3. Confirm the credibility of your characters; If necessary, create additional scenes to motivate 4. Clear the action. Violence does not have to be clear, but it is not confusing, either 5. Get the best music money can buy. It is often more important than acting, photography, etc. 6. First of all, if a movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes then it will not be better. <br /> <br /> 'Canon for Cordoba' is not followed by this simple rule when the textbook example will happen. Elmer Bernstein's score is Ridicin, the worst one I've ever heard in a humble budget movie. Considering the Bernstein certification, it is astonishing considering ('The Man with Man of The Golden Arms', 'The Magnificent Seven', 'The Great Account', 'Katti Elder's Boys'). Paul Wendkos' direction is weak and confusing. The performances are very good (from Dawn Gordon, Peter Duvell) to terrible (Rough vulgon, Giovana Rally, Gabriel Tinti), and somewhere between the middle of the middle of the reliable reliable George Pepper. Considering medium direction and amateur script, it should not be surprising, which breaks 1, 2 and 3 rules. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I give 'Canon' a '3' for Cordova.
