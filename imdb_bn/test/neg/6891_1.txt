This movie was so anticipated and played poorly. I could not even suggest it to anyone even for the unconscious smile. It's just plain bad. This is pure TV movie Hell, Cast that does not seem to be bad, but they work terribly. Just stay away from this movie and rent something more intellectual like porn.
