One night, when I entered the TV, I saw in my father-in-law's house, my mother-in-law said that it was one of her favorite movies. Well, he could get it. See <br /> <br />, I can enjoy a chick flick till now, until it is good. But despite some good performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wieman, it is more remorseful, unrealistic, and easily anticipated. How quickly a woman who is away from her perspective of women is unusual. Oh well, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The happy and orderly happy little end makes me gog. And how often do we need to repeat the title to Otro Kr√ºger? Not once, twice, three times!
