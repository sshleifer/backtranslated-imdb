Now it's a frozen director of Franco's real Turkey, who gave us such classics as "Las Vampiros / Vimpoero Lesss". Yes, I think bad movies can be very fun. I enjoy the hilarious stories of Doris Weissman, Dave Esper, and Ed Wood Jr., but it has been proved too much for me. This is the first movie I rated 1. Where do I start? The screenplay is extremely stupid. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The direction seems to be incomplete. The best music coupe (used repeatedly in this movie) was taken directly from the movie "Dare Hexare" (1964). And boring it! Poor Sharley Eton and George Sanders! Sanders in one shot read a Popeye comic when torturing a girl in her henchman (this aspect is probably the highlight of this movie's intellectual). The only thing that bothers me is that Franco immediately showed female nudity when I thought the movie would benefit from it - this is the real guide! Still, in a movie I fear, the actors pretend to shoot them with the help of machine guns, it is not really appropriate.
