First of all, I'm a huge fan of shit films. B grade is always good for a smile. Unfortunately this image is just plain bad. I dressed as a zombie for a party and my make-up looked more than this photo. Especially the older man, at the beginning, seemed to see that his baby was pulled on his face with a cow. <br /> <br /> I do not have to comment on why acting is so bad. The effect is very amateur, when the clear blood tubes get shot, the blood jets shot right behind the jamir's head. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people commenting on this movie are trying to increase ratings. None of them will rate this image above 5/10. Actually, those who work in this movie are raising their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie, it's worth not to lose 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible
