Considering the subject, I think this movie may be the least enjoyable, if it closes a fine composition. I was roasted. I was still waiting to do something and it ended - I thought that it happened before the last bit. The only reason I gave 2 instead of 1 is because some of the repercussions of the impact deserve recognition.
