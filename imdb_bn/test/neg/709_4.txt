I have watched the last movie together with Atal K. Laurel and Hardiey and I look forward to seeing some extra footage in the United States Utipia Internet Archive, since the IA version is running 2 hours and 21 minutes. This is basically the same version that I had seen before, the same version that I saw earlier, the Basement basement VHS tape from the Good Time home video, which is hours and 23 minutes (except for the exception of a product location of the vineyard's grape juice label, if there is a bottle). With the rest Although Stan feels like he is going to die anytime, he performs a fine physical comedy with Oli for more than 45 minutes. Then a stoveway and a country without a country planning a yacht - not even mentioning a charming French singer that they are coming to live on an unmarked island, they all eventually have complex problems which most of the comedy ends up waiting to finally say to Stan Despite not knowing about Oli's end, he never completely restored, "Here's another surprise There is the mess you've got me! " Cry uncontrollably before Stan fades up before. In other words, if you are a hard-hearted Maria and Hardie fan, this movie is recommended for you to watch at least once. Anyone who wants to get acquainted with this classic comedy team wanted to search for their final Roch film to finish the sea in the sea from 1940 to 1940 for Hole Roach. Think about it, even better than '40 'to some of the LH Fox Flicks (they still see two made for MGM) ... Update -8 / 29/09: Some of the missing scenes appear in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherry is singing one and has a conversation with Captain. On the other hand, Captain's wife dragged the gun into Cherie. Another one, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!
