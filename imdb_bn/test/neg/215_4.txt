A new guard of armed truck Gig was appointed to steal 42 million from the truck by his colleagues. Any bad guys, so someone will get hurt, right? Of course, things go wrong and the new guard decides to consider and makes a living by saving the life of the deceased. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I did not actually see any interest in the film, but I did not have any interest in Fantastic Mr. Fox, and that made me the top ten of the year in the film. Ardad is even more of a disappointment then I will be in it. As a hijst film, it fails to deliver the goods, it is annoying and the fill of the plot hole and jumping into the liquefaction, anyone who thinks of it. Despite the fact, the film is a really cool cast, but the film does not even use its advantage. Everybody seems stupid to think that the character of wood wasteted. Columbus Short is a strange lead that is never charismatic and the audience does not want to give a shit. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the hijst and he first plays Mr. Knise Guy, then when things do not go on his way, he becomes very quick. Among the other impressive castes include Lawrence Fischer, Jean Reno, Skit Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amory Nolasak from Prison Break and Milos Ventimiglia of Heroes. Many of them do a lot and when they actually do something, it is not without much logic behind it. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively small, but it's time to run under 90 minutes, but it can be caught. How long can you make a movie about a person stuck? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more limited. Here is the logic of plot plot. 42 million and all of them have security every hour or so to check? The whole plan of my understanding was to run trucks in a abandoned warehouse and to hide the money. Get hit and pockets of trucks pose. Then they will walk away with money. Of course something went wrong, or is there a movie right? The so-called protagonist stuck itself inside the truck with an injured officer through a series of unfortunate events. The rest of the movie is dual and its crew is frogs to enter. How exciting is this <br /> <br /> The script calls for our hero's financial problems, he can lose his house, which is why he is losing his brother. You see, both of their parents died, and this was only for them, both of them were looking for each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. He did not want to be at first, but the problems of his money pushed him to throw him in thickness. How convenient. <br /> <br /> The whole spin of Arthard's full orthodoxy is that it runs from a armored truck, from the people it runs. After this basic premises, the film becomes flat on its face. I want to finish it talking to myself and everyone as soon as everyone happens. Last talk, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
