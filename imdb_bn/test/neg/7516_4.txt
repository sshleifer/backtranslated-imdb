Do you know that they want to get rid of the moon for real? And the controversial project in Geneva could make the machine possible? I can tell about this film which is based on the future (based on the movie) scientific project but real. Hope the movie will not be like the moon. Now about the movie, I also saw the original movie, and I also read the book. Although I did not like the book, but the film is yes. I totally agree with a predictable comment that this film was a bit dissatisfied with 60's. It was very good with the power, it is good that the future of a good future was in the movie.
