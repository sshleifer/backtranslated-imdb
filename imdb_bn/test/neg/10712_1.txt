This science will be one of the worst movies to come out of the fi channel. How the film starts, the only person on this planet is women because of the fact that until the future of chemical war is far away, it is OK as long as it only targets the soldiers (if your frustration, men), but the virus comes back again (the big shock) and the earth All people have died slowly. Then all of the men were condemned to die when Madam President was shot dead. From now on, two women scientists from about 60 to 70 years old are working in cloning a woman and one of them said, "Hey, why do not we bring people back?" Someone else is not saying that the world is not ready for him, but negligently ignores him and in this way a man gets himself again. Firstly, this film assumes that those who are not genetically altered are all blood thirsty monsters. Secondly, the writer has forgotten to mention that men today are a good mix of male and female officers, so there is no reason to have a virus like this. It is the biggest waist of time you can find. This movie is not only with my bad intentions, but also in the life-style style. <br/> <br /> I can give 1 out of 10, but only because I could not go less.
