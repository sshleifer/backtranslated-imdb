The lazy writing, the bad acting and the wooden direction led us to a film known as Hughes on the Canadian Made TV of 2005, using the same name, not to be confused with eight other films. Tory Spelling and her husband's husband moved from Sanfon to his small town, where they went to his old daughter, Palle, who still loves him. She is pregnant with Tori's baby (do not ask) and anyone who plans to reconnect with her old flame starts to stop it. Actors who are playing Old Girl Pale and Doctor are not significant, because they slip over the flats. Tori is not good at all, but at least he is an object which focuses on the focus, because it runs here and there before reaching a very hairy and well-known statistic. See instead the hand that keeps the crad.
