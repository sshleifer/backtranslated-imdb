Man Bear Bear People become beer. Man / beer beer fill. After man / beer carries beer / bears carry. The end Seriously, the whole plot of this film Yes, I simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And that can be touched, it certainly lacks to draw really on the potential conflict between the two sides. Also, there was a special misuse of the film's two mugi. But that dot is exceeded. <br /> <br /> Overall, very less under. Of course, much more needs to be entertaining. Perhaps the second letter in two main characters and more smiles to the more drama. Bad films from the good thing breaks out. "D"
