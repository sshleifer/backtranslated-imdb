All right, lets start with good. Building. Although it was difficult to believe that it had electricity, and after 35 years the fire was burning and the fire looked, the walls and the strange objects were attractive all over the world. Other than that, it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it is done by WWE movies. WTF? Are you supposed to want to see it? If anything, stay away. For them, the horrific, terrible idea for filmmaking and Gregory Dark allowed it to operate. Bad choice Preview previews were more interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can not start discussing how bad this picture is. Unbroken actors and a frustrating, unclear tale. Apparently many of the actors are "all entities" from that show. This is a wonderful why I have never heard of them or their show. Still, the bus driver, which you have never seen, just closing the door, has worked together with him. At least he manages the stunt for some beautiful movies. <br /> <br /> I like to watch scary movies, I really do. But it was so much that the whole audience laughing laughing laughing and smiling. Very boring. My back child was more yelping during other horror films previews. <br /> <br /> It does not see a film, even if you have to pay for it.
