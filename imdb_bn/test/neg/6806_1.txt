"To enjoy a fictional portrait of Fu - Deane Arbah," Steven Schneberg needs visitors to show all the reality of the American photographer Deane Arbus and the suspension of previous knowledge. Wickedly, it uses Dyan Arbia's name and knowledge much more to his life and work, which sets this film to fail on the grand scale. <br /> <br /> Beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman anti-glamorous Jewish Diane Arbis, who did not receive the Serenberg Arbis, and was attracted to Arzan only on a literary level through his work (impossible realism) and photographs of circus friction. <br /> <br /> Robert Doney follows a beautiful and trivial beauty and wild sci-fi biology with JR as Kidman's passionate love interest. However, the main flaw in this movie is not the incompatibility of this story, but the director's harmful attitude is that the world's single and original female photographer Diane Arbus, was unable to make his own ideas about his work. His earlier film 'Secretary' was a study by the female masseur, in its continuation, the female's successive screenplay looted the film - and in real life, Diane flew exclusively to Arbis's courage, determination and courage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is: This can only work if you do not have any knowledge of this topic or just choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> This is embarrassing because once you delete all references to Diene Arbace, this movie is an interesting research on fetishism and the secretary is standing on itself as a good companion piece. 4/10
