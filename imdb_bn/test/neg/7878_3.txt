I did not really understand the debate and were campaigning for this movie. Especially in French and neighboring countries (for example, in Belgium, where I located, for example), "Base Moi" was declared the most frustrating and most thought provoking social drama you can ever enjoy. Yes right It may be a little frustrating, maybe (how many times do you see the ass shot?), But the weak and void plots must not have given me much thought. "Baise-Moi" is one of their "blasphemy things in society" -the film and they are generally not very convinced. About 99% of people work perfectly in this society, why do not you blame this same society? Two main characters and their sad lives are introduced separately and in flashing. Nadin only killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother, and late at night, he met at a abandoned railway station. They decide to travel together in France, where they make stops and are behind sex and blood. Although we face ongoing pornography and violence, this picture is too annoying to sit down. Like girls, it is always instructing themselves, the dialogues are lame and the people that they (and kill)? They are very selfish. If people want to create porn movies, it is good by me, but it does not pretend to make art films. When you leave the oath and hip-camera-work, all is to see (not so) arousing pornography. Cool soundtrack, though!
