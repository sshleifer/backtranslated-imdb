Yes, my summary is just talking about it. <br /> <br /> Try it if you do not see it. But not for pleasure. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Etc. .. It is especially aggressive, when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotypic. I mean, okay, "Codi" was a time or other fun, but unlike other "stupid characters (like TM)" like Woody among cheers or joie friends, he did not get a good line. His stupidity is thrown in a "duude" way, which gets quite annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> Family morale is awful. Everything for the family Mother and father are the greatest dictators, who are strict punishment and parents of the old parents, always say that they "love" their children, and finally, the kids love them * Burke *. <br /> <br />: There is always a "tender spot" shrinking in "Action", where American (C) (TM) monologue lessons are forced to sexually harass on viewers (in a mature condition, you are not sex before. You can 18 (!!), kind of way), or drug. Even the practice of church is thoroughly described here. The whole idea is directly ill, made in half-heartfelt way to earn money. If people like Karen and Frank are there, please lock them and cut the key. <br /> <br /> So, with the theme of the uprising of religious campaign, I think it's the end of the way I've done my subject ...
