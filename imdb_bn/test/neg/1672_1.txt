I got this movie "50 All-Star Film" for $ 18 (45 cents each). very good. This one was terrible. It's a hackneyed retrace 1000 times better and every time it's good. An overwhelming former joke shows the courage to train a group of teenage criminals. They can learn from them that if they can play by the rules they can make it. I'm sure the kids and locals were thrilled to be included in an "original TV movie", but I can not imagine what the project is going on and what people think of it that they can already bring it on deadly topics. I wait to see that 'new twist' or 'new angle' but honest, it does not come. Avoid this movie. Forget about 45 cents, I need 96 minutes in my life.
