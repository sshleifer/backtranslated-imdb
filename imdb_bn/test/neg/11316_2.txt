Leslie Nielsen is usually the one whose movies I like (usually "Dracula: Dead and Losing It" and "Wrongly Criminalized", also criticized by critically banned flickr). So I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" that in fact it should show a piece of junk. It holds Nielsen as a mysterious title character, some plant it on it and he surrounds everything. It looks like Nielsen's director and director Stanley Tong (behind Jackie Chan's two films), it will create a ridiculous film, but not so; It seems that they just have to do something, and there is no real humor in here. <br /> <br /> So Jim Bacon's original cartoon was deserving of voice, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has done a lot better, so this is no reason to waste your time. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolsky, Arne Hodson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferro; They probably do not want to force this crack to junk their career.
