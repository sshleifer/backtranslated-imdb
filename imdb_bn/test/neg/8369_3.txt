I sort of gushy reviews and hatred reviews I have long been a fan of Lovekahara (and 'Purist') for a long time, and when this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had many liberation qualities. I've ever seen the worst thing to go to see, and if the lovers roam around her grave, it was astonishing, but I really liked it that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I do not want to catalog movies, so I will say only a few people who keep this movie from 'star amateur effort'. <br /> <br /> It is shot on a low budget and a video cam, so it has the appearance of some soap operas, but once you use the concept it can be a big deal. The direction is quite amateur and rather brutal to use the distance between framing and shot frames. Still, the film was actually unclear, and it kept almost all the favorites of Stuart Gordon and Brian Expeditionary Travelli (my main exception as my films re-animator and Dagon) together with the lover's intentions. The idea of ​​being inspired by some of the old one is on the inmouth of Dynch Hurr and Shadow's memorable (which does not sound like this movie !!), so the overall plot is quite trustworthy for the ideas of love. One thing that bothers me is that the Bible's words disturb a zombie prisoner and begin to fear. I'm not sure whether this "word of God" meant to annoy the old public or to this particular zombie. There was no real answer. In the meantime, the remaining Christian symbolism reminds me about the myth of Darrell's August. So in a way it was a darling style of mythology. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this photo as a curiosity. It shows that with almost zero budget, it is possible to create almost atmospheric films. I like setting up wine cellars The outdoor shot was sad though. The same stretch of the beach and the trees (and almost the same shot shot) was really sad to express the long journey of 3 letters. The director needed to make the head elevated for that. Acting was ideal for an amateur movie, the blonde zombie girl got a personal prize for "the best image of the glamor by the Italian actress". Actually I think this film was made before the Lord of the Rings film. Andy Sedrish saw him and thought, "Dang, he will make a big galum!" <br /> <br /> <br /> The little bit of Koodo, the director. Makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. I was restless at this and almost obsessed watching. I was "Oh so we know him possessed and possessed", but after the movie you see a painting makeup like a girl faces an old woman (both living). So it was not an attempt to say 'Goth makeup = zombie' but rather 'Goth makeup was left after the clothes'. However, possessed / zombie equals 'blue contact lens' ... hey. <br /> <br /> Complete, I still prefer this movie better than Yuzna and Gordon film (except the exception mentioned above). Yunis and Gordon had a lot of budget, but they did a better job than a lover-like story and in a small budget. <br /> <br /> I know a quick word for make-up artist, you're asking for something in the 'bird' or 'jaria' fingers, but long, black press-on nails looked really stupid. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And ugly "that collected any mood of the scenes playing the small stairs. It was beautiful, but was not beautiful. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker of this movie has read in love and paid tribute to him. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character Carter with bad dreams, and the character Pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.
