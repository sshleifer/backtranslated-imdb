I do not believe that I saw this horror movie this bad ... hell, I do not believe I've ever seen this horror movie. Acting alone was enough to make a cringe. Bad acting went horrible to go beyond the film fat. It was just awful in the sea. And are you those people who check out the awesome effects of God? When the giant (who looked more like a doll made more of a cheaply built doll) comes out of the wall, I did not say that I want to be afraid, or could laugh my ass. As a huge fan of horror genre, this picture was frustrating more than disappointment. I could not help but see from director Portland, OR, which could be my own city. I must be deeply ashamed. If I could, I would like to give this image a negative 500.
