For some reason I did not like it very much and I bought it and found it with my family that I felt embarrassed about how bad it was. We all hate it with a passion. This is a nice enough kids' movie, probably it came in the year. However, think about it: an old kids' movie? What is the matter? Children generally do not like to see old films like this, and I do not see the adults should get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some kids' movies (such as Mary Poppins or Wizard Oz) can now be enjoyed now, but the time bandits are completely old. For your reference, and I think this applies, I do not like Dr. Strangelovov or Spinal Tap. So, if you disagree with similar old movies with me, then you can choose the time bandit. <br /> <br /> I remember the bad guy. Remember two stupid 'bad pirates' in Peter of the Sea movies, except for the time band, they are not even remotely entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, I warn you, which I can do. People loved this movie many years ago. If you have not seen it before, then do not bother seeing it now.
