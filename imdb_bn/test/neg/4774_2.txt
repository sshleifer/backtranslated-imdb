It was possible ... it really did not. But there is a lot about the movie about the sunny and humorous movie. I was a scary movie Wayne and I thought it was stupid; As my 13 year old! I was expected to be at least cripped out.

Puh-lease! Go to a foreign country and leave the tourist area without a translator or able to speak a bit of the language? Do not these people die? <br /> <br /> German is not heard from a brother and he does not call for help. Who does this? Is he a little searching and searching to find some Greeks and Americans?
