Kubrick may be the greatest director of all time. She could have made more classic than anyone else. She might have been a perfectionist. But man, his first attempt was bad! <br /> <br /> There were enough reasons for Kubrick to try to remove this image from the map: It looks like an Ed Wood film. Its strange description, cheap shots, bad conversations, your 50th science-fired / horrible harmful harmful music, and for some reason do not look like a cast like "Refer Madness". <br /> <br />> Sure, you can see a resort Kubrick there. It's a mental / horror war war. The letters became dehumanized and insane. People are playing multiple roles. There are various human face and special facial expression constant shots. And there are some interesting shots around there. But really, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not bothered to see you. If you get a hold of it then you are joining your chosen group and thousands of people have access to it worldwide.
