Today I had a real desire for a Sci-Fi movie and so I decided to check Battlespace. Sadly, this year was one of my biggest mistakes. <br /> <br /> I see Director Neil Johnson has handled over 500 music videos and I think he'll go back. Music videos are a great way of entertainment, and not everyone can make it a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably the voice. And since special effects often say a lot to terrifying. Voice over did not work on the Blade Runner, and it does not work here. The first story is spent while watching the main character walk through the desert, when her daughter tells the story. I think the story can create a great movie, but it's not good. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the impact. They are simply bad and they do not mix perfectly in the photo, so you simply do not believe in them. And absolutely all the frames of the film are filtered, and not in a good way. Use filtering as an effect is good. It's 90 minutes bad, <br /> <br /> <br /> And all the gadgets are always talking about, and not being closed? !! If I used technology I would go crazy. I was waiting for fire to fire the guns: "I'm sorry, but I think the ammunition is closed." No, stay away. This movie is not worth the time.
