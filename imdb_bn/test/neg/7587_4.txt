I generally do not appreciate the lightweight effort to create a funny story, which means "Anita no parde el trenen" can not score too much for me. The story is well: middle-aged but still handsome woman finds a new love. But in the romantic comedy, the film became just a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> These productions include "Amic / Amat" (QV), "Todo Sobre May Madre" (QV), "Las Amargas Logrimas de Petra" Von Cunt "(QV) and" El Embrujo D Shanghai "(qv). But those who have the power over the years have thrown many insignificant elements for the movie and television, something like Jose Coronado can be said to be able to create a completely serious performance. Runco is safe in this group. <br /> <br /> In this way, I was left with the feeling that I would be happy to see this film in a serious voice, which the actors really can show their performance skills. That should be done with the same leading actor as it is. Genius disintegration on a rather stupid film that can actually be very optimistic.
