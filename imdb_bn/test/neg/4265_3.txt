There is nothing to show an old man who is in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly It is not so clear from the start that they are starting to direct them to fall in love towards each other. Naturally, two people (not age or time) force each other to stay around as if they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Everyone should have chemistry. This will solve the biggest problem. The people were also mad at the reservation against the subject and probably believed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, I realized that the more difficult, why the winner - a photographer and an artist, who feels serious - had to be so passionate about a girl. Unless he hides himself, he does not hide himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is usually used to show something unusual or something that is not right So RGV is calling itself irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Camera emphasis on angle, background score, editing, even shots and symbology compounds and emphasizes their relationship. The Indian audience is so stupid that we need to say something in our 10 different ways for our understanding? Especially when the two of them were dancing together ... it was clear what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scenes with dramatic background music? I remember very well selected topics. But Verma must not forget about this issue that it is a controversial issue. If it is, then handle it shamefully, why not?
