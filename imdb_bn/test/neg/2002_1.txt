Please do not waste your money on this sorry plea for a motion picture. The only way to see it is to be a deadly fan of the Iraqi Ilianik, but you can stop surfing the internet to see this scrap. I would rather go through this observer to see the paint dry. <br /> <br /> They wished you with Caspar and Erica and believed that this is a science fictitious film, but it's fast-growing Van Helsing's grandmother (you can get points)), here's a wonderful surprise for yourself and Dracula To make a last show down. The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, when it seems that no one in the future knows who God is, they have not been taught about him and do not understand when they see the cross. This can do much more with the idea. It has become a shame way to do it.
