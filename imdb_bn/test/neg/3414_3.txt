I just bought this DVD because it was dirty and it seemed very special in its own way ("special" meaning "disabled"). The film has become quite unusual - the work of boring camera, nothing really drives the story, and of course the act is horrific. It was not even "bad" in a campie way - it was just plain bad. In fact, there are a number of great lines of dialogue, but in most cases it is weak and weak. I would have thought that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a big overhaul (if it was written by someone who is actually a drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. I do not recommend with "Film of the Babysitter" but if you do not plan in a career in movies and want to learn what to do in a movie.
