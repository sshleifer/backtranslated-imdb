Repeat: Macbeth is not fully familiar with Shakespeare's story, but my wild guess is that it is very close to the original, only set at the present time. It tells the story of Macbeth's story, a crime syndicate member (?) In Melbourne. He is a valuable man and leader of Duncan. But he and his lady have a higher ambition than that, and planning to kill Duncan, and no contest of the throne. It is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death. <br /> <br />: Very interesting idea, I must say. To use the story but change the setting at this time, but still keep the real (?) Dialog. It sets a huge contrast between Scriptural poetry and violence. Very committed to be violent, it is a commitment that keeps it, but the idea I do not imagine. It's really very bloody, but violence is slow. Just figuratively saying that it is calculated, which it is very, but literally. Many steps go slowly gradually and it is the film that brings the film to its knees. <br /> <br /> What could be a unique force, the contrast between extra and poetic dialogue and extreme violence, is now active in something completely different. Now both sadly slowly become very slowly and annoying gradually that is very slow. <br /> <br /> I also do not understand the context of dealing in three witches. Set the current time and reality that I had no place in this witch magician movie. Apparently it is, but to me it seems to find the whole place. Not a concubine, but it is not a complete sub-story with its own rules, but is completely different than the rest of the film. The place seems completely. Certainly it has been possible to transform somewhat modernly. Drug-induced hallucinations are probably (which I suggest to the director, but then he has left more witchcraft to be credible)? Now they just got the movie next to the movie and I waited for the original movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but what could be something for Shakespeare-Buff? <br /> <br /> 4/10
