With a name called "10 Commandments" you would expect a film to represent the Bible account, especially the journey. Not so here. This is an ideal method with the film produced by Bible Hallmark. Remember "Noah" ?? That was a complete fiction and one of the worst movies ever made. At least the "some" of the original story of this movie was true. However, the main character of this movie is Manithath - Moshe's half-brother, not in the original story. Other characters were missing, not to mention important events are completely removed. So what, can you ask? Because it should be representative of the real story; Otherwise, some maybe and believe that it actually happened. In today's era, people get their religion by reading the Bible instead of the church. Also, this is a great error. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change it? Apart from EXCLUSIVE's account (which should be the main focus), you have the Seasonal BIG movie to compare it, which is clearly a lot of good presentation. <br /> <br /> This was the first night that was broadcasted, my wife was worried to see it. I hope that I do not expect him to be a hallmark-film. He looked surprised and said, "Why? Hallmark produces good movies". That may be, but they are in the Bible Butcher I'm sorry that I was right. Not just the story, but as well as acting. With today's technology, you should be able to create a wonderful bible movie. I'm still waiting ...
