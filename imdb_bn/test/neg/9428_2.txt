This film reeks the production line plan. It looks like movie makers have watched the latest hit movies, and dropped Scragti on screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allison! Anthony Manna! Baseball! Fight! Baby! The aircraft! - Roll 'em! - Film stewart / allyson addresses the age of actors; Although, I'm sure that still think they are too small. <br /> <br /> "Strategic Air Command" peculiarly disgusting and offensive messages found in, but I'll be really annoying with the material: a happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character takes an important decision without consulting his wife. In the film's most dramatic scene, he calls it to him. It is completely settled - Alison is crying her heart over her bed, and Stewart walked on her. There is no discussion; He simply says that he is right, and his devious wife walked out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> Stick with Stewart-Allison of "Straton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Man ~ James Stewart, June Alison, Frank Lovejoy
