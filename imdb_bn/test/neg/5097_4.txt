Most of the other reviews fall through, I mostly agree with the comments. What I'm adding is the film directed and produced controversial ways. I think in this new wave filmmakers, some feel that they are using the unusual (occasionally blurred) camera corners, clever and flying from one scene to another. It goes well with these movie festivals, and with some of these indie type critics it also destroys the movie for me. I noticed in the review, in one comment that the filmmakers did not become a movie blockbuster. It would probably prove my point, because the film is a 'lost' feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie lacked the available flow. To post a poster to comment as a big name for Kifar Schuurland, I will be cringed while watching the final cut. It is actually a possible story, wasted trying to isolate its production. Observers are valuable, but will not come back for a second view.
