This film seems to be an exposure to current trends towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Over the world, the wineries join the majority of the majority (American filmmaker, Mandvi, in this film), or pay high quality experts to help create "perfect wine" - and as a result, the alcohol is becoming very good and predictable. Some, this is a good thing (especially for a few daily wines, you can pay 50 dollars or more) and others are harmful because the small winner's ambition disappears. I really understand the concerns of both parties and do not think of a villain or hero in this business. Sure, good and cheap wine is a wonderful thing, but what happened to the beer (eg giants like Uniube and Aniiser-Bush), food (McDonald's), shopping (European shopping malls are different from Americans) and Mega stores (like Walmart / Asda) ) The uniqueness of "little boys" is taken far away. So I was definitely ready and willing to hear these filmmakers. However, with a product that was nearly one and a half hours long and with a general lack of focus, the film became very big and I lost interest. The 80-90 minute focussed film will be more effective - especially the average viewer is not an unqualified (a loud sound for a "wine aficionado"). <br /> <br /> Very positive side, filmmakers are not smart enough to talk about it - and they should talk only on both sides. Plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. However, in spite of choosing a good style of making the documentary, the film easily travels the way, the path, the path goes a long way, and produces very slow films.
