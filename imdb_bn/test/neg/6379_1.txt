I have tried to watch this event in different shows and every time it seems humorous to be embarrassing. The reason for mentioning one thing is that it is only based on any ridicule by Republicans. In short, it seems to be the humor of the Democratic Party's political opinion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Knowledgeable about what Stuart Republicans did, and the audience hugged themselves in the laughter of laughter. <br /> <br> I guess the left is so vain for any real object that they have to define themselves that they all hate Republicans. <br /> <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> I believe: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
