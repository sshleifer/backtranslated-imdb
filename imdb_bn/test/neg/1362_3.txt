This movie is full of pseudo-deep thoughts and it's closing in its author-wit, which includes a canad-ham voice and some incredible dialogue. While writing "clear" characters sometimes (not always) are the dialog that spike skinny and tone deaf. For those who like movies like April and one-hour movies, it's another one for you. <br /> <br /> This comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling, who showed his great surprise to the believer. A film that proves that movies and media when it is hijacked, it should blame that there is no error in the actors.
