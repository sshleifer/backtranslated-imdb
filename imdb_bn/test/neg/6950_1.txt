I'm not saying that I love watching bad movies which are entertaining. This movie is 100% distributed. It's the worst movie I ever seen hand down. This is in a city random stuff (such as people walking, traffic, skylines, etc.) is within the crappy stock footage which is not confined to anything. Then there are too long 'sex scenes.' They are stocking each other and frequent lots of them. This is not erotic in any way and the awesome thing you can find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene where the so-called 'barely legal' girls are two who may not be over 40 years of age, spreading each other in blood, but a crew member bleeding blood from outside. Girls keep their smile No line should have been remembered for this movie, if they can not read the cards clearly, there is a magazine in front of them that they are struggling through strange conversation. Then there's Mr Creepo. He can take Ed Wood around the name of how he can take it, but he is far away from anything. She wanders in a cemetery about random things in the movie, which really helps the lack of full flow of films. We did not stop laughing during this movie (except for sex scenes where we had profits and occasionally became scared) <br /> <br /> I let this movie go beyond all my expectations until 1/10/10 for a horror movie.
