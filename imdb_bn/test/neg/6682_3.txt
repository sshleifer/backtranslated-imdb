This was the first feature for Clinton, I was there, when he returned this mess to Adelaide near 98 ... <br /> <br /> I was not directly involved in production, but I was usually a witness to the confusing behavior, the post set , Which went down: parties, medicines, confusing glamor, what should be done when making a movie is really an example, but young, talent Take a copy of the classic tenets of getting caught. <br /> <br /> I liked Clinton, we had a weird friendship, with one more mature script to claim to have another crack ... there were problems, and I'm sure there would be a lot of good work, if the next time round ! Because, honestly, he must have done no partiality with him in his own civic and did not cast ... but hey, it was a money job where the actor died regularly in the country. <br /> <br /> In short, 'basically made 'Awesome to watch, not so much fun to experience (oh!).
