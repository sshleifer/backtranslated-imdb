Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was badly written. First of all, during the hijack scene, Irons sit comfortably at his chair ... he seems to be reading something, and calmly too! Perhaps the actor takes the shot in the director? Also, the violence at hijacking was a big disappointment. Slowly, bullet flying - how his wife and daughter die is not only interesting and tension is lost. After 10 days of his sadness was lost. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his art journalists and the embassy (he is a journalist for the Sticky Economist rage) and see, they actually suggest him to find the bad guy! How do they know? But really stopped me from the movie, when Irene found her way in a warehouse where the bands were hanging - but the Baddies who killed her wife - and beat them on either side. So he's just a murderer. She gets away and, well ... I turn it off. I mean, I did not understand how his friends knew something, and I also felt that he was the other two who were behind the real hijackers of Hefazate Islam. Instead he is going after their friends, I guess, or hangs in the warehouse and almost anyone around laying automatic weapons. Terror was simply prevalent and the conversation was lam ("It just helps the boy, cry," he tells his son, "no it is not" and the father says "you're okay ...") Irons takes the suspicious role - he That's like a Dragon movie. He was excellent at Bridehead Revisited, which is a completely different animal than this hot thriller.
