What I can say is that this film is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means that no solid characters, no specific style, no style, poor performance for all types of sexual intercourse, but no breasts and tees (because the boy, Will not diminish it in sleaze depth?) But heavy simulated sex, well, that's OK. <br /> <br /> I must ask myself when watching these movies, when will this TV channel and when their advertisers grow up? I think this company is actually way behind. They really have a formula protected with the younger generation and if they knew we would demand change. Most of the American TV channels, such as the full point, are often asked to reproduce the same satirized, distributed rubbish over-the-counter like the Generic Movie Assembly line. I guess it works for them ... or at least have it. Although not sure about the future. <br /> <br /> Do not add yourself to death just as I did. Find some real tv movies in HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that tries to try their work and does not have to ask what a priest can do or show.
