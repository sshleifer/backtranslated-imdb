If you like bad movies, this is one practical behavior. Kaufmann and Peter robot roamed around the costumes, leaving only slavery in vain futility and finding true robot love. I believe this is the first movie I ever thought of walking. Note that I was 12 years old, and could be entertained by shiny objects.
