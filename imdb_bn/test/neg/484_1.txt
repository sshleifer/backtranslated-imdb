I'm on this terrible excuse for TV movie. I simply saw it because I did not have it and my only option was golf, college basketball or local news. The plot is very generic and there is no material that I can see, not to mention that it was a big mistake in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, the washed astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will reduce the Earth, which will end throughout life. He laid the foundation of his belief in the invention of Aboriginal cave painting (I'm sure I made a mistake). The images show a clear timeline, which shows significant events all over the world, such as the Great Wall of China. All events are shown in the order of the perfect chronicle, and the very last picture of the timeline is destroyed by the earth. Now to me, if painting shows something that actually happened, then why would the great doctor believe that he could change how it is going to happen? All that aside, the movie moved along the formula precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me. The actors were not very good, and at some occasions I felt that they did not take the film seriously enough to try to convince me. The whole movie was a uninterrupted waste of clay roads and time and money. I'd recommend Armageddon on this piece of punk any day. At least ArmedZone played some good (compared to this), Liv Tyler that does not mention eye candy. Now I'm thinking about it, golf is not bad .......
