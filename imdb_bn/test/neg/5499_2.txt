In the past, I liked Tim Burton. I like Ed Wood, Edward Sisaurands and even Mars Atex. But I hate this movie. In the beginning, for the first 25 years of the historical play, scenes of dress plays were poorly done. Then there was all the cutting-edge scenes, which kept me cool, and the thing that is to be understood, I think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and fog in the evening, and the horse's horse had a great influence on the outside of the tree, but the whole movie was just boring and meaningless.
