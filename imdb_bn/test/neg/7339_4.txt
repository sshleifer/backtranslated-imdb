I love books It emotions, romance, tension ... and the film takes two spinners with stars. Kylie Ming was already a great star in Australia, she starred in Nebberes and her first single was released. The decision to cast him into Delinquents was certainly a marketing plan. For me, it was not closed. <br /> <br /> Kylie might be very good among the neighbors, but she was innocent to play very sweet and innocent lola ... and, she was not Asian but was born as Lola. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between her and Kili. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
