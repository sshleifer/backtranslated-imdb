Not only is the movie lam. That's more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another western? How is the role of a Western title with African Americans? Is the word stupid, incredible and attempts at modernization of a stylish endeavor? It's about Incredibly lame and simple mind. It's like Lam Boom Luharman's film "Romeo and Juliet" where he attracted young people in modern times and created some campaigns through the reconstruction of a classic story. Well, Buzz Luhorman has unfortunately failed, and so did this mess. The story is not really bad, but the custom of an African-American cast, apart from racism, eliminates the whole concept of apartheid itself. It is a pious and simple psychologist (such as Buz Luharman-Man he is a bad director). Hey (I've heard you say) This guide Mario Van Paibel! He is in the picture! How can it be racist? Not that I told the idea of ​​throwing all Afro Americans instead of the Coxians. The film is not racist, it is simply useless, stupid and very annoying.
