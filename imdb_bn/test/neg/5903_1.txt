Oh this movie may be so much better. This is a beautiful story that was set in the very endeavor, and yet it was executed very badly. Leading actors have done excellent work in the past, and in most cases they do enough work in this movie. Sometimes their dialogue is stilted and forced to think. The instruction may be more concise. Most critics of the criticism have to go to the people who took a good story and made it tedious. In short, there are many better ways to spend thousands.
