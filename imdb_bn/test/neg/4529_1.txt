This movie sucked. The problem was not with throwing. I was great to cast, a lot of good talent, a lot of great acting. But the script was very fatal! It seems that Steve Carroll could do his improv which is mostly the frame work. And that he works well, but it does not work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was non-sensitive and the scenes were random and the side lacked. Also, most of the work was thought to be very narrow and bad. It was a good effort, but Max said, they missed it a lot! I am surprised to see how many illuminated reviews for this stinger in IMDB. Clearly, filmmakers are allowing people to write a lot of positive reviews in their films and fill in the entries on IMDB. If you read positive reviews and compare negative reviews, it is clear that the original reviews from normal users are clear. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that did not work. I love Anchor Man's Steve Carroll, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never see this movie. Yes, I had a few light moments, a few chocolates, but there was no real laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He used his special Swiss Army knife ... but instead of using Conifer's blade, he tried to bind his smallest crossbow. And Crosby miss-fire and repeatedly throws some sharp arrows in it (almost by putting his EYE), Mac leaves it instead or tries on the fruit ... No, he just shoots himself with Crossbow. Was he really hoping to do with that crossbow? It started to be the most options on the knife trying to remove the binding. It just did not create any sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of common situations in this movie created scenes. They made ridiculous, bad thoughts, badly inspired, and made pure messy. And that was really confusing. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big lot-down, and I recommend you avoid it. One note from IMDB: You will be going to do something about this stupid review that people are going away. It reduces the authenticity of the site.
