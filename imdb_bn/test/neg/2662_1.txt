Have you ever seen the "Marathon Man" movie? Part of the dentist? I could rather sit through "Random Hearts" that would happen to me. It was not just reluctant or unreliable - it's terribly painful, and agonizingly boring In a moment, I lose momentarily feeling. To the average people, I could have been asleep, but the other film's patrons wisely understood that I actually came out of the armor. I thought I was going to die. When the film finally ended (I think it was twelve hours long, but I'm not sure), I thanked you "thank you, Jesus, it's over !!", which is all the other movie enthusiasts. If I heard the Harrison Ford drone in a single second, then I was forced to find some sharp jam in my eyes to attract my attention. This is 136 minutes of my life I will never return.
