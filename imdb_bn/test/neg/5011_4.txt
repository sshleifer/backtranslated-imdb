Rafessi (1991) is a bad comedy / drama that tried to strain each level as a serious film about college football. Present and former superstar athletes appeared in one of the comedy highlights in the film. Other that it is a very middle movie. They should be stuck to make a straight comedy filled with reality. Instead the filmmakers try to play both the fields and they end up at the short end of the stick. Will anyone think about college football fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> T.v. until it is recommended. Free at
