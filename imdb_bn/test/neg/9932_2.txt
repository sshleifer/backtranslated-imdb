I grabbed it in the HBO under the category "Guilty Pleasures", and I would agree that I saw it guilty (and glad). One, it trash, and really messy trash. Two, the plot is slowly and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?". However, if Pata Wilson wants to sit through a poor film for some reason other than being totally naked, sometimes I would definitely like to be in the stage of a male champion pig. Do I feel messy for seeing it? Yes I'm sorry I saw it? No So, there is a conflict of good film lovers and female anatomy lover, even when in a poor movie. Sigh!
