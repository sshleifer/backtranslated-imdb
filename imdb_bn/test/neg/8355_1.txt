This image is bad as "Birdman of Alcatraz". I refrain from acting, but refrains from portraying the background of both films, which try to illustrate the heroic identity of psychological offenders. Furthermore, when it honors me, the respected actors like Alan Alada (and Bert Lancaster) play a similar role because their status credits the director's intention to increase the status of the film. <br /> <br /> I was in junior high school in the last years of his life, and his death sentence appeal and books were much more in the news. I think GroundSwell thinks that the death penalty was wrong and the chess man was a victim. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take hold of the man. Read history. Chessman was a criminal and sex hunter. Police raided the street on the streets in the night. On the complaint of traffic arrest, he stopped cars with attractive women; Then kidnapped and raped women. Rape is the worst injury that a woman can experience and many say that she likes death for her terrible and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Whatever Cheesman deserve, it's been just a decade. No sympathy for Satan here.
