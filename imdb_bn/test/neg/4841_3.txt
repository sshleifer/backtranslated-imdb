It is considered to be the first Polish West and it is written and operated by Pierre Uklanski. Known as the Dead Man's Bounty in the US, this film uses some weird visuals that tell a short story in a conversation. Val Kilmer plays through a dead body and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some weird visual situations are actually comical in a sick way. A young man of my choice closes his own finger through a hanging and actually tests himself in the rope. The cowboy, known simply as 'Newborn' (Karel Roden), has found a dead man (key) that he thinks is a terrible person. He took him to the nearby town for an estimated collection. He ended up losing the body and possible donations in a gambling match with the drunken Sheriff (Boguslal Linda) of the city, and some of his dailies turned against him in relation to his Barmaid (Katrina Figura). He guided the turn of death and leads a small fur on a dangerous 'wild goosechase'. In one scene, strangers hold the harmful wounds carefully by gun powder and a match. The corpse rots chained in a hitching post as the sheriff finds no donation for finding out. This film is also known as Samar Love, a hunting theme song composed by John Davidson. Yet this Western is like watching a train debris. There is something that does not show you ... but you do it.
