In all the truth, I have not seen this movie for many years, but in some cases I have kept parts of it in my memory, anyone who has seen it can understand. I saw it as a child in a YMCA Halloween party early in the first century, and it feared hell from our kids in a fun way. I feel the feeling of genuine concern about the unknown things I think. I can not take the risk to end up, saying that it is not saying, surprisingly. I think the whole audience of young boys is coming out of a big horror, after a scary secret manifestation smiles. Most of the viewers have finished the film as one of the biggest weird climbers in a film history and are still walking oddly. You will see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I do not know whether it is available on home video, but it still creates great Halloween features for kids and adults.
