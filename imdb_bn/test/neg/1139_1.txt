The worst experience I've ever been through. I started bleeding in my eyes. I got sick after actually watching this. I do not even consider this a movie. The movie is supposed to be suitable and entertaining. This terrible failure. I could not make it through the whole movie, because the last picture could be the greatest event in history, it gets 1 for a small chance. Otherwise it would be a plane. <br /> <br /> I can not see how National Lampun, or an organization alone, will sponsor this repression. This DVD rental is currently one of the worst mistakes in my life. If you sometimes want to make another movie only this view would seem great to you. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this image without question.
