Simply, I was surprisingly frustrated. I am a huge fan of Asian harbor, and I can see unoriginality (I enjoyed myself "red shoes" and "phone"), but this was just poorer. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of elements in this film too high: Photography is attractive, visual cool, inspiring instruction, acting is good, music is easy to ear, and CGI is incredible. But, since this is a horror film, so we are expected to fear, which will not happen with this movie. With most South Korean horror, it is non-linear from beginning to end: Long-haired retaliatory female ghosts, thick black hair and bad clutches of water clutches, and in the end, a bend that is almost * but not fully understood One of the qualities). And the irritation of the audience, when the movie is not reusable (sometimes, so easy that it can easily be stolen) Imagery of other movies, it lets you jump. Many And by jumping, I do not want to play anything or say anything, using soundtracks very loud and six feet in the windscreen of viewers (even some "create-jump-jump" moments are just suffocating). And when it does not phishing off other movies, it's annoying and difficult to sit. <br /> <br /> And it's embarrassing because "Ryong" was easily good, and its everything is good at it, but it's completely anticipated high sound and jerk scares that ruin the destruction of the movie rarely overuse. Its a perfect example of how good it can be: A letter in a moment is looking for a corpse, and without a word, the body looks back. This is entirely predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, it's terrible to get the movie for me. <br /> <br /> Confession, "Rayong" has some good features and even a couple blurred that is not predetermined and works. A very good and sad back-story has been used to explain the events, and the bend is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that distinguish the movie from any other Asian ghost / horror movie. But their problem, though they work, even though they have been used before (J -Har fans can easily understand that the bigger publication is inspired by "story of two sisters") and it will go well for fifty minutes in the background. <br /> <br /> So in the end, "RAUG" seems like a really damaged opportunity. That-Kyong Kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features would work as a division, so audiences would not notice huge flaws. But he fails, and good ... we've all seen. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
