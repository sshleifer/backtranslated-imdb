This movie is date in many ways, it's exciting. You can laugh at it or shake your fists in anger. <br /> <br /> This film discusses many problems in American history, but with the general white-men-Christian-American parents: the main character is one who can do it-it's all-and-you-get-together For-this-kind-of-person He does not have to blame so much and be serious at any time. What a horrible animal! In the first part of the film, his wife is a weak little woman and still very nasty, but ultimately the strong character. Very sorry for her cocky ways after she still leaves him for her second time. It's just sad that the letters did not really change at all. Although he had told a powerful and independent woman to be portrayed in the end, she still became worried about her adventure-finding husband. So among the feminists in our 10 points with 2 points (and those only for good intentions ...)! The issue of Indian repression has been tackled very well, but there is a need to repeat the story of that patronage. And the African-American characters that make common stereotypes make the movie even more hypocritical. I was lost so much time! So a point from the movement of civil rights (to try) <br /> <br /> I know that the movie was made at another time. I like old movies and have patience with some of my specific points. But it was just boring! <br /> <br /> This picture protects parts without the main character. The way of Mr. Dix's acting top and smug on Maybe his character is so disrespectful ... I like acting Mrs Dunne, although his character makes me mad sometimes. <br /> <br /> I must say that the famous land ray scene was incredibly completed. And the way the Oklahoma settlement portrays the movie is appropriate. It was just amazing how the civilization grew from the 19th century dirt and dust. And I do not understand that there is something with that church scene. I was quite funny and amusing it. Maybe it was not supposed to be, but I like it. So 9 points for those scenes and an impressive story about the development of the state of Oklahoma. That makes around 4 points together!
