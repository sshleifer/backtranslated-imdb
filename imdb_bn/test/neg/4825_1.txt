I think this program is a load of junk. Do they face face to face and face each other and they call this act? These people pay a lot for this, and most of them can not work to save their lives. Also, after storyline horror and watching it for a few minutes, I bored with it. Harry Hill liked Mickey's way through his TV show 'TV Burp'. The weak trick "Princess and Motor Shakespeare is not right?" That was Sonia and Naomi sewing. I do not see that that's fun. I think it's a waste of money for their TV license, so it can be shown 4/5 days a week. There is nothing better than that?
