This movie can be described as a very long episode of very bad sitakum. How strange funny misunderstanding can you just enter into a movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are switched, conversations are humiliated, people mix, situations misunderstood, and people may laugh at some point along the line. The writer is really struggling to continue everything, which makes the dialogue really forced to force. If someone plays a real person in this movie, it will be resolved in about two minutes and everyone can return to their life, but their misunderstanding will continue. Occasionally this movie tries to go for some teenage laughter, but those who remember you about the "American Pie" fun. Hooker (who thinks as a foreign exchange student) says, "To eat his sausage", he does not have a second one to play with. Although I want to give this film a little credit: it is not annoying because of a sub-plot of the stolen money, as it may be. It has a smile here and there, but then sadly another character goes back to misunderstandings. Overall this movie is very flimsy.
