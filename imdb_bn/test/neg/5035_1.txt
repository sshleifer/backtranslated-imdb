This outstanding part of the trip (conveniently) is based on a short story that was involved with two of my family members (played by Jack Thompson and Jacklin Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This movie is offensive; However, this is not a particularly good movie, but it can not be prevented in any way that it can defeat a close family member and those who are completely affected by the tragedy of real life are completely excluded. <br /> As a director; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
