I saw this movie with very low expectations. I did not know much about it, so I was not sure if it would have been valuable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > When the mayars see and destroy them, they compel them to stay in ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the movie becomes slightly suspicious to the point. The amount of cattle available in this film was actually not necessarily compatible with what was used more for shock quality. <br /> <br /> They did not try to fight the seeds from hell. . They had fire and they did not try to burn it and they tried to spend it with knives to see if they could rob it. They did not immediately assume the role of victim victims and their helpless attitude was real. This reminds me of the old horror movie where people just shouted and shouted and did not need half the brain to fight back.
