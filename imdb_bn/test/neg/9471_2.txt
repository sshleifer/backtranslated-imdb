This movie was certainly on the boring side. The acting was beautiful and the film looks pretty good, the soundtrack must be for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. While talking about the soundtrack, I said it was very ridiculous that a film about the truth and not stealing decided to use a song that was a lazy RIPOFF of Paul Simon's "You Can Call I Al" - without it they all admitted it Is there a little bit trickier there? The main kid was where he was imitating the host of a game show where my favorite was. 10 lines? Will I write ten lines about this movie? What a ripoff, I do not think it's too fair for the people to compose to write the man than just get it included!
