This documentary tries to try a comedy, but mostly does not get there for me. Camp? Here, maybe. The more appropriate word that everyone will agree with - and it will be difficult to spend any time in review - it's Kitts It dripped kitsch. It was that filmmakers were worried about taking their concerns seriously, and so they looked back in the back and said, "We're having fun here!" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt it was very difficult to try. For example, the shock dolls presented in each scene (to me) were annoying when I was sure that they had fun - or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey <br /> <br /> No, however, to avoid this movie based on my complaint. Just be ready to revel in kitsch than having you blurred at unprepared. If you are interested to rent lighthearted, you can make a lot worse, far enough. In less time, the incidents and events surrounding the rise and fall of Bakar made this interesting and valuable. Best of all, lovers of psychic lovers of mind will move and pick up the desired bits throughout their life.
