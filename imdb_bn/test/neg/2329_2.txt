A colleague from work told me to watch this movie, since he considered this movie as one of the best movies ever. So I saw it. First of all, I have to admit that I dislike mainstream movies and really like to watch movies. <br /> <br /> and why I dislike this movie. It does not have any meaning. It's just fun, stupid, annoying, entertaining, weird and adventurous pieces. At first I thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller (like reading German packaging), but the film was very mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to create a combination of mostly different pictures, but the mixture tastes as awful as a combination of beer milk. Both are pretty good for themselves, but together?
