Talk about good things about Mr. Like the screen and what I did in the past summer, I knew that this movie is aware of such horror film conventions and led to bringing some good lines and scenes of play in those conventions. Unfortunately, Mrs is just annoying. The plot screams with your genuine 10 Little Indians by a monster controlled by suspects / hunters. From the beginning you know that each letter will be closed to defeat evil only except the hero (in). And this is exactly what happened. Absolutely no surprise and no excitement The production price and performance were okay, but I did not have any motivation to look at the end (although I did) because I already knew how the last scene would end. The last one surprised me a bit, because instead of throwing buckets of special effects, it was literally directed towards the lungs. Perhaps the special effects budget has been spent in the end.
