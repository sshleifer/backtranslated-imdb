I'm not a big fan of tromba movies. Imagine, I only saw three of them (or four of these four), but two (blood shrimp frequencies and Mother's Day) are known to be the best, which is why I believe that others are not valuable to everyone. That would certainly be the case with Graduation Day, which is a popular trait to take the eight slashher. Although the film is not particularly bad (given the type of film), it is not particularly good at all. And finally, I could have wondered, 'Why am I annoyed by this?' However, some girl on the plot of a girl on the plot died, and soon after; More people started dying. Naturally, there are some potential suspects; But it's hard to really take care of what happens. Of course, in slasher terms; It's most important that Gore, and Red's staff are concerned about the track record of Trauma, where I was expecting it buckets. There are some decent killing scenes, and some of them are minor; But it is not very frustrating, which actually builds another drawer slash based on a celebratory event in American calendar. This movie has a small role for the style Queen Linna Quigley, but it is not worth mentioning that the rest of the cast is notable. The direction, the plot and its execution are all very dumb; And I would say that if you are not a big trompo fan or you want to create a slash that you never want to create; Do not bother with this film.
