This movie is awful. You are considering watching this movie ... not two words. It's stupid, the story is really lancet, and the joke is even worse. Acting is really unfortunate. I can not believe this movie is made. Rather go on American Pie, Greek or Road Trip, if you are in the mood of a joke. This is the girls who head for Malibu on their two spring breaks. Naturally, they do not make much plans and are told (I think his name is Michelle) to crush his uncle Maliba Highway. Uncle Beni strictly prohibits having a party of them, and as you guessed, they will go ahead and do it. Please, I request you, do not see this movie.
