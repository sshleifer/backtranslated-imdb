The straight-hearted thriller was treated with sticky treatment from civil director Mike Hodges for "direct action" (where I had previously heard that plot?) Of a fraudulent IRA bombing of Jack Higgens. Mickey Roch with scary red hair, admitted to the priest (Bob Hoskins, all the people) who accidentally saw shooting. The rules of the church prevent the father from talking to the Bob, but then goes to Rour and falls in love with the priest's blind nephew. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that plot. Allan Bates calls the top dog gangster and he is the only actor who looks at the jockey tone hajes. Bates is ready to do the same kind of work as the Honor of the UK, but with another supporting role, Liam Nissan plays an assistant role.
