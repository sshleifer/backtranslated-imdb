It is a comedy / romance movie starring Will Smith, Eve Mendes and Kevin James, directed by Andy Tenant. <br /> <br /> This is a professional dating doctor - Will Smith - known as 'Hit', which helps men to land their date with women of interest. Currently he is helping a strange, lazy albert who is obsessed with a powerful, famous and wealthy woman named Aligra. At the same time, Hit is a Gossip columnist, Sara, - Eva Mendes - who has been interested in Algarra writing about. When Sarah's best friend thinks of a man as a hit client, she is discouraged by love, she takes revenge against the hit and misunderstandings lead two couples to a conflicting situation. This image is not like that men will see it's male-bashing and both have fine and blatant male hate. Also there are double standards that will not be blind to you spot. Hit and Sear both look at the opposite sex, Hits love women despite their burning from the past and teach men to make them happy. But of course Sarah, a sexist who often "wants to have sex with the man who walks with her," often makes sexually explicit comments with her. Shes is confident and she looks like a goddess and knows that there is no 'real men' there. My most annoying 'bad' guy, who was the best friend of Sir, who quickly responded to the classic example of a defensive 'hunting' and hit the physically close of the hit, was hit by Sir's goat. After that, he said, "Now I am satisfied." Add that the "woman still suffocated" you are not allowed to spend your money after the permission from the algorithm is granted to the man's table. Despite all the rubbish rituals and generalizations - can women ever tell when they are not directly with them? - The film has the right point that love is not just available in America. The movie has some interesting parts, like Albert and his dance practices, but overall, this film only hit the smallest horror movie Honey.
