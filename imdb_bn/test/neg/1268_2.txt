There are many so-called anti-war / opposition governments. Now almost policy films that started as a Kappaar and our poor boys' going out of hell ', so let the world sympathize with them, it is not their fault' - kind things. I was half afraid that the other in this style behaves with the same subject / aspect. I do not go around and see it; In that case, I almost do not write this review. What did we get here? An Egyptian was taken to a secret off-Korea torture center by the order of the US, but it must be tortured by other Egyptians, not America: 'Look, we cleaned Americans' hands', and the Egyptians let them do so much to harm them. Oh, and happiness should be American with conscience: Actually many Americans have their own, but the idea here is wrong. Yes, we all know that this is called extraordinary radiance and it's time for Clinton's time and it is now used for reasons beyond control. Otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about condemning the torture of the United States; Just as the makers were afraid of horror or fear of fear of being horrified, or whatever (Watch the message board! Whoever faces oral verbal surgery for forgiveness). Torture is a terrific thing, whether a criminal or not; In the 18th century, Prussia King Friedrich, it was abolished for convicted murderers - although I want to say, a life sentence for a child mullah is much less than what I want to see. Okay, what is torture? This picture does not really bring enough of its horror and hopelessness. When you are being tortured (now come to the capital city for emphasis, I'm not screaming) If you say anything then it is not true, but if you are not sure that what you are supposed to do is pay you in the air where you are Say hello, it will stop. It's not you, but you never learn and you say that you said what you said, they said 'you'. Another thing was that the film did not bring enough out of the fact that Toronto is highly enhanced, sensibly frozen, and that your feelings feel that you are with your whole life. It somehow changes people inside. How do I know all that? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: Two things: Arabic used in the film was not Egyptian dialect. It's worse than setting a movie character with locals in New Zealand and everyone has American expressions. Also, the fearsome little preachers who were pushing their unconscious listeners to violence, were told something unknown to the religion that should have been found out. Or was it any kind of explanation that any nikampol could be a mullah / imam; He does not need any special qualifications, and it is a barrier that needs to be corrected: Their fundamentalist views and Saudi Arabia's extraordinary partner in the United States, many of them are acceptable. Thanks so much for this place.
