A star like Chuck Norris Danny, who killed a serial killer of a policeman, but when the killer escapes, Danny knows that he can stop terrorism. But Danny kept secret, he knows that it was very lucky that the terrorists were arrested and Danny got more luck to survive, now there is a final war, but Danny is ready? Well, in my story, what is the problem of this movie? Norris has played a scary hero who is still suffering from traumatic injuries. In the hands of a good actor, this idea would be interesting and could create for a great thriller. Norris thriller makes it just ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. There are also American Nizwa's Steve James on the board and Ron O'Neal of Superfluous, but any attempt to develop character is defeated by violent scripts. There is also very little work and I always love Norris Movie with more fighting and less talk. Ratings on this website, I do not have to be alone. <br /> <br /> * Out 4- (Bad)
