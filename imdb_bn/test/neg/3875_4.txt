"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes and Elmer Bernstein's score is as enthusiastic as before. Yet, it is a boring movie because it only fails to engage us in emotion. McCain's absence really makes a bad impression and here his character is played by a different (short-known) actor, which is odd - poorly. Characters do not develop, so we do not connect with them - and we rarely care if some of them die. The origin of this signal is a passable but poor imitation.
