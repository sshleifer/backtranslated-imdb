When I bought this picture, I hope to enjoy the 1970's exploitation film. Instead, I got this by boring festival amateur amateurs Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Millington. His tight editing, breakneck pacing, and surprisingly well-known actor, you almost think that you are watching ... his cinema is one! Actually, for the first time I could not even try to stay awake. The pictures of annoying people drag them into one and whenever someone dies, the film will be reduced. Sometimes it was very fast speed, making sound voice like character chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film. This script is actually better compared to the film, and compared to sleeping pill of 70s, soap operas seem more appropriate, where the actor is constantly on his line. The cover says "their main cut is weirdly loving ... but thoroughly cruel!" I believe, there is nothing "erotic" about this film. Oh, we get to see the letters made out of extra long cottage cheese, but that's about it. And as far as "cruel", well, visitors are most brutalized here with this film. And another thing ...
