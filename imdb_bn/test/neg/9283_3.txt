Anthony Wong is both this and real (much higher) steady story, but duplication stops there. Wong definitely does not reprise his role, and instead gets a suspicious police, who gets involved with a suspicious woman, Fung (1994's Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), who does not make a repressed brown job, not sure. But his own jealous "wants to stay with a girl in the girl" killer was not mandatory to play Wang first place. The movie itself feels tired and numbered by numbers. As the incredible girl of Facebook's love interest, the Ying Fan is possible whenever it is possible to keep one from being completely annoyed, and the sun has a nice ass, but can not even save the naughty. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah Ah DVD Extra: sub-titled interview with Chung Kam Ching and Pallin Sun; Anthony Wang Filmography; A very brief summary; Theater trailer for the film; Trailer for "Chinese Lover Ghost Story" and "Twenty Some"
