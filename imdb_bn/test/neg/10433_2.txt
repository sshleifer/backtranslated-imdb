When I think of the movies of the 1970s, I do not think so. I do not want a neutral, one song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want to end a soundtrack with the top 40 Babbalgam songs of the title day in the 70's. The common caro-style disco music was especially annoying during the prom scene. Activated (you can call it) was very wooden, and only felt reading from the script in monotone. Film quality and camera work was awesome; The dialog is vague, scripts are thrown together without much thought and strangers if the plot was not thin. I do not believe that people here have a high rating that I read. Basically a wonderful, poor effort to restore a beloved era of the past. The two stars I can come up with all Miserable friends
