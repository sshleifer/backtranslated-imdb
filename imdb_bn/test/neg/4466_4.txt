After watching the previews a while ago, I waited to see a comedy Steve Martin, which I think could be a keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was, the preview movie was the only fun part. The rest of the movie was mostly a bunch of junk, which we saw thousands of times with deaths and letters. <br /> <br /> This movie was a positive proof that if you paid enough money on the table, you could talk to some of them. Steve Martin was my favorite but this one was a big clunker. Eugene Levi was the only actor in the film. He was the best of a strong Lam group.
