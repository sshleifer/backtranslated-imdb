The sound of this photo is a nightmare. The best that I can say for this movie. Once these movies have started, a possibility of a good story is lost. The movie sounds good in premiere. A playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very dull. The wet T-shirt competition I've ever seen is the worst scenario, and it's a mystery about the science-type, almost precious. The sound is often difficult to hear and the main actor does not know to speak clearly. His pronunciation makes him very difficult to understand. The only bright game is Penelope Anne Miller. His role is unused but he plays well. In short, do not waste your time.
