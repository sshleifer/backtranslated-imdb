Nothing good about this movie. It is a formative predictive "romantic comedy" that forces women to focus on their important people. In other words, this is an expected chuck flick which is either ridiculous or romantic and unusually forgotten. If you want to see watching the same thing over over then this movie will fit perfect. I was forced to see it with my G / FA and it is no surprise that we are no longer together. I enjoy the great movies I see, when he just wants to see the same thing with different actors. There is nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (One B / C I could not give it a zero.
