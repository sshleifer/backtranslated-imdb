How could this get ratings 6.0? Have we been able to use these horror films so badly so badly that they have something when they come with him and I repeat 'some', we become very excited and can give a rating, your bit too much? The director has a certain visual flash. There is no doubt about this. But in some decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or scares. It was a very slow first thing, lazy killer scenes, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very incredible twist. And what is the screenplay of American teenagers in such films? They will always be stupid, annoying and so God #Mn be superficial. I do not remember being like this teenager when I grew up in Holland. Everything is considered, this film can not give anything, which is 4 ratings out of 10.
