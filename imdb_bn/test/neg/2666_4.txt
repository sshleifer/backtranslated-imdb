Michael Mayers, the scary, non-youth-young man-brain that seems to be desperate with every appearance, his drowned brothers are resuscitated to destroy more danger to his family members and to anyone else on the road. The reasoning feeling is ignored for the logical body count. Michael, who largely liked curiosity and kitchen knives, is learning to use the fog in any way necessary to swing and stop his victims, and as a result, a terrible, patchwork, dollar store film is actually unlocked by some truly unclear sequences. Donald Pleasance, seems to have died soon after production, this story has been injected so simply * anyone * can be billed as the star. You do not want to cover your eyes during this time, but you will be reducing your head of John Carpenter's classic creation slide down.
