Compared to other "sand and shoes" rentals, Egyptian leaves have much to be desired. The film is very happy based on Mika Waltree's well-researched novel, which is located in the center of the tour of Egypt, along with the courage of Egyptian physician Singh, as well as Sarah Canan, Minion Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, the story of Xinhu (which is related to romantic and sexual exploitation), due to the ethical hardness of the time, is mostly on the floor in the cutting room and in turn, visitors are treated with Victor Woody's wooden rails and railways. Even Gene Tierney ?? A major female "main" during the time ?? This flick can not see or manage its best appearance, and instead it offers somberblastic performance which has only some serious psychological problems in the actress. There is a great deal of chaos and religious sensibilities on the idea of ​​pluralism versus monotheism, but Michael Willing is so tiring as the Revolutionary Achanatan, who must somehow revive old religion to shut him down and restore old religion before the second chunk. My suggestion: Buy the book from e-bay, rent some entertainment entertainment like Solomon and Sheba and then call it one night!
