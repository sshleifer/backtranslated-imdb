First off, I read more comments from the director and I would like to thank him for his comments. I am always surprised that the makers of films spread over MSST 3 think that their work is scattered (not how best brain rights has been achieved). Rissi's comments made me curious, but the scientists thought it was different, how much the film was able to cut (now I wonder if I can rent it from Netflix). Of course, I have never seen this movie's ineffective, non-MSAT 3K version, even seen it on MST3, I never thought of it bad movie or unwanted thing. Although I think it was a beautiful brain MST3K episode); Of course, as Pearl does not describe, "leather-peeling is awful"; Do not look at the "future war" and "Hobgoblins" choice. <br /> <br /> Until the film is cut, it has been done at least once in MSST3K Case In Point: Joe Do Baker Fleck, Mitchell, where the subtitle involving the character of John Saxon is being edited in version MSST 3, Joel and Boats still comment on the absence of Saxon after his presence at the beginning of the film. If I can submit the criticism of MSST 3, if you want to spend the film for consideration during the film, then fine, but be fair to spend the film (even if it's a shy film like Mitchell). Of course, instead of such criticism the event has ended, but I think the view's view was inappropriate. But anyway, if it's the case with the Soultaker, it gets my sympathy. However, I think it's a enjoyable MST3 episode, even though the movie itself, even the "hacked" version in MSST 3K is awesome. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in the case of a strange phenomenon or possibly synchronism, I saw the Holocaar Proxy the day the Soltaker was promoted and you do not know, the person who played Vivian Shilling's father was a bit of a movie ; His three other credits role, in fact. I was that kind of weird.
