This film proves to me a theory for a while - in Australia, as long as a movie works on the right thing, it will be successful if it is so terrible. Australian Park Boyge may not be too bad - Actually bad, the plot mainly hits a poor warrior, and filmmakers do not have a clear idea about Australia's ethnic gangs (21st century Irish gang in Sydney!) An Irish gang of Australia is about a hundred years old Earlier there was jungle time!) But this is the race of racial competition O, four things guarantee success in the movie of Australia (with struggling family, minority groups), and a famous Australian biography) it won multiple academy awards. I have always doubted that Australian critics would tear any garbage related to these issues, but thought of my part, or at least hoped that they had limits. This film is otherwise proof. So do not be bothered about Australian filmmakers' thinking of your film or those who might actually work, or even choose your information properly - just write a script about trying to end some poor families, or foreign nations coming to Australia and racial ancestors And with stereotypes   াবিলা করতে পারে, অথবা যদি আপনি এই লোকেদের বই থেকে পাতা বের করতে চান তবে কিছু জাতিগত গ্যাং অন্য কোন জাতিগত গ্যাং-এর সাথে যুদ্ধ করে যা আসলে বাস্তব নয়। At the time of filming, and how painful it is to win five Academy Awards in your movie!
