The schools are a timeless exercise ... go to the Gold Coast, drink drunk and have sex. Suitable ambitions but not high intellectuals. The plot is simple for every character and it is not helpful to anyone here. <br /> <br /> Anything that helps is welding. Everyone looks too old. These characters are supposed to be that fools themselves themselves are coming out step by step in adolescence, but they look very old in the role of being credible in the role. <br /> <br />
