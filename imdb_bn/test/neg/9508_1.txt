<br /> <br /> This game is widely edited and sequences of scenes are completely mixed. The actress is frustrating (especially Helena Bonham Carter) and film painter poor. <br /> <br /> A slow, confused, annoying movie that will close Shakespeare with that new Shakespeare immediately! <br /> <br /> If you do not see any game play, at least look at the Olivier version (1 9 48) instead of this drill!
