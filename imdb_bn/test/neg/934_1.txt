I do not know that some of these filmmakers make some kind of clean film, where bad guys (bad girls in this case) will win. Weaker acting and very expected. Nothing original about it. The same movie was made over again - Goodbye Louvre (1989), Slow Bar (2005), or the same story and at the end with at least ten films. The movies have a lot of holes. They ran out of money and stopped filming. Or perhaps they run away from the idea. But do not waste your time with this one. It will only make you sad by wasteting watching your time.
