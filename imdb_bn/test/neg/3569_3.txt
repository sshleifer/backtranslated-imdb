Why spend a moment slogging through this weird and self-conscious movie? Every moment and then, after an hour of intense plot and amateur acting, we started the bits and pieces of big band swing which made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsi separately and together, they were great musicians. Occasionally - in the Jam Session, Tommy Drese and his orchestra "Mary" with Art Tutamus and a standout, Jimmy Dorses and his Orchestra face Bob Abarl and Helen O'Connell's song "Green Eyes" - we got a complete song <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is bad as acting in the public domain and on DVD transfer. My copy has just four chapter stops. This means that your fastest finger is in bold stuff where you are trying to speed up. The swim that you are swimming is the life and war version of the two darlings of Hollywood. Tommy, superb on gorgeous, and Jimmy, pretty on the saxophone, can not usually stand each other. In 1935, Tommy started his own orchestra and finally got divided. Everyone achieved success alone than achieving them together. They got together when their father died in fifty years, where the movie ends. Later, they were able to tolerate each other under the leadership of Tommy, because the big band in the bank became pale in the fifties. In 1956, Tommy died at the age of 51, opposite his sleep after warmth, rose and a big meal. Jimmy died of cancer in 1957. Jimmy was very talented and, from all accounts, a reasonable easy guy. Tommy was very gifted and, from all accounts, often an overbearing flick. But good music creates many errors and makes the Big Band two, which defines the Swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in movies, and we saw them as they are growing up with tesling tyes (with child actors) and fighting each other. This film is not only their two parents, who have played Hollywood's Irish Clive, Sarah Allgood and Arthur Shields, who want to get together with their boys, but with a major sub-story involving a romance between Genet Blair Number less. , As a childhood friend of Dorsiis who became a voice artist with him and worked as a full time mediator and an angla and worked as William Lundigigan as a piano player. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why he does not become a star, he probably could have become, just look at his pictures in a studio like him, put a studio inside him. Lundigan simply takes place. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, when we actually hear playing dorsis? Well, here's a song written specifically for the movie and blair for the war. It is called "me". <br /> <br /> To me ... you are a pink rose ... rising ocean rising ... a star's dirt ... <br /> <br /> A pink rose? The film does not get any better than it and it can not be worse. However, if you prefer Dorasidge and the price is correct ... well, I still do not want to buy it on the hedgeet. Highlights for me, singing Aezel and O'Connell "green eyes." You can watch them on YouTube Tube Free. You will find there a bit of Dorseys each. I want to know.
