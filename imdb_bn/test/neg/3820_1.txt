This is one of the worst movies of the year. The storyline did not realize that potential. Actors are a poor choice, but considering screen writing, their talents are not wasted. I really wanted everyone dead as soon as possible so I could find out and see something else. Unfortunately, I'm late and laughing at the people crying about this miserliness. Bouting was not, after all, this was England, how shit that just moans gentlely. Then, I looked at IMDB and saw that 288 people gave it to 10 out of 10 people. I can not really see how those people can score that score. They work with distributors to be a PR company. There is a sunny set problem at the end of the movie, when the graveyard and the hike attack, when the roofs are touched (it is considered a brick wall) - then the effects of blood are OTT - Is being made.
