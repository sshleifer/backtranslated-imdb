We do not pay money to rent or actually go to the movie. I'm talking about how big the producer companies are actually boring and do not talk so ridiculous that things are so much waste money. They used to make a movie like this with billions of people, because I do not think the actors here will actually work for free or an invaluable sum. With that money you can make a good independent movie, or perhaps a good Hollywood movie. It can only tear you, but no one, only teens who are eager to see and watch Ashton Kutcher movies are the only reason they are their fans. I really do not know how someone can actually work in such a movie with a common sense. If you actually look at it possible the actor is of the same quality of this movie. So I do not have to be surprised, I actually can not be more expected.
