I suspected that I hated it, I did. Everything was wrong about it; They were like filming a different book. The location and the rooms are very nice (if they are not harmful - yes even the room was wrong for their part). They were very modern, neutral and obviously I was unhappy to see him. Everyone else saw Darcy as a god of sex, the author felt her sex was disappointing and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (she is not meant to be) and Bennett has been shown to be turbulent and some unknown reasons for peasants, it's wrong and ridiculous. Mr. Bennett's answer to the door of his night's gear, with the rest of his underwear family, was stupid in the middle of the night. They were the servants. Mr. Collins was not only boring and offensive, just stupid and obnoxious, Georgia Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress! So It is historically wrong and even last dissatisfied. I could go for the day. I hate it so much that the book was not just like this, but I am afraid that for many people it will experience their fist in this great novel and it will give them the worst impression. The BBC version is so good that it's not funny and everything about this version is humiliating to its memory. In short, if you see it, then you have definitely read the book or seen the BBC version otherwise you will manage a misguided road which is not what it is!
