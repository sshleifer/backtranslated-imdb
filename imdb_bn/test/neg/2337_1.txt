Some directors take one and a half hours to tell a story, but David Lynch's "source" and his trademark curiosity spend a half-and-a-half-piece piece together, but the story is never there. No plot Any progress in the character (if you do not find a "progress" in revealing illusions). It makes me wonder how anyone can say "litter" garbage "art", but if the beauty is in the eyes of the observer, then it may be. In the 1980s, the film and TV work of Lynch started as an "avant garde" and "alternative", fine. After 20 years, the "Mulholland Drive" work closed for 2.5 hours as David Leich's mesmerizing piece. It's embarrassing. Finally I saw a movie that is considered to be the worst spot on my best spot. Throwing "Godzilla" and "Rodan" to at least people is not being blocked as "art".
