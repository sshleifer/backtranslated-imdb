I really enjoyed Tycus, not much more than mocking production value. Dennis Hooper was right, although he was surprised by whether he signed the project, but he saw the special effects he used. And even more, what was the ninja scene? That was just totally out of motion. Probably someone came up with mid-shooting bright ideas. Oh well, this movie is great if you're drunk and need a good smile. Cheers
