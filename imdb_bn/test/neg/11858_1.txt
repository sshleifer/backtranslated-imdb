My brother and his wife came with a movie to watch the video one night. This should give me the first formula that it will be awesome. It was there. This film is terrible from first frame to end. It does not even register as much as a "B" movie. Perhaps an N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Rubber-over-the-stick car still touches the horrible closing lines from the breath-taking body, if you find it free, this movie is not valuable. Avoid it together - unless you want to play mystery science theater with your friends but it will provide good ammunition.
