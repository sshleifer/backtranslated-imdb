No one could tell me that I did not take caution to read reviews (both users and exotic), but many of us were attracted to horror movies ... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we will not go to the dark room, we scream people in the movie, but you know what horrible aficionados are always there to tell us we're going to die though we know it will be bad). <br /> <br /> The following line of this movie has made me angry. Because it does not appear to be true (who carries ... jimmicks are allowed), or actors and dialogues are so lengthy (is it an unusual phenomenon in horror movies?) Or even the movie is so bad (and I'm also humble here). Actually I was crazy that this movie is not just like a friend of BWP, but half-happy lazy rip off <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could take BWP to them, but they did not even try it. The movie was created with little effort and care, and it is the most ineffable sin in the horror (or any) movie!
