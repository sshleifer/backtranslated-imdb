As in the other Seagal movie world needs. Add a bunch of actors, well ... really the rapper, heavy metal music wrap and certainly, no hips, a bright crazy chick in leather skin, and we prevent ourselves from being half budget. Why, why people participate in such films, why do people scatter themselves? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> FBI Captures a friend and sends it to "New Altraz", where the first prisoner of the prison was sentenced to death by unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> The first rate is played around, especially any scenes involved in tragedy for good people. Although serious, the director tried, and dragged a modern, tough end to the movie. She went very well often and the dead last dead got very annoying soon. When the prisoners consciously inspire the worst person, how do they ask when they are in prison, and what can they do? A stupid action that flicks slightly, if not "a- ight."
