If you look for a movie that keeps you asleep, but the Heart of the Darkness is the movie for you. It was not what I told the book, and the movie made me even more disappointed. The cast list was unfortunate, and around were pained around and without a few views, the book was not like that. I understand that everyone has their own opinions, they read Heart of Darkness and they made their own film on their heads, but the directors spent important scenes and added to the pointless. If someone speaks of a particular culture in the movie, then he must use an actor in that culture. There are actors everywhere, and I'm sure they've found better ones to fit the role. Joseph Conrad was a respected person and created a book that you would enjoy if you were looking for it, but the film was cheap and vain, and anyone should honor the film as a book. If you want a movie that puts you in the dark, but the heart of the darkness is the movie for you.
