I've just finished watching this movie, and for me .... it's totally annoying because it's very annoying ... and the story is very bad. <br /> <br /> Now ... where I will start .... O. This movie is called "Sinking of Japan" ... Yes yes ... it shows that Japan is actually going to sink The action part is very bad. Compare to the movie "Tomorrow's Day", I would have at least 8/10 rate. <br /> <br /> "Japan's sinking" does not show much to the disaster that is actually happening against us. There is a lot of tension ... annoying ... what I can say ... <br /> <br /> Another point ... I would recommend getting this movie a good title ... maybe "Japan sinking romance" Something like this, because there are so many conversations in this movie (time is wasting ... do not talk ...) and the story of love is very annoying and for a long time ... Genuine ... I almost got frustrated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... This movie does not show enough details of disasters. Many people are running like hell to live from death. The story part does not touch enough for me. <br /> <br /> But hey ... we should definitely appreciate this movie ... and have his good songs!
