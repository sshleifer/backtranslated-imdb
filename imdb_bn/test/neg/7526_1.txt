H.G. Wells are cut. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> If it is not based on a classic novel and is directed by the grandson of the author, it was a decent science-adventure / adventure movie. I'm hearing about how this particular version of the novel will be. This novel is a great fantasy story, but after reading it many people miss what (probably because they can read it at a very young age) it is overflowing with social commentary. Eloie and Morlocks ridicule the differences in class of Victorian England and the overall message of this movie is a satirical jab of Victorian satisfaction and their civilization will last forever. There is no love story in the novel, there is no romance with a beautiful Elo woman .... In the novel, Eloie is 3 feet feet high, the mental capacity that is not much more than the animal. Time traveler makes an Elie woman friendly, but it is clear that she feels more like her pet, and she dies before the novel ends. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to give us a completely stupid person. "Why does he want to travel through time." A lot of romance and the lessons he has to learn are enough to vomit film fans. <br /> <br /> The future journey is cut off by future disasters. All right, not bad, but like books, it is usually allowed to see if mankind is generally degraded, but it would have been more. Another reflection of time, I think, was that the George Pala Edition took place in a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> General story? Disgust Total false representation of the novel. Eloi is very capable and warlike. Morlocks are very cute. UberMorlock is an embarrassing, and there is no setup. She just shows time to be killed. Yawn <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumbai is okay. Guy Pierce is one of my darling but he is often confused and thinks of pain. (He broke a rib while reporting.) He looked unhealthy and very thin, as if he was sick for a long time before making it. <br /> <br /> A sad, sorry movie version of the world's classic. H. Yes. Wells deserve good .... a lot better. <br /> <br />
