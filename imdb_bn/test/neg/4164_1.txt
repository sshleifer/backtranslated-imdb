The film disappointed me for a lot of reasons: First of all, all the paintings in the future that seemed realistic to me were well-formed but it was only a limited role. Then, the story was a weaker copy of the lost translation. In the Middle Eastern setting, people with family fulfill foreign girls, caro bars, camera movements and imagery - which were a very bad imitation of the best Lost In Translation. This film tries to do something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Team Robins even think of doing this picture! Female actress Awful - Did she play Prokog in a minority report? And why do you have to show vagina in a movie like this? There was not too much love to lose in the translation scene. Just rated R for this? This movie is not worth watching from Vodiosaster!
