How can anyone start to like this image is really out of me <br /> <br /> the idea? It's someone to have it. "A guy falling apart". That idea. How nice. An environment gradually killed him ... now seeing the real and valuable. <br /> <br /> I saw the picture of this first phasimbindar ... I have heard that he is a Mais-n-scene, but I have seen this movie with more attention, inspiration, ideas, and anyone else ... this ... . nothing. It's nothing! <br /> <br /> Each shot is too long. They have so much void ... acting is awesome. You can see the actors have no preparation, there was no burden on their role, even the emotions were not tried ... it's so simple ... the lines are so elusive that you can remove 90% of them and still have the same crappy There are films. Fusion? Who cares about it Atmosphere, dynamics, for that pussies! One shot per scene, 80% people roam unrealistic, at this moment no matter how passion and importance are represented by the camera or looking at each other, it can not be expressed ... edit? All rules of editing have been neglected by any pay-pay-off ... Photography? Half of the shots have their reflection, and crappy light with no style of any kind. Shadow, shadow game ... who needs it? We need to hurt a person, pissing, drinking his wife ... she is acting. Our beautiful beautiful woman needs close conflicts ... we need an amateur measure of her captivity from a helpless aggressor persecutor ... This movie is so wrong that it was not worth a budget. It was <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually, I did not see this image from American Pie 5. That bad <br /> <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie "Veronica Foss", which seems to be very good based on the first 15 minutes (since its guidance and artistic connotation indicate, in contrast to shit ), So I will not argue that the oddity of phasimbindar .... but this .... in this movie!
