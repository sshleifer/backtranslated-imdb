This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style but marketing strategy. Part 2, part three can be ... one day until the end of the product life cycle, the condition on the condition of being commercially successful. So many things seem hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete. Action design is annoying. The design set is OK but not fine. Perhaps Edison Chen would be a big star one day. She looks really charming even on the big screen. The most impressive yet Anthony Wong 4/10 <br /> <br />
