I just saw this movie. I like the soundtrack. I saw the first trailer and were fantastic like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the movie is almost horror, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then .... they blow almost like all the new movies. I did not get the idea, why did that baby die ?? A cliche, every nigga film must kill a child, and after his death everyone will be well. Lol I do not understand what connection with the movie ... and so can be predicted, you know the very first minute. There is nothing new in this movie. I found 'you got the service' the same idea but ... something new ... it's something like 'honey', but there is little difference between them. If you have no other option then check this movie but make sure you accept the last option. And before the choreography everything is worse than everything. This must definitely not be seen ...
