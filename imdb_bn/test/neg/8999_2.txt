What a waste of time. I got it in about five minutes and * became very * antsy, and soon a little faster and soon the desire to thump me from the fast-forward button was incomplete. Actor Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did a very good job, I thought, but no one else saw me like a good performance. Again, take this review with a large grain of salt because the film was so intolerable that I could not make it to the end. Hack, I could not make it in the middle !! <br /> <br /> I could not submit myself to this review because it is not long enough. Maybe this last sentence will be the top.
