"Duke" is a film based on the heart of a British nobleman, where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and is saved from his great property and man of great rogue noblemen (Oliver Murrhead and Sophie); She passed her dog down her dog. The dog's "best friend", Charlotte, an American girl (played by Courtney Droper) whose father died, due to his former call, the former Duke becomes orphan. Florian, a young chef, with him and Charlotte immediately created a romantic sub-plot with him, which acts as the underlying voice of the main plot line as Hughert, Duque, and many other activities. Interest of love with other dogs. James Doan has seen all those who played Butler who is determined to try and serve his old dude, trying his best to serve his new master, Huber. Doohan acts as his old character, where he gives comfort and advice to a young person, when he sees and performs various ridiculous acts under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama for finishing fine and influential actor careers <br /> <br /> From a technical perspective, I dislike this picture because I only saw the discovery of the role of James Dohon. Although the plot is good, the writing material and the guidelines need to be obscure. By ignoring the absurdity of a "cookie duke", I dislike the excessive use of curious and disrespectful jokers in 'bad' letters because of their ridiculousness. Dependence on hygiene laughter as you want is very clear and many letters do not appeal to me in general silliness. The director, Philippe Spank, sometimes uses shots in the middle of the word to affect very bad sound or overall sound quality. Also, Moorhade and Heiman's performance, dramatic and romantic performances are good when the role-related requirements for the role are rarely dropped. However, as a mature film fan, I made it easy to be a simple family film designed to make you smile. I can admit that I can touch some bit fun and other bits with a plot that can be remote, but there is a certain connection. I do not recommend this movie to mature movie fans, but I highly recommend to dog lovers, who want to enjoy a fun movie for their child and families who want to see 'Ski' in the final role of James Doohan fans.
