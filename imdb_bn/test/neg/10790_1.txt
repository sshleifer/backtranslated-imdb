Although this movie was a good shot and acted nicely, it was awful. I felt that I saw a car accident - I'm sure I saw but I really wanted to turn my head around. The plot was very favorable, very troubled, and the end was frustrating. Although, it was fit to fit the voice of the movie, I expect something to improve the film. I still can not understand how pale kids get angry at the beginning of the film and how the baby gets a bit. Plenty of fifteen minutes that really do not really do much. Showing a movie with fine actors is really tragic and such a horror, awful, a beautiful set on the story. There is nothing more to say about this movie. Save yourself time and see C-Span. It will lift more.
