Terrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I like the original image. It was fun, charming, and heart ... There is no thing in this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> The original movie, stupid plots, bad animations, re-jokes from different voices (crank and ibas without exception) which are not something like the core (especially the buttocks ... * Chaddar *). <br /> <br /> The characters are off the model, the animation is flat and annoying, it's just a bad job. Around <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is the quarreling again? I think he has reformed ... but when this TV spin real * rolls eyes *. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
