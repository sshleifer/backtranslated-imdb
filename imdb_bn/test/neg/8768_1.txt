Another critic was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors saw that they were not really in the movie, as there was almost * there There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really German in the story (or what was a story), and they were not well produced well. <br /> <br /> I think they are trying to pigbyback on the success of another eschatologically affected movie (Omega Code, Leftless) (What can I say?). And yes, when these films were produced, it made embarrassment to Christians. I will not specifically recommend this movie to a non-Christian.
