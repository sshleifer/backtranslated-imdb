I am not usually a fan of high school commodity, they rely on humor in bad taste and rarely move away from the closed story lines and characters and uninterrupted dialogue dialogues. However, I have enjoyed my guilty pleasure, especially when I was still in high school. Seeing the unrecognized teacher statistics, kicking their buttons kicks me always and sometimes laughs. These movies work only if the characters are at least one of the immediate choices, not the 'Cheats' case, not particularly dramatic. Of course, the actor did not help to play that I saw a comedy of some ridiculous, nightmare, arrogant kids. <br /> <br /> Not a joke to work in a comedy, it's hard to be funny: Delivery is okay or the material is wasted waste. In this case there was not much good at the beginning and semi-funny jokes were lost professionally by Cast. <br /> <br /> This movie was felt 3 hours long, the director never heard of pensing clearly. Stay away from it, there are many more enjoyable teen comedy such as 10 things I hate for you, your father and Superbod K
