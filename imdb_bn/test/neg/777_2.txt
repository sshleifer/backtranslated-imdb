I was extremely disappointed by the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, very poor quality video and especially the awful audio. How does Bruce Hack produce its music and has very little about any examples of connecting directly to next and contemporary electronic music. Those who knew Bruce Hacks, their interviews are mostly on the vertex mumbo-jumbo. Not too much yak and enough hack. Although there is serious personal interest in my electronic music and even more than the average distance of attention for even slow and / or difficult content, even though I was asleep while watching this document and reviewing the parts I was sleeping on to review it. If you see it, then make sure that you have set up, before viewing it, like Alex in Clockwork Orange. Bruce Hack deserves much better than this. Producer and director Shame.
