Kevin Speacy is the best actor of the 90s without any doubt. After her performance in the ASEAN Suspension, she expects more and more of her American Beauty. That is why a common disappointed criminal is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Linck is the most merciful criminal in Dublin who was never in a bad mood. When his next colleague began to question Michael's ability to fully plan his partner, his next partner became an emotional, even though he did this only if he did not play good parents at home. <br /> <br /> I guess, this is partly due to my fault for not paying enough attention to thousands of plot details, which sadly becomes the "essence" of the film. I gave the movie a chance to say parody and .... well, parodies are always fun, no matter how foolish they do or how they do it. So, it was not on purpose after a complete parody. It's just a different movie movie that tries to be fun and fails. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some of his "colleagues", the general delinquent crime relies heavily on the story development and logical continuity, which forgets the main reason, the audience has chosen such a movie - for entertainment. This is definitely not entertainment. This includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the role of Michael TWO Wives. I do not know whether it is any kind of stupid figurative or strange, dark humorous, but girl sister. Remember, the character of Spesy has children. <br /> <br /> The general delinquent criminal is complex and confusing. You are not waiting for a fun scene. Instead, you follow the dialog carefully, because there is a big chance of losing yourself in the annoying, pale universe, the movie lives. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the spaces. I have been in the situation that he has been surprised, that signature for the movie. It's not miscasting, but something bad. His work in American Beauty is an insult, a Decent criminal released a year ago. Character Michael is amazing and conversations. Spasie is almost unfortunate at times. The only remedy for this, Lester Barnham and Roger Kinnt are thinking about. <br /> <br /> Writer, Gerard Stambridge must re-consider his screen writing skills and look more at that time. Because, the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often screwed. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> A common criminal criminal is a bad criminal comedy that is not worthy of your attention.
