I have seen many movies. Actually I love B-movie, they're one of my favorite styles. However, this "garbage" (I acknowledge that the film's consent) was the worst part of the painful, which I sometimes suffered from torture. I actually signed up at IMDB that I needed some way to make the voice at least how bad this garbage was. I have seen "Films" (they deserve atleast respect) on the basis of what was written and directed at high school students. I do not have any regrets for the poor actors of this "garbage" because they are trying to earn only a pay check. They now and forever will have this stain as their virginity, which was raped and given to Herpes! If writer / director John Shiban is entitled to any dignity, then it is more appropriate for him to make this extraordinary person should never allow him once again to face his camera and try to apply his so-called "gift". Like a mopping mop on a pip show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
