If you've seen the POP fiction then you will not see this movie. This movie is not funny. This is the worst ever parody movie. This is a poor effort of parody movies. <br /> <br /> Cast bad. The film is bad. It's one of the worst pictures ever made <br /> <br /> I do not recommend plump fiction. I liked the original Phantom fiction by great quintin tarantino. This is one of the worst parody movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Pump Fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny. It's so stupid and indecent.
