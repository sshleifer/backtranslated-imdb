I've read other hacks' reviews of this movie, and this is not necessarily a science / horror film, but it's not bad if it's not bad - low-budget, b-movie rental (we say) "Allian" (awful) ) "Species" (excellent and confused "place girl") and 'incubus' animal-reproduction-with-prisoners-girls angle). This is a serious Chess film, and overall it was done in an overall budget, even though the alien is not very bad (I have seen fewer believing man-in-rubber cases at any rate). None of the Oscar ingredients and Isle of Man actually played really double for Boston Massachusetts. Plot is fairly predictable and an Alien Craft will travel through a milestone mile and crash land college campus crash land smackbang - thus providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - it is completely ridiculous. However, this movie has suspicious moments, some help with nudity and semi-nudity, and this movie is one of the few movie exhibitions of the beautiful and sad model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as "Space Girl"). Just after 24 years of age, the film was shot in London by her jealous boyfriend.
