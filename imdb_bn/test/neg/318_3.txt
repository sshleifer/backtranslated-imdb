A few years ago my mother and I rented this jewel during Thanksgiving viewing. I've seldom laugh very hard. This is a common low-budget horror film which plays stupid special effects, a bad plot and more bad. But when Linina Quigley gets top billing, are you really looking forward to the classic? I did not think <br /> <br /> This movie has some entertainment standards, so I gave 3 out of 10.
