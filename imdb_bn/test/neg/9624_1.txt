This picture is really really bad, it does not work very well and lacks a lack of effort but I'm not sure what. I saw it and was very frustrated. It is a lot committed, but everything is distributed. Characters shallow and wood, and music, if you can call it, awesome. Of course there are all creatures and animated people, but they have done so much worse that it does not come as anything other than the third-rated movie. It is a real shame that special attention was not given for much attention, not all and until the end of the films I agree with, but it is a very important issue in a movie around them. For me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
