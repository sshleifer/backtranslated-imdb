I do not see what the whole deal about this movie is. Patricia Cass is singing, yes, and makes this film charming, but singing is not enough. That means, if you want to get all these benefits, then buy Patricia CD and enjoy! The plot is easy (to skip "dream"); The main characters seem to love each other instantly, as well as forget their other contacts immediately. Relationships appear almost "mandatory", and a little "detective story" just makes things worse. What appeared first appeared in the end of a perfect movie, first screwed up and then came just as a dream. I would like to measure how well I measure movies, and for this I have already begun to forget the details.
