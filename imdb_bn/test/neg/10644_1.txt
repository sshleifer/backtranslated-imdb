Heyler: Bloody is just a film. I believe this is the fourth custom of the series of hackers. <br /> <br /> I missed the start, and it seemed to me that there were some helpless women and box shapes on the computer screen. But, using my intelligence and intelligence (and info buttons), I soon learned that Villain (Pinehad) was released from the Box of Pandoras, which I believe is a gateway directly to hell. So, however, Pinhead somehow came out of the box and "Toymaker's family" terrorism. And, that's about it. Oh, and not mention the random torture of different people who exceed his way. Yawn <br /> <br /> What has mainly happened in this movie is that Pihan caught the child and thrown a dog to his wife and then killed a rowdy man. Then the husband comes along, Blah, Blah, Blah. Who care? Why it fails Heliester: Bloody is scary to be very scary. Look at the small part of the Pinyhide animals: a chassi dog that has turned inside, two men whose head and body are connected together (attach to a horror film in Siamese?) And some people who are considered to be some princess. (I did not see the previous pictures.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Are they stupid when you call someone? He has pins on his head and comes out of his fingers and has blue skin. I think that if he does not have such a true name and there is no intelligent speech he will make a decent villain. In the film some two policemen look at him and say, "Take some pain on us!" Pinehad answers "pain, how dare you have that word, I hurt?" Smoke, smoke, blurry, smoking <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Ping-Hade attacked some future shelter Letters (and listeners) get more torture experience. Some people we can not recognize (probably in the previous movie, I do not remember him at the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing that has played over again: <br /> <br /> A guard goes to visit a mysterious word . <br /> <br /> Some other guards: "Oh no, he's down, I'll check him? <br /> <br /> <br /> He'll be the same again. <br /> <br /> (Spinners) There is nothing that I did not get here: The movie's pinhead is probably sent to the end, so how does he come back to the other four films? They are prequels? Why did he die in the past? Need to come up with an idea for the series (The end of the spinners) Heelers: full of bloody sticky and torture scenes, but it has very little thrill or horrible value. Just forget it, bad bad effects, everything else makes snooze-feasts more than goodness. <br /> < Well: Some people might enjoy helpless women in the beginning Plus, Pinhead's voice is quite calm. I think if you want too much violence, then you too <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Feel free to send a private message about.
