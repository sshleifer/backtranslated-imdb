I know if I'm a low-budget filmmaker, it will probably check this page to know what people are saying about it. So I really hope the filmmaker will actually read it! I think you can find a way to get me back for half of my life, I can not see this trash. Perhaps you stop making movies about something I fantasize about. Just stop closing movies together ... you are one of the reasons for indie filmmakers to make it big. Benefit the world and get a McDonalds or job so you can do something useful with your life! I feel like calling Blockbuster that they actually took the shop to their shop.
