Unfortunate Jane Austen should be glad that he is not nearly as close to seeing this terrible ruin of an adaptation. A lot of Jane Austen films have recently come out that I claim to be permanently wiped with these two films - The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and David Copperfield's 1969 edition. My main beef with the film missed it completely. Jane Austen was having fun at Gothic Mania in his society, and most of the novels have cheeks in the cheek Although the film comes across severe and horribly melodramatic. Austin's writing is lighter-weight, fun-poking smell completely and definitely missing out on this ponderous fay iinto horror drama. Catherine's fantasy scenes are both void and selfish. Also, Henry Tilly is horrible unappealing. I said, will anyone fall for him? If you are looking for a fun Jane Austen evening, instead watch Emma!
