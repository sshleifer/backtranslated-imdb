I can see what this picture was intended to do. Unfortunately it's not just quite complete contract. The "crime of reality" works fine in sight and shot is the first rate of all. In fact, several ways to visualize a moody are incredibly evocative. Especially the detective silhouette, detective detectives coming out of the garbage, and the father is flying ticks. On the occasion, some scenes push the dialogue very much. Instead of seeing the audience, the authors use it much like a book. But the real problem is false editing. The story does not flow. It fails to complete the sum total of the part. In fact you are actually confused as to what is happening. Those who like to follow such a detective film, they like to follow, at the same time, the main characters together make a difference. If this kind of unnecessary editing is not impossible then it is difficult.
