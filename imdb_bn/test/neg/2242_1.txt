This movie is not worth the review below, it decided that I'm not going to see the next Tarantino film. And I used to love Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> Not a dancer, not entertainment, not funny, not funny, nothing, just lazy and stupid If this movie is the first tarantinus, it will be its end. <br /> <br /> Tantenio will have to keep an eye on himself, otherwise his next film will be 3 hours meaningless, annoying and unknowable. Looks like she's in love with her conversation - and her love is blind. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no reason to sit in the theater after finishing your popcorn.
