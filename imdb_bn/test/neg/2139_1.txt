Directors and editors think that they are thinking about editing this poor excuse for a film, but what they think does not help the film, it only hits it and it hits the film badly. Acting, once for a while, is not a problem, it's awesome editing, the scenes will not end for any reason, when a verb sequence will be cut in the middle or in the middle sentence. I was not sure what the story was, but it was not really important, because what I saw was fairly unintentional. Just bad around, a huge "jaw" rip off and not good at. The MST version was funny though. 7 for that, someone for the film itself.
