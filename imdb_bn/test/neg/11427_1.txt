This is actually a slightly bad movie that I saw. It's not funny at all. It only illustrates a lower class north British setting. I find it a very sad film in part, where others are cut where they will not be. One thing that really bothered me was that the closest up to the futile objects that made the film go slow. I just made it through movies because I quickly forwarded some specific sequences. <br /> <br /> This movie completely defeats the audience's attention. The main problem is that it creates multiple reasons for an action, which in turn makes it weak. But if there is a reason for one action it makes it more sensual. All these movies are all in all places. With the help of transfer plot lines and stories, I could not learn enough about the characters to care for them, where I could find a character's life. <br /> <br /> For example, people meet God in times, God seems like a quiet guy. The movie can be described in detail at the moment and I think it was a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> However, if it is enough. Check it out if you want, but I warn you this crap. I respect manufacturers to try to stop it with such low budget but they can do better. I was acting at all the false speculation in the movement and editing of the camera. But then again, that's just my opinion.
