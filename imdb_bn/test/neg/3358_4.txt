Under the average Blax Action Action / Meldrum, the lovely Miss Gear threatens his personal father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Ascien St Oker for help with "Prentice 13") whose debt business is threatened. <br /> <br /> I'll be Frank - I agree with some user comments for this movie. Martin, a known blaxpoitation, is less familiar with the "Sue, Baby" less than the satisfying slip, which is not particularly prominent, the performance scenes which are moderately entertaining and one of the more nondescript crypt supporting Miss Gear (though there is an important supporting role for D'Orville). Name). I think this routine movie seems to be fast cash with cash for its very popularity. It was sure that it was cool to see again in the stocker, although the role of Miss Gear is not good - or the conversation - as he did in other films, though he is doing what he is doing, and he is in the revenge campaign for Sassi, Playing sexy sister <br /> <br /> Non-stop / fan soundtrack is very enjoyable, in very short time. <br /> <br /> Most of those who want to see everything in Palm Greyer's Film Reporter. <br /> <br /> 4/10
