There was nothing remote about this movie. It makes fun of various sports cinemas and clich√©s, but nothing about it is a little distant. Most of the films do not fit into films with parodies and they can really be the same. Not the main actor was acting well but this is really the only good thing about this film. Also it was nice to see different kaymoos but I have no idea why they will waste their time in the garbage this time. Thanks, I've only spent $ 4 because it's not worth spending. Just keep an eye out if you can not do absolutely nothing or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.
