I understand that Roger Chronons loves to do cheap things, but it's just tragic. I bought this flicker from Dollar Bin in my local video store for more than a month after watching the original Karnosaur. I was flying away; It was the same hard movie, just some of the carbine is divided into Barnesen! It reminds me of 80 ninja films, which takes the old Kung Fu films and are divided into a white cage and the title "Nijja" is written on their titles (see "Ninja" if you have not seen them.) Terminator "," Thunderring Ninja "," Black Dragon "and" Ninja Warriors "). Thanks Roger Corman; You just waste a dollar to me.
