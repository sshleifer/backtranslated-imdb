I want to make this movie a dog, but I can not do it anyway. <br /> <br /> To demonstrate the duality of war styles, Lee Lee v. Lee is in a somewhat modest fight for the highest achievement. <<br /> <br /> This is a movie where the story carries the performance. Lee's acting is extremely amateur, hesitant, and tough for most of this movie ... right up to the very end. At first I had convinced myself that he was doing it for one of two letters. You know how to display a difference between personality. But it seems to lack inexperience or talent. It got a little more, more relaxed, towards the end. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jett Lee's performance as his carrier continues forward. I do not hate his acting. I just hate this to him. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this effect was very influenced by the "B" class. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was unique, creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not sufficient enough to hold good lighting, impact, film quality, and some acting texts, or the manager did not take enough care to bother about these little details. He is not disturbed with science in science fiction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But all stories made for a very enjoyable effort in the line. <br /> <br /> As enjoyable as this, I could not help, through all the ways, that this is that this is the only movie that is this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br />> This is a good plot for a 4.2 / 10 ("A" scale) ... <br /> <br />:.
