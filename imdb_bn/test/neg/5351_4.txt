I did not read John Grisham's "A Tie Tie-to-Kill", and probably helped to better understand this image. But probably not. I have heard that this is still the most trusted grisham adaptation, and if it is true then I can see why so great publisher turned the novel when Grisam launched it as his first job. <br /> <br /> "Kill one time" is one of those movies which seriously distracts and wants to do many things at once. It wants to be a suspicious crowd-colorful thriller and simultaneously, a film dedicated to exploring some social and moral questions. Let's face it, the two types of movies do not go together with Hollywood, so "Dead Man Walking" should be created independently. <br /> <br /> This story involves a young lawyer named Jack (Matthew McConnof). A black man, Carl (Samuel L. Jackson), to protect his two daughters from ruthless rape, from two mountainous extinction. A day before the rape trial, Karl was hiding in an orbit court and when the rapists brought the building, he lodged a complaint against them and shot them both dead. To help with defense, Jack took the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proved that his role in this film was totally unnecessary and only the film was set up for marketing purposes. Meanwhile, one of the youngest brother (Kiefa Sutherland) of the rape was angry that a black man killed his brother and decided to take revenge. In front of all these courts there is a kidnapping, a kidnapping, a brutal injury, and racial riots. I will admit that in addition to the court scene, all of which held my attention across the film. Later, I objected to the film's use of moral questions and the use of plot formulas. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Surely they may, but this does not mean that people will be innocent to be tried for trial. This picture, however, does not seem to think so. In addition, the plot has several holes for convenient use. For example, there is an unknown character called Mikey Mouse, who is a member of the Clan and for unknown reasons, to help the members of the Defense team escape to avoid the serious dangers of other members of Cller. Sutherland and the company were abducted in the abduction of Bular and this unidentified person came and died in the desert; and we never find out who he was and why he was helping people to become terrorists. Not speaking about the reign of terrorism of <BR> <br /> and the character of Sutherland, it is remarkable that police and bulk character can trap him throughout the film. A scene when Sutherland became a sniper from a building across the streets of Court Street and instead of trying to shoot Jack as he came out, one of the guards shooting. Now that you think there are dozens of police, it will be easy to surround and capture sniper. There is no such luck. No one could remember from what we could see that a sniper was still loose. Even after Bullock, he was rescued by Mikey Mouse, he never mentions the kidnapper, even did not question him. Why was this? Easy. The character's character was needed throughout the film, though he was reasonably involved. <br /> <br /> Apart from Bullock's character there is another ungrateful character. He played Jack's assistant Oliver Plat. His character seems to be a reason for the film - to provide a number of suppliers for the audience. In my opinion, when a writer used to show a big weakness in "serious" movies. It shows that filmmakers do not believe that stories and dialogues alone are enough to maintain the attention of the audience, and so be ridiculed for audience humor that they are watching an entertainment movie. But the film's many minor problems are enough. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Karl is actually guilty of murder. We have seen how many hours he planned to kill those who raped his daughter. The lawyers argued that it was temporary dementia, which caused him to be killed. Frustrating, Jack urged Jurini to close his eyes because he described the details of rape as part of his last debate. After describing everything that happened, he added a final line ... "Girl is white". We then saw the tears in front of the jury members. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the girl cried, she is free! He is free! Wait a minute! Do jurors give their verdict about their opinions or events? Most of the time, there was no such scene which the jury showed willingness and what they actually thought after getting their emotions. I'll tell you why. They could not deliberately show because a jury could not be deported for such an offense, even though the last consolidation of defense does not touch their heart. What is the message <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Do not have to be a fool. But since the dollars were reduced, so the filmmakers were more concerned with reducing the feelings of the audience rather than presenting a responsible message. If the person starts killing as a vengeance then the creator of this film will be responsible. This is a socially irresponsible film!
