The four LA police cars are driving around a big black-transformed look and have become quite ridiculous, when it proves that Nick Nolt, which is the worst, is in charge of it. The author does not drive to create camaraderie among party members, and the director Man-mountain Nolte fails to destroy the atrocities. Ask someone to Foprget. Nolt's character burns a cigarette, becomes crazy, and beat a decoration interviewer. His methods do not find him anywhere, until he open his mouth and roam around the house from his closed habitat. He pushed an FBI squad and leaked two Biman officials to the flight, there was only a vague report of headquarters anger and no punishment. At the end of the film, he was at the beginning and was muscular. How he led a deep prostitute to fall in love with him is mystery, as the eternal devotion of unemployment and the unhappy feeling expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting shots in the film: one, a nuclear explosion, another big crater other, apparently caused by a bomb. It is often destroyed like the mouth of Nolt.
