Man, are you serious? Did you read books or watch this movie? Well, if you do, warn me, it's bogas. Mark Furman was looking for a job after losing his job with LAPD. Do you remember him, right? He was the man who lied to the stand and OJ Simpson gave the defense what he was looking for. Well, he has written three books since then. I have read three of them. No, I'm not a fan, they gave me. Anyway, I'll tell you the similarities between the three, they completely distort the importance of Mark Furman. She shamefully exaggerates her tragic three. "Hit the spell", he pretends that he has something to do with catching the killer, when there is nothing to do with him. In all the books, he enjoyed great pleasure in running under local law enforcement efforts. Like his efforts, the OJ Trials were executed. In this movie, women look at Furahman and have a slow shot and then wish for it. Many other shots keep him in the center of attention, when in fact, I am sure that only at that time people thought that "Hey, or is there a racist that has stopped ojay?" This is an interesting real life story, but it's not a good movie.
