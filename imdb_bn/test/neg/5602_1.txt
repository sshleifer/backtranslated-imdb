Decoctu has to be the worst director "director" in any continuation of today, and there is no connection with him in his movies, usually homeoportisms and people roam in their matching boxer briefs. Remember ... anyone who is in dark black underwear is evil and evil and wants to crush your blood / soul ... here deep emotions). I'm just sitting through Seystood to laugh at his wife, I tried to watch every horror movie I could do, and this was Barbera (from the Baron, Re-Animator) Crumpton (I was closing in the decotty world before) Linna Quigley, Adrian Barbou and Thank you to other actresses) <br /> <br /> Lemi says how do you talk about sisterhood ... ... to other critics Echena, college campuses, gay vampire involved in the supposed plot. But when bra, panties and bikinas become so annoying, there is no parade of hot young kids ("actresses" if you want). There is no plot in the movie, no gossip, no nudity, and the conversation is ridiculous and it seems as if they can go along. The parts are kept in slow motion and repeated times are pushed repeatedly. Within ten minutes, there are only walking letters around the campus (oh, excitement!) Which shows more than any hotel than the hotel resort. And acting is extremely bad. The good work of these girls is only just ahead and turning to show off their body. Cast that talent was so vague that I would be surprised to see the one-day walk-on role on future feelings. Ditto for guys Yes DeCoteau squeezed more hot guys into this one underwear, ... instead of trying to do some work, there should be some K-Mart brochures. Do these people really have to pay tribute to the audience or just show them in Dave's office and stop their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> If I give a chance to a movie, 1.) It has worked with intelligent writing, well guided, original and skill (or a hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or 2.) It is cow's, nudity, mixed trashiness and / or it is oddly chock-full chock. David Dekto's films do not offer any of them, and they do more than normal production prices for direct-video-video flicks. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially the soft-and hard-core variety of pornography that is easily accessible to computers? I can not answer easily. <br /> <br /> Dexteu is a gay horror director and he can use his resources to keep a unique spin of this genre. Instead, he produces mood-infestation drift, without an ounce of talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, her movies are somewhat but lesbian couples. They actually consider homosexuality similar, confidential and sinful. Clearly, in his films, gay characters are trying to kill innocent, sexually related and / or innocent, sexually misleading leads. There are no shades here to make things interesting. Characters are naive and rarely proves themselves strong, convincing or confident. Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Although Laura started making video-to-video horror films directly, I could understand this plot, but from a gay director it simply shows that he did not have any idea about cheese beef in the beef meat.
