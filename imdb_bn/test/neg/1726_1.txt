Like many, I count Dennis Hooper's entire time to count the appearance of counting. I was sadly sorry. Negative things are more than truth told me about this flick. However, what the cake takes is a horror, horror story for the main character. Here's why: The planet can be destroyed, the only way to recover it, save the entire human race, it's trough, many smart, capable, beautiful, capable people get an underground hide out. And with the attitude of Dennis Hooper, the only visitor / scientist who was ready for the worst, and who has realized this. But Stevens' main motivation (Sony de Angelo) ?? She decided that Dennis is saved or destroyed because he is angry! Stevens was explicitly explained that Dennis's character did everything to warn people of danger, but he laughs. Hooper's character was with the boy's fingers, and now Stevens blames him for 'picking and sticking' ??? And if that's not enough, he wants to stop everyone from this secret access because "it is not fair!" And .... He is responsible for the death of a man who is the savior of humanity! Hello my god, how stupid you can get? I mean, two million in the budget, what can be done with it? Think of Clarks, Blair Witch and many other films that were made under $ 100,000 and were even better. AAAAARGH! I'm lucky to think that I could not pay a single penny to see this cone, and to sit at the end of this voice, uber-crap, I'm the most heroic thing of this year. It is no wonder that these beef writers were previously employed as camera operators and title designers ...
