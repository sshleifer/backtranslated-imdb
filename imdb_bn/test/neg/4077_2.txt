I want to say that I went to this movie too much by my expectations. I'm going to be funny because it's Bruce Almighty's Sigelal which was really fun and it's Steve Carroll's a wonderful comedic actor but boy, suck it. It is a sequel but actually does nothing to do with it because Morgan Freeman and Steve Carroll are the only people to reiterate their role, but Steve's character is completely different, he is no longer a great guy. . The story is different and the actor is different and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> All actresses (Steve Carroll, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even John Stewart are very nasty) have talent, but none of them seem to be using it and this is just for money There are movies. <br /> <br /> Now the plot of the plot is probably made in the form but it does not know where I start. I think the big problem is that everyone around Yan thinks he is crazy despite what he is doing, he raises a huge white beard in two days, gets help from animals all over the world, he creates a giant pressure in a few weeks, Do not joke, then they will say that he is new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also special effects are good but what is the greatest ever movie flooding ever doing Ivan Ivan? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mask, Dum and Dumendor and now Ian Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a big disappointment and Tom Shyamaad would have to be ashamed of himself.
