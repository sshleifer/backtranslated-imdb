This is by far the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I have never been able to rate 1 movie movie out of 10. My suggestion is not to see it. It's not classified as a movie. <br /> <br /> You can wait while sitting on the sofa instead of watching this movie. Acting was terrible but was far worse than the story. The events which are not even funny are extremely unlikely sequences. They are actually very long and stupid. Ashton Kutcher and her Red are very stupid choice to act in this movie. <br /> <br /> I went to Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you're 10 or 20 minutes in the movie, you can predict exactly how it's going to happen. I hope it will be better, but instead it gets worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating it. The movie is terrible. Do not see it. Hope this helps.
