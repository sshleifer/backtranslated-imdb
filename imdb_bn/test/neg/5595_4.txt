First look at 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (DR-Js. Cardon): Sexual Political Thriller is not very successful in this region, with some interesting scenery scene. The film portrays the couple by discovering their sexual fantasies in their work environment, wherever they are or whatever. The couple takes a trip where a willingness to be part of a retreat and bathhouse where they are willing to be a part of three in a woman and fill some of their imagination. At this moment, we only know that this couple is good, but we do not know that the drunkards are part of a good-teen political family. After the marriage, the person is likely to be encouraged to get a seat in the Congress. Then they get a package from an anonymous source that matches the clear pictures of their samples, and how their queuevists begin to figure out how and why those who send the package, what they want, and how to delete their names. This qwest becomes a passion that makes their seedlings deeper in the world and takes them a lot, where they are doing what they do all day and family and why they always hide. This movie is sometimes catchy but laughing because they look for the problem instead of being primarily involved with the police because of their pride. This is wrong, certainly the movie continues. Despite no name, performance is fine, but overrides the atrocities of the situation and the film is about halfway through the road. And of course, they eventually put a wrapper that denies and challenges everything that happened before. (This is not the day when they do not know what to do to spice up the film). This though does not help a bit of this movie.
