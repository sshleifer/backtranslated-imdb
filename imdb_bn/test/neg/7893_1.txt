I'll be honest - a fun visual gag with a snake dog pumping a purple plane on helm. It was a 30 second commercial, or maybe a 3 minute music video idea. But the producers have created age-old concept comedy sin to spread 30 seconds of material, which is in half a half of the film, and the results may be hairy. The remnants of the 89-minute racist and sex and humorous hilarious and deadly jokes, offensive and worst - are usually rowdy. Threadbare plot screams under the weight of its competition. The best you will avoid until you get drunk or rock.
