I can definitely say that I've ever seen the worst movies, and I usually like foreign movies. The film is nothing more than a vulnerable violent pornography. If you want to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexuality, unwanted nudity shots and a stupid intimate rape scene, which I am sure is the main appeal for the film's choice people <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot matches purposelessly, and no characters are preferred. Many scenes are depicted from the surrounding woods that women have to be patient with someone pushing them, which was a kind effort to create for the lack of stories. Perhaps it was not my time to see the film if it was correctly described in the reviews.
