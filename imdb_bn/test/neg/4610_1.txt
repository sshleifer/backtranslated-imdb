The most enjoyable part of this movie was clips from the original movie. The performance was poor and the sexual scorecard's compound revolt was there. The effect was limited at the best times. There was no stand outside the performance, in this film Amy EVVing was held to be the partner of Hamilton H20 viewers. The original was much more enjoyable and gratifying. I'm sorry to say that it's not going to be 10 years old ... so far it's below my list. Do not bother with this one of the servants !!
