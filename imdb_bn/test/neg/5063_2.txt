Closius said that "Baltic Storm" is banned in Sweden. That's not right! Instead, you can buy movies almost everywhere, such as gas stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price because the movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to maintain interest. The film appeals only to the conspirators, psychologists and other people living in La-La-Land and those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> I worked in the museum with Estonia disaster as a theme I met them all! I have heard about the theory of cocaine-smuggling, arms-smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, Russian-American-Estonian-Swedish- and Finnish intelligence, often with different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some common people ask why do not we show pictures? A question is not only seen in those horrible nonsense movies who ask them. <br /> <br /> Again, "Baltic Storm" is not banned in Sweden. It has some entertainment qualities, but Donald Switcherland is doing this movie?
