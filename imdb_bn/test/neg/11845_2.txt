The biggest and most annoying things in the movie Rapper were about to end up being similar to Tyransaurus Carnosaur, a little better work than a kid's kidnapper, and adult work. Carnasaur's film adaptation is rather a poor choice than the plot line. It was good to start with jeep kids. Then the plot went down the hill from there. A different plot was planned, rather than cloning the previous movie, if it was beautiful. The overnight movie should take lessons from the Jurassic Park series in different plots. The only film that came to be closer to the best dinosaur movie is Ateek Rex. The scenes from Carnosaur's films are often thought of.
