When this movie looks like this special Blair Direct project and says that the people of hell are walking around with the camera, the acting slash documentary theme is not a problem, I can do it and start with a haircut idea to create a scary script and make a gifted Bunch of actors and start shooting a film. The plot is that half of the people in Africa are human-like species of animals who kill and kill prey, locals believe that it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild clans are in Africa for their own evidence to Africa. There are no more than 1 of the 10 images in this movie, and I'm trying to say something about this movie, but I can not think of Nador's void for a long time.
