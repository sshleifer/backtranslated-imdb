Good wishes; <br /> <br /> I never thought I'd watch that day when I would be so annoyed by a movie that it would be a burden to end ... I am always a fan of horror movies, including B and C. But in this case it is difficult to describe how a movie that fails to qualify for any character on the scale ... <br /> <br /> The film is centered on a badly developed back story, followed by a mixture of locals. And at the top of it, the performance of the actor is suspicious. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) A gem that was shown and under the fund 2) So bad it's funny, laugh or your money back. Well fall into this movie. I was not afraid, did not smile ... so I guess if you really want to see it, then I can not recommend you ...
