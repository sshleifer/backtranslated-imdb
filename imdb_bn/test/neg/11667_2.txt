Basically I wrote that what was a sarcastic, impressive review of these rogue pieces, but when I submitted the review, I found "it is a long word that is not allowed", the words that were not misspelled were also wrong. <br /> <br /> Now the word that was judged too much has not been identified. After a lot of effort to remove the words, I finally suspected that the IMDB site is politically sensitive and can refuse some words automatically. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in myself. But after removing all the longest words, I repeated it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Everywhere.
