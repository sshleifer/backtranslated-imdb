I've seen so many - there are probably many live videos, no budget slash films, and a taste for "good people" or a taste for people who have a taste seems to be ridiculous. Dr. Chapper, please refer to what I refer to ... Absolutely shit Nothing about it is enjoyable - acting sucks, sucks the character, sucks the killer, the cow is brief ... and sucks. This is a group of friends of college, who goes to a newly discovered family cabin owned by one of the children's parents. This is meant to be a neat retreat, but they do not know that the sick former plastic surgeon has become worse with his two female assistants, looking for useful tissues to save the doctor. His name is Chopper, because he roams around motorcycles and of course chops. It's just a terrible movie, nobody's worthy of it. Enough said.
