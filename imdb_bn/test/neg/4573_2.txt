I like strange animation, I love many Asian movies, but I do not like this special item of Japan. Foucault is supposedly an American family (all of the Manquin) who came to Japan, and they have a little more modern sensitivity, including 50 Citcom families. DVDs have several very small episodes (less than every 5 minutes?) And I did not find it strange or entertaining even if it was not strange. I'm not sure what this appeal is I picked up on some mockery here and there, Lord, who did not, but the taunts are usually somewhat ridiculous, is not it? And nothing I saw or heard even a little sunny rate. I picked this to be used and it certainly uploaded interesting, but I'm guessing that I'm missing points or it's just a little lame. The box even thinks Funkon as a cheerful, okay in front, but I want to be different. 10 out of 2
