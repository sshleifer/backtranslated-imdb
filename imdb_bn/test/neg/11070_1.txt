If I was a film 0 or negative rating I could give this excuse. I was just stupid enough to take this DVD into the store, read the BlackBerry and thought it was great, I'll spend 10 pounds and buy it. I got it finally got a Â£ 10 coaster. Absolutely terrible, I do not even know where to start. I have no idea why anyone gave this reason for more than two stars because I can not remember a good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is basically seven unknown caves, one of them is journalist. No one knows they are there. When they reach the cave, they can not get out and they kill each other with a monster. There is going to be a reason for the reporter. There is some past monster in a character where his ex-girlfriend was drowned in the cave two years ago ... There seems to be no relevance or reason for it, I guess, just an ugly attempt at the character's building? However, the monster turned into a man that wandered into the cave as a common small child and lived there throughout his life. It can not glorify him for some reason, it can be bright, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe in water, can be in two places at once, and insane power (raise stones, grow as dead people etc). <br /> <br /> In the last scene, two women are alive, they wake up naked, only a little angry or confused. Then they find a picture of a kids. The monitor then exploded on the door, wrapped some carcasses on his head and wrapped it in a carpet (the director said it was a crane skull, if I could see in my life the biggest crow), Halloween is quite literally like a Kiddie "Rahah "Go. I was watching it with my boyfriend and at that time he literally burst out smile. The man then saw a picture of himself as a child and, sitting under a tree with his face, flashed him and then he got up and went into the cave. Why is he scattering the story behind the story and it makes you feel cheated for a story. The monster then killed one of the women and ruthlessly rape another one, cutting the last cut of the credit. I know the rape scene is designed to be frustrating, but as a woman it feels very ill to me and the whole thing affected me the most. He could kill him and cut him into pieces and be less fearful than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> A lot of things are ultimately missing. Also, the scenes where black was just a few minutes and nothing else was boring and constantly boring camera corners where it was all inverted and you could not see what you saw, which made me so deadly at one moment. I turned almost off. A terrible film You might be spending money and set it on fire, it would be better to spend money, as some clever people posted on me said, once you saw it, you can not watch the watch.
