I can think of the author of this story: <br /> 1. Let's make a serial killer movie like She Seenen, Night Moves, Copyright, and Silence of Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It will sell ... 2. The killer must accept some pattern. I know; She'll copy it from a serial killer mystery novel. That has not yet been done, at least not exactly like that. 3. Now, we need some sort of way to make this movie unique; Of course, good people can be painful in the Rear Window. 4. Lastly, we need a thick end that will give the movie the success of six senses and The Yoga Soupket. <br /> <br /> Well, now you know these things, you know the whole movie, so do not waste your money. I really hate moviemakers that they take a perfectly good idea for movies and run them on the ground completely. I wrote good stories when I was junior high. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. Finally when it was over, I would not have been frustrated, I just said, "Oh, who care?" The letters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personality. This film is only a proof that stealing material from other successful movies is not an excuse for a bad script. I can give this movie 1 out of 10. Generally, it will earn at least 2 or 3, but I am a bit sick. When will they learn? 1/10
