There was a very good moment in this movie. Just a couple of letters fleshed and that's not good. There was a large plot hole enough to run a truck. Creep-Ed with an old man. There were many moments that never came back like a cakewalk. What is her How are you Gary's sister? Is he better now What about Leroya? We learned nothing about him. What about the electronic piano guy? How about getting rich in miscarriage? What is her This was an interesting substance. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie as a whole and I recommend other music that is in this movie. Give time to warp again !!!!!!!
