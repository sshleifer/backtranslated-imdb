First of all, the editing of this movie is a big mistake that I did not understand how to miss - you consistently watch biblical overhead microphones outside and outside the film. For the first time I have seen, "OK, it's wrong" and it closes. After about 10th time, it starts to get incredibly annoying and confusing fun. If you have not seen the film yet, try to count how often you see the microphone; May be pretty interesting for the game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the film. This movie started with makings of a fantastic hard "Scratch" story; However, eventually the plot was completely destroyed. You have started watching the film under the idea of ​​TV advertising, that ghosts have ghosts which can only be seen by children; Especially young children, which makes it even more attractive because they are unable to warn the dangerously dangerous family. The opening scene has done a good job to mislead the viewer that it will be the main foundation of the film. ** (speaker) ** The film begins to sink with the family and eventually the house is killed by an "invisible" force. When the girl can see this ghost at the beginning of the film, the idea that it will continue is that her younger brother will tell her, "it" just before "it" is okay and she is crying in the house crying. . After telling the child to hide in the bed, the mother "invisible strength" killed her mother. After the death of his family, the boy just tried to hide and try to escape. <br /> <br /> I said, this movie was started with the creation of an excellent malignant film, where the family is stalked by an "invisible force" by the only hope of surviving with their only hope of being two years old. The girl began to look ghost, became less than half of the film; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The person responsible for the murder is considered as. After being attacked by a storm of chaos, a man kills a mother, daughter and son, when he thinks he is psychologically disturbed from their family; <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, firstly, why the family soul was trapped in the house? If the director was going for the Ju-On (The Grace) system in which the family surrounded the house after the death of the rage, and killed anyone who entered, why did the band stop hunting after being "captured"? His family? If the devil wants to kill the person who kills them, then why they attacked the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time of planting till the plants are fully effective during harvesting. It tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the person who apparently hated the whole movie, was living in the property for several months. Why did not ghost ever kill him at this time? <br /> <br /> This film includes many hits like "horror movie" scare and a clear combination of other horror film ideas. However, I'm saying that the film could have dragged until the plot was finally done. They just ran out of their budget and threw something together for the last one. To achieve the success of this film, they should be stuck with "Only children can see them" and just go away with the family or die like a family (too much for the sequel possible).
