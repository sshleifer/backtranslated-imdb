I really wasted enough time to show this comedy, I do not want to waste more writing writing. Not so much as once I crack a smile. All jokes were a boring, compulsive and intelligent kind of deficiency. I said, "Panchamal stands?" Almost every single character was an unnecessary stereotype and was cluttered in all situations and there was no solution even for half the time. The thing just happened to get the next scene. For the sake of my life I do not understand how well it has received reviews. If you want to make an incognito and badly made movie then Fat Girls is your movie.
