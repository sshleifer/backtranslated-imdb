If you are a six year old boy dinosaur, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, you will be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds. If you want to start picking lots of your thing which makes you acting, special effects, conversations, or even a slight amount of absence of a consistent plot. If you want a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, it would just be fine. That said, there are many children's entertainment which is much smarter, and some of it is even portable or enjoyable for adults. Unless your child is an uncomfortable dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.
