This movie is stupid. Have found it around. But so are fools and figs. You are mindful, stupid and dubious, significantly more interesting than this. However, I saw a stupid movie (tail sting) for love and a party of good friends laughing with it how bad it is. Tell me stigma, but watch this movie, and you find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you smile at it instead.
