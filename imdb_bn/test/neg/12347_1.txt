A friend and I went to see this movie. We have an opposite opinion of Fujimori, but after watching this film we agree on the following: The easiest way to make a wrong documentary is to create a foreign country where you were not present when you were present, how talented it is or how you Many of the investment. If you really want to know about the history of another country, do not see anything made by the native of the country otherwise you will not move away from your bubble. And those who try to strengthen their opinions and opinions that are not of them are really misusing their power. To make it worse, the director did not choose to talk about CIA's embarrassing involvement during Fujimori's regime. He has a lot of things to explain to the Peruvian people, he decides to deal with the only thing for him. But this is not surprising because both the director and the CIA are certainly violating Peruvian sovereignty, of course, trying to influence democratic processes at different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director really is interested in helping Peru, he would make a native funding to do the documentary. In any case there are documentaries, films and books made in Peruvian. Such as "Ozos Kui Nen Ven", "Dais de Santiago", "Montesigns-Fujimary: Las dos Carras de la Mizma Moneda", "Montesinso: Padreso Caballero" etc. The director of "Fall of Fujimori" should spend his time in his own country involving numerous problems or at least other countries related to his country affairs.
