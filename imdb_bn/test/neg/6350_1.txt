If you want to see an example of not making a movie, you will see it. I could, myself, make any film-making experience better. The script is ridiculous with a weak plot and there is no effort to meet for any intelligent structure. To create this error, you will think that the action is appropriate, is not it? <br /> <br /> Because of being played together, editing and being integrated together, the only saving grace is frustrating. The main performer is awesome performance. Why he should save his life, because he is really bad about acting, that's why Oscar will win. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The soundman has two guns effect, only the shadow of the silvery dark shadow reflects the camera And the only music track for WHOLE movie, no logical script that has no logic; The perfect recipe for a really, really bad film. Actually actually bug spot fun than trying to find something positive. To avoid all costs.
