Revisiting old films is not a good thing that you average. They sometimes get worse The Champion of Fangoriya Camp (in Gorozone, they labeled "the most horrific film from Texas Chainsaw" ?? um, no), Luther the Gayle evidently developed one of the following cultures as a "intense" horror picture. Indeed, it is simply average spots and slashes ?? A. Well, a beat film that sets itself apart from the pack by combining a killer who steals itself like a chicken. Yes, a chicken-like clucks. For the film's producer's sake, at least they do not walk the word of the murderer like a new referee in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Luther is actually fluttering after a long scene where people argue that he is reformed, even though he is like a chicken and Roger's dentist (which he apparently made in prison). This is a type of movie where the couple is knocking on the door and the girl says, "Oh, my mother definitely forgot her hair. After my father died, she forgot a lot." Such movie where the violent mother asks the police to look at Luther and tells him, "The murderer is in my house!" So what will she do? She held him and literally drags back home and said, "She shows me where I am and I'll leave." Why not call back up? <br /> <br /> It is very bad that the film is filled with such terrible actions and dialogue because Luther's character is really quite interesting. Most of the credit for Tom Nunan's dead Ed Terry, who went to Manchester, goes to Luther's twist. In the hands of the right director, Luther the Gayike could be in the same level as Sony Booy or Santa Sanlegi, and there might be differences in real movies. But Alberti is not that director and only puts Lathar's impressive character in exhausting slashing trophies.
