There is a difference between a "film" and a "movie". Quality, regardless of a film, is ready for public consumption. A group of friends join together for a weekend course with a camcorder. During my time as a visitor, I saw both examples. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I appeared in the screening of the writer / director John Szetzowski's "Dinnerbrook". Now read the script and see two fragments of this piece (a rough cut and "finished" product) and I can safely say it is a movie. And that's a student movie This is a good word for the lack of words, which is to say, the director knows how to record the camera record and catch the moving images. Most of the parts, static and vague, with minimal closing shots, and dialogue scenes decrease in most long shots to allow viewers to relate to characters. I understand that this is a decent budget movie, but some visual girls are appreciated and it's been a long way in keeping the audience interested. <br /> <br /> Please have an independent picture shown that the limited camera function can produce well written, faded stories and some sharp dialogs. Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, False, and Video Tape" comes to mind immediately. This movie, however, does not have. The main story is weak and focus. If the main plot Davy tries to correct his relationship with his father, then I think the movie misses the point. I came out of it that Davie's main desire is to "change the face of the rock" to change the n 'roll. "However, we see very little activity in his part to show, although there is a dream sequence at the beginning and ultimately has a great performance, we think that Davy's songs are heard or unexpectedly strumming a guitar, we simply say that Davy has played many Giggs, But we can not see him in complete rock out mode. Next time, do not tell the audience. A creative writing class Dave does not look like someone who can grow up in the Glam rock era of 1970s; It looks like he will be more comfortable in the first days of rock 'n' roll, which is like a genius brother of James Dean. Other events in the film seem to have nothing to do with randomly changed characters and story threads with little or little main stories, They are brought and are abandoned with dangerous frequency (ie Terry's father involved in mistress). If I want to see a movie with this type of decorated construction, then consider watching "Napoleonic Dynamite" again, a film that I would like to make it for the first time Could i <br /> <br /> For the above conversations, I should assume that they should be mentioned very few and very far between. Is it too much to ask for? I do not think so. When the character speaks, it is in short, harmful sentence; Oh so insightful question collection, grunts mad or wild over-the-top outbursts These characters simply do not behave like normal, reasonable people. Working with such material, it's easy to understand why why this movie only has a good performance, al-Hodson's, and why she's a bad imitation of Sam Eliot during scams. A good director, or at least one who is ready for a feature director challenge, will be able to clarify these issues and correct the authors and cameras. However, Sajajoski is so close to this material, that he simply does not see them, or if he does, he is reluctant to take the necessary steps to solve it because it will hurt his creative attitude. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in constructive ways, a self-motivated, confused fool. Just asked Rob Schneider. Finally, we are left with a poor, high school set, combined with the amazing "Velvet Goldmine" equivalent to the amazing "Garden State" of the Zach Buffet, two more films are worth your time. <br /> <br /> Now, any such cast or crew allow me to offer this offer before I can get out of this exercise. What I can do is to commend Motzovsky's ambition to make a movie of his own and keep it there for visitors to see. However, the hope of being lifted and delivered to this movie is confusing only to the glorious philosophy. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the film holds a commitment (and it encounters, at the moment it does not come from acting, writing or direction), it is: If, if the people associated with this movie are willing, then, please learn from this movie, it is File and use the lessons learned in your next attempt; Do not attack your critics, or friends or family do this for you. If you are able to do this, then perhaps the next will be eligible for distribution, the "film" is worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> I'm your listener, and I'm willing to see.
