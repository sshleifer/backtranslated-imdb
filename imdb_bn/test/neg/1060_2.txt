My Cadion Limo was destroyed !!! Well, it was like me - for several years, many polio people and some selected people around Manhattan. <br /> <br /> I can tell you more entertaining than this movie. Lord, what a bomb - like it becomes faster in an RPG. I happened to be a lot more bigger in my white caddy than a glimpse appeared on this slime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick did a credible job with a very serious actor and the dirty work he was working with. Unfortunately, Roger Howard played his part like a red-humored circus shoes. If he is not serious then why should his audience? The director should close the set within the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The document was written for the age of 10 to 10 years old. There was not a whole lot of wonderful cracking set up. Oh well, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - better to get you well.
