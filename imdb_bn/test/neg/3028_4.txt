I came out of the first movie and saw this movie. I was fifteen years and even then, I knew it was greasy. It was such a great possibility and I continually rewrite my head script. Capoeira could be a good drama to destroy what. I loved the fact that it is shot on space. The character was very bad that the resort was. It seems that they wrote the first draft of a script, then the film was created directly. In fifteen, I could write a good script! Some views and dialogs did not come out of nowhere and you were left with many inappropriate queries. And was it just that, or Lobo was attracted to his cousin? "Elena has become a kind of woman!" And the way he was always touching him. An interesting plot will be twist, Elena is a Perv who works for her drug-dealing cousin. Very bad they missed the mark on this one.
