Problems with this movie, which fail like unfinished other movies, are scripts. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> What is the story here? Okay, this is a biology but I think everyone will agree that there is no way that the whole life can be synthesized in 100 or so minutes. Some selections and editing are required but this script is not enough to just select or edit. Hoffman's life was not presented to one or two important moments or themes that could identify with the audience, and through them, the whole person's big picture 'Get' <br /> <br /> The movie is a terrible sub-truth, Life in Sob Stories film ("I'm bringing up the new shots used to match up to archive footage)" a boy who did not know that I was his father "Shotik"), Political conspiracy theory film, etc. It does not only create what he wants to do in his mind, and he is released soon, in an interview with the half-hearted Cannes bride's racist structure (reporter) Huffman's past people, which allows the film to start from being more formless and flashing. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of moments and events that do not contribute nothing to the story and have been well cut away from some more important extended rooms. After Vincent d'Anfrio, the whole scene in the office of the psychiatrist said, "I am Abbey Hoffman! I am a Father Hoffman!" ("I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting!") Could easily cut off. What has happened is the psychologist said, "Here are some lithium disorders." And two women in her life say, "We can see you more often in the weekend." And the lips! That's it. No mental health problem This is one of the ridiculous tokenistic scenes that it can easily do and it should be dumped before shooting. Where did they stand from the God of Vietnam and Hoffman phones, and watched the New York footage? Meaningless Is not saying anything about us Nevertheless, when it comes to an important moment like drug addiction, the film's very early formation emerges from the left field and gives no idea to the audience. Suddenly he is dealing heroin? Where did it come from? Why? What's going on here? <br /> <br /> I think I am a middle-aged left, I am sitting well with the target audience for this movie, but I am annoyed with 'The Man', 'The Pegas', 'Faj', etc. Cruel, fit , Standing, Hippie-Hitting Android. It may be like this in the 60's America, I do not know, I was not there, but on the condition of the film it was a cheap peculiar polymic. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Ophrio was sure that young Hoffman and I can read the bus schedule at Garfieldo at any time, although he was not good for this part.
