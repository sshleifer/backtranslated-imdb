My wife and I enjoy bad science fiction movies. Some movies they're bad so bad. Mansquito was one of those. That one was bad but it had some redeeming attributes. It makes you wonder how a self-respecting actor has reached the line "Hey! Montsito!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is so bad that it has taken our criteria for bad now. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. Quaid Strike Force was, "Indian", used to walk around a black cloth and used to cry loudly. She shot down a helicopter with an arrow! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh in this movie but there was no point in it, on which it was not indifferent. We could not come up with any redeeming features other than one. Those words were "last" <br /> <br /> There is no plot, no character development, and there is no direction in the film. No one needs to be fired in Hollywood.
