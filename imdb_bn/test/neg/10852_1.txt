Hi! I am a military, African (yet white!) Jungle tribal princess, who has tremendous power to transform the world's cheapest, helpless monster (60th Star Trayeye thinks of the Alliance) enters the clay! When I first found myself in this terrible position, I took the only logical step: I made myself a foxy-fictitious foxy, which did my bad job. I enjoy the romance novel and occasionally separate the overwhelming African warfare. And if I'm my (white, of course) sidekick. I do not think an American former military man from Couture to flee from America after divorce, then I would repent. Can you say "ducking alimony"? However, he sometimes confuses me from my difficult life. I mean, how stupid you know that those who are converted to meat are a dangerous species of giant? After a lot of hardships (acting too hard! * Quinn *), I did not give up, and after many vivid inquiries, I finally discovered my role in life: For those who are not very bad night television viewers who are not very unfortunate wires or satellites.
