Great story and great lead actor (Kayada and Ryan) but the film is suffering from bad directions, bad screenplay and bad scripts. Main actor can not save the film but their part. This is bad because it could be better than 80's style. Mystery / Mystery / Thriller. Ryan watched so young and fresh. Looks good for Ryan fans though ...
