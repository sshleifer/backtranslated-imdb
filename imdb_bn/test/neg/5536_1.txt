So long, nasty hair and her girlfriend this ugly guy end up in this house and they argue and argue about her old girlfriend. It was supposed to be something awful but I could not see anything scary. There is some reference to a monster from the sea but is not to go anywhere. Because then I want to do it because it's tainted love has pulled away from the triangle. The movie title looks like it will be a scary and exciting movie but I could not believe it so far. I waited and waited for it to finish and it was very happy when it happened. It does not live up to the title, so it's WHY it is. The cover was a cool picture but I should not judge a Chess movie by its cover.
