Definitely not bad bad budget film, this "Gorilla Bride", but not enough, not enough, and memorable enough to get into the meaningful scientific efforts of his time. Director Curt Sydmak was a famous writer in the 1930s and early 1940s and delivered the story of some genuine genre classic ("I was walking with a jamboo", "The Wolf Man"), but as a director, he probably lacked the necessary qualifications. Similar to the "Gorilla Bride" story and the "The Wolf Man" mentioned in the atmosphere, the film is much more amateur and kind. Both nights handle the cursed men cursed in large creatures, but the title does not show half as a threat to Gorilla Verbobl, although the movie was released later in the decade. During the speech of silence, actor Lon Chani tries to convince us that the jungle is an evil space and many mysteries are hidden, but in reality there is no mystery about the plot. It is compatible with a plantation manager who is jealous for his old colleague so beautiful young wife and she killed him. A native woman witnesses her crime and burns a spell that can transform her into a secret big gorilla at night ... or maybe she just wants to believe that she is becoming a secret big gorilla? Lawn Chaney played police himself, remade Burur (who played in thousands of para-mesen TV movies) on the charge of investigating the murder of the commissioner, greedy planting manager / night gorilla. Syodmak is trying to make the film look like a supernatural thriller ?? Is it or not just happening in Barney's head all? ?? Unfortunately failed and it is too much talking and very little jungle-action reason. Many jungle settings are beautifully illustrated, but the rest "special" effects are strong and badly done. Still good acting, Barbara Petton looks nice and ?? Although very expected ?? The story is oddly bound to the very end. Kinky movie, it's probably voodoo-curse me ??
