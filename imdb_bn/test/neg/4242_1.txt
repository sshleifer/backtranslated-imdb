Playmania is extremely annoying. Based on this show Mail or Shandi asks very simple questions that a 2 year old could answer a very slow response. This show lasts for 2 hours and they can probably play around 10 games in that time. People may like this event because the hosts have eye candy, but they are very annoying that the frustrations are completely destroyed. <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, they mention that we need more than one million players. Top 5 surveys that they probably take about 20 minutes to show. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. Because they probably do not have the ability to call them because this show is so cheap. The biggest money I ever saw them was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "game show" was canceled by the end of 2006.
