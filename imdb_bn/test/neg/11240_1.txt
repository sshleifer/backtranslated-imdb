I've just given 10 travel highways, I've mentioned for two reasons to prove it, I'm not a git that only gives a bad review but 2 reasons the theme of the movie has the same thread, like falling in love with a woman. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> We all know that beautiful women flashing a chick but you can not avoid them, they will eventually find you. The beautiful woman for me is two things, two terrible terrible terrible things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a dancer, you know about the warmth of the feet, with lots of warmth of the feet, encourages each other. You see the reality of Prosty Woman prostitution and it's a street pedestrian. We are talking here, there is a great life here, she is only sometimes very happy and happy to explain her accident. My feeling is that the character of this 'happy hockey' type is even more brilliant than even realistic character, which makes me ask for a movie about a person if you create a movie about a person who is afraid of decorating the player with too much chicken. Why the introduction is familiar? If I make a movie about Chef, she does not want me to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, but for the first time, what movie will you make about the chef? The hooker completely gets the point through a respectable dancer type and by bending, the story completely misses the point and consequently it does not involve any moral or social questions that are actually false. <br /> <br /> Second, 'Primate Women' insults herself for romance, Richard Gere's acting Edward Lewis has no source to scream or romance this 'lady' without her plastic friend, do not leave home without a hint, it's special By doing that you have a moron who has no imagination in a lawsuit. In his romantic moments, 10 of them are involved in cash splashing in one way or another, even when they first meet him, Lotus Esprit Turbo does all his work, where are the diamonds there, diamond, money, joke? Where do Curiosity, do not mention that effort at the piano. <br /> <br /> The girls who love this picture also want more shopping than girls. Those who love this movie also can not understand that there is less elegance compared to the old ad calculator, perhaps they may not have registered. More importantly, anyone who likes this movie will hate the 'thief highway', that is a wonderful story based on the same subject. <br /> <br /> I will finish a song <br /> <br /> Beautiful woman walking around the street, I love the beautiful lady, I do not believe you are not true Anyone who can forgive you as much <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not forgive beautiful women, beautiful women, I can not help a beautiful woman, and you look beautiful, as I imagine <br /> <br /> Beautiful Maha La, beautiful woman for a while, talk to a beautiful woman, sell your smile to me, beautiful beautiful, yeah, yeah beautiful lady, look at me beautiful woman, say you stay with me ... and I'll give you the money. I'll treat you properly
