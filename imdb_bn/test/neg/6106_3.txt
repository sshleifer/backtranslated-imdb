My mother told me not to go to see "Kadosh" - but who listens to mother? <br /> <br /> I stopped it when I was watching, I thought, I lost my feminist credentials on my way to the theater, so I checked with the card-taking feminists the next day. No, they also believe that it is more meaningless than a feminist statement, orthodox as the Taliban. <br /> <br /> This careful story to show this Israeli film is too much to think about the ultra-orthodox messianism, it is incredible (plus that sister-unexpected Orthodox rock-n'-roller (!) sisters among the incredible Sexy - even Israel that would be fabulous). <br /> <br /> Theater was quite crowded, so there is a pent-up curiosity to watch the movie of Israel; Very nasty movies are being distributed all the time. This Hollywood romantic movie pierced was almost enough to run me back. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/29/2000)
