When The Spirits In Release, what you heard from the Final Fantasy fans was a terrible movie because it does not look like a fantasy fantasy. This is a good story, for better or for worse. Known settings, characters, music, stories, and top action scenes should thrill the original game fans. The problem is that it is not a good movie in its own right. <br /> <br /> Directions of war scenes are often flexible, camera angles seem to be more effective for the fun to move freely. , But only to create scenes to break and look confusing. <br /> <br /> Cgi itself is an exception, but I can not say that what I saw from the spirit is the best. Character, although I must admit that the advent character of the child is moved more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is actually a black hole. It is a giant douse exorcist which is designed to bring Sephiroth back to a final war. Old characters reappear, but fans should serve to serve any other purpose. The character development is indefinite and the film does nothing to solve any of the plots threads hanging after the end of the movie. But it is packed with magic scenes with magic, salmon and border breaks, which probably what fans wanted. Finally, Advent Children works more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real Siegel that flicks a very chic, but totally intelligent action. <br /> <br /> By the way, do not think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful. It just makes the feeling that fanboys / funerals make my materiality so big.
