This film does not have justice to Mr. Bachchan. He was a great actor and I was very disappointed in the film and there was not much conspiracy in it. This is actually the first movie I have been frustrated with. It starts with bringing his daughter to her daughter and she is a photographer. He took his picture in the garden, he pushed himself down. He is a 60-year-old man who does not have to do anything but take pictures of her. The movie makes no sense. The whole film is behind him and tells him how much he thinks about him. Then her daughter falls, and she has to take a place around this so that she does not get bothered and finds the girl. I do not think this image was childish quality. She is better than this movie. I always portrayed him as a prominent person and then I saw him in this movie and I could not portray him in this film. The film did not hold my interest. I could not wait till the film ended. And you are not.
