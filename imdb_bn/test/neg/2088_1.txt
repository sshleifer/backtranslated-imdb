This picture is bad, yes, but the producers used a real kangar, they killed the actors with boxing. I'm an Australian and I saw a two-foot-tall man. "The Russians fight each other, it's not a scene, because the object can kill each other's rival, (this is the way to protect the feathers of women) and there is an incident where someone has a kangar Made, and injured or killed, so when you see a cone on TV or film it is a female or non Can be animated, because it is a good idea that the actor is not hurt (they may be annoyed by losing breath). Australian animals are beautiful and ugly, it is false, many dangerous (10 living in the 12 most deadly snakes here), and mostly simply ugly (soft like koala steals). So if you come to Australia BE Careful !!!
