In front of the Harry Noules DVD, the "next icon in the quote" is really quoted?!?!?!?! I have heard a lot of hype on this side but were not completely confident. But I would give a Mary a hard horror fan and a horror movie almost a chance. Find out your next wax where budget or rating does not know any matter because. Not here. Hatchet is poorly imagined, bad acting and non-funny. Freddie Jason and Kandiman's performers and actors who have played a lot of eloquence with the coworker do not make you the expert on horror. Sorry I do not even want to describe the cause of the plot because it is very stupid. Verily my money is on Rob Zombie. There are a people who know old school horror. Forget this trash.
