I really like the idea of ​​travel in levels, and I like to pull Wade / Queen even in the initial episode. Some of the worlds they made gave the original characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories. However, as show went as more stupid disputes between friends and a true bond less. There were less surprises and tension when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. And love of each world was one of the falling characters. The text has just become annoying and everything has gone above. Too bad it was better to have a knitting band close to friends with a friendly (A La Star Wars) friend of varying degrees on TV for a few years instead of a tired band of friend's pictures.
