When you think you've seen the worst Jammy sub-generator offer, then another roaming and non-talent music team comes to prove you wrong. <br /> <br /> I suffered from the zombie bladder trilogy, Death Valley: bloody rebellion revenge, through the Zumbo Diaries carried half-comotose and jumped jumping, jumping 90: extreme fatality, and actually thought that amateur movies No inferiority of the construction will be reduced. However, only I saw the Jabber Planet, while jolting the drill for two hours from the author / director George Benalla, I think I got the final on horror jambi movies. <br /> <br /> This awesome amateur effort, which is a hard fighter like Mad Max and Dead of the Dead (but all bad), Frank Farhat TK Kane, who kicked a junk for a hobby, just knives, Some concession grenade and which he probably would have been <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> from unwanted, but receiving control of the area (those who find them That is valuable for the transfer) must placate a gang of thugs shocking. <br /> <br /> Of course, why is not the type of people who take the order from a bunch of Z-grade post-apocalyptic rural boys, and they teach about bad guys a lesson (mostly focuses them on the threat), only temporarily zombies Pauses to rescue friends from <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing in this film to make it a watch, it's a horrible script, ridiculous effect and idle production value, featuring almost everyone involved in terrible acting. To be fair, I like most basic premises that jawbis are an unexpected result of a very popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrate. (We learn it when one character easily explains the story of Kane, which is not strange to any idea what happened), but the only vague interesting aspect of this whole production. <br /> <br /> I have specific honor for those who manage financing and can make their own films, but when the results are so poor, they decide to make it available to the public when respect is lost. If I had made it, then I would have kept it secret.
