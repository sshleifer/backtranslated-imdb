My friends and I often got fun about movies in real time. But this movie is really ... they will literally show something for 4 minutes straight but a man digs the dirt with his hands. It has no plot, and an incredible amount of gratuitous screams. I honestly do not believe that it won a prize for his alleged mystery. If you are like me and have seen the first movie and liked it for its terrible performance, accidentally a linear and "lowest" for the lowest low budget, it does not matter; It is so bad that its bad memories can even roam around and you have any good memories. If you look around on a blank screen you will be more relaxed.
