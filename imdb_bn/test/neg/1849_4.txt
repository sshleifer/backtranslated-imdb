INFERNO begins to start with a TVM starscape effect fairly impressive. We also introduced a scientist known as Halera. Will not you get it Heller, Hell-E, Infor. So I guess someone had some intelligence to produce. However, it has become more evident that the intelligence around the whole story was rejected to appeal to an American TVM audience that is progressing TVM <br /> <br /> This story has been incomplete by mistresses, such as the Ampon stock TVM characters are hard to choose In a liberal school, a teacher who is trying to save a boy from a criminal life, the doctor who is his medical license Riyechena etc. Actually the story gets a lot of attention against this disaster, all possible tensions and dramas have apparently smoked, and a TVM is only we know that there was not a downbeat there. <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, see the scene where a guard with a gang of National Guard. A soldier blasted a tower in a fire in a grenade fire and the whole building exploded in a fire ball. What a small granade that can not contain high explosives is not more than ounces! Can not do it. Another explosion of plastic explosives and another in the army engineer carrying a dam with the effect of the same firework can be seen. Directors, please note that high explosives are not like Napoleon. <br /> <br /> They say that I got too much attention for TV and at some point I did not want to stop it myself. It was some potential and considering me, special effects were considered very good and it is not as bad as a TVM that some people are making.
