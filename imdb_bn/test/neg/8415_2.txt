I hope the Pulp will be an interesting movie, but was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a real struggle to keep watching. When you say to yourself "Hah? What is this?!?". This is the one you see after seeing it - why have they ever been bored? <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very bad that Michael Kain is a good actor. I was hoping to see the great Lezzette Scott in this, but he would only appear on the screen for a minute total. Scott was one of the best films of all times, and one of the girls in Flette, silent women, and this was his last film. <br /> <br /> oh well ...
