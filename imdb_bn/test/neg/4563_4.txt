This is an old dark house. A young couple wanders around a strange palace and runs it by Satan, where they are following one group of famine, one after another: the hardships, the beggars, the leopard, the mood, the strange woman, the man, and (for some reason) two Chinese They ended up in the throne hall, where the hero had to climb seven steps with seven illuminated footprints for the contest "Price Is Right" competition; So the title. This is the same thing too much for my taste. Fun while traveling around the house is fun for a while, then it is repeated. Harald Lloyd or Booster Keaton or Lourall and Hardy, doing two bits in the same bit of relay, it's not really funny. This is not fearful, and apparently it was not intended: the family is very stupid. Most of the films in this series are compatible with the real threat of jokes and usually two - those who believe in letters are real and it's a cover for others. The cover here will not be taken seriously and it is also not covered. Coming from fun to a couple of minutes, but it's rather fun fun. The novel was a direct thriller based on the film and I think it could have a direct impact - and it may still be.
