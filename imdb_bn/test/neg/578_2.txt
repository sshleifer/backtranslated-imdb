In the beach beach of the photo, divorced single mom finds an anonymous love letter and activates her in her latent love life. The Pet project for actress / co-producer Kate Capesau, who gave a warm, neatly retained leadership performance, is still so thin and directional and editable, so uncertain that an undisturbed discontent reduces. Initially, Capello Helen is reading a lot of her friends, her boyfriend's letter (a funny visual joke), but the first person played with Allen Dinosaur, who did not play homosexuals with the challenge, but closed the closure due to this hostage. There are different ideas that anyone can hold a stick, and the continuity is very sticky. Supporting cast (with Tom Seleck and Tom Ever Scott, mostly working with his shirt) is very good, but they can not save the final law, which is frustrating. Less is basically, a quirky, happy way, but it's flexible, nothing better. ** **** to 1/2
