The idea of ​​this film is quite interesting: the junior children are climbing from abandoned mines to retaliate to Pennsylvania's retreat to retaliate their death. Cool. When dealing with zombies I lack the creativity of the problem with the movie. The producer really could have done the film with some terrorist views "torch" as a stop action, walking on opposite camera or torching with stuff like that. When Jumbo children roam through the woods, they can see a 9-year-old walk on a playground in West Philadelphia, like a bunch. Instead of choosing axes and foxes, they could easily carry baseball bats and gloves. Why should I fear these little kids? Anyone who can safely escape a straight line away. Also, who in their right minds had their children in that annoying, run-down house with one night? I opened the door in front of me and looked around and said, "mm-hoom.mm-hoom, sona, start the car. I'm going back and forth again and then we're from here." Completely incredible movie. Do not waste your time.
