My DVD describes the "El Chuc√°bra" plot behind: After the settlement in the desert, the legendary vampire hunters escaped into the city by making fun and panic. They followed lethal animals, an animal control officer and scientist. Stellina David realized that with her suspicious plan, a vigilant is also monitoring the fraudulent killer for a mysterious research facility conducted by Dobbik Dr Goodspeed. If you see it under the influence of alcohol, this woman's horror flick is somewhat fun. The script is completely stupid, outside the frame of belief and the aspect is amateur. Two Rubber Chupacabra suits are the best things about this movie. It's 3 out of 10 and it's very kind.
