Depending on the comments made so far, everyone hates this movie or likes it. I think it will be great though it is not a great movie but it has interesting moments. One thing, it was located in Colorado (it was Brinridge or Teluride? I can not remember, but it is in credit). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's pretty cool, even lived in Colorado for a few years. Later on, it has Disney's trends for outstanding character actors. Harry Morgan did not have a better form than when he played in Disney movies. She is literally hysterical. Also, do you remember the wonderful Mary Wicks? Although there are "bit parts" in this movie, he is always very cool. If he does not know who he is, then think about the animated Disney version of the Note Dame Hannah (he was a cowgirl), and he was not the "Bonnie Act", as well as the most interesting of the Nun "problems with the Angels." She has always been a great character actress and most actors do not qualify for her recognition. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s, Disney actors and star actors as well as Disney's "greatest" films, however, if you really see some of them starting from the beginning, you'll notice that it's really fun in every movie. Or shocking moment. The whole movie may not be fun, but always a live-action movie always has a comic mole (at least 1 or 2). Harry Morgan suddenly wanders on a tone or team conveyor in his voice, or Joe Flin donates an awesome description, it's all good. The whole movie may not be good, but I have sometimes seen that this is a violent moment in every Disney movie of this period. During this time Disney has always managed to create a person's smile, despite the silly film folly. <br /> <br /> Based on these comments, I disagree with the viewers who are afraid of each Disney movie at this time. That statement is not quite right in it. Rather, it is easy for me to give credit and ignore weaknesses in plots at my fun moments. <br /> <br /> Some live-action Disney movies have really appreciated them for the genuine classic (Old Yayer, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who do not, - when films become indecent, frank and obnoxious A good happy family was fun when they got up.
