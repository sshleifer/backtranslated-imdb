This is an amazingly bad action film. I mean, its initial error is blurred. Arghh! Pale wardrobes, retro cheese set designs, and suitable painters do not prevent this flash from snooze. The second (main) error of the mode squad is the lack of character development - lack of lack of actors. I like Claire Danes's work, so I was surprised to see her unattractive performance in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi has misbehaved with her: how does cotton-mode, on the left side of the acting style, perhaps an action can be set on Flickr? As Omar Apps, well, he has to send a few lessons to learn how to feel. People were the same face expression for the whole picture! My suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable.
