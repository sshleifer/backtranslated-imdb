I was very disappointed in this picture. The director has shown some talent in his other efforts, but this only started to be filled. There may be a deep meaning behind it, but it seems that there is nothing other than a director who has some toys. <br /> <br /> I would recommend his other works to the public, but of course not one. I saw it, I remember it would take after an initial slow period, but it's not. At the end of the film I was not silent, nor did I think of new ways. I could just say to myself, "What was that?" <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures were really interesting parts, but not enough to sit again through it.
