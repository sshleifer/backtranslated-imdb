This film is hard to try but fails It may be an appeal-like appeal to non-Australian audiences, but it's just tedious to the locals. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is a tough, difficult isolated mine city. If a couple of Citoid fruits drag it, it is all expected. Did I come across that good-looking theme before? Oh yes - Town Mouse and Country mouse. <br /> <br /> I hope that it will improve, but after the broken mountain scene, I found where this title was and so it turned off the TV and went to bed.
