I really do not understand why people love this show. A friend of mine sees it and since I love science fiction, as soon as I'm committed to the Shoye Plot, I tried to watch it, but it's really a really annoying show. The only thing you will be awake during this event is the use of complete CGI-effects and muppets like video games. Remember that I call it muppets because they actually look like muppets, they're not really like aliens. <br /> <br />; muppets and make-up effects are awesome overused this show. Your man who can best describe as Ali / Daphf-hybrid, you have a bad girl, who looks like a chessy vamp-girl, you have a floating ribbon-crack crack-aliens ... it feels unnecessary And even a point that you are confused with the whole story of the lost astronauts. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also a lot more. The makers of this event have thus directed that each episode is often considered to be another show. That is, at least that you have to point back to the original character / muppets. The whole plot about the main character of returning to the world is a lot of shocks in the background. Acting is very bad. Conclusion: If you want good sci-fi, look somewhere else. It is not even real science to start from my opinion, since the show looks at the imagination with all dolls and strange dreams. And if you just want to see the Muppate, I would see you the Muppet Show and the happiness of a show is over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any ideas about living spaceship? Oh okay The doctor started this idea almost 30 years ago! This show is like the residue collection 'Sci-Fi'. Scripts and events that are abandoned for a good reason, only picked by this awesome show.
