A college professor is working on creating zombies and, you do not know it, things go terribly wrong. The next thing you know is, the whole campus is overrun. Thanks for the love, a pair of trained uber-commandos for such a situation. Very bad they have to be with a group of dead-comedos, under whose leadership a rapper (he does not bother playing a military man, he only responds to his high officials as he is 'wrapin' veil vein). High point locker room view of this part of the movie Men and women die-downs share the same locker room and apparently all women need military laws to wear black brushes and children's pants. Hey, if you can not make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. My hat filmmakers closed. <br /> <br /> So, after working on how well these Moroccan commands are prepared (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all killed by a completely small order. Their biggest downfall seems to be that it never happens to launch any light on them. Facing a common one walking between them in a room and watching someone distant. People or zombie? Can not say Flip over the light? No, the death-commando protocol keeps them in their possession so that they can easily get out of their hands and well, they have to walk on to make sure they know the drill. The death of Sergeant Major Sticky Finges is particularly fun - my favorite scene is associated with a rapper in any film. Fortunately (and again, the filmmakers hat closed), the hottest babe in moron-commandos manages to survive. Her and the female uber-commands both wind up in tight t-shirts for the rest of the movie. Now the military operation should be done! There is a bunch of running around, my ridiculous things like uber-commandos fail to get an easy ventilation (it is probably a thin part of the aluminum that you can easily keep your fists with). These zombies awakens the plan to blur on themselves and even though we have not seen anything in the movie to indicate these zombies through their smell, even though they are good enough to start sniffing jumbo hunt and let our heroes go. <br /> <br /> <br /> A few interesting bits - Paris Hilton Gaga, "Can you hear me now?" Although the zombies bite the secondary letters immediately, though, they are able to fight their way through dozens of nibbled on the main characters. Another chocolate is supplied by Mr. Funj, who can not utter the word 'tornit' (te-n-kit?). <br /> <br /> Overall it's a little ridiculous. Some might use more interesting characters, but basically for a sci-fi channel, I was gently influenced.
