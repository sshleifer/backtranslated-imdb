When this movie is a shameful result: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, guided and produced by a donkey. And / or b) It is produced to illuminate the insect / Stupa Anger's madness. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is disrespectful. Vidya spent much time in her childhood and was not as good as the legends - such as card counting, her black trick turn, money roll as id. He mentions great references to other pizzas such as Chip Reese, Brunson etc. The movie is a complete mess from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want more complete and accurate accounts then read a book. If you thought the movie was good, read books and change your mind.
