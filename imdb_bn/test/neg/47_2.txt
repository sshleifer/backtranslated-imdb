I grabbed it at the IFC last week and I thought it was the norm of the movie short of Indie: a little over style, heavy on the substance and originality. The 70's chest hair and an upcoming movie with a very cool-for-school clothes makes the boy unusually attractive (and bootable for boot), wonders? Also, this film has spread to the chicks in the late 1970's, which works for some (think of Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides") but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another critic is the work of Harmony Korine and I compare it with that. Agree. Yet I do not see this as a positive thing (however, has he ever done the latest?). "Labrador" is really a waste of all time and energy involved. If you see it in the cable late night, turn on the channel and see something else instead.
