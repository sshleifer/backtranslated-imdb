I'm 35 years old. Bruce was Evil Dead in Man, and I still love to see ED1 and ED2. Show him in King Babba Ho Tape two or three years ago was very quiet, in which he showed versatility and acting skills. But the courage of this screening brain is certainly not for Bruce's first fans. I got too old for this sh17, or I'm part of Bruce's target audience no longer. I love this picture of positive kids 9 to 13 years old. But this enhanced Matinee Sci-Fi comedy has a striking moment of 5 minutes, and the rest of the kids' slopstick humor. Campbell would talk seriously with Sam Raimi√© and screaming together for the last Evil Dead reunion photo to get my brain back in my interest. At least there will be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry Bruce, it's not just spending for me. Take care.
