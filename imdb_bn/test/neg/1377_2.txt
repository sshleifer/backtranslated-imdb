Carlos is probably not the most real humor, but the first series was fun, his direct comments and observations were fresh. I missed a few seasons, but after all the accusations of theft, I took a few moments of Mensia Minne at the end of July 07. I saw a little change! There is much more between toilet humor and sexual jokes compared to observing the Carlos race. In one episode, he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappell. I do not think so. Perhaps comedy Central will give him another season, but the episodes I saw were tired and sound more sound than Osborne's. Carlos, stand-up for several years, get some fresh ingredients and try again.
