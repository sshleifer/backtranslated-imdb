While studying the difference between religion and culture in college, Mandi (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class, has massacred the students of Cassandra (Terrence Manning), Bailey (Glen Dean), Alex (Joel Michael) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) The study was done by their leader Wayne Quinnlin (Robert Barson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin found an ancient tableau of South China, which would give a huge force to him after the sacrifice of man, but a woman opposes and he is destroyed. However, after the death of Morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discovered that Quinlin came back and pursued his soul behind their souls. <br /> <br /> The story of 'Cult' is not completely bad. Unfortunately, the screen, direction, acting, line, camera, CGI and version are awful. I was totally bothered and lured to use the DVD's FF button, but I resisted and 90 minutes watched my life and never sat on Saturday night. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Amulto Secreto" ("Secret Skin")
