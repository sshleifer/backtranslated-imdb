They said David Davovini took six days to write the script of this movie. It seems right. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen Gogli. It's not as bad as the Gogli, but Saddam Hussein Adolf seems to be not as bad as Hitler. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He has been pretending to be French all this time. He revealed to his wife that he was actually American. For some reason, despite always commenting on her husband's American accent, it reveals Earth-blast for him. Also, their son - remember, he was born in France and never knew that his parents were America - without the hint of French accent, he spoke with the correct American English. This movie is just one of the many huge plot holes in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main boy in this film was the flashback of Tommy Young in New York City in the 1970s, because he explains why he has his wife hidden in France. His best friend as a boy was Papas, who was a very dangerous player by Robin Williams. I think Dovovini thinks that "bored" is someone who is not just stupid, because Papas sometimes goes silently, while another time he comes only as Robin Williams. Yes, Williams is actually fit with his tired impetuonic scent, though he can play mentally slowly. <br /> <br /> Tammy's mother, Dukovi's wife Tea Leni, played a pole-nailing patient, who was upset. Her husband is on the recent death. Leoni does a good job, but she mainly smokes and yells for things that Tommy does not seem very important at. Do not give her a lot of work with the script. Tommy made friends with a lady (whom he called "Lady") and advised him through his prison window (this detention room is called the "House of D" to make it short, thus the title). Tommy jumped loudly and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly that the city streets of the city. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole essence of the film, but the plot of the plot is abundant in this film which makes it very difficult to touch but comes as good, bad. Real bad The real is the real bad. At the end of this train's ruins, the script becomes Korean and Korea and ends with a ridiculously vague ending. <br /> <br /> Critics do "House of D" individually and justly. I really can not believe some people like this movie. It sits through a painful film and afterwards I feel weak - not from emotion, but how awful it was.
