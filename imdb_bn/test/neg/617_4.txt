'Felloni' is a B-movie There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look at the cast lineup, you may have some high expectations for their entertainment possibilities. This picture is filled with the wonderful character that you grew up, whose faces you can recognize immediately, although you probably do not know their names. It is astonishing that filmmakers could combine this project together, almost they decided to reunite B-Movie actors. There are really first-rate actors in Cast: David Warner, who will receive recognition from Titanic (though his favorite role in his time, Jack the Ripper at Time Behind Time) and Lance Henriken, who as many as bishops in 'Aliens' remember. These two actors have done some nice work in their long career and made some very fine films. <br /> <br /> However, these artists are not as well as impressive as their collection, their talents are not fully published on screen. The writers of 'Felloni' spent a lot of money in throwing a dream-party, and then a great factor missed their golden opportunity due to the general majority of all B-movies: A fool script. <br /> <br /> We start with a stupid premises. The bad guys are caught on a terrible murderer and they immediately follow the film crew to acquire videotapes and destroy the evidence. But honest, why bother? It takes time for the film to track the track, one thousand copies of the tape can be made and can be circulated on every law enforcement agency and media outlet. The perpetrators do not realize how vain their efforts are, and as they steal and destroy an original video tapes, they will solve the whole problem. Silence ... but I think if bad guys are so logical then there will be no movie. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is going on. It's sometimes stupid, sometimes cliche, and sometimes unbelievable ... everything that you expect from a movie is coming in all. Of course, I have always believed that strong performance material can overcome many weaknesses. In this cast, the performers have the ability to act firmly, and although many Cast members are not good actors, and in most cases have achieved B-Movie status, yet one can be optimistic that Cast will be able to infuse some life in their part. However, some actors in this movie are frustrated that they really think the film is enough to give their best shot. There is no clear inspiration in this performance, but again it is an irrelevant script. Now, I will admit that some of the cast colored actors direct to add a certain amount of pizzas in their line of delivery, but to be honest, the very best actors I mentioned earlier seem to be mostly discouraging and incompatible. <br /> <br / > <br /> I'm talking about the story ... even if the act is sufficiently qualified, the dialogue seems to be a little less sugar, yet from this incident T 'phelani "can not escape. That's the final mistake in his author's low-budget action movie script, which takes place pas: A conspiracy with many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can see this movie for a hundred times and you will not decide how to add everything yet. Trying to create suspicion and always guessing the audience, the author threw all kinds of surprise and unexpected twists in his script and ended up with a jigsaw puzzle, but when you are finished, you will see that pieces that are just missing that fit somewhere and others Will not be I appreciate a good thriller that guides me, but only creates existing plots twists for your confusion and is not compatible with the rest of the story. There were so many things that have never been explained that I finally felt very disappointed. If you decide to see it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I did not mention all other stupid issues about this film, but I would not be bothered. The interesting thing is that despite what I said, I must admit that I can not give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can not keep my finger properly, I actually thought the movie was a bit of a favorite. Silliness may actually be fun if you are in the mood for it. Plus, I really like some of these character actors, and although their performance is somewhat unthinkable considering their talents, I still came out to see them. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that I'm rating this film from a serious movie perspective. It's completely possible that I've missed the point completely. It may be that filmmakers intended to make B-movies. Maybe silliness is all completely deliberate. If this is the case, and if I could rate it on these terms, then I would have been told that 'Fellani' is a classic in the style of the tongue-in-cheek action flick. B-movie fans love to see their favorite actors together, get some chocolates from the script, and get entertainment with a healthy dose of guns, explosions and smugglers.
