The only reason I bought this DVD is that of Cynthia Rothrak. Because now everyone knows that she is the queen of martial arts films. The problem is not the martial arts movie. This stupid movie is about a minute or more battle scenes from the movie Rathoroke. Now if you were a filmmaker and you have a synthetic rathrak in your film then do you want to do a lot of martial arts? Everything that happened in this movie is like walking around, just as I was when I saw this pitch. I bought many of his movies and they bought all the movies, but at least there were some wonderful fighting scenes among them. Avoid no matter what a martial arts fan to avoid it. I'm still crazy I buy this DVD to waste 4 dollars
