I'm not sure why I do not like this picture so much. Maybe I'm too old or too male or too much Was the only target audience here? If you do it and you like it, I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit in a pill. Characters were outstanding and disrespectful, this script was simply embarrassing and some, though the acting was not fuzzy. Meccans, tiresome and sometimes boring - of course there is some good. <br /> <br /> A related topic: Why do I see Chris Klein in any film when I try to push him to a fool? Anyone else get that?
