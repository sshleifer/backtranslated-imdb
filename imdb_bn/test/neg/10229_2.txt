Also the title -> Magic Castle -> This one is stretched. Why bother? Why create another rockbook and then add another story line which does not have anything to do with Han Lake after playing it. Some of Rockbart's friends, books stolen from the forbidden industry and original characters (no voice). A continuation by this thread threaded from its bares. The next few things that you know of some birds are "forbidden art" and Tone Chapter 4 remembers: magical birds will be born. Please, the chapters have been closed down, but it will start but the bad end trilogy will be closed.
