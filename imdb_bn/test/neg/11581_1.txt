I can directly acknowledge that this is one of the worst films of my life. And it does not say anything, because when I look at the ugly movie itself, I feel myself a fan. But this is out of the bad. This movie is so awful that it does not have any fun, it's very bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible to review. There is no strong point and nothing positive to say. I'll just ramble about a couple of points sucked. First off, CGI is the worst I've seen. I could not believe that the film was not created in 2005, CGI thought of me that I saw 5 ways in Babylon when the CGI was new and fresh. It's poor out of faith. Secondly, actors think they are among the worst types of soap. And looking at their resume I see that I am right ... Thirdly, because of being able to reproduce a lot of reptiles, they did not match the other technologies invented in this film: a pistol to rebuild with infinite winds! Sincerely, Michael Perry shot 100-200 times without reloading to other scenes ... as was not enough, there were also planes to move shapes! At first they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scenario they are completely different and they are again F-16 in the third scene! For buying stock footage, please do not mix like this! <br /> <br /> Not really saying, but I think I'll stop. I'm telling everyone what I mean. Undoubtedly, I do not think this type of movie has been made. Ed Wood will do something like that. Completely ignorance, something does not care about ... it's almost amazing in all the horror. If I can give it 0/10 I want to, but 1/10 the lowest grade That's why it is.
