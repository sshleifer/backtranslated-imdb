I never thought I'd find out to say this: But I think "dog hunter dog" is more entertaining than the police drama of the 90's. Walker is very soft spoken and in reality a "CSC: Miami, and much more like" high-acrono "copy shows. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they are not good either. I like the carat chip action, which debates the Walker's trial foes and cast various castes like CSI series science technology. But there are some elements that I hate like this show. Table / Countertypes! Okay, stereotype / countertips! Unfortunately, this is a show for the Red Star America's moderators, who especially refuse to take part in the crime scene with the older generation. For example, there was an episode where a child with mental energy was admitted to Dallas where he met with children's groups in Goth / punk clothing and they started harassing him. now! The understanding of Central America Goth / Panke culture is exactly what it is. I mean, how often people think that looted clothes and theft from people just think of own business there. Whenever the platforms have blacks and latinoos, it's always in the neighboring neighborhoods of the gang. OK! Everyone who is not a minority is a great employer of crime, medicine, surrounded by poverty. Again, the Middle Red America America saw these people. Finally, why Trivate is explosive sidekick, do not you make Sidekick an equal donkey?
