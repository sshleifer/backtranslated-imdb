This image will not return to life for three hours stolen from me. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically incognito as a significant creative process of a cyclical drug trip. Want to know what they were doing when creating this image. <br /> <br /> This is also the most historically-incorrect film of existence; The incident happened in 2001 and went without any incident or prediction. <br /> <br /> Unlike the letters, the design is straightforward and only rambles without fixing or reasoning everything. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst of it: It should be thought-out, but the only thought of entering my mind is "what $ F * is going on?" <br /> <br /> I'll ask everyone for serious entertainment purposes, spend this movie fairly and choose a science fiction movie that does not stick to your $$$.
