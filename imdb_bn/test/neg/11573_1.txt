Within the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was one of the movie "The Place the Falas". The acting was terrible, the script was even worse. Who lets write these people, this kind of bad words for the movie to write Comodora themselves Russian midgate jets are a state of affairs with airplanes like jets, and pistols that can miraculously re-load 50-60 rounds without any re-loading, a bad story tale. At one point, comodo is killing special forces on the night, on the other hand, how they mean that comodos and cobras are cold blooded and do not come at night !!!! Although today's film industry has great effects, they were average for this low budget movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at what's saying, and eventually it's seen that any other wonderful movie can make bad. Shame Shem Shame, to create such a ray !!! <br /> <br /> This movie should be on the floor of the cutting room !!!
