I was sitting sitting in these slowest movies ever. After the introduction, some of our farmers were given backstory of "some" to kill, we are going to a farm that is familiar with a white hungry family - and nothing happens during a Luoyang. Then they help the farmer who met this drifter and hopes again for a very long time. Then the family girl had some plotty stuff. Then something else happens, the drifter goes nuts and the movie ends. Why did this family have to leave Beckup, in which she got some trouble in the girl and they had no money and it was so late that I could take care less about these sad people. I can not believe I actually went to this theater! This movie just did not suck, but some $$ holes have answered her cellphone, fools are making sounds and making the film suck. Why theater saak - Bad movie, too nasty food, and stupid in the theater, I stayed at home and watching DVDs from now on, at least I could have smiled if I saw this stupid movie. Stay at home and usually see some of these pieces in the thread, rather than going to a theater. Foolish stupid crap.
