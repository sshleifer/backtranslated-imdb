It was just a terrible movie. I saw it at the age of 12, I am 19 years old and I do not think I will forget this movie. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think I still feel ill, it was just maybe everything that is awesome in a movie that is awesome. I do not really understand what kind of garbage will enjoy. To enjoy this movie is not enough to stop your mind easily, I can enjoy the Disney movies of the free-to-live TV as next generation, but it's just something else. <br /> <br /> I usually I do not like to judge a movie until I saw it, but believe that I am giving you a favor. Do not watch this movie.
