What a boring movie Although it was a ridiculous part, it was just general and annoying (for the 90-minute film) I believe there was a lack of reason. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I thought white blood cells would fight against bad viruses, but there was no such fate. It was even more that the virus was wasted than being defeated. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
