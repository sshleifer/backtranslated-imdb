Romance Polansky is the most lavai-made-for-TV signal for the classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by the weird Stephen McHattie. The Rosemary (played by Patty Duck here) a Coin of the Duke, later again led by Minnie and Roman Castweets, preps the son of Satan for world dominance. It's not really scary and lighter years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, author Anthony Wilson and director Sam Ocean, a devil worshiping thriller screaming, a lot of candles and Ruth Gordon are trying to behave brutal and nasty at the same time. Gordon is the only holdover from the original. George Mahisis replaces John Cassettie as Guy, and has played Hammi Ray Milded Roman Cassettes, who has sabbing for the late Sydney Blackar. Newcomer McHatchy is the only real saving grace for the film. He looks really sinister without too much off the clitoris and even doing something. Charles Bernstein's music is fuzzy, but more used, it ends until it becomes ruthless rather than being effective. O'Steen, who edited the previous Polanski Masterpiece, shows no flash or subtlety.
