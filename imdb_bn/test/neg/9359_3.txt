I've heard something good about "Grace states" and have come out with an open mind. I thought that "the army of God" was right, and I thought that Duchess was probably as advanced as a filmmaker and mature. The film started acting a bit lazy, and I thought, "Well, maybe it'll be better." Unfortunately, it's not. The film starts with two elderly performers of Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the visitors will get to know them and take care of them. Instead, an unlikely series of unfortunate incidents (which are indefinitely, but rarely show a dwarf image) highlighting the obscure disdain by stories missionaries and it becomes almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The success of this movie is its successful success of its target audience. Miraculously and wrongly depicts the lives of the missionaries in Mormon, Ducar does not perform much more than the anger of the Mormon audience. In no way reflects the reality of the film. Nothing like listening to Mission Duchess (I've performed this Marmon mission myself) and in California the gang life must have occasionally more clear language than light inconsistency. <br /> <br /> Conclusion, which I encourage the audience to touch and trust them that apologies were available to everyone, both were incredible (Chamber, the whole mission collects this old man to send home - and the mother and the girl stand there Right next to each other!) And delicious. Next time, try to create a movie that Dunker may find.
