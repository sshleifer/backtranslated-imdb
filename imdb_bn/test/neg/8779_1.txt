I think this bomb is coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. An American Classic Reset with the help of modern day movie tactics. The original "Lone Ranger" client had a bit of a back of Murray's treatment. The statue has threatened legal steps if the Moor studio continues to depict itself as a real loan render. (Moore was working as a Lone Ranger for the sick children in children's hospitals.) Many American American Clayton was close to Moore; One and only lonely dyes. In my good behavior, I always felt that the studio could judge both the fans and the heirs of Punjab justice. Maybe a new movie is a canio. How was this case, and stay away in the many droves of the view. Also stories and acting were weaker. All this adds a big box office bomb, and so on. I am delighted to personally lose the big money after the way I am being treated with Lone Ranger. You do not behave in an American icon that way.
