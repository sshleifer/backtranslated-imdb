What a horror movie This movie was so gradual and it is very hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and was just confusing. I was watching it all the time, I was ending !! I felt that the second hour of my life was lost that I would never come back. Save your money and do not hire this movie. I now see why Sarah was just in Michelle Gella's movie. The first movie was great but this was just sucked. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer because it is only viewable with this movie This movie had no real story about it. I still wonder what I saw.
