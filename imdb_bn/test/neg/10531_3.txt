Steven Seagal has done some horror films, but probably his best after being drowned about ten years ago. Cast is better than normal, and when the story and plot is a total joke, at most, the action scenes look quite good. <br /> <br /> This picture is probably the worst in history. Someone is stolen because he stole some money? Some mercenaries sued the Supreme Court Judge? Their aim is to exchange the prisoner in exchange for a judge, so that they know where his money is? Meanwhile the Execution Chamber looks like a set from trap door and false floor and Cirque Du Soleil circus show. <br /> <br /> Then there is a problem of prison. Here, Warden Hommy, starring Tony Plana. All of the captives have their gang color and signs, and the guards have to serve food and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a bunch like fighting wars and prisoners while fighting some prisoners while watching the warden. What happened? Warden gives them a strict verdict. He can punish them later. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for laughing. However, Nea People looks pretty good, and H-Rule tries to be an action hero. Seeing most of the prisoners, everyone "makes the right thing" and performs surgery so that they can free the Supreme Court Judge from their detainees. Regardless of how bad the half-past dead may be, when you see it, remember that it is easily the best film that Steven Segel played under Seed in 1992.
