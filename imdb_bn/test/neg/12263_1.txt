I was not prone to ranting and was less than to start with my expectations, but how does it feel like a good idea? Because of your cameras, some of the big ugly friends and talent for the actors, you can not go out and make a movie. It should have been equivalent to fountain songs, that is, it has never been seen in the light of day. However, however, this garbage is found to be a distributor to help prevent it from limiting 4 ft cubicle by 3. It gets worse from the worst. To talk about a low budget, a person in a scene of torture digging coffee in a chair bound in a chair and getting coffee. Obviously this is very painful because the child is crying in pain ... maybe he has ordered Deccaf! Worse than acting wood (I could probably see a tree for 30 seconds, completely annoyed, if you can see this trash for this time, you are a better person than me!) And war scenes will be home to a kindergarten sport yard. If you do not enjoy pain, do not touch this film (in this case you should try to spread warm coffee on your own). I want to say it is very good, but it's really terrible.
