No Holds Barred This film from Arnold Schwarzenegger was great when you were in the 9th or 10th year of the movie. But when you grow up and see it, you feel embarrassed that it was so impossible to like it. You feel cheated, embarrassed, and stupid. If you have a younger brother and you show it to him and he will call you gay, take him a high five days and take him to the strip bar for his 11th birthday.
