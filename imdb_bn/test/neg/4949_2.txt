I just saw a forensic file marathon on the court TV. The episode was similar to the plot of this film, with the right-wing secret and sister-in-law subplot. I do not remember anyone based on the true genuine disclaimer, but it is written on the case. Apparently it gives details of Ruby Morris's actual genocide by her husband Earl, to 25 years in prison for her murder. Just to show you, may be unfamiliar with true fiction because I felt that the Lifetime Plot was compiled and more than "extended" without credibility. I am with other posters because acting was bad. Although I do not target it with the players, It's really the main character, girl, whose performance was bad.
