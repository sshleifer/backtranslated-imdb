It is surprising that some such people might find ways to visit. I knew it was by the Uwe Bowl, and I found it in the store's door box for $ 2 (still pretty, considered) but Majeed curiosity led me to see it and: <br /> <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure that these seven wrap-offs, Lamb's silence, and American psycho, all rolling in one, which is written by Apitara. <br /> <br /> 2) Caspar Van Deeen played the main character, and he is so weird and vague that only anyone will know that he can certainly be a crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3) Jennifer Rubin played a "good policeman", who invites serial killer in her apartment for home-cooked dinner and what does she get for her trouble? I let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4) Michael Perez is a "intense" police, who plays with a VW bug, a new style, which runs it with a siren. A VW bug ... that would scare the criminals' hearts when they come to see. <br /> <br /> 5) Van Deeen breaks with his drunk, but he still has a "not involved" party with "not a married cake". Everyone will be surprised to see that he (of course, he was invited) and they all shot. <br /> <br /> 6) Indeed, this # 1, has really been. This killer is known as "Monkey Maker". Without any doubt, the name of the stupid killer may come up to one million years. Possibly there is something to do with it, saying "do not show any recessions, do not listen to bad words, do not speak any evil". It is possible that monkeys have something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7) Oh yes, and there is a club that Van Deen roams in the beginning of the movie. Have bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and with a disciplined linkage cage, oh, gang members beat each other's crap with baseball bat? It looked like what. And of course, it only goes to ice-tips, really cool stuff (?!), Where some suspicious "actors" say to sign a confession before shooting some women, I guess, a snap movie? I'm not sure if this picture fits with the rest of the story and probably was not possible, so if he is not worried then I will not worry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will feel like watching something from a parallel universe-treatment. A parallel universe that KIND like us, but where things are not exactly where they seem to be right. You have entered "Bow Zone". Exit as soon as possible, and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2.
