An upcoming young story about a teenage boy rebel against the church and his minister father in a young Norwegian village. The countryside setting is beautiful, but the story is rather brutal and plodding, the film devoted most scriptures quoted. It's like watching a religious promotion movie. The Seasoning, who has just made another film, is commensurate as a sensitive young man, as a sequist of his harsh father and a woman as a woman who fascinated the season. The film aims to be fresh and charming, but it seems rather old and tired. Director and co-authored by Neshaim, who has worked on most of the TV, is not up to the task.
