When I saw the spirit in this movie, I was very sticky with girls. <br /> <br /> After a few years of anticipation, they gave the date of the liberation war of November 2005. Well, came November. And went. Followed by December. Oh, look, today's January 31, 2006. No US Released. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm very happy that I had a friend with a bootleg subtitle copy. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, Sig was superb. Not as good as expected, but near perfect. However, I cringed on the unusual movement created by children across the film. I thought we passed it now. Also, I do not really care to give anime look on their face. I was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look in the film, and still have a bigger character than most characters, especially girls' letters. Although they had their personality, I would give them. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not the big fan of anima, I'm still in the wild battle scene. They were nicely animated and were hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is mostly a bunch of hyper-styled war scenes. <br /> <br /> Epic A FF7 series was promised for several years. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of sign with a plot to excite us for just two hours of running time. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its complex stories, this film is short. You do not really know the characters. If you play the game, then most of what happened in the film was a way of understanding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have nothing more than the cloud "I will call if I need you, but perhaps I will not back the singers ". "And, to add to the injury, they had to cast each character separately to the cloud high and higher. Here this little part was so quietly close. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The comic relief that was fine for the game, but this movie. People do not act like a rigid war cartoon characters. They have removed their glory: <br /> <br /> and, spoiler (yes, well, you are probably more Part I already know,), who seems to be running the SD in the North Maoq: Part 1? Yes, now, with the picture, but with Sephiroth, that's right, he had 5 minutes of screen time, maybe that End Spoiler: P <br / > <br /> If this movie is made for fans then the way to go to the square. If you have any indication of the direction that the FF series is operating, I doubt that you are going to see most of my money. Mr. wonderful story and great characters to play your game. <br /> <br /> Some of you had the opportunity to epic. Something is really nice, a nice composition that confronted Disney Cze films. <br /> <br /> Instead of giving us a nice piece in the bottom to keep us together. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure the rest of the fans paused for a moment and only everything tried to concentrate but CJ knows what I mean. Well, I was losing this 5/10, but after thinking about fixing it, I gave it 3/10 because they could do better. They did well And it's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they want to rebuild some FFVII, they will first have to do it.
