I saw Ed Wood's biology many years ago. Tim Burton has paid tribute to this highly-steep but yet enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it actually lasted me. A silly story, kind of bad production value but still entertaining and even fun. <br /> <br /> then this. You can do it Well, since Wood is reported as a cross-dresser, it's amazing to see a movie related to it as a cartoon. Yes, there are some stabs to learn about the subject of the audience, but most of it is actually a slightly curved self-parody. <br /> <br /> One problem with this is its hundred points. On the one hand it is an application for tolerance. Illustrate transvestism as another disease. And finally, it tells the audience: "Well, if you are now sch sch, then wait until you see this!" The problem is that the film should be compromised with wood to create the film. When you see the opening title from the producer it can say in the meanwhile: Under the supervision of the person ... So, where we are. It is not a serious subject movie or an all-out schocker. <br /> <br /> The entertainment price has practically taken. Wooden voice-tightness is silent, but only because it is confusing. Although it was made in the 50's, one might argue that a brave film made a reference that even referred to the transvestite word. It comes against everything that is trying to argue against the film itself. Schock. Rape scenes, when it's light, just do it. <br /> <br /> so sorry. It is not a misfire but prejudice wood alone.
