This movie has one or two very interesting gags but they are not worth the wait. In the drive-in movie theater, two boys have an unknown argument in the selection, we have left a family! Hollywood and Driving Drives are voiced on informal dialogues as driving their camper driving van driving throughout the screen. At least I think it is effortlessly, the terrible song that mixes so loudly with this montage often introduces the undeclared conversation. <br /> <br /> Finally, a camper van arrives, at night, from the gas station where the family comes out, there is another unknown conversation before driving. The camera was able to reveal the actor then we played. He speaks directly to the camera and we realize that he is the director of the movie he is watching, and how he came to make films. <br /> <br /> A great idea that ALMOST (but not many) <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the same time we face two letters, at the beginning of the film, we got together with Peking Litter and they all made a movie picture. <br /> <br /> All the funny and weird comedy does not come because they keep the crew together and try to raise the cash needed to start filming. <br /> <br /> This movie was put together in a shoe string and a promise. And here's a nice little idea to struggle to get out but the death penalty is so perfect that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than just above things, and everybody (or shouted) once spoke. Most of the conversations here have been shouted out by several actors - Robert Olman can do such a thing well because he has a script, rehearsal, decent sound technology and editing facilities. Everyone shouted to a microphone, at its sound, was hidden in the dust of the next room, it is not for transparency.
