I think the movie is a low budget in most cases, but this is not a problem. The problem is, the movie is only LAM. It does not actually make much sense. Yes, it explains why things happen, but that does not mean I do. There was no reason for this. The movie is very slow. The last ice age was faster than it was. I also think they went a bit more in the murder. That meant they were not very fair, but the killer spent a lot of time hijacking his victim or hijacking his victim. Maybe I was young, but I just did not like the movie. The whole thing seems to be a lower version of "When a Newborn Call" version and it was probably the whole thing. But what's so For me "when killing a stranger" is a 4/10 *
