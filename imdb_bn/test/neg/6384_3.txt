I saw this movie and all were honestly quite frustrated. And in my opinion the lack of heart of this movie. I obviously did not know what was happening in the characters from the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of work there that they could not complete with the movie because they tried to be vague and had some deep comments about life, or did not try so hard. That is, the characters and stories lost all of it. I saw another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I think this movie felt the feeling of radioactive and heartlessness and I was surprised at what I was thinking at the point of view, or it was not a point in the film's point of view. To be honest, I did not feel like tearing my hair during the movie, I pardoned the lost time in the tragic picture. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that some people will love this movie, but I'm not really.
