This was an amazingly bad movie and I literally saw Blue Screen Dolls for the first time. Imagine any effect on the worst Blue Screen, make it worse, and then combine it with weak, rubber, and play-doh dolls that can see anything from a semi-preset pre-school art class. Then add some scary, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, Medico-metal guitar solos stuff that add too much and chronic way too long. The overall film is absolutely awful and look like "Feeders" like "Rashomon." Among the worst movies I've ever seen, each measurable metric gradually downsizing, a broken rest stop toilet is very much like a climate turd in perpetual, slow rolling. Nevertheless, a movie like "Actium Maximus" will not be missed by bad movie consuers, even if looking for clips on YouTube or elsewhere. If you can stomach a ride, this movie is a bit of an eye opener. I think this director may be mentally ill, though, which is a bit debasing. While discussing with him about the project, you understand that he really believes that he has created something nice. I think he is the Gonzo filmmakers "Star Ward Kids" What a mess :-)
