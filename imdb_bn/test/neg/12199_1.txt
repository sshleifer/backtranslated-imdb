Acting 10, script 1. The "Hughiburlly" theater comes from the unfortunate postmard school which has announced something like a story or plot. People may get away with this in stage, it becomes fatal in film or - at least deadly dull. That we're left with a bunch of great actors that spouting that conversation, when brilliantly written, adds nothing. Even worse, each character speaks with the same voice despite their background. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The geography attention is ridiculous. (Hint: The window in front of Sean Penn is about eight miles away from the window behind its window, and you can not drive to the south through Hollywood and pretend to be a gourandal bourbon.) All right, the suspension suspicion and all that - and usually I like They do not have to pay attention to the little things, because they are only production irregularities. But in spite of the Thespian piratics in the screen, they have stacked so much that the enterprise is saying a lot about the weakest element - script. <br /> <br /> In short, remove the video even from it. Ravi has chosen a wrong quote from Scottish play for his title; Hurlyburly has been named better "A story full of a fool, full of words and anger, nothing signals." Somewhat long for March, perhaps - but at least it will be honest advertising.
