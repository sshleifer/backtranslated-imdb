Before I started, a "slight" correction: IMDB said that Richard Gere's 180 cm long. Wrong! I went to her side 10 years ago, and she could not be a teenager greater than 165. I was 183 years old, and he looked like a child next to me. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be "Wheatlands"; Malick's previous (and better) movie "Badlands" is an appropriate title complementing. This film shows that all directors are not the main purpose of entertainment. Indeed, some of them are as the main objectives of showing all their minor wheat. <br /> <br /> This movie is relatively uninterrupted with the sad and unexpected tragic end. There is nothing more than an average and anticipated love triangle, but the movie does not survive with two-thirds of men in triangle. Be appreciated for its visual quality; Though it feels realistic 70, there is a limit to how to make it in seedland. You can shoot them with 1500 mm camera, for all that I care about, but they are still in the field of wheat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Brooke Adams" . But for those who show all the glorious colors in a field of wheat, see more: You've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biography" Richard Cerr and other Hollywood intellectuals heavyweights, please contact me by email.
