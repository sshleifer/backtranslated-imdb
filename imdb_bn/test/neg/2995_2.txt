I should live this picture, but I do not. It won international awards, it is foreign (I usually like this type of movie) It is going on slowly (again I like) and there is no illogical sex or violence in it. The problem is annoying. Two of our friends from the same village in Turkey are "successful" and not another. The failed man comes to Istanbul to stay in the sea for a better job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br I did not see anything new added to this tired theme. Someone is standing tall and looking at the sea or watching a coffee shop or watching TV. I understand that such things are to show their love for it, even though it got the idea in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Floating around his death. When they are not clear, the symbols are best, but there, in the background, create a mood compared to the audience's awareness. <br /> <br /> This film is so indifferent that it does not score a score of 1, so I give it a 2. Being a rated one takes a genius. This image was not so powerful.
