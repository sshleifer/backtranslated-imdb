I like most movies and I'm a big fan of San Bienne, so I thought I would love this movie at least. Also, I'm Canadian and it's mostly Canadian film so I was ready to spend some serious slack for it. "Garbage" that might have prepared me nothing for garbage. Steve Gutenberg as an Action Hero? Give me a break. The performance of the movie was so bad that sleeping tonight is having problems. Now I have two wishes in my life <br /> 1. I hope you will not sit through this movie. 2. I want to be 6 hours ago Oh wait, the movie is 2 hours less - it took just 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. Seriously
