Not bad performance. Hoopi plays a very good / warm role. Still, the storyline and the circumstances can not be believed (compulsive PC stereotypes). At times it is good Jewish and blacks versus evil devil Christians (ho-hum). Imagine a common Hollywood. The movie is at its moment, but it is not that I recommend watching your way.
