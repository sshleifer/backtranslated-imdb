I know when I like this movie 12-14 years old. Now I'm not 24, I have seen it again, and I did not want that I'm not even me. Because when I was young I laughed, and I have no fun. So an hour and a half without fun. The joke for me was a shame, funny or very young. So when I liked my childhood movie, I do not like those things now. Besides being not funny it is not actually believable. The evil character is done very badly, but I guess that's what kind of movie it is. And the last 20 minutes of the film is quite long about the continuity of the fight and so ... but if you're young, you probably love it. I rated this movie 4/10
