There is no one else than that, why Miles did badly by O'Cafe. Surprisingly, the mystery science theater was broken into pieces by piece to pieces, and it was unfortunate to sit through this Turkish. I'm very happy and recommend checking the MST3K version from one of its best episodes. <br /> <br /> Its original movie is basically a B-movie crude, which is becoming the Italian film makers slow since mid-80. This film was apparently made for cash in Canaan crash, but it failed miserably on all calculations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " />
