This film is really closed when a poor little boy is set by the barbarian dog pack. After a period of time, he is saved by a grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We then introduced a stranger to the annoying house mates, of which there is a tart that is always half dressed. At this stage, the film raised my tension about the strange "Polinki Pinky" background sound which was at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen the strange animals were going around grunting things and killing things. A word of advice if you are ever stuck in your home with some nutrition - get some cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we dropped half of the film, because it was completely strange or memorable, we now have a stunning conclusion, that the last surviving creature has a "whip dual" with the grandfather and his magic whip. I will not say what's going on here, but I can say that the whip is full of tension, airy fights, split-level fights and all types of plays. <br /> <br /> I'm going to cover this movie now. I do not like the door of a neighbor.
