I used to read why my caged bird in the English class sang and we saw the movie after finishing. After watching the movie, I'm sorry to see you. It was completely influenced by the books taking away anyway. The scenes did not give any sense to their sequences, the act was terrible, and it seems that the screen writer did not really pick the book, but chose the arch for notes. I was angry about how the movie ends. Almost half of the books were cut off and as a person, some aspects were very important for Maya's rise. If you read ... Caged bird, this film will destroy the book's experience so I warn you not to see it.
