A virtual carbon copy of the cave preserves the low budget impact and slightly different plots. I knew the movie was flying when I saw Flickr Flickering Flame False Camphor clearly reflected in a close face of the actors. Contradictions in character and sub-surface did not serve any purpose, and added nothing to the film except for a short moment of silence. Acting was not as bad as ordinary B movies, and their fears had some credibility, but as professional cavers, they seem very emotionally unstable for their chosen profession. It is not worth noting that the total rental of 4.50 dollars is not worth it.
