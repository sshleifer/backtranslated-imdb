You know, this is one of the "Emperor's new clothes" movies. It's such a wall, and weird that if you really like it, you really are in the movie. Well, I think it's a bunch of conversations. This kind of film that hides behind my grandfather or spirituality makes me nuts. Some people have this bad dream, probably before going to bed, the conversation above has been properly taken by eating, it mostly thinks (unfortunately) and then it keeps on filming and we all want to be surprised by their creative talent. I sometimes have a wonderful dream, sometimes, it does not create any sense, but I do not feel the need to keep them in the film, publish them to others and call the industry. Curiosity, itself, is not something interesting to mean. There is some purpose and intellectual thinking behind the true grandfather or spiritual expression. If other people do not find it, it does not make it deep, it simply makes it stagnant. Seamless for the wicked, for me, not good, let alone great, art. And compared to "Trivulla" with "Delitysen" is not the same league in "The Godfather First and Second" to "The Godfather III".
