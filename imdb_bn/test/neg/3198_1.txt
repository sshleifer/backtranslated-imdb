Anyone thinks this picture is great, strictly need to see their heads. It hit me that this image was made as a joke. It has no good points. The price of the prop is about $ 10 and the whole set seems to be that it can fall any time. Why is such a movie made in the first place? These two were the most annoying characters that I came across at the young age of Spaceship and the Redneck of the Twentieth Century. This image is almost as bad as "talismanic talent" Vanilla "misunderstandings" as the "Cool A Ice" as the Ice Star.
