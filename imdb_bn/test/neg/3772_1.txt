This film is part of an incredibly self-motivated character which assumes that the mere impression of a story is as real story. It was very painful to see and because of John Travolta and positive buzz, I began to laugh loudly aloud to buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and heavy (and authentic, heavy hand) seems to depend on the characteristic. There is an isolated scene between Purslane and Bobby Long where a TV is destroyed, when out, incredibly flaccid and sick time. <br /> <br /> I found myself less and less caring about the characters. I saw it. It was probably very interesting, according to film-school, to create it. But it is very annoying to see it boring. An induced and provocative film school project should not waste money on you.
