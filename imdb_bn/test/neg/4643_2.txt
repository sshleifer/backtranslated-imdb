I know that the full moon, or any movie studio, was fun and the Chess scientists could never recover the feeling that was the original 'transeur'. And instead of Los Angeles, with the last two entries in Jack Dethan's series during the medieval period, it became quite clear that there was really little hope for the transition series. Breathing a new life in one picture is one thing, but our main character is out of its element and keeping it in the past, it does not work! So with Transars 6 now, the whole moon has given so much new life to the series that we can not make any agreement with Jack Death. We are now his daughter, Joe. Jack will go into his body and past and the trancers will have to fight once more. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> But it's not Tim Thompson. It lets its clips and sound bytes rotate together (believe me, you can strang together) to horribly deliver the last audience of true Jack Death. And from this point, things just go down the hill. This girl, Jack Death as our main character, is the worst idea in the world because of Jack Doth being supposed to be in her body. This cute young woman is not the right track to act as a rough and difficult person! It does not work and it really stops like stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to special effects and makeup because most of the reading means that the full moon has gone: really, really, the low budget enterprise. I do not know what I will say about this movie, except that I want to be completely like the full Moon like Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trance Days. 1. After that, special effects were not good, but to tell stories. They have created serious B-movies for serious B movies and horror fans, and this is not just new full moon studio. I'm good for the day 'ol, and really hope that the full moon can drag themselves from this horrible smoke that they are okay now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
