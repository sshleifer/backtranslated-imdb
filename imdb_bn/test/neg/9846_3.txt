This movie, one word, was terrible. It was boring, anticipated, and cruel, weird. I was waiting to finish it and when I did it, I was scared. At least my mouth left a bad taste. Anyone interested in movies about liberal women's sexuality, my advice: stay away from this movie. Such films give a bad name to the classic named Lolita.
