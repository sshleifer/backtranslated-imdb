In one year, when "Singin in the Rain" and "Hi Noon" were released, this fantastic turkey has won an Oscar for the best picture anyway. Half of the pictures are nothing more than circus performance. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Both Houston and the Wald are identical, though they are a boring model compared to the annoying Hutton. Playing a self centered tragedy artist, Hutton works like a very high school student in a badly produced school game. Grahame is the only cast member to launch a decent performance Demille has no interest in telling a good story, only made an overlong spectacular, how stupid matter.
