There really is nothing to say about this. It's just really, really bad. Bad acting, bad scripts, and editing is probably one of the worst jobs. It's so drunk and sticky that it only works to confuse the audience. Plotting to talk is not a real issue, most of it is a real fake looking demon fish invading Europeans trying to pass themselves like Americans. Pass this one.
