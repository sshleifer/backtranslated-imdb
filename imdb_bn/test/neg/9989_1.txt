This is a rare sensation that is so shameful to come across a movie that you feel like turning away from the screen. But when you see a great actor surrounded by nude by Sir John Gilgood, then copulating couples to do what you want to do. Add Peter O'houle as syphilis-rydid emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, who raises his fingers on a man's anus, and you start grateful that Kaligula is the only interested in adultery for the sick / insulting movies. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays the life of the infamous Roman Emperor Kaligula (McDowell), a very annoying person whose story is told by sexual violence, frustration, betrayal, murder, cruel connection and lesbian sex scene. <br /> <br /> Although Kaligula was completely crazy in real life and probably wanders more frequently than his base motivations, the film is still unreasonable dirty. The sex of the film is not used as an aspect in a versatile story - the story is about gender After a while, all the nudity, hip lips and nipple became barefaced due to sheer repeated repetition. Performance is completely illiterate, especially McDowell, who takes precautions in the air and gives a performance of all wildlife posting. The O'Connell script seems to be considering it with his credentials (surely he is in it for money?!). The rumor spreads that additional pornographic scenes have been added without the consent of the producer during the post production, but there really is not one minute in the kaligals, which are honorable or disciplined. It is doubtful that during this time, talent and money will sometimes be thrown into a pornographic movie, so in this sense, Caligula is a kind of experience ... On the other hand, it is so horrendous that perhaps it is a blessing in the disguise of a "different" thing.
