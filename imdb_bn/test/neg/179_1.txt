Beavis and Butthead did this movie? It's just that bad. In fact, an incompatible and misinterpretation of "bad" versus "good" in the wine world. Have you noticed that individual filmmakers have tried any wine for personal safeguards of wine and terori. The camera work is going on very well when the content can keep you awake long ago. This is not insightful journalism. What I found from this movie is that the filmmakers are trying hard to highlight a world of wine worldwide, for example, the owners of Mandvi family owned winners in all parts of the world. OK, that's a good start. So, how to compare this wine? Mondavi Napa cab does not taste like their Italian wine. We never find out because nobody comments in this picture. Instead, there are many innuendo about Nazi and fascism. Well, those things do not grow grapes. Hmmmm.
