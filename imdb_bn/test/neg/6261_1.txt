A movie like this praises me for the achievements of professional actors. I think film-genres are usually very tough for professional actors and they are ready to stop them for the smallest reasons. Just watch for a few minutes "Charler's Genocide", and believe me, you will change your opinion. A weird actor will be a compliment to these non-talented actors. But then again, it's a Jim Wynorski film. Winrosky is the popular director of this very low budget B-movies (has worked with Roger Krrmann on several occasions). The problem of this movie actually tries to develop a plot. And when you are providing an actor line they are reading an eye chart, how should I care? Wynorski's "bare Wench 2," he did not try to develop a plot. He simply tried to take a softcore porn / spying on "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and it was titled. "Cheerleader Masscare" is no fun. A couple have mandatory female nude scenes, but they are few and far away. So it's not even worth enjoying a erotic level. I must say, the worst scenario is the one where Nikki Fritz is walking across a bridge that is going to break. First of all, its character does not have to walk across that bridge. Secondly, the bridge started cracking, instead of trying to run it across, he stood there and worked helplessly. And top off it, we do not actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers are ready for this $ 2 budget !!! Contrary to many B-horror movies, it's actually boring. And that makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few brilliant stains was that of John Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly half of the order is not). He was funny in "Bare Winch 2" and there was some interesting scene in this movie too.
