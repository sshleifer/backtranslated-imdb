The main problems of 'show' are related to extraordinary script errors, which will only be postponed to a standalone audience. The main question is, what is the purpose of lying in the middle of the artery? The film tries to demonstrate that the purpose of the murderer is to cause evil and destruction in his prey, he loves to live the lives of other people, and loves to feel over their fears and skills. So why does he pretend to be dead only in two major characters? An extraordinary illness: Can a person die for more than one or two hours without a single muscle or even without breathing to find two men in the same house? Without the ultimate (D) effect of the film, it does not understand all this. And if the killer always seems to have control with the plot and it is not possible to tell lies like a dead body. Finally, it does not work. The right place for the murderers should be a dark and untouched shadow behind the false shadow (male nurse), but not under the white room. The look of the director's murder and perhaps the hidden site should not be shown. Then, the film will be a pretty good thriller. However, 'show' is just a fiasco. Hitako, please come back.
