This movie is just shit, I can not do it differently. Since the very beginning someone knows that she will be desperate. <br /> <br /> Story, conversation, acting, special effects, make-up, sucks quite a lot. I like the movie Vampire and I know they will never win an Oscar, but it's not worth watching, I can not believe how anyone created this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's about a dream / reality experience. The film's development is incompatible, the motivation of characters ... does not exist, everything seems to be a big joke. Probably what they tried to do, but I doubt sincerely. I want them to try what they tried but it only turned back, it is definitely one of the worst movies in my life (and I saw a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to it) Please make yourself please and do not see this. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's full of clich√©s! Bad 2 bad script, bad directions, bad cinematography Freshly 3 I bothered to comment on this as the opinion of everyone.
