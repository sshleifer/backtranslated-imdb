I do not even see this whole movie. Now, I like the 50's Saifai-Fi movies, even when they did not get it wrong, it just bothered me. One thing, a member of the spaceship talks and performances crew could become a tenth grade. He must be a bowling league, he sounds like he does not have a space ship. The scope of the window of the spaceship is surprising in the world and this barbarism says, 'Can you see Brooklyn?' And the other guy is saying 'sure'. And said, G, I wonder who is pitching? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take me back! Creu crew crew crew and not one of the better moments of the film screaming from G-forces skin during radioactivity. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie can be characterized by a big "end" on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also find that they can not open the hect because the 'bob' has done Greece in front of them. Taking off. Of course, going to be 'greased' by a spaceship crew member, we never learned before that there was never a space suit and did not know anything about zero gravity. Overrived fat cartoon duck as Baby Huey once said, "That's the logical sound!" No-gravity-the effects of space are so bad that it is painful to watch. (Everyone knows, everything goes to UP in the absence of gravity.) <br /> <br /> How does this movie get more than 6.3 out of 10, when other super-high films do not give any high rate, it is a mystery. I really like the old science-fi movie, but this is not realistic, and the hair tries to humor the character by throwing it into a pit from a gas station. Greece's hole does not work - it only destroys the film. I think the opposite seems like I do not hate the whole movie that 'stupid' is clearly not the one who will be in the ship - even in 'heel in the summer.' God I wonder if he too checks the fan belt. Maybe they can leave 'warmth' from the trip, but it can not be very excited. Even so, it is only average. Everyone is disturbed by what everyone else, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see the space movie of 1950? It all beats for hacking 'rocketship x-m' Maybe not too much 'reality', but rather more serious stories and less stupid characters.
