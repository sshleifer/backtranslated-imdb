The film's plot seems to have been built from a wicked dream. There is not enough reality to keep the audience interested. The Vermont Farm scene failed to show the way to establish farms and the farm families were attractive and entertaining. In the course of whiskey bootlogging trade there was little if no research. Canadian clothing saw something completely incredible from the French Revolution. The warm game was good and during the time, Christ's momentum was incredible to imagine. An interpretation was the mystery of the owl's appearance and the invisible train in the thin air was too high. I could not understand how a live trout was frozen in the ice and why would bread give two people trout, a good food source without food.
