I'm going to see this picture is a big mistake. I think the lottery is going to see the movie. After five minutes you knew that it was going to be an impersonation, and I've struggled hard to stay in my seat - feeling the loss of the old "two hours of your life". <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that, without even mentioning the complete "historical accuracy" thread of the review, the script is achingly, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes can be spread for one hour to give a validity, real, development of the plot. Instead, it lurched from an obsolete "dramatic" incident to the next. The girl does not cry at the beginning of the film, because at this time the audience has no emotional attachment. And finally, going through the field of tall grass in the sunset, what was it? <br /> <br /> Even the nice Ed Harris could not protect it. He often felt his pain in some line of speech. The most impressive one was the most terrible one, for any apparent reason, she saw the girl copying her work in her apartment, she saw it all a bit vague romantic style - a light (or I dreaming), and she said, with her voice to the authorities < br /> <br /> "Wash m." <br /> <br /> She got up and washed her with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? It's ridiculous <br /> <br /> And then there was music. A long extended session when it only manages Beethoven and the sound surrounding the 9th Symphony film and the singers were waiting for a wait, waiting, waiting for what it looks like forever. And then, finally, start in huge words. It was spine-coolly surprising and I dare say it, it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> So where the film pick up two big stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven wanted to say right. <br /> <br /> and I believe in him.
