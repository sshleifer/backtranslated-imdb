Potential spinner Peter Jackson has shown so brightly in his 'Lord of the Rings' triangle, it is possible to have good films, even great people, in the heroic fantasy genre. This series distinguishes literary ancestors, medieval chin romance, especially Arthurian legends, on whom Tokianian and other writers draw. However, it is difficult to think of any other 'sword of lord' as a sword-magic-magician. I would agree with the critics who said that the bad bad part was Ron Howard's 'Willow', and even against a positive bad, he made a slight difference as a mere medieval film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Golda comes from 'Ring of Lords'. A wicked ruler tries to achieve an array of powers with supernatural power to achieve the ambition of world domination, but a group of heirs is destroyed by the group. The film set in the Hiburian era begins with a barbarian era in the distant past of the world, with the arches of wicked Queen Gander, which makes heroine Sona unreasonable sexual advances. When these were rebelled, Graden responded by killing Son's parents and brother without giving a woman's name to answer. (In 1985 it was probably not considered as a political fame, rather to build the main villain as a woman, rather, for the purpose of homosexual purposes for her Wilen's disappointment). <br /> <br /> Talisman blames a kind of fluorescent green football ball with magic power, protecting the female priesthood with a fully protected garment, as they are going to destroy, Similarly, they think that his power has become very dangerous. Sonja sister of the dead, her only surviving relative Sonja herself was not inactive, but she wrote in the martial arts academy, from which she graduated Sama Kam Ladd and took revenge on herself. He is the king of the most gallant sword with Collider, who is in Agnar of Tokyo, the princess train, the deprived child-ruler of the state, which has fallen into the power of Gerrena, and like the Falcon, Lover's Loyal servant. The rest of the picture is fairly predictable, because Sonja and her colleagues are trying to overthrow Zidane and try to resist the destruction of the world threatened by uncontrolled Talisman. <br /> <br /> What does this do? The film is so bad? Well, to start acting. As Kaldero, Arnold Schwarzenegger is usually done with heavy foreign vocabulary, at least in the first part of his career, as the wooden, poker-facing performance that became his trademark. When compared to Bridget Nielsen as heroin, he looked like Lawrence Olivia. Miss Nilson seems to be a worse language than even learning languages, to whom each curriculum is provided by the mechanical, uninterrupted voice of the curriculum-text-English-syllabus curriculum sent only three. Arne looks better than a marvel. While other characters do not manage their own personal struggles against the English language, only cartoon characters, especially Prince Turn, who will ever be one of the most appealing screen youngsters. Worse error worse than the <br /> <br />, however, almost complete lack of imagination of the film. This is especially a great result in a fantasy movie, because these genre films should rely on their imaginative energy so that the audience can suspend the normal feelings of disbelief, which will be triggered by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's best essay, at least for the next three hours we can admit that we are in the Middle World, that intelligence, wizard and habit exists, and the fate of the world is a magic ring depending on the destruction itself. When we see 'Red Sonaza', we can not understand anything, except that we are seeing a clash of actors with each other in a bad way to take control of hair-green football with each other. The lack of <br /> <br /> starts with even the film's title. When British science fiction writer Brian Eledis challenged his foreign names given to his characters, he replied that in the form of a fantastic alien society, there was a little bit of your own individual culture, if you were the hero Joe. (Confessed, tokianan <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Likewise, the heroine of a story, apparently in a barbarous era, is named after a common girl named 'Sonia' (in the same way that the name 'Sujaj' is pronounced) is called 'Beti' or 'Mary-Zen' <br /> <br /> This picture is too short It seems to have been made in the budget, which makes me wonder why they are upset about it. Imagination guarantees need to be done, or not all. It was definitely shot in a remote mountain area, with no effort to offer little or no special culture. We see that some buildings, such as the temple of the palace of Talishman or Gaiden, are probably the cheapest set. We learn that using Torrman's power, the city of Toran has been destroyed by Guer√©n, but we do not really see this phenomenon; All we see is what can be a thunderstorm on the other side of a hill. At first you think how Sonia wanted to overthrow the entire kingdom with the only empire, but when you see how small the army was, then it became more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you will be surprised that Toulishman or only a crew member is risky against the set in an illiterate task. If we can not enjoy this movie anything else, at least we can enjoy it for its absurd humor; An excellent example of filmmaker-funny school. Ed Wood will be proud of this one. If it is shown in the night's election before listening to California's television, Gray Davis will still be the governor. 2/10.
