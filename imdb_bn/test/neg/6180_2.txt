Here's "The Slater Rule:" <br /> <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Cla Dual, and David Morse have all given great acting. Gosling, as always, excellent yarn is remarkable. Locals are often exciting. <br /> <br /> "The Butcher Forul" here: "<br /> <br />" The script is horrific muddled. And I can definitely appreciate a non-"good" movie, this movie is just boring. Great performance can not be made for a stupid premiere and a movie for a script that is filled with throwing lines that often do not understand. Just roam through the first hour. <br /> <br /> I got stuck due to the bathing, but eventually I changed the channel on my own. Here Spoilers relayed my last. I miss a lot. Do yourself a favor - see "Believers" if you want a good pink flick. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10
