Stay away from Pontiflu's best bits and it's 28 days managed to ignore them. Creepy time to copy them. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got a growing tenser, this just stinks. Radio DJ, "We must stay in the air" does not spend any time in the air efficiently. She sat down at her and watch TV for the news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie. Is there a person in the US or a world that does not know which zombie? Or have you ever heard the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute, this muffy cluster is still addressed as jammy, "infected ones" or "rabbis". A guest can appear after the word "Zombie", I can take care less. Perhaps there is a copyright where you have to give some words to use? Bluetooth earphones are called "ear-stuff", I do not kid you! To finish, no plot + no acting = no careful. Waste time, shameless, poor execution.
