I felt like I shouted from the theater, so I felt, but I stopped myself. Yes acting was great, this is not usually Hollywood film, but the dialogue will not just end (or get interesting)! And despite all gabbing, you really do not really know or care about any of the characters. I certainly saw most annoying films from Spiers, but I hope that it will be annoying. I had to sit through it, but please, keep yourself up
