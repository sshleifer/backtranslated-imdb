"New Hope for Roman Movie" ... if it is a new hope, I do not really want to see such a great movie-defining hero (Romanian cinema). Now seriously, where do I start? 1. Random Scenes: Are you kidding me, it is also not believable that it is a high level of stupidity 2. 2. Direction: Which direction? This movie was stressful, at least, since they decided to look as trashy as soon as possible. All right, I admit, no Polanski, Hitcoak, Ficacar or Lynch (may be listed) by Radu Munthan, but at least the minimum effort would be appreciated. 3. Language: OK, I do not understand why (almost) every single Romanian director believes that if you think the movie is as tragic and obscene, then you have art. I do not think of the quality of the clear language or the bad picture until the final results fit it. In this case, it's not. There is nothing to comment on, since this movie has already been told thousands of times, the letters are depicted to be very memorable memorable, that "threatening events" can also happen, are poorly depicted and become unimportant. This movie only relies on self-motivated emotions, "we must" Someone was found murdered, so we are "sorry", afraid or scared, feel that someone has become like this and so "definitely of us" must definitely feel certain. That's baloney Because a movie is a part of the imagination, there is nothing for the reality here. So your only real emotions will be discovered when you are in the deepest of the Earth (<br /> <br /> * <br /> * / * * * * *
