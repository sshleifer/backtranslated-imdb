Seeing the documentary of Lucino Vicente's Carlo Lijani, I was in high expectations before seeing this image of Adam Lo three years later. But the viewers like me became dissatisfied ... I faced the need of critical opinion, which I usually did not give because of a documentary that would satisfy every audience. There is no documentary that will fully examine a theme. But when I read the written reviews already in this title, I felt a little confused. People never know how to criticize. So, to be clear, I'll split this movie into two main sections which are significantly different: one previous director before and after his career, about the director of the Wiki <br /> <br /> The comfortable background, all hobbies, young Lucino experience and enjoyable resources are clearly presented. As well as his efforts in horse racing, his relationship with his mother was so annoying after his parents' divorce. We got a very correct idea of ​​highlighting Lukanoo as the real calculation: In real arteroccasses, the capital is cooked with nanis, with access to everything. For example, Gregory and his wonderful villas proved to be the excellent villas of his father. He insisted on Viscounty's important visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met prominent people ("left winger"), who later influenced his style and industry message. It clearly illustrates the idea of ​​imperialist ideas about the emergence of noble rise (contrary to the first view). <br /> <br /> However, the part of his director's career, which began with the Oscion in WWII, and in 1976 the director died before the death, just before the death, he was severely executed. His movie is not well discussed. Why? Because there are really few people who have to really say something. Franco Jefferrlie, director, remembers El Terra Tramer's work and it's okay. There are some interviews with French Rojie. But later, films such as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like his interview. Moreover, some of the thoughts he has expressed are not right to be associated with a documentary ... Not to mention the remarkable work of Wisconsin, such as Conservation Pies, there is no interview with prominent caste Bart Lancaster. Should also be mentioned about Silvana Mongo and Romi Skenader. There is a footage interview with Maria Callas that appears interesting but that's only a short bit. Franco Jefferrlie, although I admire him as a director, it is not really worth saying anything. For example, he mentioned how Visconti separated from him after the service of the year. Therefore, I say: Simplified and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I found a strong point here, it was a footage interview with Visconti. As a result, we can get his own opinion about his work. For example, I am so grateful to talk about death as natural as normal section of life and birth as birth. She discusses her health problems after stroke while filming Ludwig. <br /> <br /> I believe this logo is good for Lukino Vicente (1999) by Carlo Lijani. Although it is completely short and narrow, you get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti became very excited about him and his naturally the views of man's emotions and stones ... 4/10
