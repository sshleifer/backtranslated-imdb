The high blood pressure women's track star dies after coach George Michaels (Christopher George plays him as the main but-head who plays the role of a sportsman under his watch). After going to school, he will go to the campard, to provide Flick with his intention as a possible killer. Some of the psycho-cycloths in sweat (which is often the same as Michael is seen), using the stop clock during his execution, the track team members were part of the dead female runner to the killer. Immediately disturbed parents told Principal GoogleLealen (Michael Pataki) why their children did not come home after a promotion. Inspector Holiday (Carmen Argenio) revolves around the campus on the request of the concerned parent. After a gymnast body in a locker immediately became a major suspect in a wretched Michaels. Ensign Anne (Patch McKenzie) returns home from her base in Guam to get her dead track sister's diploma and soon she encounters murder in the climatic Chase scene. Kevin Badger (E. Danny Murphy) is a tired lover of lost track star. <br /> <br /> Instead of retired place slash, it is trying to tear out the order of death and fails to fail in a fair manner. Low-quality kill sequences only increase laughter, such as a football player thrown into the stomach or a pair of insertions, which takes a poor soul leap. Linnea Quigley has an impressive role as horny student Dolores who sleep with her music teacher for a high grade and always after a male stud (garden party shears the recipient's prom team has Dolores bed out there before). There is an introductory introduction to Van White, which reveals the body of dead gymnasts in the locker. Virgil Fry has a stupid role as an incompetent officer.
