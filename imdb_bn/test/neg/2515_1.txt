How dare you? Adam Low, clearly without shame, this fake keeps his name for respect. This is not a serious research or analysis or commentary on the work of the great Visconti. Yes it is long and clear, yes we have some nice clips that are interested in these movies, most of them already have seen. But leaving the most lasting impression is the longest feeling of what is gossip. The last and loud ally comes from the German actor, ranting and raving third rates. Sufficient Creator Mr.Low has instructed that, I imagine that to get a better rating than his ratings earlier than that, but the fatal boring documentary in Kurosawa. Well you have news for Mr. Lo and your colleagues. You miss a great opportunity and I will not give you another, for one.
