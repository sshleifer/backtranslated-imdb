It will take so much time to evaluate such a bad movie that I am surprised to see it. There was some truth in the beginning (the film). Partition "AF" started in 1943 when two Communist pilots of Croight Eustati AF were merged with their observers at Bregte 19 and Potsez 33, respectively. The plane saw some steps in the stuffing and hand-bomb attacks, but did not last long. A crew died and the other survived, the pilot was killed in a spitfire VC flying. The original partition squadrons were established when RAFT separated the two (Yugoslav Squadron) ICEC's Hitniken ICT operated by the Spitzfire VC and the Royal Royal Air Force pilots, and allocated them to the Tito forces on Vis Island. Even those who were never involved in the wind movement from the air, but strictly for ground support. So the film was a giant beef, kept it lightly, and the minimum point for it, otherwise all bad, the director. By fate of some quirk I was present in filming the last sequence of films, while most German air wrecks (Yugoslav 522 instructors, flying sequences were also used) at the military airport at the Mustache. Pyrotechnics were impressive, and the scoop film was hugely served by the crew even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and frequent fun by contemporary audience.
