I can not even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (when I'm in the movie I'm an excellent guy). Just another big budget-made-to-something-like-mind-lot-many. It's not even awesome. The great films that did not reach the big screen then revolted and then came ... "The thing" to cheat the movie fans. I think that the big producer wants to create. <br /> <br /> Just a big producer, hot girl (though awesome actress) and a ton of terrible movie clich√©s and cook it for a week and you get "salted". <br /> <br /> And I thought bad boys were 2 terrible !!!!
