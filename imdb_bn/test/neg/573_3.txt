It's a movie about people getting a love letter. Nobody knows who sent it and nobody knows for whom it is. A good cast led by Kate Capso, Tom Seleck and Ellen DeGeneer. This, however, is a complete dopey plot. For example, the leading citizen of a small city in New England, the Capo character brings a strange college student working in his bookstore in the summer. He instead loves Tom Selek, who fire him in the city fire-mad about him. I do not know if it is not in the absence of foolhardiness. This picture is an example of how DOPI is. It is a pleasure to see Kate Capo Jog, but you immediately realize that he never provided one day of his life. Another is clearly Dopi part of the film Dopi.
