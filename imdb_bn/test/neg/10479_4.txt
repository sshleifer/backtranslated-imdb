Asylum seekers, tutors and perhaps some gifted, their absence, the father gives shelter to an irritating, over-psychological side that comes to the page after asking his mother for a visit. Famous painter William A. This tremendous psychological thriller directed by Fracor has trapped most of the films directed by photography managers themselves: Each shot is composed for a lot of style, but liquid pacing and a tough, gripping story. Fracur (and his illustrator, Lasalóló Kovas) is very fond of Gaudi White and Sonali Tones, the film is a burning, tableaux. The palace in the center of the work looks like a funeral parlor and the frocker surrounds the yarn that is rotating in the house like a funeral. The most interesting actors of the 1970s, Robert Shaw and Sally Kellyman (Shaw's Fianci), were directed to spend plastic overlay and awakened editing (which turned into a little bit of business in their scene). Another interesting screen personality, Sandra Locke, played a "revenge" for her adaptation of Catherine Danube. Pale and scaly-eyed with long and long hair, people are a strange man's puzzle, and it's very dangerous and dangerous at first; However, this role is so old-hat that people can not find fresh things to get out of a deep shake, and they are dazzling. Fracor Locker allows the fic-out scenes to be over and over, Shaw (horribly looking at Dubeier) puts them in an impossible position playing sensitive parents. If the screenplay is faded with the scale with the stability (or, at least, some dry wit or humorous relief), these nonsense may slogan. The lemp script adapted from Stanton Forbes's novel "Go to to Deathbed", adapted from Levis John Carlino and Edward Hume's Limp script, and only the players' charisma brought us to the last line. * **** to 1/2
