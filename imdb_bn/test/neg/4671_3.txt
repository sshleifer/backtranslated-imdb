spoilers <br /> <br /> This image is not packed into action; It's slow and annoying. It's not funny or exciting, it plays on predictable and cheap feelings and vague patriotism. Special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are cry and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Acting talent is ruthlessly stupid on one liners and clichés. These are spawned by letters which they should call only 'gentle giant black man', 'serial astrologer hero coming', 'Square Javed hero coming', 'The book of covered', 'who is unfortunate Jwala', life by a code of honor, "Emotional princess" and so on. <br /> <br /> and write! How immune they counted they could fit this thing? A scene where people can cut bombs by cutting one or more wire, even counting them as imaginary? The last 15-minute play of the movie depends on the viewer, if some quarrels can exclude personal differences with Ben Affleck and Lime Bíler can leave the world while saving the world. All work is done; We have to wait a few seconds for Harry Stamper to stop some cotton candy lines. I know Bruce Willis is usually a charismatic man, but his character Harry Stammer is an insulting bore. I thought he had achieved the Golden Razzi, he was rewarded for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is so long, the plot is so clear, and the dialogue is so disposable, nobody can help but notice the inefficiencies of lame, inconsistency and plot holes. Some 800 feet of TX's size is less than a pinprick. Try walking 800 feet in TX and you look closely at the center. After all talks about artificial gravity at the Russian station, it seems arbitrary once. Indeed, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie. Anyone other than Michael Bay will close this dead body and send them to blast an asteroid threatening the world? <br /> <br /> Only phone / insurance / colla commercial style Montage rebels. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really This one is boring, stupid and really stuck to yourself. It's hated and frustrating because it has become one of Hollywood's most expensive efforts - from one expensive explosion, another cheap explosion is in progress. Oh yes, the whole subject is flawed by the negative conservative view of gender, politics and so on.
