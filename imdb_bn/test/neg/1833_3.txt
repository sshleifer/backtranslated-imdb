OK, I had high expectations for this reasonably high. Controversial topic was a good idea. As a terrible fan, I admitted that I was fascinated and very excited about it. It was a great idea to them, but it was severely executed. let's see. This movie seems to be running in 3 mode: Happy, Gender, and Dark. The problem is that the movie will not determine what it wants. "Happy" parts I believe in contrast to "dark" parts, but it does not work. Soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The most unexpected and unerotic way to have sex. I am not complaining, but they were unnecessary and even admitted for the poor quality. <br /> <br /> All except letters (patents) are unlikely. His friend from Munich is a whore and probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie that I have come across recently. <br /> <br /> There is a plot which I do not have to go in detail ... it's not stupid and more talented hands to make a good movie. Even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on. Do not try to understand everything because here's the giant plot hole. <br /> <br /> It is so rare that you do not care about any hunter, criminal, or anyone. And to think this has been great. I can say one good thing about it, which is, movie sheds some light in today's unethical medical way. With the advancement of genetics and controversial science, it can be a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. But you will not find it here, just a few views have been visually paired with people and things that you are not worried about. <br /> <br /> Leave it and visit Flatliners, welcome to you. <br /> <br /> 3/10
