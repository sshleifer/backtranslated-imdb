I was completely bored for this film, melodramatic no apparent reason. Every thing just became so serious and people swear with really stupid expressions. Then there is a series of killers who could apparently kill a man to get the title of the serial killer. Good serial killer butterfly likes and dreams of most modern films are illustrated by the sound effects you could hear; <br /> <br /> Why Why? I nave no idea It really wants to be scary, but I think it's like talking about a group of fears of the universe and adding dark surrounded words. Just for the record, this is not a horror film, it must be a thriller (just now). In fact, filmmakers must do homework before making "horror" movies or at least one movie before calling "horror" movie. It tells me (can be very strange sound) "Acolytes, you take nothing to say forever."
