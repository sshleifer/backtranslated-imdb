I suppose that only a few selected members of the audience were interested in showing how a New York-based Hosteller handles, but I stopped these intelligent souls with annoying patchwork techniques and deliberately show sounds here; These underlying 'flaws' were direct results of the movie's underground budget / underground / experimental nature, I'd like to point it to the point. However, those who are so interested, the film has extensive male nudity and features of Joe Dalsandro, it is understood, has become underground ?? And gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The spiritual structure shown in the daily routine of the playwright's playwright offers some quietly interesting views: meeting with her (and finally a gentle elderly artist); Dalesendro has expressed his opinion on his extraordinary work and probably portrays his potential fellow colleagues, including his special modus operandi, among which probably Heller's inconsistent person? An illiterate nerd! Perhaps, the film ran against the demand of IMDB for only 89 minutes, its full length 105 (but the next could be wrong)! <br /> <br /> I have seen some of the movies of the violin and it is not as satisfying as the most tolerant example of the way I have been able to go, BAD (1977), and a little better My Huster (1965) It was mostly busy. The first part of this trilogy was not really good, but it is not saying that you have to do what you are going to do, and the other two chapters will have to be succesfully followed ... <br /> <br /> My usual negative reaction Despite this, FLESH is still valuable as a capsule during the 1960s and as a prototype underground scene of both age and film life. Mine is valuable too. For the record, an image of Dalsandro from this movie has been fond of Smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling (which is unselected here), "Candy Essay", which is the first opening track for the Velvet Underground, 1969 album Name The next band is my favorite of all time, and though one of the reasons is that, through their mere unique and ground breaking music, they have described a very different lifestyle than myself, this is an incident where I experience "rather a rather rather literal experience!"
