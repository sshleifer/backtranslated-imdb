It is based on the life of Michael Life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander did a good job but did not see anything like Michael. I think Michael is portrayed as a stupid person, which I do not believe (though he sometimes believed the wrong person). I thought Fraz Alexander saw Chinese look when they were white in the white look. I think Latia should be portrayed this way, in the 80's, she always painted with her brother. I never looked like their opponent cast supporter. Lisa-Marie Priscilla's son had some wrongdoings, although Lisa and Michael had married, she still saw the marriage scene at the age of 22. When Michael told his mother Catherine that she and Debby seem to be married to carry her child, then Catherine's idea was to marry both of them.
