I just saw this movie last night. In the first 30 minutes, I hope it will end. <br /> <br /> It was a promising start; The first 10 minutes The firmness of this movie (Friends in the rooms "isolated" together with the bed (and year) together, friendship does not go anywhere, it is not only believable. She kisses somewhere near the road, and she thinks that it is so terrible. <br /> <br /> There is very little material to catch your interest, not only do not act, he is very passive. Whatever the movie is shown, the viewers should be careful about screen letters You do not develop the connection. In the next sentence you will learn how to become annoying as one of her previous ("Do you have a cigarette?", She does not smoke, she wants to stop smoking, now she does not know it) > <br /> <br /> To see him in the absence of one year, he comes through the door, even if he does not embrace or kiss or express any emotional connection. To lift his suitcase even his It does not dare to look at anyone. It does not behave as a good friend, it does not behave as a good friend. <br /> <br /> When he gets his phone call in the middle of the night (he lives in town for a day) , She showed little interest to see her face, as more work she would have an understanding for the night. At this moment they were known for two years for one another and he did not see him for a year. Not trustworthy, not real. Remember that he has written a book in Entrophy and Enthalpe, yet we do not see him writing or reading or discussing any interest in physics, he can not handle the discussion. We learn that L.A. A watermelon spent $ 50 (this silicon type was not your mind) seems to have no problem with it. We also learn that when the airport is closed, some really real snow frays are blocked by the sky. I'm sorry but also been in LA? <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see their work. We never see them struggle, they are always on vacation. They have unlimited time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Beautiful life. Unreal Life Unreal characters. Bad title. Bad movie
