The target is the story of a special agent, after carrying out the order to kill the Turks "terrorists" (remember that among these Americans, "a film that loves neutral nationalist super-patriotic crap movies"), returns home to return to his former wife and Two kids are taking hostage. Charlie spent only a few hours trying to ask the terrorists to bring him back for hours. <br /> <br /> It was among the worst movies I have ever seen. And, I was not really (and perhaps, inaccurately) to accept it from the video store, I would never start watching this huge length rubbish. <br /> <br /> The movie is out of the way that any generic action movie story I have ever seen before. In fact, they mislead various types of such shorts, how bad it is. I was expecting halfway to 'Steve Segel's shadow from Madi TV's Will Saso Living's' Homi the Clown' half-way out of the screen, to remind you that it was an overwhelming action movie, but now our character is here Clearly how clear it is. Even no good fight or action was not in order. The way things are run, you will not even think that someone was kidnapped, there was no terrorist, or any remote fun events were going on. <br /> <br /> The story is completely and completely not strange, acting is such a terrible wood. Just look at the part where Stefan Ballwood, former special agent Charlie Snow talking to the abductors in the telephone. They tell him that they have their wife, and they keep calling him. She said, "Charlie, help!" Or something like that effect. And Baldwin "It's okay, honey" answers, as it seems, that script is reading and the word sounds the sound. I imagine that such ridiculously bad movies (such as those below 100 in IMDB - a list that should extend at least 250 films and almost every Stephen Ballwood film should have), some might have some talent At least it has been an attempt to not ham it. Someone anyone. I started reading from the script everyone that everyone thought. Save it, the only person who has a genius in the complete freezin movie (and should not be in it like this), Deborah Wilson of Mad TV. <br /> <br /> It was the capital cheese festival. How really embarrassing
