Just after watching the first and it's too stupid. I had to see the first episode of bone and then an episode of the 11th hour. Should be ashamed of the 11th hour. <br /> <br /> It is very weak. Stuart introduces himself as an official scientist. No mention of what kind of scientist is just the general science material. In a program about cloning, they bring a caretaker who paid a church to settle the failed fetus and kneeled before the statue of Jesus on the cross and apologized ... and as well as saying that where the bad guy can move, he can move the plot. Now the science is working: (<br /> <br /> An idiot is not good, some picard is angry with the TV that advertises the skin, which shows you a young man, shouting, "It's a false" colored female assistant <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon, where Pinochose's Daddy is named as a bad old woman with a bad old lady. When Pikeard entered the taxi for a while, Picard went to the floor and saw, he said a window was going out ... he went out, he could try ... or maybe get the number of the taxi and it might be in the ring or something else. .. I am now entering the taxi and you will not be able to do this by the end of this week ... Maha ahah. <<Br> <br /> The sadness is so stupid. At a stage, a sad parent agrees with Picard that even if the replica clone son is born, he will not have a son like his son's son, yes, the right people of the hat, the common scientist argues against cloning on that basis that every soul is unique and Why do you want to clone <br /> <br /> Although ordinary scientist Picard has invented a bit heel, he is ready for stem cell research and unless it is said that it will be a disaster on humanity. She has a pretty weird rant about how important it is. Of course he does not mention an example. That kind of shows sums up. Buzz sound and tawdriness.
