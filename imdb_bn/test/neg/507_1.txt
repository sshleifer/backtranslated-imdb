let's see. What is my most annoying? At the beginning, I was very excited to see the scene of so many long dance scenes ... without even showing where the song was coming from ... the degree of college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or perhaps it was that each scene lasted more than fifteen minutes longer than them. What is a picture of this picture. And the most annoying aspect is that bad guys are very bad, so it seems that the director is making the film for the second grade. "These people are bad ... these people are good". Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart in its dormitory, I'm beside myself. There is a view of a rollerskating rink that is completely out of place. Love is the main character of long characterless love and a Russian prostitute and a rock star and her sexy groupie think that love scene. John Hurt's character, who shares part of the initial opening scene, disagrees with Overdollen Villen. His death scene may be very stupid in history. And I'm all listening to the haters of this movie, how beautiful is cinematography. I think it looks like washed out. See "Day of Heaven" you want to see gorgeous backyards. This movie is worse than anti-propaganda. It's meaningless On the coast, showing the main character in a yacht, was almost stupid as proverb. The battle scenes are tiring and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it until bad movies are good, because it's their king.
