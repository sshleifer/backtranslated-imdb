As many posters have "indicated", it's a sorry "Star War" Reepoff. Now if you're going to stop "Star Wars" but at least fix it; "Blaster Galactica", and some other space operas that did not work bad, but it is certainly not one of them. David Mendenhall, teenage lead, is not really bad, although he often goes to the overboard on the "intelligent" factor. Vince Edwards has not done much improvement as an actor after her "Ben Casey" day; If anything, he has more than ten years of wood. Other performances, are nothing to write about at home. Even bad effects are special effects; You can say good about them that they are lousy. It is very evident that "Eliens" is only a rubber masked actor with little foam or latex, and Edward's attackers and "war" scenes among the aliens are badly run and badly shot. Roger Corman is a very weak effort from leave it.
