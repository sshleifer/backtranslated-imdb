This show just sucks. I do not think I even need to tell it why or why judging by the number of comments I already just repeat everything. Vip's keys are to turn on your TV and throw Poo to you. That's exactly like I'm not too much of a little bit. These guys are not so stupid, funny and not smooth with women that it's even funny-casue-its-stupid. I am sitting in four episodes and I want two hours before. Where they find competitors, because they probably have mentally lacked. If I was a person who came for a ceremony for this event and kept it on TV, I would give the world a favor and find out the tallest building that I can find. How to get such garbage TV? In particular the comedy network should not be show on a comedy network, at least a comedy show or maybe it can be fun?
