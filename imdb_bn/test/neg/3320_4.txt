"Queen of the Dead" is one of the worst adaptations of a movie I already saw. What I like about this movie is the soundtrack, without any other. (Because I'm a fan of Karne, Marilyn Manson, Leichen Park's Chester Beninton and Wayne Static of Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes and many bad choices I do not even know how to get started. Two stories have come to an end, such as twin legends (one of my darling), Armen and Daniel's relationship, and even Louise was not present. To mention some (the plots had died) First, they should have made a movie. Vampire Lestat ',' This' is not the second book after the interview with Vampire and 'Queen of Damned'. They tried to provide so much information in a single movie that if you can not read Vampire Chronicles almost nothing will get. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no real significance for many meaningful characters in this movie. . In the case of Pandora, for example. <br /> <br /> They do not match the description of Anne Rice, especially Mary, who likes to play all those actors, it's imposing a blond guy with a beautiful, tall, blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is going to be like Lestat) I did not understand why they changed the creator of Lestat to Mary's instead of Magnus. <br /> <br /> "Interview with Vampire" was a great movie, I liked the actor and Tom Cruise because Leastatte was perfect and the best of all the best than Stewart Townsend. (I'm sorry that Tom Cruise once again refused to play in Least). Only Antonio Bondiara did not match Armando's face like Armand, however, however, the Energy Rice was so much interested in this interview. That, I could not sell the rights of this terrible production.
