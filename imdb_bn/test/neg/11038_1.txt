Before I trash this image, I have to get it out: I want Park as the director-love the work of Uq. Although I do not agree with the public that he is working as the best director in our time, I can not deny how he understands how to use the camera effectively. I really like one of her sympathy films for Mr. Vengeance. Also, acting in Mini Sieque Choir was the only thing that allowed me to take this picture seriously. . . <br/> <br /> Now Bad: The plot is the oldest clinic used only in cinema / literature. I do not understand how critics can trash to clutter Hollywood blockbuster, then movies like Oldbay have been reduced, which are not only non-curriculum and cluttered but even more so. However, Old World is sometimes a flat out of the most generic, inorganic films. * Spoilers * People are held in captivity, people want revenge, people find that he was sexually with a family member, ending human life. * End spoilers * Simply, this plot line has been used in everything from modern Greek melodramatic soap operas and innumerable movies / books to Greek drama. When the main manifestation is so melodramatic and unoriginal, I laugh loudly. Does this mean I have a disrespectful fiasco without this feeling? Some reviews of this film tell me about people like me? No Overdone plots mean people can laugh. The horror movie proves franchise, and Oldbaw has proved it. Why do not people think of something that is just really annoying with curiosity and work-related clich√©s in classical music? The blood that comes with the problem. Simply, it's not there. When the director points to the camera on the screen, it is very frightening when some "poor" happens, as we are seeing kids' movies or something. Maybe we were. However, I've heard Old Bowie "the worst movie of all time" and "the most annoying movie of all time." But when I saw it, I failed to see distant or annoying things from a distant place. All the "Gore" offscreen, and even the violence level you never see before in PG-13 movies such as Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why this even confuses an R-rating, much less "the most brutal movie of all time" Seriously, I've seen a movie that looks like an elderly boy on every age, like violence / cow. <br /> <br /> Another big shining, Chasey Fleen is the original villain. During his screen, most of the ridiculous American pie-style spectators seem to have a bare brace, but I think he's oh-so-bad? When she was wearing clothes, her hair came back as a bad mix of cheeses, James Bond villain mixed with Austin Powers. He discussed a brain dead teenager like a hyper overdose, and his conversation was so bad it was a smile to me again. Sincerely, Old Years laugh about my comedy this year. . Finally <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Finally, For those who are stuck in their arrogance, they have forgotten how unreasonable they are and as a result they do not enjoy "film" (sometimes "movies"), how they have forgotten how terrible and annoying. <br /> <br /> What I can say is: I like "movies" and like "movies". I like the thoughtful plays that actually say something about the human condition and I also like pointless action movies that thrill me down. But the thing is, for me, both "movies" and "movies" have to be chosen, they will have to be original. They have to be something that I have not seen, I have lost the number of times the plot has been used. If something is not original, it's expensive. If others decide what they do, then it's forgotten and annoying. Before you "touch" it before giving a more perfect rating to old adolescents, you may have to think about something: which movie is not the same as touching, but at the same time the original thinks you more? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
