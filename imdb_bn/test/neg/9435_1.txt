It is easy to know what is to be said at the beginning of the movie, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man on a holiday. This exorbitant Nazi was created at the end of the seventeenth century, when the blond women were supposed that America's survival and knitting garments were worthy of death. <br /> <br /> Like the others of this era, this movie has been able to bring it, and the audience knows this. There is no mystery or mystery. People are sticky, but everything is predictable for the prediction of the time, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Five people go on evil youth and go to the nuts. Everyone is brown, so that the director-writer team can make their Nazi campaign supportable. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the man attracts blonde, who does not really see much, and ignores the super. Any heterosexual people that look hot will go nuts. In seventeen years, movies should appeal to men and not to men. <br /> <br /> Completely shit and completely bored.
