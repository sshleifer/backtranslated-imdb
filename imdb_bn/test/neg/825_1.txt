How is my God doing this bad? Who is this persuasion of Ali Ji? Avoid this at all costs. It is a smart decorating satirical and replaces its show of humor with toilet humor below and outside. <br /> <br /> It was an attempt to get acquainted with the United States before publishing its show in Hobby. <br /> <br /> Here a commentator says that we do not judge the film on the eligibility of the show due to the differences between the two. Although it is true that the standard format of the show could not be moved to the big screen. Mr Saatcha Baron Cohen confirmed his comic style's smart usage in the story of his current movie. Instead we have this mess, all of which have nothing to do with Ali Ji without packaging in honesty. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating. Find some real Ali Ji for DVD's Init, Iii, or Bling Bling.
