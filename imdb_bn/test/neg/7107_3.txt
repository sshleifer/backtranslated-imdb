The film is very fast-moving, bizarre and colorful, it's a ton of tonsure and make-up like Matte Mac. Also very cartoonist, as said; Cartoon sequence pops up here and there. The plot is very sticky, but I believe it is meant very much. This movie really made me crazy things, characters, they were painfully annoying, especially Rebecca Laurie Petty, she was really annoying (I believe that she ever saw the most annoying creatures). The edit is also annoying, very stylized MTV. Another thing missing from tank girl is an exciting adventure. Humor is not so funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best example of a real chick flick, and a hate / love film.
