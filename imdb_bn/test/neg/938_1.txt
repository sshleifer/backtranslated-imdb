DC Relay Affirmations saw it as part of the Film Festival. I hope they've got better films, because the film failed to give any hope to the audience, which was seen by James Franco without his shirt, even easier wishes, such as good acting, coherent aspects, character development, or actual production standards. The impact of film school on fractures, such as showing moments of emotional distress and influenced by my own personal effects from Idaho to Terminator 2, the film failed at almost every stage to engage the audience. The first twenty minutes bravely tried to take it seriously, the audience threw it jointly and began to enjoy the underlying ambiguity of the film. I was upset that I paid 9 rupees to see it, and I would not go back for two hours, but on the other hand, it was a two-minute entertaining time that I would never go back. It has been a classic mystery science 3000 episode.
