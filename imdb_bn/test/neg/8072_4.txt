Cuore Sacro leaves to be much desired that integrate the effects of shiny film with a story. Script writer has passed as very inspirational for "an angel thrown out", with a script, Ozpetek still remains interested in us. Actually, I wanted to focus on positive things, but the last thing I was so annoying and weird is that I think the couples may have been lucky for their death soon. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story built on the heart (thoroughly) completion of a big packing style. The result of this kind of neutral foundation is the complete formality of the tonnitor or the M. Like night Shyaman films, God can be a tremendous success like a terrible trash. Cuore Sacro is next to a bit closer. I usually found cinematography to be above average. His crores of laps was very appealing in the Irine's tracking shot pool, as it was served inside his mother's house. For me, Michael's elusive parody of Peter when Zyngarlo came from the rain and Irene was standing with him, it was a little stretched. The big issue I took in this movie was the method of Ozzette, which directly recorded the event and the emotional arrangement of the camera facing his hero. This works great effect on facing Windows, but it seems that Bubolova is no Mezzogiorno when employed here. Actually, in addition to this ridiculous story, the main problem of this film is the Milkostest Performance of its main character. This made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad. <br /> <br /> Ozpetket is continuing our crusade against our corporate-driven societies so that we are forced to be more spiritual (required religious) and more neutral. And while I'm certainly sympathetic to this scene, I felt as if the visitors were hit on the head. Characters can be more than two-dimensional? I tend to find this movie very enervating and soulless. Did the "evil" aunt more than a joke? It goes for the "right" side as well as "well" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly guilty Aurelio people as well. And if we miss the ozzatet point, then she decided to wear her opponents to their own levers. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about using the Director's Color. He opened the couple on all black, as well as Irene (when we first introduced him and his life after conversion), wicked aunt Elonaura, and of course, but well-stricken feet on carousel. Black is a color which offers a specific course, the mind set and emotional is in the mind. It is the modern day armor, the color of choice for the essential items that suit the business case. This is the color of mourning, as funerary finery of sport by a suicide couple. Finally, the color of black goddess, such as a simple dress dress and noon in the second half of the picture, illustrates. <br /> <br /> Another main color, and a very suitable choice for a movie about the Holy Heart, the red. It's a color that is an extreme innate emotional element. The character of red dress is bold, emotional, new ideas acceptable, and lazy. Red is a risky color of modern times; It weighs our perceptions of wear and makes us wear weaker at the same time. Nevertheless, red carries a huge weight of history and mysticism, because the first members of the Crow Magnus buried their corpses in a red hair, and in fact the first person Adam named Toro was named after the Red Devil. The red also has an anachronistic flavor, where the red back (and self-propelled attitude towards life by the association) was more acceptable. So when we red-filled room (the walls covered with mysterious fridge of Irene's soil match a red-spoken menu and a red color image of a weeping day), "good" character María Clara and Aurelio red dress, and finally the image of Irene Mom is a formal In the red gown we can see where there is the sympathy of Ozzattek. <br /> <br /> One sound or two soundtrack, I think the original musical themes are appropriate for the story. The Kosi Barco theme marked Irene's style for its monotony and resilience of laziness (the best use of continuous repetitive Barco theme, such as Barry Lyndon of Cubick, is responsible for the strikes with a striking repeat of 8-times). The most inspired option was the opera Ariya in a few seconds, when the electricity was shining, Irene was behind Beni through the house. It is the famous Aria "Ebben? ... Ne Andrò Lontano" from the Catalan opera "La Wali". Aria is sown by lead Soprano forever going by. Irene's mother is a dramatic supranova, we can guess that this is a recording of her song and she says a mockery for her daughter, such as the movie Irene will not have ever decided to see Beni alive soon. My soundtrack has a small question, why is the famous Tangoho Saya Maria? I love the song and could hear it all the time, but it was not really fit here.
