"Julia Carebreez (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working hard to become a doctor, and suddenly, Julia sees herself as the guardian of her younger brother Amanda, after the murder of her parents, Julia's new neighbor, mysterious Kevin Finni (Rob Loay) When growing up, it seems that the young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secrecy, because she is now a murderer The goal of Julia must be to discover whether Kevin is a friend or an enemy, according to the DVD Slieve synopsis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This thriller quietly becomes separated between the oceans Read, but it is interesting for some time.Becklessly, the telephone view of St Alkker Shawn Divine (outside of the police station) and Mr. Loweer Violin (restaurant) is played intensely, but soon, the idea is that. It is not hard to believe that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers twists his legs in some red color of the deliberate scene. Unfortunately, this is not a complicated plot point, and bad story stumbles are afoot, roughly, "dead silent" is not a bad way to spend any time, if It does not have anything good or you're greedy and its co-star. <br /> <br /> Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlan Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
