This movie was not so good as I thought it would be. There are no stories, no characters and some dialogue has been beautiful. The effect of gore is good and it gets pretty bloody at most but nothing at the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and that girl is on the scene with the start of it. Music is a classic score and the movie fits very well. Their 90-minute version should be made so that they may have some time to develop character so we can feel sorry for the person at the Otpisi table. And more information about mother language has made this film even more horrifying than it. Do not expect a scary movie but a nice, poor special effect relay.
