I had to watch it for my Canadian movie course and I was told that it was considered "the best Canadian movie". I did not agree, considering I saw this really much more than I saw. I realized that Canadian themes and messages were there, but the characters and the plot were separated with me (as a viewer), it does not tell me the truth that this movie is trying to tell me. The plot was very dry. Characters did not have many positive personality traits, but these messages are emphasized for not checking the viewer. This image shows little about the history of Cuban. Not a very attractive film; It definitely does not deserve to be made such a high pedestal.
