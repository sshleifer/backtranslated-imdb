I bought it for a few dollars in the local video store, because they cleared their tapes for DVDs. <br/> <br /> <br /> I could not say that it is one of the worst movies, but it is very lazy. No real cancer scene. I do not sleep enough for my time (only 4 or 5 times). And he is not the Thai goddess which I hope, is not. So my two reasons were found to look at this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some deadly animal violence that enjoys this type of enjoyment. A great war between a mongoose and a big snake gets pretty bloody. Animal torture, as well as anything which is real and some fake. Thankfully, the fake is somewhat funny, but the reality is just a little damaging. <br /> <br /> It is generally said, this is a 70 film - too long, low-growth, why not deep as deep. But it's a little different, is not it? One and a half star!
