For this movie, stop a TV show, and a serious ending. I thought it was a lousy way to close a serious one. 'M * A * S * Goodbye, goodbye, and Amen' were good, but not so. Avoid this movie until you love the series (like yourself). <br /> <br /> I was a loyal fan of show Stevens, but the plot was very scary, and Dave Coolie, man, that guy is' good did not ... well, never They could not use Team Moods, he was a great actor, but he was very good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give it a 4.5 / 10
