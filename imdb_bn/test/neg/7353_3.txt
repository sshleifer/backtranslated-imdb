Why did Burt Lancaster allow himself to play the poor Sankouk, who was the most grateful Annie Dandi, who played the Crowe Crowe on Evan Dekler? For the same reason, Robert Mitchell allowed himself to throw himself into another harm, who called the "Where a Hazardous Living" in the 1950's. Perhaps both of them thought that they were a better way to show 'range' as an actor? Which is known for them, playing against the common 'tough-guy' role, can play any role that plays their image. But the problem was Steve Thompson's role, Chris Cross's heartfelt love-affair Milkestist did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Lancaster does not fully express anger in the role of Thompson's one note, but initially the film's hero is spontaneously (and I can say that unfortunate). <br /> <br /> 'Chris Cross' is an interminably slow moving film. There are many unnecessary scenes in the film, initially: flashback, which describes the story of the clash of Thripton with the nightclub Dan Duri's Dandi. What happened in the initial flashback is explained in the picture: The relationship between Steve and Anna, the relationship with Steve Martinez and his bad blood is related to Dundee. If director Sydmark is forced to start the film with flashback, why can not it be kept in three minutes? I think it will be more effective. <br /> <br /> In 'Chris Cross', the hero takes law and order and takes some time before taking action outside the 'normal' world of law. The scene where he "goes by passing" and goes to 'Anna' in the nightclub. And notice, how Sydemak spent so much time looking at Anne Dances and Steve? Apart from cross cutting, he spent a lot of time while concentrating on AC Morales and his Rumba band to remove the story. <br /> <br /> Until the second crisis of law, with the story being brought with Thompson and faced with unwanted conflicts, in the middle of the law-enforcing squeezing of his law and order, he learned that Anna ran and married Dundi. It is becoming more evident at the moment that one of the central weaknesses of the film is that Dindi is never on the screen, in most cases, there is no conflict between Thompson and Dandi and we are leaving the overwhelming tactics between the two love birds. It became active (and Anna later explains it to Steve). Because he was gone because he disappeared only for eight months, but he also felt the direct threat of Martinez in the face of pressure from Steve's mother, who meant he would see that he had ended up in the William House of Detention. Anna goes back to Steve because he has realized that he made a big mistake with Dandi? It proves that he is killing him and now he is afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One unexpected annoyance Chris character in the cross can not hijack you a armored car. But when Steve tells that it can be an 'internal work', then everyone is surprised! You thought that Danny was known as Steve's 'profession' as a shielded car driver and offered him a pre-arrangement. But Steve must offer the offer so that Dandi will not kill him after discovering his relationship with Ana (if they are scared to get caught, why do Steve and Anna meet in their apartment where Danny can find them so easily?). I really got Finchley (played by Alan Napier), a kick out of 'brain' operation Dandy is so dirty that he must hire this alcoholic former professor, who plots the plot on a map. There must be a matter of collecting the components of gas bombs used during robbery, and of course, phenolio is good for it! <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the whole film is the shocking car robbery. The edit was quite good because it illustrated the growing step of an intelligent evil. When the gas bombs were closed, the atrocities of the gang were shown in high relief when the prisoner killed innocent armored car guards. <br /> <br /> The final picture of the movie is drawn as the rest of the picture. Why would one of Dundee gangsters take so long to kidnap Thompson? That's the nurse, then Gunn is waiting outside, then she comes in and says she is a friend, Steve falls asleep and after finally waking up, Google kidnaps him. <br /> <br /> <br /> At home Anna, we wonder how Anna got her hand on cash. Did he steal from Dundee after dinner after eating dinner? It is not explained. Even worse, Ana suddenly got blue-eyed. Before that, his selfishness and Dandie's attraction could be explained by his perceived rejection in the face of threats to Steve and Martinez. But after returning to Steve, he was afraid of Dandi, when he became the most dangerous, he unknowingly enabled him. Just like 'instant coffee', you also have 'instant femme fatale'. <br /> <br /> "The movie is silent?" "Cree Cross" as the author of Silver and Ward's "American Style An Encyclopaedic Reference", "Cinema is one of the most tragic and compelling of the silent". I want to be different. To tragedy you need deep letters that have a deeper depth and to be forced, you need a story that is justified. Chris does not have cross. It is an overrated "B movie" that finds herself in the pantheon of art house noirs in any way. Again, the old mentality has won in Yesteryear's Picture Assessment.
