I hate it. I hate self-conscious pretentious grief that masquerades as industry. This image is stupid, unconscious or unconscious. After the first half hour, I swiftly switched through the DVD version and saw the same adolescence Shannonigen over over over. I'm so excited that I've spent hard-working money for a sophomoric clap-hopping. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue, do something in a movie, let alone art.
