I rent this movie with my friend for a good smile Because of the taste of our suspicious films, we actually laughed with Clerk in a video closure. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because what I did was hidden inside the giant Metal Bracece Jane. And I do not hear anything due to unconscious lisp. Other things that enabled me to understand my attention without its metal face were in the sense of its suspicious fashion. This movie was made in 2005, but it seems that the dresses were going back to 2000 for clothing. If you think that Aaron Carter was considered "popster" and you like high waist jeans, ankle socks and knee-length skirts, this little trip from memory lanes is right for you.
