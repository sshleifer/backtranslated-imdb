What's wrong with 'NorthFork India' movies? For all their rigid comments and big attacks on the studio, this is the sacrifice we have. For about two hours, I was given the pain and pain of a movie that started moving like a blind man in a new place and ended without covering the new place and died gravely. <br /> <br /> The details that have parallel stories are a dead city and a dead boy. Two black dresses (one of them James Woods) must be forced to leave the remaining residents of NorthFirst before the dam and before stopping. The other story came back to a boy priest (Nick Nolt) who gave him to his parents. He is dying and visited, I guess, by the angels. Among them the wonderful shiny and Anthony Edwards with Daryal Hannah reminded me of Sinfield's pirate shirt in an odd garment. <br /> <br /> Although it is "plot", the film is not about it. The film is about nothing It's nothing, nothing says, does not go anywhere, and there is nothing interesting to show. Perhaps through design, perhaps the provocative, most recent, after the effects of David Lynch Vanban - we can not see an important art film - directional style. The whole movie is filtered through a gray, gradually backdrop, which I think, a film about death fits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If you want to see a film that kills a boy, 'lorongo oil'. If you want to see a movie through which a city is destroyed by water watch, 'O brother, where are you art?' If you want to see a movie than 'NorthFor', there are hundreds. If you want to see a movie worse, there is only one boxer. 0 * **** Outside
