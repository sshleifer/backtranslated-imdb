To get started with, the script is overwhelming and inane. Characters shallow and formulary The plot has deliberate reverse and non-sequititors. Baleudwin is terrible - these actors can do well on their own. Comedy and wiseracks fall flat. The shoot scene is weird and incredible. The Belvedev guided himself as a very brave hero, but spent most of the time in a strong struggle with women, especially with a cruel persecutor in his tunnel, who always asked and refused to reassure. Conductor suffers from helpless ineligibility, unable to effectively implement the pistol he has brought. Incompleteness: Bombing with gunmen, pushing people with a railway car. The next time we see them, they are taking their business sitting in their seats, talking, eating, reading, sewing. In the New York subway, people sometimes come to the train to make some musical or dramatic numbers - perhaps they were thinking "happening".
