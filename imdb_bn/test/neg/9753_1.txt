Actors can not work. All dialogs were plagued with bad characters and character damage. Channing Tatum did not move her lips or changed her facial expression ... ever. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new. Some children on the street are involved in a professional world of dance and it turns their life around. Combined with the whole incident involving little kids, directly gathered from the Youtube Got Survey and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that they were not good, but the film did not bring anything new on the table). <br /> <br /> and Dance ... There were only three racing seasons in full movie and 2 of them had commercially taken the stroke. Perhaps I am very critical because I'm not a dancer, but maybe they need to listen. Channing Tatum is not a B-boy, no mean. His little lone in the parking lot was a small style, technique, or a carrier component, all of which were part of street dancer standards. Everything in jazz and ballet in movies was nothing but bad tactics and nothing was acceptable without some twirls, but something more The Grand Finale thought to me "... all right, now they will become serious". In the end, I realized that it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I am not able to make a good dance movie, but there is no exception to the rule by step by step. Apart from the exception of the street dance culture, you did dance, at least the dance aspect was. Save the last dance was garbage, and so there was no music from the last 10 years (though I was influenced by Moulin Roo) ... see center for ballet, see Bit Street for Hip-Hop
