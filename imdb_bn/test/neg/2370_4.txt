This movie comes from Long Running ITV Citcom in the same name. Citcom has been running for more than half the time and brought our screen rigsby, Philip, Allan, Mrs. Jones and Vienna. <br /> <br /> In 1980, the film version hit the cinema. Now when it happened, then Richard Baybinsell died unexpectedly and was replaced by actor Kris Strawley only when he smiled. <br /> <br /> I felt that it felt different from the film. I like Richard had not had a shot as a character if he liked it. Like having porridge film without gobber or macay! <br /> <br /> There were some classic moments in the film but it felt a little de-ja -Vu! Many series have seen TV series before. Now if you've seen the movie than the series, then the series fan will get a different feeling about it! <br /> <br /> Leonard writes that the film is made in the top and the movie, the series on TV. This movie has recently made a new living on DVD and usually it is on a peaceful holiday in the terrestrial. This is a cracking film, but for rigsbys, you may feel that you have seen it as before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
