I like the end of Balochichi movie, the best composition "El Ora del Rioio". This is a great screenplay, great actor (well, Castelito seems much bigger than others), a great use of lights for a great movie. <br /> <br /> Well, wildlife notes are a different story. Wicked screenplay has ruined the moral (and we could talk about politics in the week, you know we are Italian ...). Poor cinematography (it's very easy to represent dark years of dark 70's including dark colors and dark light, try more for some effort !!!!). Bad use of music: What is the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic logic of Brigade Roche? <br /> <br /> I reply to everyone who claimed the main prize of Venice: "Are you almond ??" Maybe the Russian film was bad but it was not as bad. <br /> <br /> I am p. E. Do not believe betrayal !!!!
