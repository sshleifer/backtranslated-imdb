What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not so much With the average Indie Style film making, this image has always been wrong. Editing is just awful Gangster story could be dragged as far as possible, if there is a lack of gangsters' character. Everyone just started to be there for some sort of powder line That was not funny. Hooker, the father of the deceased Mafia, who wants that his son will legitimize his business, "Janny" is the best friend of one-fishing, with the usual suspected gold heart of this film. But the main character, the gangster that likes a girl-like dress. Is she motivated to wear a girl just like she is a woman? Mysterious The end of the movie was nailed to the coffin. It was anti-climatic to say the least. I understand that indie filmmakers do not have the tools to make a suitable shot out, but they can also use water guns. Overall, I would say it's leading up to the hip, (Vancouver's red carpet premiere), it was frustrating.
