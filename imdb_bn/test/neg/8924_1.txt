Last night I ran across this movie on the local TV channel. Frankly, I have never heard of this movie before. Just, I've lost Seagual's recent movie track because everyone is worse than ever. Here, again we have a dull Seagal as he was stressed by his girlfriend to make this photo and he was forced to accept. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is below zero, and there is no single view that the film is not falling together. I have no idea why Sigal did the film. Man, it's "out for a murder" even worse! If you watch this movie you will feel sorry for Segal. He seems to be running out of ideas, encouragement and meaning. Avoid this movie and some are appropriate.
