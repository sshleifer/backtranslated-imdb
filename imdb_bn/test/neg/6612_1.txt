The sound of this movie is TRASH. First, it gives an account of a season 16 years ago! Who care? The film was about the depth of the bottle cap. It makes a complex cartoon Bob Knight like a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> I do not bother, but I am still surprised that ESPN has shown a movie with more damnation than Kevin Smith on a capital. Cable channel The fading term was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible and anyone who is associated with it should be ashamed. I am rating it on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Avril Wins ... 2 movies that are in the Cufffest Hall of Fame.
