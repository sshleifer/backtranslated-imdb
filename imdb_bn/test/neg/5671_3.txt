I would not say the show is all bad, because some interesting parts like Spencer and some random events have happened. But more than that, let's face it, it's a dry sitcom that kids buy. <br /> <br /> Miranda Kosgrove MacGunn was beautiful and fun like Drake and Josh. Actually, he is medium in ICL and he is not so funny to try. Sam acting actor seems to be half asleep most of the time, and his antics are so sticky that I thought about them. They're not funny, just boring. And Freddy is ok, but it's not interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the circumstances are unreal, but it's not all bad. Some are somewhat annoying though. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. Girls age 14, and a web show that does not provide too much personal information, 27,000 weekly (WTF) with weekly visitors, with an advertisement, and they still do not attack the crazy with their lives. <br/> <br /> 2. Their web shows are very much appreciated ($ 100,000 annually for snoopers, free tour for Japan, plain white performance, etc.) In fact, anyone who is 6 years old can not find their "comedy" recreational. <br /> <br /> 3 How they are so "average", yet they own a three story loft, Spencer rarely does anything and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the tools for web viewing? 4. Adults are all stupid. All of them <br /> <br /> 5. No 5 feet high girl, no matter how objectionable and firm, trained police can take down, until she's muscle. Sam skinny and petite. <br /> <br /> 6. Do not fall under 9 stories in a lift. <br /> <br /> 7. Police can find out about criminals than police. <br /> <br /> Fools show. Indeed, it seems innocent, but kids feel that they can be objectionable to their old age, being alone in Seattle while they will be with only 14 unlawful bodies and it will be wrong to give personal information. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. When was the age of the cartoon when I was young?
