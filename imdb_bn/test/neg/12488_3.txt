Has RGV happened in the world? There are so many mistakes about this movie that need to be stopped and where to start - first and worst - music. Every scene was with this chaotic background music that tells you the mood, quite frankly, I can add. Secondly, the light - are we wondering if our projector is still working, do we need dark scenes? And finally - if you go to Indiana's Godfather and Godfather 2, please understand that many of us watched. Naikan was a RIFF of GF1, but better, and more entertaining. I saw an analogy between both the company and the government and RGV's TE Tech 56 was brighter, these two movies left to be loved by some. People will not be influenced by just corrupt politicians and many others. Maybe to see RGV Makbul, which is good enough to be RGB!
