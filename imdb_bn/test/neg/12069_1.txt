Camp Blad <br /> <br /> Addendum ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Deportation Camp Blackbud - An estimated murder ten years ago - the target of four young people killed their masks (Courtney Harris) and through their intentions they stalk them with sticks. Low-rental time-consuming illustrations in Camcoder using the No-View field serial 3D format. There is at least one plot, but the script follows closely with an established Blueprint (with the opinion of "Friday 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain So Genocide") without even adding something new or even interesting. Director of Brad Sykes - The Zambi Chaknelles (2001) and Bludy Tees (2002) - is responsible for the primary work of Romero and Sam Raimi as the main influence of his career, but filmmakers have challenged the mainstream of their budget effort With Sykes only using video technology to simulate his cinematic heroes, whose Le polite confusion with the film are placed in a home. Apart from the 3-D format, there is nothing here to give attention to anyone. Followed by Camp Blade 2 (2000).
