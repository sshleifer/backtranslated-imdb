Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with a common point: Obaba little Vasque city. In this film, the director tried to explain some of these stories using a young journalist as a series. The fruit is a weird movie, because it has no other main character than the city of Obabah (the film spends 20 minutes for each story). No stories are really well explained and in reality they are very annoying consequences. It was the best movie of the year in Spain, but well, it's not saying too much. Only good things in the film are valuable circumstances. It is depicted in a very valuable valley and it is more enjoyable to spend time watching the scene rather than being aware of the story.
