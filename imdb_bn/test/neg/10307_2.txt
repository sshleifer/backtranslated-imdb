I love this show. I saw every episode of last year. I bought dvd And I look protected tonight and I see some reasons retooled this great show. And you have to accept it what it does and destroy it. You have taken one of the best aspects of this event that were 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love other characters as well, but they are good at the small dozen like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. Like some of his siblings, some of his family has been lost and others are trying to fill it. It is too much Small dozen things are fun when you are exposed to it all the time it goes boring to funny. I was looking forward to returning to this show. So please bring back the charm. Even if you can not fit the piper in the show bring Lizzy back. But I like those girls. They bring fun. The program tries to live the life of Sam about her and also manage her personal life and friends. That was the charm. And with that great dog as well <br /> <br /> I hope the network (Fox) will force the writer to do this, and the authors will not do this for the purpose. I will give some more episodes to the Shot before leaving, but tonight's episodes are bad. I made a big deal from the show that came back tonight and took the people and felt like a fool, because no one could laugh except 2-3 times. I apologize to them and I did not know what happened. And about 10 minutes in the episode I realized that they do not show piper or lejizzi and it will not be watching TV TV comedy anymore.
