Seeing this movie, you only have to ask: What are they thinking? So many significant parts of this movie are bad, you may think that it is deliberately poor as a fun. <br /> <br /> I think the film's worst directions. This movie has many poor uses of camera angles and other movies which are laughably bad. The most interesting example of this will start at the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations via email - the same camera angle is used for each shot (which ends in a painful 2 second piece) and the same desktop / window / program etc. Even every set seems to be shot at the same time. The whole sequence was completely silent, even with no music, or sound effect. Overall, it was an unfortunate way that a city was being sent to the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen closely, you might see that the music is similar to other movie soundtracks. It's not frustrating - as with the movie opening up, most of the songs are actually a minor change in scores of other movies (see what you can guess). Also, I've noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like writing and playing through a lower end MIDI keyboard. If you are familiar with Lucasouts SCMM adventure games, the thumbnail of each device seems like something like the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is just plain sucks. Acting terrible Script derivative (ferris bular?). No joke in the movie is not funny, until you see the whole movie as a big joke, money paid to the listener. Do not hire this Do not show it while restoring it to the comedy center. Just forget this - it's terrible.
