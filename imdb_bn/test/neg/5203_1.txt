As a huge fan of original operation Delta Force, I thought I would choose this picture. I figured it could be very bad However, here is a list of things I learned about Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - Despite being elite in the American armed forces, the Delta Force is mostly in the late 30's and early 40's. <br /> <br /> - Despite being elite in the American Armed Forces, Delta Force carries a pistol or a one-47s of standard police problems in their most important mission. Despite being elite in the American Armed Forces, the Delta Force did not know that during Steveal's mission, it is not okay to go after bright red skimble jumps and open spaces that keep you away from sight. <br /> <br /> - When you drop an immovable cocktail in a tank, it explodes outside like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - You can run away when you hit the tank fire, even if the smoke can be a small problem for breathing. <br /> <br /> - You can die from a standard gun shot, but you can survive by sniper rifle multiple times, and a few times by a one-47. <br /> <br /> - Members of the Delta Force regularly attacked by railway officials despite being the elite of the American Armed Forces. <br /> - If bad people are coming to you on a slow train, 4 out of them can not figure out how they can automatically get automatic fire fire, at least 50 of them Half of anyone with 5 meters (16 feet), hit one alone. <br /> <br /> - If you are short on the actors then just retake them - Bad guy in Operation Delta Force 1 is a good guy called Operation Delta Force 4 Mac, and the man playing MCC at Operation Delta Force 3 Now a different good guy avoids a lang game. <br /> <br /> - It's not right to shoot Delta Force, it's not a unarmed terrorist, even if he is trying to reload the weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades influence the land when leaked by members of the Delta Force. When cast by non-Delta Force personnel, they explode at the point where the Delta Force members have left grenades towards the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can run faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - Militia and personal forces use the exact same helicopter that the United Nations Operation Delta Force 1 uses. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy can not see you in that helicopter. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Shooting on the chest will cause minor damage. The person will knock him on his knees and kill them in 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - In foreign countries, when Delta Force wanders from old people, because the US military does not provide them any means. It can also explain why they were caught in public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really a great moment in making movies, but it's good for laughing.
