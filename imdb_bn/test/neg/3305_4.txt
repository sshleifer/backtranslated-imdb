Anyone who created bad news for the full-length parody movie of Lifetime Network Film - a deadly encaustor has already done it, though it is unknowingly. There are lifetime life tricks - a divorced mother forced to flee from a lost stellar, an unbelievable ex-husband (who had cheated her in a married marriage), and a police department that patronized her complaints with her. Stand up for yourself. Especially jaw drops are the scenes where the heroine decides to unburden with her rarely, after a break by the universal STK, and trying to try her mother! I saw the first hand harassment of a colleague by some trembling with the church, I know that stocking is not a joke, but it is definitely in this movie.
