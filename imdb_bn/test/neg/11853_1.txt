This picture was really terrible. <br /> <br /> However, it is valuable to look at, because it features the most unnecessary extended scenes in the world. I mean, this thing has been repeated about 7-8 minutes (repeating the same 'moving' over), which is about 10% of the whole movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " After 2 minutes they run out again. What was that for ?? Also, the small white forklift magically transformed into a huge yellow excavator was excellent. It is frozen because I was using the footage from the 'Karnsaur' triangle up to this perfect ass patch. I'm going to see them now! <br /> <br /> The image is laughable or worth seeing, but if you do not get bad movie fun, stay away!
