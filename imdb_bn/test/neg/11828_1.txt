Ah anemorph I like the book series and everyone was worried at middle schools and when I heard that there was a television adaptation, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> How the boy left the final product. I think for me, at this moment when Nicholedodon stopped talking about cold programming and more generic. <br /> <br /> So what was wrong with the series? Let me count the ways: 1. The letters were horribly miscast. In books, the animorphs were anywhere between 12-14, the television cast was at least 18. I was frightened when I saw the first cast photos. <br /> <br /> 2. Horror acting / bad writing I was blaming the fault that I'm lumping in that lumpy mass. It was probably that Caste's rapidly threatened the threat, which is at least 13 years old, which is not Marco-funny. In fact, I did not remember a single ridiculous moment from the group and had a few. The actor did not help with the writing, which was strong on his superiority and head ache badly. <br /> <br /> 3 My lord was stingy with the budget they were. Only the final result of Andalite must be sure to pull VioMom in the plug ... their heads were clear which showed the helmet clearly. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to Cast - As far as the Rachael bookfighter was the biggest disappointment, the best equivalent of the TV series was "Scary". Also, I know Casey is idealist but there is a difference between "idealist" and "stupid". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Music will be obvious? 6. In response to 6 questions, "yes" because all other things were muted, why not a less intelligent audience would have to be thick like a hair wrap-rock rip off or any brick from its brick. Then, got big (Iraq, 2004) but if I did not clean myself - this show sucked the show and it was hateful for a series of books which it was supposed to be oriented.
