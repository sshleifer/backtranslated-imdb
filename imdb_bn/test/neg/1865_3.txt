This is a bad movie, but oh well, this film is not like the hair of at least the third Galius movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is its writing direction, direction, acting and basically a bad movie. Everything in between It has a weak, simple, and ridiculous story, as well as there is little to do with previous Gaelic movie entries. It has tried to connect the film with the first movie "Gholiyaz" since 1985, but on the other hand, if they really want to connect the film to its predecessors, then were the Gawlis in this film? Instead of now we played some small people, Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed as demons. The ghouls of previous films were not a classic character, but they were the heart and soul of the movie and provided the movies with a certain amount of fun. It's like being Gremlins movie without Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really interesting to see because it has no excitement, good humor, curiosity and basically everything you can think of, because it has been put together clearly by those people who are most talented in their business. The director of Jim Winnerski's resume, "Brewwieck's The Witches" and its "Suegel Jones and Busty Crusade", "Hutter Hill House", "Scrum Rani Hot Teab Party", "The Bare Winch", and "Bare Wrench" Project 2: Awesome Topless "and" The Ben Wrench Project 3: The Nymph of Mystery Mountain "and" The Da Vinci Code ". <br /> Yes, this movie is quite stupid and a campi It is not really enough to make the thorpe stronger and it gives more entertainment value. You know, it is a special effect of hair, dresses, make-up and looks like a cheaper movie after listening to actors. Outside, it is not the worst movie because the reason for "Gholijay III: Goose college goes to college" is due to a lot of bad films, since some of these are dangerous links.  রচেষ্টার প্রচেষ্টায় ছিল। এই চলচ্চিত্র অন্তত এখনও গুরুতর এবং পেশাদার এক হওয়ার চেষ্টা করে, যদিও শেষ ফলাফলটি নিখুঁত থেকে অনেক দূরে। <br /> <br /> খারাপ চলচ্চিত্র তৈরি করা এবং সম্ভবত যারা পূর্ববর্তী ঘাউলি এন্ট্রি দেখেছেন তাদের জন্য কেবলমাত্র দেখার যোগ্য। <br /> <br /> 3/10
