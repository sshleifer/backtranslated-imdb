A fine lineup of the actor and a seemingly beautiful plot - though not the original - promised me a beautiful evening in front of the TV. I was frustrated. The actors are well-meaning (as incredibly illustrated by Juliet Lewis; William Hurt is firm but in the background; Shelley Duval never believed) The story of the story being related to me was very thin, and the last turn was very clear and very late; She was just one character beautiful for her, so guess what? Then the final after-turn ?? I do not know what that seems like. Lovers and neighbors? Deal with the devil, or just get him removed? What! There was a great idea behind the film, but the idea was not worked out in detail. It might be good, but it was not. There will be a lot more loose to say colombo.
