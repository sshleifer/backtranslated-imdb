It shows one of these Australian films directed by "Australian" students and funded by the government. This is well appreciated by artists and teachers, with the help of smart shots of color and size and oral trips to Freddian psychologists, but in general it is felt good movie, good story, and generally good taste is stupid. When the art students became so emotional, I guess. The same thing as the "Pink Flimings" mile forward. Some pornographic films of the 70's are more spectacular and inspirational. The book of Revelation is not entirely without merit, but as a whole experience it is well below the average B grade.
