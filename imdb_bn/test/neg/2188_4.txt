The movie is ok I mean sorry to see it! I played completely stupid and most conversations ("Oh no, this was my grandmother's bible!"). It's sort of the U Turn Bad Remake. A man does not come to any desert town, meets the wrong person and falls in love with the wrong woman. And because of anything close to get involved, he thought he could leave behind him. The movie is quite predictable and it is not really something new. If it ends, you really do not care. Most characters stereotype, especially Brian Austin Green !! Just another movie from all states, but just on Wednesday night's annoying entertainment. IMDB votes: 4/10
