Because my ass was laughing off but was probably the stone. On one hand ... this is not a horror film, there is no big deal in this whole film, and the scourge of the plot is so huge that even the fewer IQs below would think it was stupid. Above all, I live in Denmark and live my life and can make sure that Denmark is a small country where you need to go back to your GPS and maps on your lost path. I would guess that if you do not really try it then you can not stay for more than three hours from the city or other people. Secondly, I do not think of any part of the movie, except for two Copenhagen shots where none of the actors were actually tapped, actually in Denmark. Doggy woman does not speak Swedish Danish. The first bog body helmet brand new The girl she finds in the woods is hidden behind a stone that is not in Denmark. This is just stupid.
