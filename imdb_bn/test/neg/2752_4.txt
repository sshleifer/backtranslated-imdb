Shemp finds out that she is married in 24 million if she stands to million dollar heir. How hide he looks and his personality does not seem to be that he can not find an acceptor - unless an article is published in his explanation paper - at which point five mad women do not claim <br/> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> I said, Buster kitten's bright comedy. That's why I dislike this picture, because it was Keaton's masterpiece, a Raifef of Seven Cancer plot. The old comedy plots with stooges were not unusual for Colombian photo to steal or just to recycle old Stooge shorts. So, from the beginning, this image is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this film is mainly due to the skin's leprosy and dryness and ornaments (often the phone booth scene). The cousin was bisil bit beautiful and funny though - away from the fine! However, the worst part of the film was not particularly fun conclusion. In Keaton's edition, hundreds of women appeared to be married to him, and the act quickly became furious - here, it lived in a small house and there was a lack of comedic punch - the end of a quarrel. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dull retread. Also, before marking this review "not helpful", be sure to see seven signs that I'm talking about first - then you decide.
