Beatles can not even write songs, even if everyone likes, and although Walter Hill is not a top-top, it is not one of the inspirational thoughts of action films. In the 1990s, social platforms between music and movies changed, the ropar turned into a full-fledged film star, and the role of the actress brought empowering regional accent and transparent acting backwards. It was a lot of ice films that I saw and liked as a child, only after seeing them and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Saddler have a basic living until they go to a fire on a map with the golden effect until the bargaining building. I quickly and clearly set up the main character and location to transfer it to Walter. But I blame everyone involved in the shutting down of LAM-and performance. The ice and the cube were red hot at the moment, and when I enjoyed both their career as rapper, in my opinion they were flat on this film. It's about a ninety-minute man laughingly turns the other person behind him, where you lock yourself in more than one state of disbelief. Now it's a movie, it's not a documentary, so I will not waste time in restoring all the stupid plot twists in this movie, but there were a lot, and they did not lead anywhere. I see this feeling that every set was confusing and only playing cuffs. I still enjoy two about it, it involves a scene with a needle and the other is a huge 45 pistols of Saddar. The film below is the Domino Pizza as it is in the line below. Yes, if I'm hungry and feel like not cooking it, then I'm well aware that it's a nut like nuts. 3 stars, meh
