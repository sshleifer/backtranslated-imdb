I have a friend who works in my blockbuster, and he rents five free movies a week, so one day we screamed Aesel to do something interesting, I fell into 18four surgery in Kung Fu, and this box was judged alone, this movie is amazing It seems, but still we were tempted and paid rent - later, it was free ... and thank you It is ... .... I have seen any movie till this .... The budget is definitely a bump and a piece of string ... The plot was ridiculous, the only mention of "18 arms" is that there is a book that 18 weapons that teach some bad guys - and that's it! There is no weapon of war in this film ... and the verb function is only flat-out BAD ... 9 out of 10 punches and other people's footsteps come about a foot away from other people's landing, and the film will have a lot of time when film frames are avoided. (Laughingly, because of poor editing) .... Dubbing is funny, and it is rarely understandable ... and we can not act either. Finally you must "watf ??" You must be fair, but I must definitely mention that the war strategy used by the actors was somewhat modest and the old man is crazy. But about this ... Thanks, I could not pay for this movie, but at least now I know That's actually how bad a movie can be ....
