So bad as well - the script is not only clear, but the acting is just poor, but unfortunate. Definition of the worst all characters: Unrealistic sensation, responsive feedback, strengthen the camera to watch surveillance aspects, which are introduced as keys in the plots. <br /> <br /> When the laugh does not stop, the end, the main character says something else, 'Your daughter does not play football and does not know any cooking'. This type of crime of female intelligence defines the level of the film. <br /> <br /> What is the film about the mental behavior of the second character?, about its effect on the main character ?, or just a sequence set of events, heating order for a clear ending? <br /> <br /> Please do more of this - it was a good time to guess in my next time it was wrong ...
