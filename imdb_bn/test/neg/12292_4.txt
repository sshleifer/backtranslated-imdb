I am very interested in very positive reviews here. Although it had some good features, in most cases I think the film is heavy handed, predictable, and worst, at least not least in scary. The first 30 minutes of the movie were committed, the actress did a great job in her film, and the world around her was good thoughts and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the movie entered a lower spiral. I did not go to this movie that would not be about it - I did not know anything about actor, director, genre etc. At certain times, my wife commented "Could it be terrible movie?". Well, I think, as the boiler plate "horror film" scores skanking violin and the full score of the increased compotos can not mean anything else. The film does not seem to be completely original, romantic interest was painfully obvious from the very first moment, and the second half of the film entered deep into the laughing state. A movie like this walks dangerously narrow way, and unfortunately there is a point where the audience must decide whether to walk on the path, or to jump and laugh only humorously. For the final 30 minutes, I selected the next.
