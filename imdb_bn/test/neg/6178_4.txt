I saw the movie after checking her rating on IMDB. Then, it was at 8.0 and I thought, "Wow! That must be good". I think wrong The beginning of the movie is a pledge of plot, but it quickly moves under its bases. I think without Richie Nix's character, it might have been okay - though that's why the line of the story does this. The character is very extreme for my favorite, and hard to bear. Also, the original character can be partially irrelevant and easily dropped from the beginning of the story to the end of the "last episode" - the option is that I just could not understand the movie. Although it needs to be admitted that it is "simple observer", and I did not have any problem sitting in the whole film, after finishing, I was a bit incomplete. All in all, rather than the mediator.
