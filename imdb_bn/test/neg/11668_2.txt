A few days ago, for the first time I saw three crazy movies and I was frustrated with the third schedule. It destroys the fine work of the first two films with the weak and greasy action, and a story line that transforms a mysterious Australian insect into a ridiculous sand hole, hopes to see it in the child's adventure movie. Most of the characters are seen in his earlier films as dark and brutal figure, and have changed as my expected reluctant savior, which makes me feel betrayed. Do not just do this if you have not seen this picture yet. Let the story end with the fight fighter and save yourself a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alert) I had other major problems with this film that were really flying people that left a bitter taste in my mouth. We have already seen him in the road fighter, where he has made the highest help and yet when he reappears in thunder, it seems that he has never met. I do not know whether he was supposed to be a relative of different characters or street fighters. However, this is not explained, and this is a weak element of the overall weak film. 10 out of 2 Thunderdome does not get war because of 1/10.
