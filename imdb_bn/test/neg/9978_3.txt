I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, terrible acting in most parts. I think Peter O'Howel did a good job of acting (Tiberias), but he must die before seeing the film's final cut. John Gilgood, as far as his appearance in the film, still plays Hamlet's role. Part of hard-core pornography was neither erotic nor did they do much more in the story. Well Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the man playing macro was handsome. The person who played Claudius looked more like the traditional painting of Nero and certainly Claudius's Robert Grayv's picture differed. The murder of kaligula, wife and child (?) Has stalled (?) Murder, because it falls on the stairs in an open-air area, after seeing him after death, when he actually ran ahead to death in the underground passage of the Palatine hills. Domus Flaviana that still exists. There are places in this movie where virtually something draws my attention - compassionate anger. If you want history, read sweetyanias or testimonials, if you want pornography and tragedy see Pasolini's "Sallo", but stay away from this movie in all the ways.
