I am afraid of the fear of a number of people who think this picture is appropriate ... much less! Are they the basic criteria for most of the film? I do not know anymore <br /> <br /> This "commercial movie product" really does not deserve to honor the honor of a film called The genius of genius Genius Keane really genuinely has the injustice I admire Laurie Petty, but most of her has gone down the tune. At least his role was very small. Maybe he had a bill that desperately needed to be paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance that I saw while watching "firearms" was amazing. Let me out of my chest: if you can not show the reality, then do not show it at all. OK?!! When you see the effects of lam it is embarrassing for everyone involved because it does not come near the simulation of a real burning building. Some interesting tidbit: 1. A window opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the whole room engulfed in the fire. What does she do? He tries to fire the room! 2. The same janitor (who burned the building) then later came across a door marked as "harmful element". His brilliant mind would tell him that opening doors would be a great idea. Big mistake 3. A woman is giving a fine-grained donation of $ 100,000 to a Greyhound rescue fund ... but she's wearing a fur coat for the charity event she's holding! (Which animals do not care for living animals, what kind of things do they think?) 4. Most people in the film are forced to vortex with a huge steel wall, even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) even 'penetration' Yet they have a wide wind wind that can move on the right side that anyone can crawl through it. Sure that this security has ended. <br /> <br /> I could go but I am worried about this lunatic movie. Our "hero", which we want to challenge, is a career criminal who tries to kill some police officers. What a swell guy! If the general population wants to make their mind worse in this drop, they will have more energy. I wish I could just remove it from my memory. 1/10
