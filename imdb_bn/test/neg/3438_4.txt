!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not think much of Arnie's action / adventure movie with TERMINATOR and total RECALL exception. They are definitely better than their joke but it is rarely saying. My problem with all my activities Blockbuster is that they lack any overlines and morals <br /> <br /> Morality? I mentioned in my review of TERMINATOR 2 where the good guy terminator SWAT team's friend knees. Do not we think that heroes are doing their job instead of killing people, because we would appreciate him anyway? This is an issue with ERASER, when James Kane's character is revealed as a betrayal in the US Marshal division, Arnie character John Kruger is driven as a witness to his protection, but Kruger is killed quite a few in the next few cruises. Martial amount of work with villain Were not it all the traitors? Certainly many of them were honest men who were trying to stop Krüger because bad guys told them that Krüger was a traitor? It is rather helpless thought because Kruger killed several people who are trying to really keep the law <br /> <br /> Despite the one million dollar pricing, special effects are not that powerful. Look at the scene where Kruger gives a wallet and scrambles to keep a parachute. It is clear that the action is a stuntman who is making a free fall order that Arne is in the studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is a film that contains unnecessary CGIs that contain killer algorithms, not just unnecessary CGI, but disrespect CGI. There are also some holes in the plot, such as open scenes, where some witnesses are involved in the protection, which has captured the crowd. Kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out several bodies and starts the fire. Kruger shows the reconstruction of the dental record through her next couple of computers. Will it be logical to do but all couples will keep the computer recorded in the dental? Do we believe that the US Marshall Department keeps the body full of duty for such incidents? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ERASER Arnie did not do much business at the box office, save for Terminator 3: Reason for the instrument was an event movie and it would be interesting to be remembered as a politician rather than an interesting movie
