Another sticker from the Prime Minister's Entertainment Group, and thankfully, one of their last ones. <br /> <br /> 'FireTrade' effectively turns into a very low budgeted remix of 'Towing Infarro'. Some attempts are made in them - there is no effort in 'FireTrade' which has DeanSuperman 'Keane's star, who is absolutely terrible actor, has all the acting abilities of a porn star seriously, but he has become one of the best actors here and some say, others only One of the hopes is to give a bunch of shoes from different soaps of different days. Special FX Shots showing only junk, burning buildings from the ground, in the worst I've ever seen, like someone like fire scribbled an orange pen in front of the camera. You do not basically root for any character above - you hate everyone and hope that they all die before 90 minutes. The script is shocking - the obvious instruction of red herring is coming later, someone else mentioned it but 'the scene where the quarrel fights with a blazing fire in the building with its vroom .... a delightful, or same mussel Going to the house identified as 'dangerous stuff', these scenes were supposed to be tongue-in-cheeks? In any way, I doubt it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is given, I can not recommend it - instead see 'The Towing Inferno' <br /> <br /> 3/10
