For me this movie was a disappointment. However, I hope that it will explain the popularity of General Ramell and the reasons for his success as a military strategist in World War II. But none of them, it's related to the last or two years of her life and tries, to make her white. So I think Rommel was a moral and miserable technocrat, mainly in the character and murder business, in particular behavior or behavior, not infamous. Such real life people do not have good movie material. I often feel sorry for my favorite actor James Mason, who had to replicate a beautiful wooden character. Actually, a good director and many acting talents have been spoiled in this movie ?? Apart from the exception of Luther Adler, Adolf describes Hitler's really memorable and strange nature screenplay. <br /> <br /> There might be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Germans are not only believable and famous British actors. For example, Rommel is not like Germany, but it is commonly understood as "Southerner". "You soon think about a certain dialect, a specific kind of intelligence, a specific way of looking at the world (total reverse one Prussian ?? junker"). I think there are mixed feelings about the assassination of July 20, many of those who were in the conspiracy were not democracy, and just wanted to join the Western alliance against the progressive Bolsheviks of German soldiers (thus fighting for war ever waged)). <br /> <br /> The best pictures of intellectual, intelligent military mind are still in my opinion Patan (1970). Incidentally, General Patan may be thrilled for a short moment in the wide documentary footprint used for this movie, when he is passing on passing vehicles, low angle shot. The open holster and the mother of the pearl bottle with the revolver is clearly visible!
