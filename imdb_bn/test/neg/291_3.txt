I've heard the story of the movie's impersonation and it's great, but it's only 1/100 movies. The problem is the pinch of this movie. I have never got the plot or the person is stealing girls? It makes any sense but hey ... why was it weird that there was a club randomly. Many parts of this movie do not give any idea, but overall I was interested. It was confusing at many levels ... Maybe I did not have enough indie for this movie but I saw the last scene that they went out of money, spent just a few things and forgot the plot. Its less budget and so appears. I like these that they used very bad effects which were bad, but they did not use any quality that was quality. I would say, this film is with the right production, the diverse bad script. I definitely saw the movie as not random, but the pieces of the puzzle just do not make sense together. Influential, after the impact of my pregnancy in the 1950's, I would leave the exception of the final war. Models like and sparked out See if you want an unintentional comedy from an action movie. Mystery Science Theater has a candidate.
