When Explorer becomes a missionary, they still absorb in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> What is my first reaction after watching the pictures ?? God bless me that I am not eating fish or any vegetarian food! <br /> <br /> The documentary was about Tanzania's Lake Victoria, where many beautiful fishes lived, and in the 1960's, someone came to Pars' powerful fish nail, who became exportable goods for the Europeans in Tanzania. Japanese market. Was the result serious ?? Firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; Secondly, the fish that comes to accept can not travel simply because it does not create commercial / business / capitalist ideas, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (which Europe can give to this world); Thirdly, the pilots (such as all immigrants and touring population, such as truck drivers) will have to live up to their sexual needs by increasing the local local African prostitution; Fourthly broker, seller, middle-class men (mainly Indian origin traders) are in chains and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; Fifth poor children lead to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> This documentary was great for creating. But did you succeed in creating the best documentary of Hubert Supper? This is not a big one. <br /> <br /> I am saying these reasons: like India, Brahmin needs to stand up to the upper level Brahmin and for the world, the need for Indian poverty and untouchability; The story of Tanzania and its growing economy and the destruction of poverty is needed by the birth of European documentary producers around the world. As soon as they see the world for poverty reduction, the unknown reproduction of the rich class (who never considered poverty or poor people poor), who survives, survives, earns, and fame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pictures, letters, local, interviews are very grave and dark, Dark and annoying He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice presenting his case. Finally we feel sad and sad for the Africans. We started considering the Tanzania government and the people as terrible. Maybe some Westerners will be able to discuss their sad situation in the air conditioner rooms to discuss the sad and realistic situation of Africans, but there will be no more. <br /> <br /> The screen prevents itself to show itself once on screen ?? So this poor country will not be identified among abusive Europeans. <br /> <br /> This director, Habart can only survive as a dry smell like today's CNN and BCC media giant. There was no or no general idea to talk to any Europeans who imported this product from Hubert. A complete lop sided flimsy effort! But do I understand the same reason? Hubert just wanted to raise his reputation, laughing with his European consolation and laughing. <br /> <br /> No extra words for this kind of effort. I hesitantly give the documentary rating more than 3.5 out of 10 because the theme was correct; But for the most intelligent Western audiences, the garment industry was highly absorbed and blown away by the ill-fated director! (3.5 out of 10)
