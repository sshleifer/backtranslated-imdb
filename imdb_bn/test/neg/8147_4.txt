Of course, I've seen the version of MSST 3, but it's not really bad, at least it's my film's hatred for others. <br /> <br /> The story center of a disgusting girl incorrectly called the "school girls" Besides, the race, release, and pain (unknown) happen. The story and acting a little bit, as the action. However, if you are completely annoyed then the whole thing is actually recreational for the degree. <br /> <br /> Overall, a simple sub par 50's flick, but sometimes away from the worst movie, the movie with some brilliant spots (The Avia Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you get an opportunity to see the version of MST 3, then you will not be disappointed. It is not so much by self, but I can think of the worst method of torture ("the speaker"?).
