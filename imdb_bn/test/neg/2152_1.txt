I can not believe that only people made and performed in this movie really take it seriously. Skits on SNL look more realistic. Everything was ridiculous. Incognito gunfights, ridiculous boxing battles, dialogue, sad background music and even b's blind eyes It has been billed as a comedy, it still makes more sense but still will be worse. I see it as "entertainment" only if you can see the full room of Stone College, but it looks like Rocky Harry's picture show. Imagine some things that you saw in Blazing Saddles, like under the weight of the horse or like the old lady Peteeninfe Pet-punched. Now imagine that the producers want you to take these scenes seriously and you get the list of these disasters.
