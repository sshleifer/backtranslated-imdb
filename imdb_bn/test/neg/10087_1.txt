This is the most painful, stupid, obscure stupid show that was ever in the air, and this is coming from someone who seems to be "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife loves to see the reality show - and this was an episode of drill where Wannabes had to develop a "walk". The end result was straight from Monty Python's "Scilly Wax Ministry" sketch. I can not laugh enough hard <br /> <br /> and then public Miss Banks (as they all ridicule ...). From Rose O'Donnell's "The View", he wants to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV. Such modeling is doing great things for mankind. Please I could never find her interesting, and now I can not find her intelligent that there is abnormality to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone needs to say that these human dress hangers eat healthy food and actually look like real women.
