The two-page boy works in a radio network to try to solve the murder of performing black faces in the shifts. Since 1945, Jack Marne and Sydney Miller have played this hooded. Do not be quick to talk, everyone screams, and on two pages, the boys police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sunford). It is a real "short" in 59 minutes and it's a feeling of being adapted from a game, because it is mostly done in a radio station soundstage. We really do not care about any characters, perhaps probably why it is ever displayed. No matter what. It was Phil Carlson's second film director. We have not given any sources that can prevent people, so we only follow police detectives and page boys as they first try to solve the mystery. I would have to say no longer so no spoilers give away.
