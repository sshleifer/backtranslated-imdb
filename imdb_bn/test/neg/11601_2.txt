I only gave this 2/10 votes because Hitcoch agreed to direct it. He certainly spent a day with predictive plot lines, foolish children who are trying to be funny. There were "hijacks, sanitized, ambassadors" in the times when the Hollywood production code was fully functional. Visible male characters who prefer the "soap" character never stroke their work, the food is usually not eaten when it bothers me. (One exception was in the eating scene of "Tom Jones" (1963); While drinking plenty of drinks - non Vincent should keep their mouths open for the next line! Carole Lumbar must have hired a character from the hit "Cool Blonde" model, but it must have kept him close to the thrillers he had for managing this disrespectable copy script. I did not wear well for years. I could not wait till the end because it slowly Amak Was disturbed. Last.
