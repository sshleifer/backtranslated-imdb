I do not think Haggard was always the most fun movie, I liked CKY and Viva La Bam. I think it was too stupid and there was no plot for film. I highly recommend that you do not pay a lot for this movie, but anyone who likes Viva La Left, CCY, or Jack Ass will see. I liked a lot of movies and then there were some parts that should be spent. I think that Johnny Naxville played in this film because he is a much better actor than most people in Haggard and perhaps this movie may be more fun. I think Ryan was probably the best actor and it was also skating on the left more.
