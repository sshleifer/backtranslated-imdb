Tug-3 is absolutely correct. Although I'm sure Mr Ossmand wanted to create sincere, heartfelt Christmas films, it is as weird and unclear as it was. Christmas's religious significance has been forgotten and replaced with beautiful kids, weird adults and DOPI villains. Production prices show that it was portrayed by a shoe store or really inexperienced filmmakers - I unfortunately doubt the next. The worst part is, weird enough, really music. You would think someone with chronic music carrier might do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. Even my mom does not like this movie, and she likes osmand and fun things.
