This is basically your rice fairy biker flick complete with Nifty slangs, crashes, and music. OK, so just slangs and crashes. It's a little bit more than the other fares featured in MST3K, but it's still equivalent to running a nail in your knees: slow and painful. Plot will eliminate my power to give away so I will just say good to stop you skipping this one.
