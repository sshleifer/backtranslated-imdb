From the producers of underworld, we've never seen the worst Weibo movie ever since. It is basically a reconstituted version of Underworld, yet vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal) and generally just about anything that can produce a decent film related to Lycanthropy (the biggest deal) all of them!). Vivian, a prominent Lycanthrope chocolate maker, is currently living in Romania because he was killed in front of America and executed a few years ago in America to break his family. There, he belongs to small societies (or packs) and perhaps the leader of the pack Gabriel, whose son - is looking for some toad-wacked pack with British accent, it is taking it on his own. They obviously have been discovered in other countries before and want to settle in Romania to avoid negative attention, of course, such activity is considered forbidden. Vivian is in love with an American artist who is unaware of his involvement with the thirsty group of blood thirsty. When they discover the secret relationship, someone dies when things become dirty and people are forced to participate in the deadly tradition where they are separated into wood and are hunted - the pack will have their "wolfy" selves All of these really made a big jump before they light up and land as a light. Very cheezy effects The whole movie is like a poor underworld with a few topics, romantic moods and very little action. Looking at the theater, I could not wait to finish. A devastating annoying frustration. Avoid!
