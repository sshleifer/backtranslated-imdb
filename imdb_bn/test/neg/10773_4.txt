I'm not sure that I agree with the director of this version of Scarlett Pimparle. I imagine Sir Percy Blenke a very quiet, apparently lazy elite. This special Sir Percy Blake seems to be very involved with energy and volatility. I'm not grateful to Houdini, James Bond, the mission is to move away from the impossible style that Sir Percy's engineer. In previous versions, intelligence was exempt, not technology. The letters of Margaret and Chaublein were not adequately portrayed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Explain. The director's explanation coincided with me, probably because of my poor character, I did not get bored. <br /> <br /> I like the version since 1982. Anthony Andrews is very unreasonable, calm, khanjakhan So Jane Semur and Ian McCain. In my opinion, pieces of this time piece seem to have lost with this latest adaption. I recommend sticking to the previous version, either one from 1934 or one from 1982. <br /> <br />
