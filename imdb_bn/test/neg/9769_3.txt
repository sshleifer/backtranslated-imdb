I'm going to be generous here and it's going to give it 3 for living in Huntsville and it was great to see how beautiful the city was. That said, this movie was quite bad. It seems that they have started with a script, and directed the director to keep an eye on each other meaningally with each other. And Billy D. Williams believed that he wanted to be anywhere but in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I can write a script for this movie better, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> I mentioned one thing across a review and message board - the idea of ​​starting this movie around the First World War under all and it was about to begin in the late 1950s or early 1960's. The military was not isolated until now, I'm sure the soldiers waiting for a train train will still be separated into a place like Huntsville, Al. If the beginning of the film is supposed to have been introduced in the early 1940s, then Billy D, Leslie Anne and Ray Don will have to live in the 70s and 80s instead of the 70's or 60's. <br /> <br /> Don 'you really love the actor, because the story is not very interesting, if your time is not wasted.
