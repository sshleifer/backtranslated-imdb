Who really wants to see? Disgusting violence, hateful sex for so long. I do not want to, but I was always bad about my philosophy because it seems to be bad for any movie. It was hard ("next Friday" later on). <br /> <br /> It's basically just shit. How can you possibly call something else? A Roman emperor story as an excuse for Gore and T. A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they've been like this." Okay, but why bother with us? I do not care if it's been good (and many scenes where I really doubt). Dot, why would anyone want to see it? The problem is that the film is the only reason to choose and it is you would like violence. There is nothing special about it, only cruelty. You can say "cool!" You want to say splatter-slasher-movie But with violence, horror movies can give you at least chill and excitement, probably the letters that you care about. But here everything is dark, dull and boring. Each character is crazy. "An emperor story that can not deal with its power". What? In the very first scene, she nude with her sisters naked! I have no problem that we saw a madman for 2/1 hours. <br /> <br /> But you saw Helen Mirren pregnant and dancing. Or look at some 5-minute hardcore scenes as a movie message. Or imagine, all right, was fun! The real birth scene, how the sunshine! Let people, animals, those who care, treat them as toys only. <br /> <br /> I do not care about anyone, I do not care, it's not a movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, frustrating and hateful. If you want sex or want to see a violent flash, go to a porn movie if you want envy. At least those movies do not pretend to show some artistic skills. And they are small. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1 + - 6-)] [0/4]
