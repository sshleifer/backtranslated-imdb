Just awful I'm just including a spoiler alert here to include a Kuply Jokes from a movie - there's nothing else to loot, as it's already rotten. This drawer should have been one of the vendors "A Few Dollars for More" period, when he would take part in some negotiations for some fools. I saw it as a 15-year high school student in 1972, and then loathed it. It needs to see again; After 35 years, I think that I now saw this as one of the shortest five bad films. I think, the vendors were more in the role of the ongoing camie than a lead here, but even his presence could not be improved even drunk jokes, lame plot, and infantile repartee. A moving theme surrounds the use of his fingers to the seller: In one scene, he holds his hands in a group of doctors and folds his fingers, defines a group for which one is in the hospital - interns, nurses, administrators, etc. - as long as Until the middle of his fingers is left, where he says "... and patients!" Rate rate. To avoid costly test, he drank his finger in the urine sample and gave the stick in his mouth to check the sugar, and then advised the detainees around him to do the same work. Then he advised them that he should keep his middle fingers in urine, but he would impose on the fingers of the index and advise them to pay attention. Hey Hey (This is the only reason I think, and this movie, and writing this review, a friend tells me a date version of this 'trick'). If you leak this, you will run unrest. If not, see George C Scott (the same year in 1972) 'hospital' for some genuine, wonderful black medical humor. Even better, read Samuel Sheem's 'The House of God', and if you can, check out its movie version, which has never been published (please make a copy and send it to me - I'll finally see it).
