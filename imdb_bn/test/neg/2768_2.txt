I could not make head or tail from silent film silent. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, it was okay, but the quality of the photo was awful! Walmart bought "Gansar's Double Pack" for $ 5.50 (8 movies in two disks) and when you keep the DVD, then some pictures of the pictures are apologized for the terrible image quality. <br /> <br> The plot was flowing everywhere, I did not understand what was going on ... Then the "last" popped up and the movie was over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, or if you have bought this Gnoster Double Pack then exclude this one. .. <br /> <br /> 2/10
