One of the worst movies I've ever seen is one. When I was trying to see it, my flu was there and I was open to any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately this was too much. How can one movie be completely ungifted? This movie makes pornographic look like European art-movie. Cast speaks only their lines without any emotion; Thanks to Charlie Snoos (Beldwin), who spoke about her separation, the rest of us talk about the weather. Just terrible (and funny) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
