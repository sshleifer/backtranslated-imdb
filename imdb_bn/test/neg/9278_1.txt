It should sometimes be the most insulting abuse of the term comedy. This is not just funny, and in order to ask a few questions at the Bible Office, Leopard writers must try to use the name of the TV series. The film does not look far as far as sexual stimulation (no average achievement), and it has all the charisma of a corpse with Regmorts. I'm afraid of a complete washout !!
