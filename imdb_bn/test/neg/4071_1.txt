Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment Just like Hong Kong full of Antonio Sabato Junior and there is nothing except unexpected wine from his mouth. I am in the 95% dialogue! It would have been good to mute the character! How can some physical functions speak line without losing control Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare beyond me! If the character of Mitchell's foot is more than a sentence or sentence with the word 'main', then I think I've cast iron through the TV set (I love multitas - especially bad movies). Signing up for this movie will be an awkward year for both. Washing the car for a living will probably be pretty good by them. And bad guy ...... if she is so bad, she does not shoot all the rich college kids instead of pledging a break in the toilet. Even the title was a misnomer. A 'crash landing' means the plane is actually upset and even a token fire or a wounded person does not make it landless. Instead of landing safely, the plane should crash and burn like a script. <br /> <br /> This movie sticker!
