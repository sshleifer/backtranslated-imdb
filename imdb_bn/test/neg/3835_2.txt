I accept it now It's one of the ever made Lamest films. But, Mr. Szogenez's defense, "not really" -Sissin was not all bad! To love Sweden's way to Sweden on the way to 15-year-old Swedish Soviet sweet Swedish, Sweden will have to speak Swedish as Henry (Dennis Hopper's Jewish mother). <br /> <br /> This scene makes it so perfect that Henry's father answers a Swedish-speaking (Jewish?) girl in Germany ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Care of Henry's mother This must be a nun, it's a woman who did not have the experience of acting, but still keeps her strongest performance! <br /> <br /> All and all the Flickr nostalgia for me personally, it did me a post in the database: IMDb. : D <br /> <br /> // Like Faylein Movie Star *
