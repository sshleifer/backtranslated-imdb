Stars: Hayden Pantier <br /> <br /> There are so many movies that have this same plot, and this is a poor reheashing of it. Populer white girl comes to ethnic school, is fit, is soon to be taken. The basicity is nonexistent in this, and not the smile. It uses annoying many old weak executioners. Why I do not know why it is a good idea to make video signals in medieval movies, but not so. That said, positive in that all people are fairly capable actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** Out. PG-13 for language and sexual humor
