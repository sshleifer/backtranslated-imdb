Just watched this movie last night. I think it's a freedom campaign and if I want to be honest I have seen it again, then perhaps I was not so liberal. I hate hype, it can destroy a movie. I think the film has highlighted the character and gave importance to Woody. He was very good - although he is surprised whether he is throwing stones all the time. It did not go too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character ended up in me. To me he should be more contradictory with Demi - throwing him out or telling him that he has been paid. Before the proposal, he could investigate - which was not shown in the film, but none of his felt position gave any proposal to anyone. He was cruel to them, and the last straw was the house, and yet the demy fell for him? Episodes that gave insight into the relationship between Demi and Woodie were the best part of the film. There was a deep depth of outshone that the role of John Gazez's assassination. He could have been really strong and other people said that the movie draw card was Redford and they did not want to destroy their "image". I said Robert is old in this movie! The characters of Woody and Demi were naive in a sense, but I think they were very much inclined to attract you to their disaster and to be their champions in their decision. But the reality is, they lost their dream house and where did they go? Las Vegas? To make jamal what they kept and then took an offer from a rich rich billionaiire. Redford found their proximity while making them very little unrealistic. The movie could have been so much and other actors could make a difference, but said that on late night TV - it was enjoyable and if you do not think too much - also playable
