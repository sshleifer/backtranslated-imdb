I saw this lover with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can see it is made cheaply. With badly written and very bad acting. I've read different versions of the authors and heard a version of the audio book. We could not make the film unimportant because it should be lacking. The experience of this viewing was Blair Witch Green Access. Then the part was that was indecent. They see this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. The magician spreads his content on the boy and the whole family laughs. I was terrible and very weird. No one can understand why it would be entertaining. It shows another scene where Dr Midge arrives and Batessel Bell pisses his clothes in his house step in front of his mother and brothers. Instead of the mother, her brother stopped him. How sick The little boy in the visible first scene asks for toilet paper and goes out of the house and gives pleasure to the sick face with sound effects. I think they should have all that left. Reverend James Johnston's makeup as an adult does not really make you feel old. Do you think it was dipped in the fish batter. Joshua Gardner's blood is worse when he fell from the stairs. John Bail's death scene looks like they have gone out of the way and tried to do something to show him a serious sick person. There was a fall in this photo to many sick comedies involving bathroom problems and inexperienced people. These people will do better if they use commercial movies for local TV stations for products in the bathroom. They have chosen a good thing and are unable to make it properly. I rated this film capital F minus rate.
