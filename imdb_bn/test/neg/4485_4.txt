I was talking in to see it by a girlfriend .. John looks great with a good guy, sweet, sensitive and no shirt !! I had a love story about it both, but it was mainly about his response to his character. Sabhana was a favorite character in the beginning of the film, but once I dumped him, I paid tribute to him. He said, to remove his isolation from him and it was difficult - he was one hundred miles away, he killed man and through his letter he got only the contact !!! He was not difficult, he had family and money and he did it! When I forgave him, I was very frustrated - he had so much love. I waited three years and welcomed him with open arms.
