Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I'm drawing attention it was a trailer and not a cartel. <br /> <br /> The video I play is about killing people in the film and living forever. <br /> <br /> The first horrible movie, the blood is less or less blurred (spreading gossip), these scenes have become worse. <br /> <br /> But really (in fact) this film is very bad, very bad, but all aspects are bad. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to anyone, trailer is good, movies are bad <br /> <br /> I spend (and spend) these stupid movies and doing very bad things (like).
