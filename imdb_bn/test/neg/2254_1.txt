Critically frustrated by Brad Pitt and QT, this plot is very godly and hair, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorifies the Nazis and portrays a man of honor, and the Jewish people are deceiving, can not promise, and show bloody harmful . (Including follow-up spinners) Hitler is unbelievably ridiculous joining a stupid plot to kill 300 Italian soldiers in a small movie theater in Paris together with the most infamous Nazis. The Nazis are happy and enjoying every kill in the movie, such as seeing a basketball game Stupid, finally the deal is Lum. Really displeased the movie has achieved great reviews and has been ranked among the 40 greatest 250 films. Many awards will not be surprised even with the Oscars. The film is a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but Hey reconsidered, it is not doing a great job. It totally condemned the Nazi-Jewish conflict and each other, who had been freed from Nazi persecution and suffered.
