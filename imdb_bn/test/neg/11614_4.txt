After starting an curiosity, this short drama descends quickly into the ranks of mere mediocrity. At the beginning of the film two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet each other when their lovers wait to return home from their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a lovely looking actress, and she plays Louise; An intelligent girl whose favorite lover is a round entertainer; Music, movie you name it, he does it. He is telling another girl, Karla (Heather Graham) about her wonderful lover, it soon became clear that she has many similarities between the friendships of two men ... and it is clear that these two daughters are dating the same person. Oh dear Robert Donny enters the JNR, a sledge with two girlfriends and some poor people to go anywhere. Danny plays such people that women like, but men find annoying boring; He, basically, is a Mummy's son. The worst kind is too; Always call the phone on the phone, and keep the girl ambitious (even if empty) with the promise repeatedly. It is enough to make the normal person sick. <br /> <br /> This picture closes the three-way love triangle. Movies such as Jules et Gym This film does not work though; For most reasons it is incredible for the story that is the reason. Seriously, if two women find that they are dating the same person ... they will not rush to talk about this. Another reason why it falls down is that it's just so turgid. There is no possibility of the outcome of this situation by presenting this film, especially with Clusterophobia to establish it in a small apartment; But all the movies are lost in dialogue; That badly written and poorly distributed dialogue The film is widely overacted; It is not only believable that people will find work in this movie after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Doni Jr. is a lot of things lost in the film. With natural birth killers, he proved that he can offer wildly recreational performances, and this movie can do something like that. Two women are not lost because no one expects anything from them, but Danny can use it more effectively. Overall? Time wasted Do not be disturbed, instead look for juals and gym or natural birth killers. This is my advice.
