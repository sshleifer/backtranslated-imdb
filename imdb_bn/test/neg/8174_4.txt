OK, here it is short ... This movie is full of most conversations, top performers and a threadbare script. <br /> <br /> Moments that can be very dramatic but will easily become laughable because the above-mentioned and poorly written lines I could not help to smile at the moment that I was meant to be very serious. This movie is a bright spot circus. There was certainly a treat during the morning to see the circus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then it returned to the B-movie region directly to N-Movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It will be a slow year!
