Feature of any freedom fighter, this film trash. Do not start to be funny in his joke. Humor is unfortunate for children, and attempts to appeal to adults only add a sticky smog to the sad package. Sitting through it with my kids just make me uncomfortable about what's coming next. I could not enjoy the film Although my child bought the DVD, he enjoyed it even though he owned a new DVD, but he or his sisters did not even want to see it again, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King etc. Get frequent requests for duplication.
