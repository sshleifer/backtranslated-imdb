The Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad's heart is dark, deep, and very deep. The way I have to read the novel is way better way than the movie. Mr. Malcolm has played the role. Cartz was completely a partner. He fit the character of "mouse and men". The movie excludes the main parts of the human body which I think is important to get the true message of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie was edited badly. It looks a lot of non-critical and annoying flashes. This is a very suspicious environment in the novel, but the film lacks its feeling. There was so much left for the reader to imagine the book. For example, when Marlowe spent uninterrupted hours and days waiting for Reuters and the scene was dropped from the film. In the novel, Marlowe waited a long time for Rivets to fix his boat. It was a big source of novelity in the novel. The film adds more parts that are useless and not kind. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book, and Curtz bowed the monkey and killed him. In this way everything is destroyed, I have no idea. So do not see my suggestion movie, just read the book. You will understand more and get a better explanation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
