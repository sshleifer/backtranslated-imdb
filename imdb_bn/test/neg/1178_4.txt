There are many reasons why I'm not actually supportive of the film based, but filmmakers are more than any other than giving creative licenses to the story. If they have such great imagination, why not use such talent? Otherwise the facts stick. They could only have a good movie if they were just that job. Ed Gein was an insane horror man. It has been said that if you take Michael Mayrece, Jason Vauresh and Leatherface, then wrap him in one person, Ed gin will still be sick / scared. Then someone can not make a movie about him that can reveal this? When they portray reality, they will be horrifying until the end? <br /> <br /> I read the book and saw the news program about it and now I am not a figure writer, but I believe there is enough documentation on gyne that it will not take much for writing. Created that has never been documented. I know that he was only guilty of 2 murders, but instead of using deputies with his mother in his house and with all the proofs he got in Berner, there should have been many other ways to keep this film together and filler as a girlfriend, and it is much more. <br /> <br /> I wonder what I'm thinking is this ... Why did I know more about supplementary letters at the end of this movie, which I did more than ad gene? Why did not we know the relationship between his mother, father, and brother and him ... what psychology did he make him ... Did he become the child he had abused, the child he contributed to? Instead, from our childhood we shone him as the only little boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it was bad casting in my opinion, though Ziine was a small person, and perhaps the little girl is small and somewhere younger than anywhere else considering the girls. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Bhurishis.
