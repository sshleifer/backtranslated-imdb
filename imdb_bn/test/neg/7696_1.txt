This is a true Saudi feature which is shown in the movie theater, but it is not in Saudi Arabia, because we do not have a movie theater in our big state .. Not only a movie theater! After the Islamic extremists, the government banned the opening of the theater or religious police (or both) in the late 1970s and early 1980's to stop it. Promotes false sex and similar things to the 7th art. See a strong reason why we do not skip movie theater !! ..We keep many video stores across the state, we watch movies on TV in some satellite channels, we can install "showtime" channels set up and generally all movies seem innocent in many ways .. I know how many people go to neighboring countries only a few movies to see. I personally visited Bahrain several times to watch movies in theater because it has great fun watching a movie home. Saudis provide the world's most expensive movie tickets, we travel to watch movies, and every city in the rest of the world has a movie theater. This is one of the problems we are having! <br /> <br /> This image is produced and produced by Ronald Filmed Entertainment, a leading body of Saudi tycoon-Prince Alwaleed bin Talal (world's 8th richest). <br /> <br> The film title literally means "how are you?" But it is a distress meant "what is going on!", Sometimes used as uncomfortable for something "bad" and sometimes used as a slang to remember his business and not to interfere in other cases. Anyway, I think they meant (how are they) and at the same time I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actors like Hisham Abdul Rah in Saudi Arabia, who are very famous and have more popularity after getting 1st Prize in Arab Reality by showing more shows like "American Idol", like the Arab version of "Cash Taxi" Some TV programs work .. Other famous actors Khaled Sami is a funny and very funny sense of humor .. Mishal al-Muttari, Turkish al-Yus Q and Ali al Sabella other actors less famous works, and they show some of the TV series. Female actresses are non-Saudi and they did very well in Saudi accent. Jordanian actress Mike Hamdan plays the role of leadership and actress Fatima al-Hawasani .. Not our Saudi actress but there is nothing like this good. Saudi commentator King Al-Muttariyy, who wrote the Aliyyad Newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the state), wrote: "Most of the movie does not expect the first Saudi feature, it is born in unusual circumstances, Can not judge under normal standards like film. It is true that the film is the first movie on the opening day of Bahraini The success of the movie is fresh and a Saudi family deal on controversial new issues within Saudi society: such as women driving, less shallow thoughts about art, guardianship of the particular community and conservative and one of the extremists. It seems to be missing in the middle. One of the advantages of the film is Raji Daud The beautiful music score of which was good but sometimes it does not reveal what does not match in the film.Turkey Al-Yusuf did a great job, his performance was as well as the best actor alongside Mais Hamdan.Hisam Abdullahman, the biggest hit actor, Mutairee, Ali al-Sabayyah, and Khaled Sami who work well in the limits of their role. <br /> <br /> After all, Caf√© Al-Hal? Even all its difficulties are still a good film and it is the first step in Rotana. This and the film have become human and street lectures which is a golden goal for general debate about the Saudi film's film. Until the information about the importance of the 7th art and other industries is "<br /> PS: Another Saudi filmmaker" Abdullah Alamhasen "claims that he conducted the first Saudi film titled" Shadow of Silence ". << br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie yet .. I hope I was helpful.
