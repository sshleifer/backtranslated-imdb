What a stupid frustration Forget this unreal movie and instead get the TV series. In the world, they are making America's president more barbaric? All politicians should have bumped BFF (Peter Cook is good as British Prime Minister). It's a satirical deficit, instead of going for the "lowest common index" slapstick. If I'm generous, 1 out of 10! Unfortunately, this is another example of a rebuilding that completely misses the point of origin, the difference between them was written by the same person.
