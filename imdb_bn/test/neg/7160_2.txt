This picture was strongly recommended, a great fan of Brendo, I ordered this image from Harrogos and was waiting to be concerned. I was rarely frustrated by a film. Brando was as good as a German officer but the rest of the film was helpless. You will never be able to take care of a favorite letter (except the bando). Acting was right. Story, what story? Possibly that dot. It's all after war, but I saw so many good fight films. (Arab Lawrence, Apocalypto, even Star Wars) It was so annoying that I was checking my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I saw it as one of the worst movies. Please do not waste your time and money on this. I can also add that I wrote this first user comment, I just had to tell my feelings about this movie. However, my favorite time is: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, One Flew Over Kaku Nest, Paul Fiction and Ames. If you have not seen them yet, please do so at the time. And Amadeus WideScreen will be 2.35: 1
