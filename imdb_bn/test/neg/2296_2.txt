Calling this movie a decent or enjoyable awful tribute is very optimistic. Hack, you can not even refer to its genera as a spoof because it is way less than average (it's funny, but "lol, you do not know"). But I still want to see it. Only for a large number of triangle elements. However, those who complain about the film about their allegations only blame themselves. When you see the DVD-cover of this movie, you must know, for example, it is not going to be on the same level as "piano", so do not complain later ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed might be something But it can shake completely. I think the main idea behind this movie is the threat to the 'cutting-committee' nowadays. It shows an editor named Edward who is gradually being destroyed by all the violence and cow pictures in the film (well, very slow). Big company name is named Sam Campbell ... funny, is not it? Personally I also expected the character Bruce Raimi, but I did not have the generosity. However, this guy has become rich by making a movie named "Luge Limbs". They feature (and I'm not kidding you!) Scenes where a girl is being raped by a beaver (?) And then gets shot s shot by a bazooka !!! Now, who is not terrible anymore? <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe with all the cows and 'loose states' but it really becomes very annoying. After a decent in the first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into complete annoyance and does not recovers from that. Only after thinking, for the other obvious references (of course, without pushing the object-button) to the rest (looking for the better-known horror movies). Apparently I saw the scene stolen from Evil Dead, Lamb's silence, branded and others. And as well as there is a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls for praise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In Sweden. I'm sure there are lots of talent in it, answer answers (for example, Danish "NativeVigtan") ... but none of them joined the Evil Ed cast or crew. Not only do you want to see if you have a stupid mood and you do not want to use all of your brain.
