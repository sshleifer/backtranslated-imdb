Well, I usually like Iranian movies, and after seeing Kirstami before night "After watching" 10, I hope to be a great movie. I was very frustrated. So far, the worst Iranian movie, and one of the most annoying Asian movies I have ever seen. If you do not see any kirastami movie before, see "ten" instead. If you want some good Iranian movies you can try "seb", ur "apple" This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only fourth, featuring some funny features, worth seeing. If you see that this is the first Iranian movie, you probably will not want to see it again. I do not blame you, but you will miss some great movies.
