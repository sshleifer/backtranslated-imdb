It looks like it's in my local blockbuster and I was weird. I like movies about mythological creatures I like movies about venufoles, vampires, jammy etc. It is a semi-colored, half-leopard creature of half the people who like Africans. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful! The actor is terrible! No scripts! It is all reform! The whole thing is illustrated in the night because they say that once you see it. It's clear bull * * Sleep! They make it awesome at night to film. But, they failed to fear me. After the first person was killed, I put this case again and took it back to Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Now you are probably saying that if I do not finish it, then I do not have the right to review the film. Well, this is one of the movies which was not worth seeing all the way. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars are really BAD!
