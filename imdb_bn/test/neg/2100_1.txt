Sun-on-A-Train is a movie which I think is a movie that is due to the pure pleasure of my thinking, about the film. Snakes were an enjoyable action film on a plane, so perhaps this filmmaker wanted to successfully earn cash with this low budget effort. In 85 minutes, train snakes are almost helpless to the witness. Due to the lack of film events, I had to stop filming for myself to do something entertaining. Throughout the duration of the film, this girl's curse why and why she keeps this green / purple cough cough can not be completely explained. Not only that, there are annoying dialogue on how the two main characters, Brazzo and Alma will discuss how to rid themselves of this curse. I can appreciate making low budget film. I really do not like movies, I'm open for any type of budget, but the Snake-Anne Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. At the end of this photo was the writer of acid or something? Why did the girl suddenly become a monster snake? And most importantly how was it able to eat the train on earth? <br /> <br /> below. Snakes on a train are a movie which should be avoided at all costs. I'm not as intrigued by the title, this is a movie that is serious bad. Let's relax these snakes. <br /> <br /> 0/10
