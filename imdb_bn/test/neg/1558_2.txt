Zarkorr is a bad movie. It's not even worse to rate its good division. It's just bad. (Lack of design), from special effects to acting, stinks everything about this movie. For beginners, the film seems to have been portrayed only in empty rooms, and some props were thrown to look good. Then we play that it is so bad that it looks like an Oscar candidate like high school. And top of it all, special effects that are so bad that they pulled them off in their garage like an amateur. The cities that seem to be monsters are like my nephew train sets. So they might screaming to the audience, perhaps the fake. The only good thing about the movie is the giant case. It is so bad that they spent all their budget and there is nothing left for the rest of the film. And probably helped a decent script.
