^^ There are spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is a big shit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no one else in this picture, without a wife or even if she wants Win Everyone is selfish, and many things do not create any sense. <br /> <br /> The role is very heavy on everything from medium to medium and above everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />> For example, I left the room for a second, when Jenny Garth's character was asleep with her manager. I returned seriously after about 4 minutes (I'm sure there was no commercial) and he was sleeping with the Berco people. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie that Barco was his drunk ass in his car because he did not want to stop the marriage. <br /> <br /> I wasted 2 hours of my life. You should not have
