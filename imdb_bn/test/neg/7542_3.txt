Even after creating this image (I think it was a good idea to think that Bottom was so popular) One thing that confused me with the Guest House Paradiso was that it happened in the light? There is no artificial light used in this movie and I have seen it on the network TV, so it was not about viewing a DG tape. Indeed, it was impossible to see the picture shot in so dark. But if the conversation is something like this then it is probably not a bad thing
