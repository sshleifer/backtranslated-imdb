This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Out of the start, 'DOA' starts at least as if it is part of the camouflage, like Funcher's 'game', entertainment. It is suffocated from a wonderful sequence displayed for central character (Dennis Quaid) to set up a wonderful and intelligent thriller. But the plot spreads rapidly, causing the dramatic curve not to cross halfway, when the character learns that he has become toxic and it is only 1-2 days to stay alive. And this, simply, a twist too large for adding a story unexpected. Once this happens, the only chance for the success of the film is if it is a situation in which a person's psychology is considered to be his main subject, in fact: 'D.O.A.' It seems like this is a normal revelation that you might face in a thriller. The problem is twofold: firstly, its actions in the works will not ensure the possibility of its condition; And secondly, even if they are convincing, it is difficult to care about what will happen next, when the most significant point of the plot has already been resolved prematurely. The rest of the movie is an ideal map for this type of movie rental, but the character's little-treatment makes it more turbulent than usual by accident, which rationally explains the events that interest the movie. Dennis Kaid played a major role. Not as pleased as a burnt professor or as a man determined to die: Meg Ryan, Often, ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature ugly 80s soundtrack. Instead of 'play' see, which tightens from similar roots and driven the character, where 'DOA' drifts into development that only falls on its own premises. Curiosity itself is quite curious, shame on seeing it drowned in a surplus of shameful plot.
