Farcek has been very much appreciated, but I do not think that it is good. It certainly has a distinct look, but it lacks everything else: stories, motives, aspects, excitement; You name it. I'm a big science-fan fan, and I think it can make a point to see all sci-fi shows. I've often finished the Parsecs four seasons, and at the moment I'm not very satisfied. There are some good things in the show - especially Claudia Black (who are absent from the first paragraph of the first four episodes in the season) - but they are very few and very few. Overall the show is deadly by very stupid stuff (such as fantasy elements instead of SF Dieto), and many episodes, esp. Season four is uncertainly dirty and very weakly structured. And one does not think it's just going anywhere. It is mostly thin, long running plot lines with unpredictable events which gradually develops. Well, sometimes it's a bit more difficult, but it lasts for very few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> Effective, there are some fascinating things here and there (occasionally esp. in space), but the ceremony seems to be stuck in the same style, which gets totally old quick. Miracles and vague pupils make a great deal of alien shotguns and I like them (up to the mountain) where regular people's face characters are focused. <br /> <br /> I think peacekeepers show away the most stylish and playful and interesting figures; They are successful in being a believer foreign culture, despite the appearance of all their people. There are a few really cool episodes with them, esp. In the first season (IIRC), where Criston forces the peacekeeper as a captain, and attacks and eventually destroys one of their secret places. These episodes can reach 8 ratings out of 10, but I can not reward more than "4" ratings. <br /> <br /> As well as peacekeepers (which is somewhat single psychological) the omnipotent and militarist really nuanced), the show simply does not give you some important or significant offers to know or see. That too, there are some good ideas and this is not total loss. <br /> <br /> This is my opinion, of course, but as a science-fan fan in a brain, I think it can be calculated for doing something and helping others. There are not many good scientists; But Star Trek (a series) and especially the new Baltalist is definitely better than Galactica Farscans. But if you are a great fan of medieval science-frees, you may also like Fars. My rating: 4 out of 10
