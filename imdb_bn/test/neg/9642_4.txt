Acting, heavy handed, full of lectures, circulated on the nose, and stylized at a way may only be guilty of MTV, the loss of stop loss is prop from the garbage. I have hoped a lot with talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Phillip, but screen writer / director Kimberly Perris has done a hat-trick to portray the bad effects of the war against American youth. I'm sure he's doing some work in Iraq for war and young war, but you do not guess by seeing stop-loss. In many ways this mess reminds me of Catherine Hardwick's Lords of Downtown, it is also equally inefficient, extremely styled, hard material waste like TV movie. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
