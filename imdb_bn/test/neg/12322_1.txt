Well the previews looked funny and I usually do not know well with my kids, especially during the night .... Here is a movie that does not apply to children or adults because the kids are very annoying for children and are completely flat for entertainment for adults. I was really embarrassed with my 9th and 6th year and I was explaining my 6 year old SH * spell. Here is what happened to Dr. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry children's mother for her money. If it was a mistress, maybe it was great, but it became a big plot around the whole film and "cat" played a hypothetical role to reveal the neighbor publicly to the mother. Take my advice and read the book and pass the movie.
