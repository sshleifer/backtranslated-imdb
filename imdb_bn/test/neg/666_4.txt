The first official release of the film section of the World Wrestling Entertainment is a fantastic fundamental horror / slasher film by Cain performing "CE no Evil". Their horoscope, hard-walking moves, and convoluted backstories in maximum one wrestling among their big male wrestlers. And do not pull any punches here; Although the film is promoted as the greatest horror film of all time (mostly by WWWY), it is not saying that after seeing this movie I can confirm it as the greatest comedy of all time. <br /> <br /> "See no evil" to see a bunch of juvenile criminals sent to a hotel so that they can be cleared. Of course, a demon killer (played by Cain) will also be living in this hotel and we all know where to go. In the early 1980's, Slashar's Flickr has the majority of the similarities and structures, with most of the clich√©s being intact without having much to do with the film plot, but they are associated with the shades. And see that the main problem with "View No Evil". It tries many techniques to predict by predictions that predicted as predecessors; The fearful horror fans can easily recognize the hostages some time ago and even those who saw some flicks should know what will happen next. It's very generic to be scary. <br /> <br /> The glory of the film, no doubt, but it is only for the impact. The dark atmosphere of the movie begins with the feeling of terrorism at the beginning, but when you are going to the end, it leaves the place somehow and gets tired quickly. Death scenes do not come as sunny and horrible as they seem ridiculous, although some of them are quite inventive. <br /> <br /> And this movie is also very bad, as the main characters are not sufficiently enhanced for us when they finally get axed. Some can not properly show fear; They just cry and cry a vain attempt to emote. So when they die, it just adds a comedy, because you do not care enough about them that you consider them only equivalent to the Starfleet Redshirt of Russia. <br /> <br /> As Kane, she portrayed her character in the same way that she portrays the character of her film, only using axes and hooks instead of hell and sulfur. There is no doubt in my mind that Cain can be a great stability in the awful style. Has his appearance and appearance; He is only required to work with good material (especially a script that no person wrote on the wrestling show). <br /> <br /> Now, though it seems like a strong criticism, I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of the laughable movies that you can not help but sit and enjoy. My main key to filming is, again, it is only a poor film shooting exercise and there is no horrible or shocking moment in it. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to smile a bit of scary moments in the movie. If it seems to be so, the movie has been given a higher rating. But it's not. It gets a smile because it is a B-movie and it does not help the director with previous experiences in pornography and music videos. Whatever is just the right thing to do directly. However, I've enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> If you do not think of a funny movie or a movie, I would highly recommend "There is no harm." If you are really genre of this genre, then I will wait before decrying the DVD before testing it. Everyone else will probably go watch something else.
