All right, so I'm asking to start this review that I've been looking forward to seeing this flick for a few months now, I think its trailer and it looks really cool .... I do not know that the only cool thing about this cliché-powered Turkish was just her trailer. In the film, I saw the first 3 frames of this movie, and even though "To me, this film is not so bad in any way, do not be fooled by an opportunity! You just watched 3 minutes" when I was shaking my eyes in shame. All the frames have been shown .... get it .... a guy with a poker face (because he thinks nothing .... that deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. In the second or third, he is awake to his fully groomed bedroom (because he is sleeping like a dead man ... because he does not mind), and calls his father, "John Garden State, I, your father" .... Oh oh! "I, your (inserting father)", as I would like to respond, is that I want to react ??: "Oh, he has a very strong relationship with him" .... Oh ... yes, Just how do I want to respond .... <br /> <br /> People, this is a painful movie ... Since <br />, Falik continues, we are talking about his friends Learn, each of which is a separate OEM Walking India Movie Clé F. For example, one of his contacts who works at a medieval theme restaurant who speaks Klingon (Victory Letter + Pop Culture = Your Ideal American Indy Flick) Then we know the character of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alisa Jones (a movie from GS, Chasing Emmy), Amelie and the father of the father-in-law Sunshine ... You know, smart, real (not true), beautiful, and beautiful. .. Contact with her sexuality (!). He listened to some band called 'Shins' and ... what? They are from this extraordinary decade? Then why do they sound like that? Oh, they have no personality, all right ... so he took his CD player in John Garden State and saw him in the face of a mobile phone (you know, loves). As you can hear, I heard these songs, "I would love this soundtrack, it is very substitute and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation, even the ideological photocopies of the breakfast club, in the past 20 years, Ghost World and Other smart movies, you can not drink coffee and read books that you do not understand "... <br /> <br /> Now Ryanta, there really is not unreasonable! ... if he dies in an aircraft accident, he does not make any difference to him (because he is already dead ... and he does not feel anything), and he can tell us from a visible concept that is directly known as an unknown movie! !!, it's a cool scene but oh, did I see it in the troll? ....... Then in some parties, and when you think that this guy is really deep and unreasonable, so ... Oh, he does not like such a mental zombie after all .... The development of cute character or just A sh! TTY movie? ...... Well, that lets analyze the scene, it features him with motionlessness, with a coupe moving at all really fast pace ...... The concept of challenge is known as a Dream which is taken directly from an unknown movie ! So just a sh! tty, sh! tty movie ... <br /> <br /> They then fill more toxic (close-up, actually) letters, and finally, on the ground with a big hole. John Garden State says, "Good luck by exploring your infinite shallow" and the guy is saying ... and so far I wanted to spin myself, "You" ............. and then we Gradually said that Neo Jesus .... Oh no, wait, another fool, clear, repetitive, too much and miserable crab piece <br /> <br /> Finally (finally !!!), some more shit happen And he has a big warehouse showdown to overcome the bomb He entered: He tried to talk to his father, who did not see him in the last few years because he (his wife) was murdered by the last cousin. .. (You see, he killed his mother, so he died ... ... and did not feel anything ... that deep). Now I'm really smart and hope to keep a conversation between a father and son like Magnolia ... ... but it's Garden State, so it's pretty beautiful: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you do not know What do you do when you have been disturbed me for a hundred years, but I know that you love me - Koppey's father's father: no !!! No !!!! I'll call some simple stuff because I'm not so deep in any character, actually this is like this movie, so do not !!!! -John Garden State: Father, we will always carry us because we are the same person ... ................................ .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ..................... !!!! ............ OK, you believe in me. <br /> <br /> She gets the girl (because she does not die, you know) and the movie ends and I go and eat a piece of chicken which makes my day. <br /> <br /> This made-for-trailer movie sucks
