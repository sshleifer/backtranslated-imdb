From what I understand, Mr. Bava has abandoned this project before completing ... and the creator !!! If I were him, it would surely be certain that every copy was burnt and in the future someone asked me about this movie ... it never happened and it never happened ... the end of the story <br /> <br /> Despite some great set and good photography, it's a horror movie ... Can it be horrific? (Not least) is it supposed to be funny ?? (Pau-lace) total waste of time ... and I do not really want to say !!
