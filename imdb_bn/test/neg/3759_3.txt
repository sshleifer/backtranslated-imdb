I fully understand the historical significance of Rockets X X, but it's not a good movie. To get started, the plot (or its key) is dull and lifeless. Five explosions closed for the moonlight moon ?? They must be closed and ended in Mars (huh?) ?? Caviman looking Martin throw stones at them ?? Do they come back to Earth and meet a fiery death ?? The end Believe it or not, but this pithy plot description makes it really much more interesting. To make matters even worse, John Emery's character, Dr. Karl Ikstrom, thinks that people have long been able to talk about everything from the dangers of nuclear weapons in nature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I can give some examples, for example, but male champion pilot floyd (acting annoying, played by plastic-laden Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (In the middle of the female only) and Floyd's frequent strange object of attention) that the film's attitude towards women is quite beautiful Hugging: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I'm surprised, a girl like you was mixed with something like this." <br /> <br /> Van Horn: "I think you think that only women should cook and should be sewed and bear children." <br /> <br /> Floyd: "Not enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd's cave should have been there!
