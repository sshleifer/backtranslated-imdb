The headline of this review about how I feel about this movie Not only that, in the 1980's Slashar films, everything was to be seen - if it is in this era, I will not go to any audience for this story. Otherwise, do not waste your time at this time. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to most of its type: Some of the scenes in the opening scene are a horror event, which inspires a bloody killer to go to a killer rampage. There, that was the job. The truth has been told that none of these 80 were known for their fundamentalities, so I can not see the point of horror just for the film. <br /> <br /> But where the film is failing, its mystery and murder sequence I saw some horrific slashing films of the 1980s, which had less budget. This one just fails to create any real mystery. The director threw some nice camera corners and some semi-professional directors touched here and there, but if you are not afraid then that does not mean anything. Gothi is also good, so anyone who looks for some of the makeup effects of this 1980's will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly to combine slowly. In fact, almost the main component of almost any slash is tight pacing - all you need to do is run fast and keep the pieces of assassination set at regular intervals, because we have to face it, we consider these things as great characters and star plots. But due to pacing, scripts or editor, all off. The murders spread to the interrupted break, we have some long windsight (no character is created to make "character") which only serve you as a sister and allow you to pray for further murder (which I have said, usually in any way It is not implemented. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He (or he?) Is a jogging case, a fence mask, and his (Or his?) At the primary weapon I wear a sword, and I told the writer that he woke himself up thinking of bringing a real, "cold" murder weapon, but the idea comes as unreal and silly. The film's "Hudanite" is not even emphasized in nature, as they forgot or left us. <br/> <br /> <br /> I have this meaning that people are somewhat modest behind it. Raddhasila tried to do, and sometimes, at the age of miracles is a quality film-making, as opposed to slyasara their purpose was probably more true. However, in most cases these attempts failed. However, some good performances (at least, for this kind of movie). There are attempts to characterize, but it does not end in some way, so ... what is the waste, everything is managed here, the plumbing and the continuous feelings of murder seem like they can not come quickly. <br /> <br /> Finally if you really think of the old '80's slash, all the way, check it only if you've seen it. There is a whole of us all. But it should not be expected or anything. What we do here is a very silent recreational slasher movie that leaves all of any real impressions.
