RKO was trying to encourage his starter Joan Fontaine when he threw him as a flying nurse, who was a doctor (John Bell) who was strong enough to move away from the responsibility of this little programmer. TCM promoted it as a stepping stone in the career of Joan Fontaine. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is sincere and an acceptable job, nothing, and John Bell is just like his love. But Philip Haston (who has the look and playful nature of James Garner), who shares the top billing with Fontane. Whatever this handsome actor is? Who did not preach with Fonkeen? He showed skills as a light comedian. <br /> <br /> Such thoughts went through my head because I saw this bad drama, which never lived up to its strong commitment to its title. The story itself is rather tiring, occasionally coming to life due to Fontaine's encouraged heroine. <br /> <br /> She nicely photographed and corresponds with her serious expressions, so that she needs to do more in the future. Date Beal does not visit a prominent career and shows why its performance here. <br /> <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Houston? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See Towel: Dual fries ("Dracula") outside the patient's control patient.
