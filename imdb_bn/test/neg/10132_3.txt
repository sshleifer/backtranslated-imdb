Nottlie Wood portrays a polio inactive song writer, Courtney Patterson, who is trying to avoid being damaged due to her first love affair, partner with actress Marcus Simon, who played cruelly through Wood's real life husband Robert Wagner. The film is extensively cut, but most of the rest of the scenes show a very weak hand from the director, who allows Wagner to sonababulate consistently, allowing hard and dirty work from Wood, who also receives a fine snap. This script is somewhat frustrating, but the continuous nature of Wagner's dramatic lacks is unfortunately in full, because he has been given an independent hand to impose his extravagant view on Wood, which must discourage an actress. The progress of their relationship has been misrepresented and it has been combined with sticky execution, directing the audience to be less than what it implies, the motivation is almost completely ignored in writing. Although in most cases obscure, cinematography is illuminated in a short sight when the wood is placed in a patio and after the word of a closed door, the camera's eyes finally show its helplessness and weakness. Actors in more controlled aspects will even be allowed to scale their acting even with the lax Wagner, an engaging relationship line; As it is released, in most parts, there is a immense lack of commitment.
