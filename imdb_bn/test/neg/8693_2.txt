Excellent efforts to make Shakespeare language alive in post-apocalyptic settings, but the final result is horrific. Predictive Liverpool is not believed at all; The budget was probably not too big, but the production designer could come up with a slightly more creative approach. Alex Kox has made some good films, such as Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I do not really know what he was thinking about here. Just an opinion.
