Looked pretty well and looking at the hit but could not help but it seems that Morris is featured here on most of the "actors" exploited. Stumbling around the nude in a narcotic stupor all seems to have been able to dallesandro in these properties - a huge and hearty contrast from flesh. His paraphrase of some scenes is the only indication that he is acting; In most cases, he sees something that he bought drugs. Woodlawn is a testimony that is okay - the statue of Lower East Side. But one of her female shows - she rarely is involved with other actors, but it can be said that her sex scene with beer bottle left Halle Berry in the shadow of a raw emotional film. When he pounces on a young man, the lover will be with it's ferocity of a vampire. Female actors, Andrea and Jane have two interesting voices, you need to mute the words to overcome their scenes. These actors have committed several suicides or are killed only a few years after the absorption wind is added. But perhaps they were frustrated to go before Morris's camera. Probably not a bad way to spend on Saturday night, but at least it brings a specific time and place to life clearly.
