I do not mind many of the issues that others have objected here - acting, lighting and so forth. In most cases, these things are made to carry the film and make it quite effective across the points. It's just a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> I had bugged myself on what points. Because it is a deep morality film, and morality is deeply strong. Actually it is actually fundamentalist Christian morality, and it is a fundamentalist Christian film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Mascin Wills, Preritti and many women look good for hijacking, among whom she has posed video. Oh, swine! <br /> <br /> * Roberts's father came back from Vietnam, so he was ashamed of being ashamed of being ashamed. Kill yourself Yes, what a terrible sin! Why did not he become drunk like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * And Bakon's character is preferred in other school's school. How horrible! He was probably a child apparently count for vain. Children, it seems, are judged by God according to adult standards. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe many people support this moral integrity. This seems to have been unmarked in comments on this movie. Not everyone just buy these things? At least human law treat children differently from adults, their ethical concept is partly formed. This photo has any kind of joke, and I'm quite offensive to that. Before the bad habits of young people, women are helpless, at the thought of atrocious animals. Or that Vietnam vet drug drug is driven so shameful that suicide is a legitimate option. Poorly
