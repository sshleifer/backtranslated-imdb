My wife and I could not even finish the movie. Verily, it was rather painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical accuracy is not compromised by incidents as a ridiculous one-dimensional character of the characters themselves. For example, Augustus simply takes "energy burden" with helplessness. Indeed, he is portrayed as some great humanist and believer such as democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, camp! My lord, the dialogue is horribly bad. When I had a better conversation than my child, my mother remembered the soap opera. On the chalkboard the ears like fingernails like constant expositions and grants grants. Disgust (OK, I'm a little distraught, but the dialogue is really bad.) One of the reasons for the HBO series is Rome, because its characters were not at least credible, irrespective of its historiography. <br /> <br /> Rome was enough enough to not know that they could stage the epic war scenes. The makers of this photo are not When Kaiser attacks Munda, the war scene is really harmful. <br /> <br /> I'll wear the dresses perfectly well. The set fine, although their CGI backdrops may be jarring a bit at times from time to time. The word is bad, though? In both cases, music, junk work, and dubbing of sided letters. <br /> <br /> However, this rental is not completely worthless. As the head of history, I was waiting for alternative methods of Augustus than Rome's Rome, which I think was unable to capture its overall "feeling", just as they did Caesar or Anthony. Instead, I should stick to my reading.
