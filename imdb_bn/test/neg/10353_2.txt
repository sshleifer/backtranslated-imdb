I saw the first episode and I found it a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I saw the original series in the last series of Channel seven since the first day of Big Girl Blouse. Katha and Kim were a great documentary and most of their humor is getting. <br /> <br /> But in this American version I think it is neutral, Molly Shannon Kath Day is supposed to cling to the 80s with her frizzy paraam, fashionable, dress. The actual km was not as good as when wearing the clothes of Selma Blair. I found that CEMA seems to be leaning heavily on his stomach, he is obviously an Australian size 12, where Kim (Australian) size 16/18. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> May have track. This molly and shannon are not used with each other, there is no mother / daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Fill was just like a light green breeze. But Craig was handsome and sweet plates was not from the Australian version. <br /> <br /> I saw it looked like a very bad game. The act was too much wood and Selma's expressions were closed after ten minutes. Especially his sulking scene. <br /> <br /> The sum, I find it to be a waste of time during this show, the script for Americans has definitely been dumbed, which is the main choice they say on the board. If NBC Kath and Kim want to show, then why does the producer not pay the original screen? <br /> <br /> I can add a smart cookie to the producers Sharon's permission to use your character.
