Talking about 1 hour and 40 minutes - talking annoyingly, and talking more and then something. It is hard for me to understand that the actress, like Parlude, who was fantastic in Fayette, was shattered into a piece! Incredible If you need a nightcap, this movie can help, though I like some nice classical music. Unfortunately, I found out that for my comment I have to write 10 lines - it's almost incredible! So, it is not enough to publish a movie in short and short, by expressing a single or brief sentence. Geez, man I made my point and do not waste your time with more, unnecessary words - just like this movie. Wolfgang
