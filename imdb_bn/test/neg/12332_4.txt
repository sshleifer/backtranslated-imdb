The "love of life" invites the benefits of a gay and gay man into a very culturally relevant scenario. I think the subject is compulsory, even if the conflict is a little compulsory and very easy to solve. For example, Thomas Joe is very quick and very conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity flaws: another user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... which I received the most is that Joe's face hair configuration became visually visible from the scene. Finally, I made myself more active from moving this movie. Stephen D. Gil has a pretty body and it shows up with pornography skills and excellence and it always matches the chops often played. Most of the time, the film seems to go full-screen. Stephanie Kitchen did a good job, but the moment of being illuminated at the last moment was a bit messy for me, because I was in the mood of a good ramp to shower at the end of this movie.
