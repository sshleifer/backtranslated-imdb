I was unhappy to see this picture recently and must sit through it. A friend bought him for Â£ 1, and loudly loudly loudly loudly shouted loudly, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Less budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were played very badly, the script was stupid, and there were so many scenes in the story that it takes unnecessary, so the movie will be of reasonable length. <br /> <br /> For example, when the lead character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous time on this scene, meaningless conversations that do not give the plot any real purpose or necessity. <br /> <br /> The main actor thinks that a woman who takes revenge for sleeping with son to give HIV, never think about being tested. Instead, he decided to torture him before he was killed and to torture him before he crumbled. <br /> <br /> If it sounds good and you think that it will have a lot of roar, think again. This photo has no real poor sequence and is very responsible for such a movie. <br /> <br /> It is not afraid, it does not make you think, it does not offer fast development fun. It can keep you sleeping but it is sure to throw you in the tears, so please protect yourself from frustration and follow my headline. <br /> <br /> Ignore this picture from 1/2 (it is not worthy even 1) <br /> <br /> The picture was 78 minutes, but it seemed like it was 2 1/2 hours.
