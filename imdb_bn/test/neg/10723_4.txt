I thought the movie was sub-purse. Acting was good but not great, the story was fun but did not come out like that. The director dropped the ball in this movie. It was not James (Jim) or Tea. IMHO was music that it was. There is a scene where things go down the hill and Johnny Cash music is running - the people who were depressed (not ridiculous) killed my mood. After that, the movie could not be restored. The situation of deportation was a potentially funny situation, good acting played well - I even smirked but the music was again visual. The song kept dragging me in the movie. <br /> <br /> I said it was possible but worked badly, even if I used to reach final production. Early precel memorable types: at the beginning The theater release was good, even after seeing it, but the film was released by the freedom fighter: the authority hello was very good. The same story is just different director. The same should be done here
