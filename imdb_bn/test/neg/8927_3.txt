Cemetery for the elder of the poor worker film-old martial arts. In such films, they struggle to maintain the dangerous shortage that makes their primary work successful, but they all end in failure. Seagal is too old for this kind of role but he does not go ... no matter how foolish he is. Some hope that his current work will bring magic in some way, but there is no magic left. In the late 80's and early 90's, Steven was with Sigal and his work made me a fan.

Since I'm producing them, I'm estimating more than $$$ satisfactory. If this is a treaty, we will manage Sigal Action Films in the late 1960s and early 70s.
