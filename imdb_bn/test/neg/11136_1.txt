<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> In this "movie" our aggressive Black Guy, The Black Gai Girlfriend, The Sonar Beach, Possible Lesbian "Hacker Chick", Pedophile Teacher ... Bla, Bla, Bla ... and then the Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking away legends too far?" This question was asked at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw a dream? The whole thing was a dream !!!!! This is the most suspense way to end a movie. "I do not know to explain all this, and we do not have any money ... let's make the whole thing a dream." The director / producer / actor / FX guy is definitely thinking. Yes, director Mr. E has done almost everything in this junky film. That's the only last moment ... and the head teacher, okay, so he's kidnapped! What to do with the movie? Of course black people died, the wicked girl is killed, the teacher of the past has been killed in teacher's teacher (she is the main suspect) .... YCK YUCK YUCK !!! This movie burns me heart. <br /> <br /> Made with dotless, stupid, and parents-visas and MasterCard (which tells me that perhaps it's still being paid), this movie is stupid, annoying and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> What I like was credit. They are the way to present names, at the beginning and end, etc. It was a strange feeling. The picture was not too bad! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
