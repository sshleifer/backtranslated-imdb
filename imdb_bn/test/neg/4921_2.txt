There is not enough space to explain the film's frustrating mess. The silly special effects and the unknown of this film are at least one of the problems of this movie. This image seems to have been assumed in the middle of the arrest and it can finally be made in the 90's. Under the profit "hero" (Fashionable "Miami Vice" is full of three-day shadow beard), Ronald Reagan is a ham-fished slam, it would be interesting if it does not give much importance to itself. Since, the movie is just sad. I feel sorry for the poor actress who spoiled her fine nude scene in these bad movies.
