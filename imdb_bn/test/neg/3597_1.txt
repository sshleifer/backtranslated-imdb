I do not understand the ridiculous in this movie. I was also objectionable about how the Koreans were portrayed in that movie, even though they were actually a comedy in that region. First, the actors are Japanese, and they make the most vulgar expressions of the Koreans in that film. This hatred me how people are expressing it I just felt angry at the scene, and how they were so badly created in this movie. Humor just lasts for one laugh, and still can not understand why it's funny. It is strange humor that is the most hateful representation of society. I found it to be an offensive movie altogether ... maybe it was I never lived in "hood" or saw a "hood" movie, but I do not even have any desire.
