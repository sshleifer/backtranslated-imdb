I accidentally came across this movie and I do not want to. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the original Snow White without theft of characters. Do not bother yourself well, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not see everyone, poor (cartoon graphics compared to cartoon), and I did not see any plots about messing up completely. In a classic movie I want to give up and leave.
