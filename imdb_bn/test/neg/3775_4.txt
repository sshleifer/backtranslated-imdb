Veber is not famous for its outstanding manager skills. In fact, no one laughs as long as they get laughing, most of them are to be honest here, spread throughout the process, and half of Deepiredar's intellectualism and Bhabar covered his face in dialogue. <br /> <br /> But there is no movie beyond the usual Veber Premier since it is not enough for a great comedy: A tough guy is condemned to team up with a very naive character. A real story is going on on the sculpture of L'Amererde, La Chever or Les Compher. Le Diner de Cons, although it was a game, the next disaster Pinon managed to create a real mystery. Tai-Tui revenge is ineffective and weak to stimulate our interest. Both are both heavy on both screens and scripts as well as scripts. <br /> <br /> What is wrong now? Veber wraps up this up to no action, no rhythm. Instead of using it systematically and elliptical (perhaps meeting with William Goldman in Hollywood) and 'music' really emphasizes that the narrative in the story and the lack of a background. <br /> <br /> So you have to be content with Depardieu's performance.
