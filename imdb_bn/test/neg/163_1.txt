I can not believe how foolish this movie really is. The story (written by Keira Knightley's mother) destroys the film. It does not make it straightforward, stupid, stupid, and absolutely no senses ... <br /> <br /> This film was so bad that it was mostly in the beginning, especially at the beginning. The story often runs with each other about their daily flirts, often seems like a trio. In this movie, you have a total of total drunks from the beginning of the couple who have a boring death (poet and his wife). The wife sleeps to sleep with the other man, the poet is distorted, who rely on the cheap Bose and the women. The wife, who quickly became a friend with her former childhood boyfriend (played by Keira), suddenly became jealous, she knew that they both were lovers. Some do not seem right here .... I mean, get the program with lady! <br /> <br /> The following line is: East lover again embraces new wife, meets again, becomes jealous, then ex-boyfriend is married and her husband is jealous, bombs in the house of crazy drunk couple. , Crazy husbands call the police, and they end up going to court for the attempt to murder people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is about it and something with me The family members fell asleep. I decided to give it a chance and I should stick to my first instinct.
