I saw this movie when it was first released in Peelsberg Pee. I drew distance from yantston Ohio. 85 miles I did not know anything about plots or players. I could not read any reviews and I did not talk to anyone I saw this. Believe me I'll never make mistakes. I believe this is the first feature-length movie illustrated in the new 3G process. It inspired me to make a 170-mile round trip. <br /> <br /> There were two levels of a waiting line that stretched (I'm not your child) 2 or 2½ blocks long and slowly moving. I can wait to sit firmly. If I knew only at that moment I would know soon, then I could have turned ¾ on the way back to the start of Youngstown. <br /> <br /> While showing the first 3D scene, I was already nodding off. The novelty quickly ran thin and since then it was pure pain. <br /> <br /> I can only offer the following suggestions without scary detail. If you sometimes look at the famous movie Plan Nine Form Out Space, it seems that it is sometimes portrayed as the worst movie, it is in my modest opinion that this garbage is standing on the head and shoulders. <br /> <br /> I do not know why he does not have a television, why not know why. If you get a chance to see it, do something else. Walk on the walk, cut grass, wash the dog, someone blurts you with rubber hose. Something Your time will be well spent. <br /> <br /> This is my first movie review. This could be my end until a bad movie comes and I do not think that book will happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
