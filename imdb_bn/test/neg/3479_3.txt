Some excellent Rick Bucker-Esk has made special effects and Darn Seraphian brutal in a small role, this beautiful Lam Italian film deserves some recognition. Most Italian directors (Raggero Dedomo, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava, and Enzo G. Kastallari) mostly go to original movies when most of the girl flick produces some credit for irrigation. As Plankton, it is half-piranha - half the thieves, people returning into monsters, raping women, and generating general magnificence. The film's great, lazy, and sexual feeling makes it hard to enjoy. Only Italian language works - Floating in print.
