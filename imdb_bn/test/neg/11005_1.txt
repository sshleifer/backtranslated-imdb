I went into this movie with an open mind. I was too lazy to go to the video store to pick a movie, and my friends came back with it. I promised him that I would not laugh at her choice, but in the first five minutes I told her that I would have to take my promise back. We keep watching, just to get it good, but not to; <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is probably one of the worst for the film, and of course, the IMDB button has a space of 100. I do not really know how it got distributed. The light was poor. I saw good acting in primary school drama. There is nothing positive to say about it.
