I'll be honest and say I left it to look somewhere else in the middle and then proceed fast with a few breaks. Then I have come back here and have read a few reviews already made .... <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm the only one, and I can not help it, but the answer to this cartoon from North American society seems to be "from them Lets protect them "and iraq comes directly to mind. It seems to me that it is a justification or part for another attack, including "fair intention". <br /> <br /> The woman seems to be a spontaneous personality to me and I am annoyed with her efforts. For her to grieve and raise "feeling". In this case, this phenomenon can never happen because history history teacher has already mentioned here, I wanted to know whether the average size of his family was so wealthy (they were playing on both sides?) And sending him to Paris !? Now, if this was a poor girl's biography, then I could feel a little emotions myself. But it stands + in its release only pure campaign film; Worse than his cartoon, it can be taken seriously, perhaps by displaying the "soft" side of very good tings for his own good. <br /> <br /> besides those who have clich√©s about gays. Well, a woman who fights for her rights, at least she should not have compassion for the people in the society ??? The message is probably spontaneous from the view of the ruling class. <br /> <br /> I'll only give it 2 stars because its production and related components A campaign film certainly interests me to restrain my thinking and so usually makes some visual emotions interesting that I can not deny.
