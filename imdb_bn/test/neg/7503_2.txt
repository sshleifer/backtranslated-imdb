In the 50's, a gay photographer called Bob Mizer (Daniel McIaver) founded a model called "Model Fictorial" and published a male magazine company publishing magazine and male models, and most models became prostitutes. "Bifike" shows the rise and fall of this distortion. <br /> <br /> 50 minutes of modified footage, many models in current models and Bob Myers testimony, director Tham Fitzgerald show this nude man and with 93 minutes running sex, lots of bad taste and very silly shit. I did not hear anything about this morally corrupt Bob Myers and I do not know what AMG is like. In my opinion, only gay and very specific audiences may like this boring and provocative movie theme. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Frasca" ("fresh meat")
