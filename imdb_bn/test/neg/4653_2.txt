All Americans of childhood are probably "Lauya-sai!" Known about its iconic call. Whatever the name of the little timmy or the child, his friend's friend on the border has his little tight-head. These same Americans might have made a leap on Lacey Television (or was it any other way?) I am very lazy for any research, and one of those painted heels. It is inevitable to make a "gone dog in this movie"! Punishment, so I will not (although I have technically corrected). But in a way, it's there. Lasasi (shaping, playing with the best friend of the man) gets top billing. The DOG gets the top billing. Now, I'm not familiar with the actors or their agent contract, but here's how it's going on in my mind: <br /> <br /> Movie Mogul: OK, Lascie, in the achievement, it will be, "And Shakes With Lassie as! "LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr MOVIE MOGUL: Ha, hey, baby, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rroroo rrrorooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, I think I see. Including lead billing? LASSIE: RAOFFF! Rawrrrrff rawrf! Movie Mogul: Oh God! Let me go! Top Billing! Top billing for you, let me go now !!! <br /> <br /> So, the dog gets top billing, and with the rest of the shell-shock cast, I think it is understood. We like the old gramps Jonathan Prospector, his young, sticky and apparently orphaned friend Tommy, Skeichy Laser Lin Taylor and loving old religious grams pilot peat. Here the conspiracy can be summarized in some sentences, so I will save the real pain of seeing the film. When a victim and his partner died with a dog named Jonathan Shape, his partner died. He became a new partner, Lin, who was overwhelmed with gold, and for some reason Jonathan gave Shap to kiss a little Cribbami Tomi. Lynn kills Jonathan, Shape sees it, and tries to kill Lin Shape. Then tried to kill Lin Tommy. Then Tommy Beeves, it gets cold, and Shape Lin carries a broad plan to take revenge, which he (or he?) Did. Last <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The limited power of the Lassi 'Act' (similar style, probably to Keanu Reeves - The same face expression, only the body continues) Amazingly, using a few minutes of film is clearly set up or insulted by its green American actor-face-to-face "Americans, how are you!" Stereototypes, the painted heels are suitable for lassie fetishists only, or who are involved in their relationship with potentially through their days as their proud old prospect, see that shiny gold is unmanned!
