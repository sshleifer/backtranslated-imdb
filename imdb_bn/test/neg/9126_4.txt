The final frames of the original "American graffiti" provide a one-line summary of the fate of four central male characters in the film. Although somewhat sexually explicit in removing female characters, the original film provided all information about those people who would love to have even the most brilliant fan of the film. However, some feel that after the end of the original film, the survival lives of these characters can be made detailed in mega-rocks. Bad decisions An insurance salesman and his wife, a silent personal in Vietnam, a drag race driver, and creating an excessive hippie among interesting characters in interesting situations, far more than the anticipation of this almost unexpected movie. Although the original cast has mostly come back, only Richard Dreyfas has good ideas to stay away, "more American graffiti" protests, car races, country singers, and a mess in the innocent situation of the Vietnam War. The use of split screens is once thought to be innovative and bold, it is led to confusion and is already confused by the confusing one. This is a seagull which is often something that can be wrong with a single cylinder. Perhaps it appears in the film school as a lesson. Even the use of time music, which was originally a joy, was done badly here. If you want more "American Graffiti" see the original twice.
