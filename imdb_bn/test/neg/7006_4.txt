Midnight AKA: Do not tell me the license (available in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. It's like a movie Mirit, a plot (no hole), good story and a convincing conclusion and the other is trying to complete it by the membrane of the skin. It is certainly not more than a B-movie skin flick, whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in the longest sexual scene. <br /> <br /> If you try to rate it as regular movie, then this line drivel below. Whatever the plot of the huge plot hole, whatever the story is destroyed. For example, if a colleague dies, would you call the police or head home and hit the hot tube? Judging this film with the content of its skin, it is visible ... only. In most cases, all of the girls are beautiful but quite clearly developed. Although all of the sex scenes were long and overdone, and it's only a little boring quality redeeming it's quality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can imagine as much as can not imagine or be next to the cast cast Maybe, she feels much better than that. <br /> <br /> Jet Anderson, who played Detective Array, should not even be an observer. Movies, one act is very few She looked good though, so we knew why she was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really will not recommend anyone on this. Even if you are looking for a good skin flick, there's even a lot better there. I rate this 4 out of 10
