I have never seen a more unreal movie than this dirty piece of this kid. Acting was at the top. The direction was drawn and amateur. The script was just a joke. This story was written by a person who was not near high school football, less professional play. And why, why do Oliver Stone think that they need to act to act in this movie? He was terrible, sometimes playing the most unrealistic announcer. He does not hire to compete in professional wrestling. Then you have jammy fox, who threw a girl. However, he is an athlete more athletes than the elderly Dennis Quaid. Seriously, stone 16 year old men wanted to manage this film with ADD. So we hear loud songs, quick cut and countless edits. It just became a bad MTV video. Sham on Al Pacino for doing this shit. Cameron's dais? Heck, any talent pike comes down that takes any role. Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" when you got, well, your movie sucks! And this one.
