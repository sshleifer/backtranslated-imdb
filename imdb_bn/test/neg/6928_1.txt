I absolutely despise this film I wanted to love it - I really wanted to. But man, oh man - they were close to Sarah. And my father was pretty beautiful. It's straight out of Sheryli Temple Film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend books. It's awesome. In the book, respected and decent and he does the right thing ... because it is right. There is not a poisonous bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In this picture, he is meaningful and intelligent. He has little things to get back to Miss Minchin. In the book, all over things like Sarah. She has to stand up to Miss Minchin. She said the truth and is not cowed by her. But he does not do that stupid, malicious things that he does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is rather dissatisfactory than me that many people here say that they like the book and they like the movie. I can not help but wonder ... have we read the same book? The whole aspect of the book was personal responsibility, dealing with respect and honesty, always speaking the truth and facing disaster with calm and honesty. <br /> <br /> The whole book has been happy - her father is not ridiculous survivor, but who has joined her partner who has been searching for her. In the book, he took this new father figure who loves him and cares for him. And Miss Minchin Chimney is not Sweep - this part of the film was really stupid. <br /> <br /> All these praises for this bad picture are boring to me. We appreciate a movie that glorifies a small, malicious behavior with some tips on the harmful hat? The book was full of bones and full of honesty. I can not even recognize him in the film ... he is not in it. <br /> <br /> Good thing Mrs. Barnett does not have to see this awesome thing. It is terrible and inaccessible to carry the title of his book.
