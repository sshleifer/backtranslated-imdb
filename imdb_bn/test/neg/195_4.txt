I'm not saying that I have some love-hate relationships with music. Some of them are superb, some cruel shit. So I hope hair fall into one of that category. However, it did not fall in the middle instead <br /> <br /> The songs are not bright, although the song "Sodmy" gives me a lot of laughter, and everything is date rather than seeing. But the film did not attract me like others, like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, because for several years I hated Rocky Horror, suddenly I got it and I liked it later on. Maybe the hair should be the same. Although due to the language and nudity content, it will get much exposure as a rocky loss, but I suspect it will have a chance to grow on me. Getit? Hair ... grow up ... Oh, suit yourself. However, I did not see the last fifteen minutes, because of technical mistakes, which was shameful, since I'd like to see how it ended, especially after reading some reviews here. <br /> <br /> There is no film for casual cinema-gear, but certainly one for musical lovers. I really hope they will not rebuild it, since I think that such a rebuilding will eventually end up a shallow, pale, PC version. <br /> <br /> A look genre for lovers.
