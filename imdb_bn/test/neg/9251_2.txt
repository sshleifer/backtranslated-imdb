This is shown on a premium channel, so I did not make it for TV. Even though, I like some lifestyle lifestyle (lifestyle here in the UK), but it was awful. The family was so silent that "love you mom" "love you more sweet". Then after they broke again, after 10 minutes they came again, "love you mother," big cheesy smile etc. She phoned her husband, and told him that he would not come home. They just broke into a man more than their bodies, there is a nutritionist living next door, who need help? Her lusty daughter and a cat (not for a long time) have her care. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I can give it a good 7. I can even show it to my friends while I have round them. Vodka can be fun after bottle or 10 bottles!
