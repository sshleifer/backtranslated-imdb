This film deviated from the Bible and the 1956 movie bar fell so down. I traditionally viewed 10 commandments on 2006 that hate to replace the movie. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, like the 1956 movie Churchstone Hesson did not look like. I will not waste my time while watching this movie again. They tried so hard to modernize this movie to keep you on the other end like a soap opera (and not good at it). I'm sure 10 young people who did not pay attention to the original 10 orders could agree with me, but everyone would agree with themselves. Also, it took ten years for the first ten orders to be made, which probably took two months to create it. Special effects were not so great that for so many years with so much technology and after so many years you thought that they did a better job now.
