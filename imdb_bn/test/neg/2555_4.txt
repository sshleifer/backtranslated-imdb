I can not stand the mother acting woman. I wanted to silence him. He had an odd method of talking and the lines provided for reading could not make it better. I had no idea why the people of the city took it with them because of all these problems, since it was considered by women as the only woman under the age of ten in the populated city. Even after a terrible tragedy, his voice was free from human emotions, he had no power to realize the events of his own life. He said, "I love you", "I hate you", "foreclosings in the bank", "my dress is burning in the fire", or whether he was distributing his line with the same passion. Was this actually pictured in Ireland? The sun shone throughout the movie and the characters were surprised to see the showers during the rainy season. In the summer of 2002 I used to live in Ireland, the warmest summer in a century. Most things were still cut. If the farmers in Ireland could only harvest a long dry period, the country would have been hungry hundreds of years ago. It seems that there was not much money for making movies. Black and white flashbacks seem to have been portrayed with the security cameras of the Sam's Club.
