Well, I fell for it. I saw the box for it in the video store, and made it a mistake for "Girlfriend", which I had heard was fantastic. In my own defense, the titles are the same, and they have re-covered the cover art for the box so that it is almost identical. However, to add it, they probably re-edited the whole cover packaging / promotion to capitalize on the buzz / success of "Girlfriends". I got it pop and a bad feeling when they started showing low budget direct video flilers for trailers and even worse when a music video of the film's original song, which seemed like lift music and featured Column Slime Clips, I saw the first few minutes and showed Maria Kanchita Alonso, I knew I would fall for it. (Do not make me wrong, he was a talented actress, but I knew he was not in "Girlfriend", I was the film I was in. I was in the film. <br /> <br /> So, along with me looks cheating and crazy To see not close to myself, the movie was just fine: Blaye, a Latino woman who is the daughter of former champion boxing, is among the closest friends. A female boxer, who - and I'm coming far ahead of it all - it was really a drag - a match with an average champion named "Terminator" was severely wounded, a large female version, more pumped up, I. Turner, of course, Bell The only thing that decides is to become a boxer and to take revenge on his friend. He is his careful, supportive but protective father (his mother Zak He died because of cancer), who is only a policeman, his love interest, his care and supporters are still protective, and also working with his father, a policeman, hmmm, they have both jobs that have put their lives in danger against duty. Wondering what will happen? He started training and certainly met a lazy manager, who certainly pretends to care for him but only wants to exploit him. Actor actress feels very less like a mercenary, Kerry Evels, and at a very young age, she conducts little difficulty. Her performance was really really bad. I will not even go to the plot because Rocky or almost everyone has seen, where is the movie going and how it is going to be okay. <br /> <br /> It was not entirely terrible movie. Most of the acting was right, and the main actress was very good. Well, the powerful female Latino role model was. The final battle scene made me selfish, even though I knew everything that was going to happen before. The acting actress playing "The Terminator" was quite remarkable that I really wanted to kick her $$ kick to Bell and was prepared for the Bell Bar, although there was absolutely no surprise. At my favorite moment (probably in a moment where I was not crazy about renting movies by mistake), his belly shook his sticky manager after he showed his true colors, shouting at him, and then suddenly got faked. He smiled and looked at her and saw that she was actually a charge. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to be wicked was boxing saying "no matter the size" and the woman wryly replied, "Now where have I heard before?" Another line that is thought to have dramatic effect "Doctor told me I could not walk again!" "Come on, you know you can believe me!" And "your mother was so proud of you". I could go and You have not heard a million soap in a bad soap opera or movie-week-week. Maybe I'm too much money - the filmmakers made an effort, and I was willingly sitting by the whole thing ... but I was not just watching anything else while working. You can make worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you can do more.
