This movie lacks everything. Except Bobby Deol, who is the mediator between his own criteria, no one in this movie came to work with a scene. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the song does not praise the movie <br /> <br /> Good. Music contrast between Bobby and Upen is not that well-highlighted. Great idea has gone completely wrong. The movie does not have a perfect ending. Please do not waste your time in this movie
