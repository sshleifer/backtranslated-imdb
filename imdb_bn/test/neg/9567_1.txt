If it is not widely featured in each "not clutter" list, it should be the only reason, because those who set particular lists are not aware of its existence, as long as there is a favorable alternative. I'm not kidding you, it's a * bad * "movie". Joseph Maker returned from the dead, with various obscure, undefined supernatural powers, most of whom are engaged in the new, increasingly humorous and ridiculous (and sometimes scary or obscure ... sometimes it does not go for them, it just gets intertwined. Goes, and the former person's efforts not only work, time limits) and stereotype / orchitips, and David Keith is portrayed by (which I respect ... well, at least in Daredevil), many inconsistent (which can do with scripts) and often work more than top performances. There is a character or two personality so incredibly irritating that they look painful. The edit is actually more clever than this (and what was the world with red color for flashbacks?). Cinematography ... Oh, dear. Effective use of framing, coverage, angle (which may possibly be attributed to some editing), please, say, when you say something you know about existence. As far as technological direction goes, it is a pretty shy excuse to do something more suitable to the projector than the fuzzy film. But why stop? The plot is just poorer. The basic idea has been completed, and it has been much better than that (the Crow will be one). The way it is said is jealous, and there are some explanations behind the flashbacks, but it is still not satisfied. Pacing is about the existence. The lead definitely is unlike, and there are more personalities in a burning door, those very little woods that do not mention. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? Are you doing this in the name of all that is good and right (for pan purposes)? Perin, you're already funny, Drew Kerry shows, Nicholas, well, I did not see anything before you got American, but if you did not have anything else then you were funny later and those plans were deliberate. The dialog is ... low said, good. Languages ​​have become extravagant, and stupid. Violence is done frustratingly and they do not seem to be trying to conceal it (it could be a more efficient technique to indicate). Letter, do not start me. Why unexciting illustrations, so foolish, spend so much energy at the event? If you think more about this, it gets worse. It is an electrical scaring machine that is not as usable as a "bad horror flick" or a B movie (it can pass very well through the rest of the alphabet and still can go further), it is not afraid to be the most horrible day of your life. I'm only recommending those who want to claim it as bad, and do not say I warned you. 1/10
