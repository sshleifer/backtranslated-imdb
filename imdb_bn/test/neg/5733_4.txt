For the first time after buying the DVD, this picture was viewed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same budget was not present, Some sets and effects are not like flash and some scenes seem fast. <br /> <br /> It is OK to look at Nilssen, but unfortunately he did not work even if he shook his head. <br /> <br /> It seems that the role of Arne's supporter was that he was credited for director Freelessera, who also directed Conan the Distrover. Maybe Ernie did not believe that he would go to film titles like producer, total recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And looking at their faces, they said they got so much fun to make this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen so many bad Two stars.
