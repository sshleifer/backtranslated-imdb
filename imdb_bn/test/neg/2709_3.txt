When I noticed this in my TV guide, I was actually planning to show this film, but after about 5 minutes it was decided that "who the girl" might be more valuable and valuable than this. It is impossible to describe how Madonna's acting looks bad and the end result is sometimes one of the most annoying characters in the film. This shit is an insult to movies and wit. I almost never! I do not finish the movie starting from the beginning, but in the case of the previous impossible. 2/10
