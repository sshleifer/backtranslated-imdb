I have mentioned in other comments that I have seen him in "American Ninja 3", since then I became David Bradley's real big fan. The man is doing martial arts is great, there are some types of charisma and great looking dude on the screen. Sadly, from the very beginning, he went to the DTV division and as a TV movie until 2001, he apparently stopped making movies. Now, one thing is watching cybercop cop or hard justice, which are suddenly clutched films, but the real fun to watch (the cows are entertainingly bad with any kind of money) but the other thing is looking at a piece of annoying piece of rough reality. I mean, this and Crisis, this man has ever seen two big pieces of horse-cow dung I would not even suggest this Bradley hardcore fans too. If I knew it and the crisis was going to be so f ***** g crap, then my cost would not cost 3 or 4 euro. Although the total reality is annoying as the Crisis, it is interesting, but it promises. A group of military prisoners in the future have been given the opportunity to stop any kind of disaster in the past (I'm sorry, I did not really pay much attention to this torture) and they have 24 hours to return or something like that. If they do not, they are stuck there forever. The poor director who keeps an eye on it, "tries" some ridiculous (?) Clich√©s like criminals coming to the world, and does not look like a truck for example (wow, sunny ...). The film meets with some of the world's girls in front of The David Bradley. It has made me so angry that I have to force myself to show up well in 3 or 4 installments, I have to spend for at least 4 or 5 euros. I tried every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley, it's only 10 seconds battle scenes, then it's the ultimate touch that will contribute to throwing you down under the hundreds feet of birds so that it does not see it again. I hope I can meet the "director" of this pill on the road and I will ask him for 5 euros as I swear by God. I want to meet David Bradley as why he played this poor excuse for a movie in the name of God. Do not even get bored with this movie, I think it is from the bottom of my heart, renting it for it and especially not for buying it.
