In the 1950s, Daphne du Murray has set up Rebecca in San Francisco, but it can be very well seen from Robert Weiss's very extraordinary silence. Valentina Curtis survives a concentration camp who steals the identity of a deceased woman and drains herself in the life of Richard Beshat (who may also be the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... It is irrational and final but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is horrible, gradually falling apart she realizes she made mistakes. Beshecht is a little fine, fine ... though the end of the light looks very annoying to him. Fay Baker is a very good Mrs. Danvers - just like the caretaker. Intelligent is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a fantastic quick clip. He crashes the control car with (or at least a stunt duty) at the wheel, now stages out of the classic.
