It gave two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to buy this piece of horse filling. I paid a dollar for it on the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have some good movies (at least I think they're good) never seen inside any video store. After watching this, I'm really insulted by that. Even worse than the lightest years I have seen, I can not even recommend it as a film in Campi Riches. It's so bad, instead of making you angry it makes you angry. How to find any kind of distro film distro? I can only believe in the distribution of amateur delivery DVDs as it was self-distribution. This "film" comes out of business to the creators, you have no talent for it.
