I saw at my local supermarket and I knew that Debra was in it so I wanted to buy it (without the support of that sexy woman!) Acting and acting in this movie was terrible (except for Debra Wilson and I. 'I just do not love him because I Love him, he played an actress or actress seriously!) I did not get it at the beginning Why did not return the wife? Running at that random instead of his car. It was so stupid. And it does not seem to be being kidnapped in public, residential streets - yes ... it's realistic!) In the park also, when Charlie stole the woman's cellphone (for some stupid reasons) she was frustrated and found out Find out (and at one point) when they were on the gun point - a cell phone! In reality, I suspect that LAPAP will leave it for their stupid cellphone! The lady went to one of those cell phone booths and it was replaced! The performance of the kids sucked very much (I think they were reading from a cou card or someone close to the camera was whisper to their line) because they would ask the question and look around and then answer a suspicious voice (ie- "Yes I missed what Daddy? ") Also, how do those sniper trees and the roofs in LA do not show? I'm watching this United States playing at 3 am. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson will enjoy his part in fanatics. He is the only actor with any real acting skills (Debra, sweetheart - close this cheap D-grade, direct to video movies ... which may be replaced by upcoming films, white paddies.) He keeps some jokes when a parent comes up and he Who is talking to someone, she asks, "Danny, Charlie!" She shouted on her computer.) I am 4/10 because of her good acting skills. I gave it 4.
