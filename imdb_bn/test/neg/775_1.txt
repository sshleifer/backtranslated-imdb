This is absolutely beyond the worst movie question I have ever seen. It is very bad that as soon as I find it I plan to renovate it again. This movie produces 'Oscars Space Plan 9', it's like an Oscar contest. Just looking at the actors I want to laugh loudly I could not say enough bad things about this movie. It is full of horror aproaches. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on terrorist attacks with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). As far as I can go ... I'm very laughing. I know it will not be fun ....... * Lololololololol * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
