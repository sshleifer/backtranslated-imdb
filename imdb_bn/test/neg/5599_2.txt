OK you are looking for a funny lesbian romp. This is not a movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot socio-dramatic characters (in the words of 'cruel intent' or 'wild things'), you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductress movie, but it's not a movie. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you had an hour in your life then it was your movie. It is badly written, badly operated, badly damaged, poorly illustrated. It had special effects ... I mean really bad special effects I think you can really create the same special effects in emo-lol. <br /> <br /> This is a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> Actors were pretty starlet, but obscene. It is shot like a soft-core porn but you do not get the money shot and the actors see everyone bothering them out of the brain. The 'girl girl' scenes, which sucked BTU, were so limp that it is not significantly significant. Watch 'almost sex scenes' in YouTube, this is the only reason you want to watch this movie and even its value. <br /> <br /> money and time spent !!! Do not even pick it, instead look at 'Cruel Objects 2' - bad movies, bad stories, bad writing, bad conversations and bad acting in the same movie. Actually I could just purge my mind to watch it now
