To the end, rival 'El Padro' and 'Darkness Fruit' pictures to prevent uninterrupted and uninterrupted pictures. This is actually the first movie I gave out of 10 out of 10 for IMDB and for good reason. <br /> <br /> For one, cast is not special. This is not a problem for me, except for any other character other than interesting or unlike the Grand L. Bush's Harrington. Second, there is a low quality production standard - Television science-like futures - and there is a firm compilation of water, and water views managed by SFX teams are stored in dried sets in dry sets, which are not very convincing. . This image is literally 'Shuknodak'. The worst part is though this film is boring. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were rotating round: "This is a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * T." "Not really." "Bullsh * T." "I'm not making it." "Bullsh * T." "Now it is!" "I did not see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yup. Bullsh * T." Then it takes up so little for about twenty minutes or so. Then we're back in the running dialog. The dialog is not a bad thing, but it's all about these movies. Character Talking That's not a bad thing, without this film it's not very good. The dialogue is often coupled and clich√©d, and is not very interesting to hear. I do not see any point of slander on special effects; This picture has bad quality. <br /> <br /> Set is small and unreal. Acting sub-par. Script - Oh Lord, Script - worse than a trash of science fiber, television must be dredged. It surprises you where the budget of this movie was. <br /> <br /> There is still another horror, horror of the Megeludon (Four Four) film series. Bring to Steve Allen, please ...
