I read the book 'Scarlet' and for the first time I've seen a good movie. I'm afraid to say I was frustrated. Following the film does not follow the book and many changes I did not like. <br /> <br /> a change that I do not like to represent Lord Fountain. It makes no sense to him to be bad people. The things that were done between Lord Fountain and Scarlett were very different and their full relation was very close. <br /> <br /> There was less conflict between Scarlet and Rite than the book itself. The film seems to have sent two complete opposite ways and they often do not have enough way to think that love can be between the two. A fine movie, but I believe that it might be better than this, it was more true in favor of Alexander Ripley's book.
