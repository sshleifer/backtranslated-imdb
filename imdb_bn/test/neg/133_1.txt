This day, writers, directors and producers are more dependent on the end of "wonderful". Old art to stop the film, we learned the information that we had through the movie and it was able to bring it to a pretty complete end, it was lost. Now we have a movie which is not a complex, detailed or neutral matter, it can be wrapped up in 5 minutes. It was all of her head. Explain that the director's safety net. If all else fails, or are not good for writing, or if we go out of money to complete the film, we would always have been "on her head" and can finish the movie in this way. The audience will buy it because none of us are psychologists and none of us suffers from schizophrenia (which we do not know), so we accept the story and believe it. After all, mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have been pulled off of it. But why are we getting more of this shit? Every director / writer now thinks they can stop it because, well, the club did this and it made a lot of money. So we can get movies like bookmakers, secret windows, identities and this movie (just to name a few).
