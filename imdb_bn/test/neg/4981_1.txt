When I saw the underworld trailer in March last, I still felt that the time was a little smile. Certainly this was an impressive idea, but in reality, the idea that the idea might work, I think, is frustrating, the frustration cat and the dogs can not be worse than this? Then in December and I suddenly recalled the film that I realized how much milk was milked, it seems to be inevitable in the UK, it would seem horrible, but the horrific reviews only helped me understand that it was impossible movie For no good reason. Yet I swallowed my feelings and today I went to see pictures with a friend, when I entered my screen, I could die, for the first time I was watching a movie with a friend and the only two on the screen! I did not know anything about it that I was going to tolerate. To panic it is terrifying, horrible, it really is. Imagine how bad you can think of this movie and then make it worse for a movie, just how compassionate it is for the movie. Although it aims to entertain kids, it seems only an embarrassing mess that insults the kids instead of enjoying them in movies. The phenomenon is not out of the way, it is usually poor, and the movie can not help it as a long, tired and lonely boring Saturday cartoon! A brief five minutes where I can imagine that the film can be passable, but the film seems to have died suddenly and after that the sign post is already finished. I'm surprised that this movie is really released, it's disgraceful to Disney, half of it is better than direct video signal! Even more horrible is the last page room for a series! <br /> <br /> So come to the actress (Croke Documents). All right, I'm going to be honest Jason Lee is fine, his voice matches Canin, and he has been given a decent script which he has done for performance. However, with such a dodgy script he seems to be just flounder. It reminds me of Garfield's Bill Murray in many ways, Murray could do what he had, but what he had was not enough. Then we get onto human actors, and as well as most of the miserliness. Alex Neighbor undersea, Jack's friend plays. My biggest concern is that anyone will take him to audition seriously. The scene of the flying with the underdog might be perhaps poor because it is perhaps the most vulnerable scene in the last few years. Once I did not believe that he was an actual person, in fact my part was still convinced that he made robots specially for the film! James Belushi thinks half of the film dead, there is nothing to do with him, there is no suitable line, he just thinks that he wanders around the set, which is waiting for the plot to be relevant, which the writer tries to try at the end but It's such a poor way to make her ridiculous. Fortunately, Peter Deenclass is a reducing factor in the film, he said. As great as Barcinster and seems to laugh at the introduction. He stole all the scenes that he stole, even though he was sharing the screen with extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the casts are worse, especially Taylor Momsen, will have to finish his acting career! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the funniest scene underwent bites a bite and explodes dog food everywhere Then you know that there is a bit wrong there. If the film does not do good work or good story, it can be easily ignored, though the movie is worse in both cases. The impact is so much of a crop that the underworld is just strange, and the dog uses such strong effects that you often forget that it has a great effect. What is the point of making a film about a super dog if the enemy dog ​​is super super? The final battle also becomes embarrassing because its ten minute chaos, the dog flies, the other things happen, some things are crushed, all of it is irrelevant, because this thing is happening for the incident. The script is dodgy as well as the best and cruel pain inducingly awful at the worst times. When someone says, "See an airplane, it's not a bird, it's not a frog ...", yes you read it correctly, I only wanted to burst into tears. In fact, I wanted to go out, wanted to see if it could get less than a point, so it would not end in the end so it would not be grateful. <br /> <br /> The overall underworld has become the worst movie of 2008, and is actually bad as the epic movie as of last year. Thankfully, for the underworld, Spartans will be seen here soon and I hope it gets worse. So if you have not got my review point, then avoid this movie, if you want to see a movie with a dog, then see cats and dogs, if you need to buy a real dog, do not see it!
