For the worse! There is not much hope from García, because he is the most performing actor today But Keaton really should know that this film will be sliced ​​and earned during its acquisition. (I do not particularly love her but he was Batman <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Walks (dogs may know your bad (pond)) and Keaton back behind them and backls back to their whine with their tails in their legs. What comedy does the movie have? Jismabad makes her fool with the scene, only a complete hindrance with dialogue can be found to be behavioral and it is very annoying to feel sorry for the child. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a movie with the poor, , Humorous, requires some tough action, for example, take a die hard, despite the sticky plot instead of that. <br /> <br /> Though Keaton The character was a joke, yet I went astray for him, and I wanted to see Garcia his dead baby and queen on some island of Paradise, making this movie a good smile. Look with a wicked friend and you have something It may be fun because this movie requests advertising in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Greed created this movie and thanks to God bits of his own ass.
