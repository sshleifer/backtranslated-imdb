Red glasses <br /> <br /> I love Avalon, I think this director has created some amazing visual aspect of the future. This picture was boring though annoying shit. The opening scene shows cover and a guest's live action Ammy style shows great promise for future silent commitment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the film is close to me Very little understood and I could not care less about the people in it. All of this would be fine if the film was effective in the industry. The opening scene appears to be attractive and looks like a scene in the massive robot-case scene that holds a huge machine gun in the rain, it seems that the film was not worthy of sighting. <br /> <br /> Things down.
