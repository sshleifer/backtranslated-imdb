Then it is difficult to follow the second half of this photo. I got the first part with Spanish Inquists, but this film has been moving forward with Spanish rule for many years. The movie does not do anything to fill you with what happened and I do not think much about it. So, the movie then gets confusing. The film begins when the father of a wealthy businessman, Inside the Church, is specifically accused of Father Lorrainezo. He is questioned and forced to admit. Even the wealth of his family can not buy him from prison. Her father acknowledged Lenzo that he accepted the Impe's release as the descendant of the chip. It makes all the reasons for the church to condemn Lorenzo, who went to France. <br /> <br /> The film goes on for years and the French Revolution is fully effective. Ins is released from jail. It was a great job to show the fragments of Natalie Portman in pieces. He found his family dead and looking for Goa for his help. He told him he was a child in prison. Goa established a meeting between him and Lorenzo, who is now French and in power. He dad Goya sees the girl and tells Lorenzo, who is making the best decision to send her to America, so nobody can find it. But before the end of his plans, the British joined the Spaniards and Spain restored power and now he is persecuted. That part was not well said in the film. This is a picture that appears to happen in the day. <br /> <br /> The last messaging: The movie is good, as long as the movie is good for many years after its inception, the film hopes to understand what's going on. It just got very confusing then then.
