Visitors are a hard, difficult movie to enjoy. It was so slow and at the pace of the lead that sometimes I was moving in the movie time. It was a hot, sunny day on 11 o'clock, I could not add midnight to the winter of winter, so you can gradually understand this movie. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, it's not long. It's just ten minutes more than the average video average in 100 minutes and it's more than fifteen minutes more than the higher clock, which I was happy to see in the previous day. <br /> <br /> When it does not make the development of the SL -O -O-B for the atmosphere, the audience is slowly enough to make it beneficial for its use gradually. Rushb Mitchell's boat-woman, Henning / Aliens / which is really awesome and effective, her suicide mum roams quickly and while crying at night, flashbacks are both cheap and annoying. Make perfect make-up on all of the shops for Splurging. The single person boat is a vague place, and sometimes the movie uses the full power of the location and the secluded sea to get out of your position. <br /> <br /> However, my recommended hard spectators. I just did not feel that I saw a 4-hour film, not 100 minutes, but I feel that I have been deceived in some way, like explaining many things like Haining (mind games? Real spells? Space aliens?) For the visitors specific Do not pick one. Radha Mitchell, who talked to her cat and the Dominican Parcel Smolder, had no clear reason for some illogical horror in the past? Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he told you what happened, but the mad / stupid you can remember it. If you do not see many of these movies, your new perspective will probably improve somewhat, but I found this slow, annoying and highly derivative. If you want to frighten yourself with folly, there is a better place to do this, if you want a tricky thriller then many smart ones.
