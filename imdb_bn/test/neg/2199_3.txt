Ratings: * ************************************************************************************************ ********************************************************************************************************************************************************** It is a medium, sad, hollow, ridiculous and predictable piece of trash. One of the adjectives I used above is to add 1/2 star to me. So is it so bad that it is good? No It's a 'case so bad it's ridiculous'. <br /> <br /> An amazing actress Belk Angela Bennett, who is a computer expert, who is always at home. He works at home, has no friends and his neighbors do not know him. Suddenly, he saw himself involved himself in dangerous situations after the death of a colleague, and the same thing happened almost to him. His identity, bank account, etc., has been deleted, and now he has Ruth Marks. Conspiracy even involved the government and ... wait! Did we meet this before? Yes, thousands of times "Net" tries to be modern, from the portrait of the 90's, which shows the computer as a villain. Big deal! It's just a pretext to show me a film, ridiculous action scene about nothing. See boat crash scenes. The camera slowly smiled slowly ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Has he already made a decent film? "A tie tie to kill", all right. But he is still a bad actress, repeating his robotic facial movements in each of his films. The advantages and disadvantages of the computer have already been shown in 2001: A Space ODC is "the best, most intelligent and sometimes the most complex film ever made." It does not need to be compared to "net", what is it? < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remove this image!
