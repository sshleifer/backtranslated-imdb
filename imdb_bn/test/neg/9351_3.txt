Long ago, up to a galaxy, far away (known term), water has become the most valuable product (it has got the term known) and a small minority controls its distribution (what surprises, only a heart attack and the surprise that dies). A group of ice pirates (revitalizing water ... wet band? ... oh wait, last used) Try to discover the way to provide an infinite but damaged (druce?) Princess with an infinite supply of water and a group of idiots ?? Of ?? Despicable villains in realization. <br /> <br /> This movie could be a really great comic parody ("Star Wars," David Linch's "Doon") but just did not properly manage it. It goes, I believe, the word is "low cold" humor. It's not really successful in the fun of being ashamed of Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Uriich (these three stars) who are not fit for acting. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a rental and definitely a drink directly.
