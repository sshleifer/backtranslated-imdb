I really hope these "movie" producers hope to read these reviews so that they know that people simply do not want their movies. They are just an embarrassment to the genre and genre genre genre genre. Whether this was better than the first because both are not exactly plain terrible both matters. I'm surprised they did not learn their text from the first movie. Now close !! Keep an eye on horror movie observers' warnings, dot watch, rent or "Urban" images, and above all, do not buy them !!!!
