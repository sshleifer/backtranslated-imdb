Robot Holocaust has seen me the longest, most kind effort to create a post-apocalyptic film. And I thought the Italians were the master of the deadly Mad Mac WinAntains. Some movies like Escape 2000 are positively brighter than this part of the puri. Intriguing ?? Even with each scene set up each scene. And the boy does not drag it. Scene after scene with no interest. Special effects (and I use the word "special") are made of shock dolls. Yeah, right ?? Shock dolls! The acting is abysmal. The Angel Angel Jager is running for the worst performance I've ever seen. Of course, whether he's French or German? But man he is bad. I can not remember a positive thing to say about movies. So I'll stop there because this junk ten sentence is about 10 too much. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, I saw the version of Robot Holocaust's MSST3 version. Some of the movies making the movie so bad helped to win this MST3K episode. An episode for a season, riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark almost every time. On my MST3K rating scale, I have a 4/5 episode of this episode ?? Ask for it
