So, on Friday night and you want to go see a movie ... whatever you want is something entertaining, not too much arts, or something that requires long nights in philosophical discussions. So, you pay $ 10 to see the mode squad. The movie trailer stopped me, but let's ... it's the most beautiful people in Hollywood - eye candy. But about that ... Prada is a string moving ads. And did Hollywood producers forget? A land Why are these kids roaming the streets after unknown enemies? Where are they? But, do not worry after a while, you just care. I was at the end of this movie because I thought I could be more productive (and free) than sitting in my house and traveling around the wall, but it ended (90 minutes - this is the only saving grace). So, still 10 dollars willing to waste? Go, get yourself a nice hot food.
