This photo was originally set up for failure by the studio. One, Annie Rice (Book Writer) offered to write screen play but refused to be in the studio. Two, they tried to do 2 stuff in deep novels in 2hour movie. <br /> <br /> I keep the only way for these two books - Vampire Lestat and The Damned Queen - work for live action form. Must be through a mini series. First, the Vampire Lestat took place from the 1700s to the 1980s, and its main character is quite characteristic about the conspiracy of Lestat's conspiracy. The whole book Vampire Lestat Daman set up the second part of the Queen programs. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perfectly misrepresented, actually the same name is different story <br /> <br /> If they want a vampire movie, be fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by this novel, fine. But do not come back to the theater with Rice's extraordinary novel and the success of the character, for the faithful readers to destroy them. <br /> <br /> If you do not read books, you do not do it, but if you read a book, you will really insult the movie. Who says, I'm such a huge fan, I should have known this movie completely, that is going to happen and it's gone for now. Catch 22, it will see, it will hate.
