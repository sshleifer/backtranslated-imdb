A bad movie about a bad movie. That original, right? If it is, then it's just about good things. The lovely Ally Shady could not resist the bombing of the movie theater and VCR everywhere. It should also be noted that he and other actors rented for the character of Danny ILO have billed themselves as well as the characters played in their D-rated films. It will call a B-rated movie, too much praise, and greatness to confuse.
