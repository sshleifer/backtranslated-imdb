This is, in fact, one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christian, a ruthless, confusing mystery that clearly defines its predecessors ("the death of the blue", "the evil under the sun"), lack of donations (and budget!) And Donald Screen Spell as far as Peter Ustinov There is a continuous shade (of course, he is playing a character less interesting than Pirot). This image only guides the coast of Christie's power to the coast (all its plots have a certain amount of interest), but the side is frustrating flat. (* 1/2)
