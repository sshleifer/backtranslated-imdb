This movie represents the movies that are bad in business. The actors are unfortunate and the scripts are awful. Special effects, if any, were done so badly that it would have been better to do this instead of cartoons. It is also good! I think the makers of the film wanted to laugh, but once I smiled, I saw Patrick S. Long hair and everyone's colorful clothes. At the end the scene was good but they were not part of the movie. In the end you'll ask yourself "Why did I waste my time and money with that shit when I saw the plants growing or clouds moving?" I do not think that I'm some critics or anything else but it's really a lam film! Do not see! Security over losses!
