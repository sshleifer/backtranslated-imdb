Like anyone who bought it, I was disliked by what I called "20 pieces of grave" and "banned in 20 countries" or in the box. I admit that I am a huge fan and always amazed when I can always hold films on the dark and look firm to do it. Tom Sawney, Rick Baker and Greg Canom are some of the best in business. Revolutionary make-up effect in the 80's. They do not need them today because everything is complete on the computer. But computers can not be compared to visual wizards that these three men may be hypnotized. But I digress <br /> <br /> Check out the 13th Finals Chamber of Friday's Gates to Hell to Fantasy Glory Films, or even the main achievement of Savinie, you are grateful that you are grateful for creating a horribly poor movie. You can not tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> Why do not I see Kanibal Farrox for any other reason, but seeing this hole in the picture can be seen. If you search for this movie then you are wasting your money. Many more critics have mentioned here, most of the time after Gore is a consequence. You do not see torture, as bloodshed happens, you also see what you see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />? Well, here it is, but as far as you can expect, or do not expect. A man is thrown and a woman is leaked by her breasts, but then involves those two scenes, and a scalping; There is nothing in this picture. These three references, even the grave scenes, are still quite passionate about what you were expecting. Maybe it's me and my scary and cow's style sick and stomach's experience, but I'm hoping a little more. Call me sick or stomach, but only because people do not see this image in the first place? I honestly bored myself in many places. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another photo of Kanibal Ferrocus, trying to capitalize on the frenzy of a higher movie. The Kunibal Holocaust is not really a great movie, it is much better than the triple. If you get out of your way to buy it for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
