The Emperor (Richard Hydone) dog is married to a dog (Joan Fontenne). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell the record of villagefone near Emperor, his dog is attacked by a Johann's dog. When Virgil was exiled from the city after a revenge attack, a psychologist insisted that Johann's dog must be in front of Virgil's dog so that he could relieve his dog's fear. This arrangement is made and dogs fall in love. So do Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film ends with romance and at the end Johanna's dogs are born. But who father? <br /> <br /> The dog story is a very poor vehicle that is used to create and create a story among people. This is a terrible story. There are 3 main musical pieces which all have junk - bad songs and awesome dances. It's just a very annoying movie - Bing has many words in each sentence, and it distributes almost annoying, annoyingly. It's not funny ............ Never .......... But that might mean. Bing and Joan did a lot better than this.
