John Sles, what have you done? <br /> <br /> There were moments in "Silver City", which I could think of a good story, surprisingly good characters, thoughtful dialogue. And then those moments will quickly be covered by poor writing levels, tedious aspects, and unrealistic acting levels. I really love all the works of John Slayes, but "Silver City" terribly. <br /> <br /> I felt that Cylles was working at the beginning of a good story involving illegal labor and industry. Anti-corruption line, but then he got trapped and trapped on the satirizing secondary plot line on the administration of Bush. Two stories do not really connect with each other, and the weak elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the movie, which makes me lose patience with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Another major flaw is Danny Huston's performance. Each scene is distributed with a gawping grin, irrespective of its compatibility in the mood of its conversation. At the end of the film I hated this guy, which I noticed reminded every bad actor of every high school game. I did not see Houston in anything else, I do not know to blame him or know more about Cylals' guilt. However, he is a very unfortunate movie's unfortunate focal point. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated by "Silver City" at the end of the last Slaghammer-exquisite scene. Silas is the best, or hack, even medieval siles, which can be much better than this movie. See any other work instead. It is not even a rental price.
