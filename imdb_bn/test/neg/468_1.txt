The film is a film again, film industry does not believe in making a film that can only be for people's ideas. There is virtually nothing about his theory or evolution, rather than the most annoying story of one's life and a relationship with a girl, a scholar script, great independence with Darwin's life, the conversation of his character, which I believe he believed that he made the voice. Darwin never believed in high power, he probably did not believe in God's established Christian concept, but was not atheist. Which refers to this film. There was a writing and a lot of good movies, if they started with the publication of the Origin of Spaces, and created a story about the revolution that took place and wrote a wonderful cast of characters associated with all sides. Instead we got a plodding, annoying drama, mostly created, a great injustice
