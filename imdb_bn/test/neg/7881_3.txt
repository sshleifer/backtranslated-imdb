Well, how can the movie be made as exciting as possible? In this cartoonally straightforward Shankar, two low-life Paris women (a prostitution, recently raped former actress, not less), have been especially victims of national sexual assaults of men. <br /> <br /> In a very short running time, this intensely indicates the experimental nature of "Themma and Luiz" - but it works entirely with regard to adultery or thought for the full potential feminist message ... and we are very close to the dramas No, actually the violence seems to be mute and flexible- and perhaps it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, when I always show the courage to hold sex scenes in the "serious" film industry, I am always welcome. But the question is: Does this work for the whole film? Is it any good? Here, too, although we are given a new meaning in the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 out of Ojjep
