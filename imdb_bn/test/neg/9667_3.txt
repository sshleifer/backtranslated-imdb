Something strange about some inconsistencies you may find on some Cheek and Ching material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often want more songs at the beginning of this song. But on this pretext for a video, Stoner has shown us four song videos from their album at the moment, titled Out of Off My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits, in which some anonymous producers describe the record as novelty recording which can only take room in the charts. Unfortunately, this initial voice-over head hit just nails. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Often, when someone crosses the first song, intelligent listeners notice that the recording is a little bit, if there is anything, to get their attention. On the other hand, bands denying mainstream conferences often end up storing their best components or spread evenly across the disk. In this case, Chechen and Chong seem to have decided to hedge their bits. Open piece, exit my room, a sunny-themed song with an incredibly bad video A few nostalgic directions can be found in many 1980s music videos. The idea of ​​Chechen's British Punk is incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> where it has been reduced to the second number, I am not home anymore. Nothing hits the interest of a song like repetition, and it is difficult to repeat more than this aural turd. In fact, one of them faces mock Chech and tells him that we have received the idea that he is no longer home, so please proceed. The next song is a peculiar thing with the theme of love, it is not only for this collection, but also the absolute rock for cheeks and chongs. This song was created for the sole purpose of padding during the album's running time. Fortunately, Stoner has preserved the best for the end of the era, but Chang is completely absent from this cut of notes to note. Born in Eastern LA, based on the old Bruce Springsteen number is a simple number that cheats the ragan's view of multiculturalism. A person is shouted through the Chechen story, one should be surprised that the poorest industry was sent to Mexico not to speak in Spanish because only their skin was not dry. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985, and it is still so today. If anything, it has become worse, so one should think that the birthplace of East Bengal will be written in the present era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the two cut albums do not make the album, especially when there is so much annoying fillers among them. For example, interviews are fun before leaving my room. Smoke up a lot like the split up, but enough fun to justify their existence. Unfortunately, making two mid-song footage is reflected in them. Annoying music makes annoying fillers. If you want to spend moderate in the middle of this video, then it will be a bit better for you. <br /> <br /> I got 10 out of my room. They are acquired by the first and last videos. I'm pretty sure they look at things like today and wonder what they were thinking.
