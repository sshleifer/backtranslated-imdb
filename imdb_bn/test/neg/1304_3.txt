The digital effects are done on the cheap and lack of mystery in the sequence of action. It was originally made for TV and it shows. David Sauchat is disturbed and the Nigel Planner is just ashamed! And Robert Carlin's Dick Van Dyke for the London Accent, no comments! If you do not have anything you want to go one or two hours away, but do that. If you are going to buy a DVD then wait a couple of weeks and put it in Dargah Bint at Asda, where its title is! If the budget is bigger and follows the book of Richard Doyle more closely, it may be something special, but it is a little poor for him. See the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what might be.
