It's almost impossible to sympathize with the character of Richie in this film. If he is considered to be depressed, I think before writing this film, the script writer and the director neglected to despair because the character of Richie is self-centered, worthless Shah than the victim and survivor! /> <br /> Strong attempts to describe surrender were ridiculous like tragic interactions between people in and around him. Sorry, but I could not buy it. This is a direct video scalp. I'm glad I did not see this.
