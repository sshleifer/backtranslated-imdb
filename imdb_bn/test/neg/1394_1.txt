Yes, it's just the people, this is undoubtedly the worst show in television history. For your silent disabilities cousin's comments on the Thanksgiving dinner table, you may want to see the tragic, lonely and unclear hack comedian effort to entertain the public with half-hour pale and tired social ramps, but this may be a show for you. It is billed as my friendly comedy but it looks like Team Allen Richard Prior to be honest. To avoid all costs. Until you are a masochist.
