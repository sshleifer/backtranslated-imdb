This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment for me. Since 1986, I have watched the Eurovision Song Contest (well, at least I can remember it, and I was just two). As for any other year, there are both these good, bad and terrible songs - there's nothing new. But this year's show I can remember the worst. Turkish singer is just as good as a rap-off of Tarakan (perhaps more like a civilization) than the song and many terrible songs <br /> <br /> "Simarik" hit the hit song "Over Way that I Can", just felt very bad. It was not worthy of conquering my perspective. Belgian songs "Sanomie", the second coming, a no-language song. Wonder next Singing animals? Yet the music was quite interesting, the song gave a kind of dreamy feeling, for which "songs" seemed to be appropriate. One of the best songs, but it's not saying a lot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After two of the closest races in Eurovision history, Russian two. A U. Third place behind Turkey and three points behind Belgium, "Neither", "New Boasia" ("Do not believe, do not be afraid"). I had one of the highlights of the T.T.U. program, Among the most covered women of all female competitors, only wonderful about everyone, they let their mouth talk and if we ignore it, they are the first The chorus failed to pitch several times, but they would say the song is very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scoreboard was Austria, where the book makers of Denmark were the biggest excuse - a song that really The horrors passed - but ended up in the 8th place - what could be the left side of the song being silenced? That performance most ridiculed me and my family, because it was not good, It was really funny that it was really fun. <br /> <br /> What they did in Sweden, in 1999, they took the words like ABBA "Take me to your Heaven". In 2001, they made the top 10 Rebuilding with "listening to your heartbeat", again sounds like ABBA, and again this year, they again finished the ABBA-style again in the top ten. <br /> <br /> England end up <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a little sorry for the Asians, this year finally got the opportunity to watch the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserve better than this. <br /> <br /> Although I was not surprised by the show. Since 2000, my Eurovision has stood as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was OK, but certainly no. This year was quite frustrating simply. <br /> <br /> I hope next year will be good. If not for us, at least for Australia. <br /> <br /> 4/10. T. A U. For this, one for close competition, one push for a push and one for all.
