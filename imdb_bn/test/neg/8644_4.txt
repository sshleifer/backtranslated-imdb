William Petersen (that CSI guy) has a small stranger role but it's the best part of the movie. Her character comes across smart ass and tough, and it is fun fun to see him a He is a range that allows him to play about anything. After her 5 minutes, it's nothing just from looking cool. It expects you to see its character again in the movie but after 20 minutes you will give up hope. The movie itself is quite poor. A watch price at the TMN or a pickup in the library but more. Most of it comes to you. Reminds of this secret where the film itself begins to be complicated, it is a very loose, it runs everywhere but where it should be. 5 stars out of 2
