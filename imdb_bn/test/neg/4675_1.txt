As Scott, I think the concept of "Macbeth" has been completely neutralized in time and space in America. I am convinced that it does not apply to the broader IMDB users, but why can not many Americans relate to any film concept that is set in their country? This attitude does not support any party in America's BigWide World. <br /> <br /> It was bad that the "Wicker Man" was rebuilt and set in the US, was completely stripped of its cultural topic and Polticaly is correct for gender changes for a leading character. <br /> <br /> One, next to Robert the Bruce as New York Police ?, Scots Mary Queen is a "football mom" juggling, kids, as a career and relationship <br /> <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, open all the other cultures on the planet!
