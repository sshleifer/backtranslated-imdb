I only rented this stinker because of its relatively high rating. It suck completely! I can not imagine how anyone would think about this good movie - even a movie of him. There were no redeeming attributes of any kind in any type of character. For different degrees, they were not selfish and meaningless-or ill-disposed and harmful individuals who had no idea about Christmas spirit (when it happens!) I know Canadians and like them - but I can not remember that they also think this is a good movie. I'd rather sharp stick in the eye than seeing this aggressive movie again. An extensive waste of time and money. Do not believe the believer who wrote this opinion that it is "valuable". This person will probably enjoy having a tooth drill without a dentist antenatal. I do not mean to be innocent but I can not imagine what this person is thinking for my life. Until they were motivated objectives. Maybe he was a director or producer. If so, I would like to give them money back. If your money is important to you - save this piece instead of renting it - or rent something else (some!). I'm going to find good reasons why I did not rent this picture. If I'm Canadian I'd be ASHAMED that it is supposed to be a favorite Canadian flick. If so, then I would say that those who think this way must surely require a lot of powerful medicines. YECK!
