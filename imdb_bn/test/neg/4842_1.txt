Come on, come on! Now my countrymen have started making the West! Is not enough that our movie already sucks? Now you have to act in Polish and infect the English language movie with no sense? Please stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes. A 5-year-old child makes a movie which can make more sense. I'm from Poland and I'm not ashamed that this title will actually be seen by you. Please, I'm begging you not to see this movie, and if you do, judge Polish people and Polish films based on what you see there. We had some good movies in our history and we were somewhat bad but this was - it's not a bad thing in my whole life. Stay away !!!
