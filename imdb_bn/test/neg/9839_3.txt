It is a shame that this movie with cinematography does not have any plots supported by Sir Keuli (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (film editing) work, and more than that, there is no point in what is going on in Mexico. The film tries to make a very realistic illustration of the city, but unable to do it. It's a shame, a lot of the film waste. An American woman has been kidnapped trying to find her brother. The first description of the story was strong and attractive, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to bring a better description of aggression, especially when the matter of US Embassy in Mexico City comes, when dealing with a problem like this. Comparison with Frankic (1988) as an example, related to similar problems. The same can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare as an example with cotton el poder (1999). চলচ্চিত্রটি যদি আপনার নিজের শহরের সৌন্দর্যের অনুভূতি দেখতে চায় তবে দুর্বল "প্লট" এবং অনেকগুলি টুইস্টের দিকে একটু মনোযোগ দেয় না এবং এটি অবিশ্বাসের পরিবর্তে ব্যাপক সাসপেন্ডের প্রয়োজন হয় তবে চলচ্চিত্রটি মূল্যবান। Mexican Patrol from Mexico City to catch major characters in the Mexico-US border? And this police force is going to be able to use his radio from the border to Mexico City! Just this movie producer. It is impossible for these Mexicans to speak Spanish in other movies about Freida and Mexico.
