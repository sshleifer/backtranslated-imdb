If this movie is a holiday tradition, then I am going to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you think it's a 'wonderful life'? It was absolutely awful! Make my toes curl to sing the boy. What was in the world with his hair? Amy worthy performance?! Please Please, lucci is ok but an ami ????? I think this picture is a waste of money. They got trapped so close to the original story that they pose to give a modern and retro touch that it got worse. It lacks encouragement and diligence in all accounts. Lighting, dresses, make-up, it everyone wanted to go home. Just a big one from me
