This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not go with high expectations, but as soon as it starts I can do it as O-K. It was not. Jim Carey tried to try, but he spoke in all his lines as he had some diabolic cartoon character. Other actors seem to try their best but try the type of wood. The plot has a good basis, but the composer line makes it stupid and foolhardy. I was laughing at the whole half of the film and after five minutes I got tired. Most plots 'twists' could see you from a few miles away. It's not just worth looking. I really wish it was I was not wasting my time.
