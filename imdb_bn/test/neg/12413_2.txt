What really is not there in this movie ... there is a burning car at the beginning of the stunt rasar or stock car racer, a barrage gang communicates with him, who is a very beautiful woman, to give him a job, he goes back to his place, refuses By that, the police asked him to take him away !!! The drama is a very annoying little movie that really makes Hero very much and shows a biker can kill the gang and for some reason the police can not commit any crime on them. I'm not sure what the ladies biker did at the end, but hey, it's a bad movie, you always get the scenery that gives a little bit of knowledge. I said, if a piece of pieces is a driver, I understand it wrong. They may have a stock car driver because Stunt Racer will race, and I do not think it's great for stunt cars. The actors are bad, and all the bikes are quite annoying and the hero is unfinished ... This film is not full with kick but it is a pot.
