I told anyone that this movie would be good and really weird so I realized that I would hire it. Half way through the movie, I was wondering what the hack is going on and what is the main point of this movie. Since the beginning, this film is so bad that the ill-fated part of the movie has not even bothered me. I mean they're going to come with the next volcano 2 lava back. I mean that this movie is so stupid that the characters are so poorly developed and Robert Englund makes the previous movie worse, that means I can be transformed into a freak crook and a spook man. I was really bad for the bad guy, which was so bad. I mean that the father does not think of taking a real care about a police who is going through the moments of his life in his life. I mean if I'm treated like a girl, then I'll do everything to keep people behind my prison. Also it seems that obviously the character of the DJ Snyders will turn the character bad again. It is one of the worst movies of all time, including Volcanoes and 8mm. Do not want your time you do not enjoy it ....! <br /> <br /> If I do not have any grade on this site, I would love it, how bad this movie is!
