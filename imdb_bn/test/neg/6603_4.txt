I grabbed La Bandar because it was reunited with Gene Gabin and Julian Dvojevier, whose favorite Leo Moko is a Noua's best artist Gabin will put a few points on it, but the film is set in my 'sell' shelf by creating a strange plot, cheap set and laughing like an Arabella Arab princess. If you see it, then you yourself ask why a deadly few yards away from the Eidmahs did not build instead of the fort * around * the fort. And why use tin roof in the middle of the desert? But then, because of the severe adversity of the script, you should have no more thoughts.
