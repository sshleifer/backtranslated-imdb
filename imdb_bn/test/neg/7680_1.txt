Bad movies, movies are horrific, and then there is a small, distorted body of movies that are so terrible that even after seeing once, the tremendous horror can even make them impossible to forget even after decades. It's just a movie and it's hard to believe that the original film in this series was really good. Let's see, George Kennedy, Cigar's "tough guy" Mechanic's original chipping was originally promoted to the captain of the Air Force, and came under the Concorde missile attack (without asking), he flew out of the cockpit window despite flying in a FireGrant Mach 2 (Possible) flight. Lets always, wild high-end harmful muvovers, which empty the wings of a real plane, the impact of passengers Puts on! But the worst part of the film, at least like me, is the airplane dedicated to me, this torture has "played" among the coolest, sexiest and most technically extraordinary aircraft ever to fly. Concorde (or, simply referred to as "Concord" as a pilot), deserves much better, this hatred takes the high-quality looks like Audrey Hepburn and equals him with "Purky's" sukkeel. Thankfully, sometimes delightful "aircraft!" Release! The following year the full "airport" franchisee was brought to a good reception, since someone thought about the fifth installment as well as studio and movie fans would be frustrated. <br /> <br /> 1/10
