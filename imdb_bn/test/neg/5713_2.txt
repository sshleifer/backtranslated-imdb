What's up with this movie? Mr. Lin and his authors think that one of two screw-up UPS's can carry a feature length movie in the shadow-mesocultural fling? Perhaps it was some comic element (which was not deliberately deliberately), or some extra dramatic element (which was not), or if it was hardcore. No, this is just the history of the matter. A bunch of retified trysts is a myth. Hu-hum, who cautions? "Nine Weeks" It's got to deserve every Razzie nomination. <br /> <br /> <br /> What is the significance of Roger Ebert and his RAV reviews? Where was his head in 1986?
