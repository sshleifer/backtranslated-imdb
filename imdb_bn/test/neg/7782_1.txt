And do not look, this is the worst movie. Tagged that others may be, but there is no bad. <br /> <br /> I found this movie for clearance-selling laserdisks for $ 3.25, and I think that a film with those actors probably can not be worth the price. It's worth three times - because at the minimum, they could pay me to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the package cover is not the girl in the movie, they are someone else, someone is small and cuter replacing, to make it look more interesting. Whatever the "plot" was about three minutes in the actual movie, the rest was filer. And I do not want to say that the type of filler you feel is filled when it is full, or it is a kind of eye candy that you do not think, I mean that you are thinking about your shopping list. I think "music" must be made with a friend whose radio was once heard. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there was a beautiful hill shot, a river valley, a forest, some, something about this movie will be positive. Not there. Even at remote lasers speed, even with the remote spider button, you can not get it quickly. After a few years of commenting on the movie, I am tempted but I am not registered, I finally cracked because I had to do my part to push the user's rating on this sticker as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Guidelines give you "focus on content and context." I do not have enough content to focus on, and it's just my point. Sometimes bad is bad, and this film should be better than that which is more than just that.
