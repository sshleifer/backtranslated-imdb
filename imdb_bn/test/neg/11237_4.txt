I grabbed this movie in TCM, and George Murphy could have entered politics, if it could serve the best MGM to him. It's very slow that it does not stop attempts to attempt a real film-silent effort. This is my favorite two <br /> <br />. The player of Eve Ereden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor of the film), but really hit me that leading lady Francis Gifford did not change the expression on her face - 90 minutes (this sounds more!) - her abstract scene was ridiculous . John Hadieq played his role, but the script threw him and the rest cast very badly. I mainly gave it 4 stars because of photography. This was the first time when it had double features in the program.
