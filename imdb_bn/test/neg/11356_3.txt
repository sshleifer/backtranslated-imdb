This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I came across the Flight of the Living Dead looking for a horror movie DVD in the Amazon. I already knew from this name that it might be profitably and most probably the wrap off of the snake on a plane, but it was selling brand new for 69 pip, so I think I have nothing to lose. Music is not fit at the opening of <Br> <br />, although I liked the song myself, the pop-rock song is not really suitable for presenting a zombie horror film soundtrack. It started surprisingly well, initially the scene was not very bad, some acting was a little cringe-worthy but bad as I would not initially think it would be. <br /> <br /> It all goes well with Laura Coyote (Rocket to Kill Bill: Volume 2). She is supposed to play a scientist. If he is, he is not very bright. Thankfully, he was quickly polished. <br /> <br /> I was laughing physically when the camera was running on the plane during some turmoil. There was a nun. Have you ever been a plane with a nun! I was surprised that he was not crucified. Finally, after 35 minutes, we get some zombie action, and use the word 'verb'. The quality of special effects is pretty much down, but this is expected from a movie with the budget. Although blood cover and yellow contact lenses do not look like a zombie, it seems very interesting to you. Using slow motion does not work particularly well. I think this movie is probably trying to add too much stories. Trying to pass the problem as a form of "malaria virus" is not a special step considering malaria, it is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film plays mostly like other Zambi movies. Most of the letters die and it ends with some people fighting for survival at the end. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Dead's flight is a completely conclusive end. I know that this is a movie that encourages people to come back to life, but the end is just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
