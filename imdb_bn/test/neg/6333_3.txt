The unexpected "home attack" section can be returned to Wes Craven's first sledgefest "Last House on the Left", such as "I spit in your grave", "wrong way" and "visitors" soon with such nasty off-shoots Footprint Here, in the first eighteenth century, the Italians reconstruct the same plot once again, making it a continental train. "La Ragazzo del Vagón leto" ?? Known as "Terror Express" in English-speaking countries ?? Wonderfully good starts but it gets worse for twenty minutes, because sex scenes start to get priority on the more serious steps and suspicions. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Arne, three wealthy young men who humiliate terrorism and others, manage a trans-continental express in Italy. The train is filled with other passengers, among them the prostitute Juliet (Silvia Deoniisi) who frequently travels the train and has contracted a broken job with a port, so that men can take part in cash with the money. Emotion in his sleeping ovary is a night. Three shoppers quickly set about crashing passengers with their aggressive, drunken behavior, but it becomes even more serious when they take control of the entire car in Express and Barricades from the rest of the train. Soon, are they reveling in their temporary control ?? A young wife (Zora Karoova) raped a young man with a deceitful ombudsman; Juliet forced herself to suffer sexual abuse for a long time; And after the unexpected three forces of male passengers, a 16-year-old virgin will have to take the role of a PC in order to decide to travel with her parents (the idea is doubled that her father is forced to play a player). The only passenger who seems ready for war is a criminal who is coming to Germany, but what is the hope for a person against three armed ghugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazzo del Vagano leto goes to a great start. Various curious characters are introduced and three hoodlums have a truly unstable impact on tourists. Although the story is clearly a conspiracy element, the visible scene is carefully created and the film seems to be moving above its usual normal brutal level. Caro splits slightly into a hole in the toilet, in a horrible scene of a sex-sandwich in the ovaries. The scene is filmed gloatingly, and does not seem to generate sympathy for victims or hate towards impact predators ?? Instead, we are called to think it turned out. This is his worst sensationalism. Following more humiliating rape, but rape sequences work very much on linking sex and gender genetics. The 16-year-old girl seems to be teeters and especially "wrong" on the skeleton of a hard hard core. It is easy to forget that at the end of La Ragazzo del Vagán Leto it was considered a thriller, because the last hour of the film was dedicated to pornography instead of suspense. Sleaze lovers will revel it; Others might want to see elsewhere.
