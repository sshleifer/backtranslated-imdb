As the real lover of the film, you should suggest to avoid this terrible effort, how God approves the funding, it is critically a movie experience that distributes empty dramatic tensions and plots until nothing happens. Connectivity is one of two fears that at least awakened you to the Pccci that I've ever seen the worst movie and criminal intentions played by female leadership. A blessing with modern technology, you can go ahead and see it at 12x and it will last only 25 minutes, and you will not miss a plot <br /> <br /> No idea how people find it interesting and Giving some high marks!
