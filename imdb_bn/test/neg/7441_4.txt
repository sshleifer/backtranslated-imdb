Follow which touted, shoot and shoot yourself through updated heads. Rather, considering the tragic situation of this film, there was a series of films that did not require patents. <br /> <br /> What really is worrying about Robocop 2 is that the manufacturers probably do not understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) Bad action movie was a wonderful, vivacious mockery. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Particularly tedious, thin-looking dialogue on the shooting-out finale, it attracts interest and does not contain the original power or soul. Spuf ads are a little short-lived ("Warning: Continuous use of skin cancer will cause cancer") It is only later thought. And a new designer drug "Nook" is not as funny as playing a racket or family family, "Nuku ?? M!" <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation ?? Original weakest element ?? This humorous sequence fails to include a credit sequence when it is more widely used, which makes it look even more cheap and instant. Ah, humor? You can say that. But what is the fun Mayor, or Robo's Platytudes is rearranged? Yes, they try to provide light relief, for example, for the fifth film of Rob movie, the screw driver ("we only human") hardens, but no one can laugh. Like the rest of the picture, they are staid and moronic efforts for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The third and final film in the series (imagine RoboPop 3; 5) left Peter Weller, replaced by Robert John Burke, who played a disrespectful role. With tension-down language and violence, it was a obvious application in the Kiddie market, plugged across a lot of a Robo action figure. Its social conscience grew too much, and the new invention of armored attachment and the jetpack was becoming very stupid, the final film was never determined as one of the best works. Yet Fred's decker's fluid direction and flowing speed makes this one look enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robocop, then, the film is right. Robocop 3 was not any good if you could see the sequel. The second film hanging in the middle, which leaves an unexpected odd leaf on any photo. Save as a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, for pound signs. Everin Kierhner is not a Paul Vernovan, such as comedian Frank Miller and partner Walon Green Edward was not the author of Newman and Michael Minar. If a good idea, a toxic waste. 4/10.
