This movie was so bad and so cheap that I saw this movie in 80 of the most annoying slow motion films I've ever seen. I like the cheapest movie of the 80's but I will not break it again. It's not just any ideas. A family who lives in woods invites the boy, his wife, and their daughter to spend some time during holidays and films, because the mother and daughter can not walk well. We never see until the end of the film but there is some form of mom's ESP and there is nightmare and flashbacks about what will happen to the girl. From this "thing" to unfortunate prey, we have no source like "formula", what we see is a bright light illuminating his view and what we heard is a cheap explanation of Darth Wadar's voices and soundtracks stolen from others. Movies Then we finally found out and smiled what I did. This "killer" has become some tribal Japanese warrior from WW2, who apparently came back to life demanding the mother and her family. And all the mothers standing in front of the living room, holding their hands in the fire or standing under some kind of pressure. This movie is kinda! Avoid it, even if it does not rent.
