Uimiko (Wakana Sakai), a beautifully adopted daughter of a dead Japanese businessman, has gained control of her father's company; His uncle Kazuo (listen Suagat), who has been running the business, did not order to injure his nephew. Jag-yard chef Casuacak (Takshi Okumura) entered the wrong hotel room and beat Hit-Man Invincible (Jung Yewen), he mistakenly for the killer and sent him to kill Uimiko. Instead, he falls for the beautiful heirs and ends up promises to protect her. However, he was kidnapped by Kazuar's men, while playing an arcade game with Kesukake Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Your gangster crazy does not threaten to publish its illegal activity unless They allow their total control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lama Ka (Eoin Baio) and Liam Doi (Candy Lo) who are unknowingly hunting two martial arts experts in Kansu. He learned Kung Fu and tried to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A frustrating film considering the elaborate slapstick humor, spoofery and battle scenes, no talent involved in the problem 2: 80s Kung Fu superstar Yuenne Baio operates a few battle scenes but this is a little old for acrobatics today; Director Kars folk tales disturbing kind of parody schtick I'd expect from an awesome movie film; Jung Weinen resorts to play the role of operation Scorpio; And Sam Lee ?? Well, Sam Lee is always annoying! <br /> <br /> <br /> Colin Chu, on the other hand, affected me as gangster Ben; Is she a definitely strong screen presence which has not disappeared by Hollywood? He then starred in both Matrix movies and said soon. Appeared on the OAA, which is operated by Corrie Eunen. I was also influenced by Waqana Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is easy to eye and should do more in film business. <br /> <br /> What movie is being parodied, but in 104 minutes I found this film to sit through a real bud. If people drag funny balls, your sides burst when you smile with intelligent sound effects, but no problem 2 can appeal to you. Otherwise, I would have to leave alone alone.
