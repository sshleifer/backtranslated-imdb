The journey here is to search for God, big guy in the sky, big cheese with a beard. Incredible as thirst for impressive ultimate knowledge. Chairman of the management from Leonard Niemeye is Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatana Kirk. In an effort to mix funny fun with the series, including Science Fist, Mythrienics {Cloan-Dialogue Consultant, Really?}, Shatner and his co-authors have just earned a parody of the shameful parody. Where's the danger? Where are the arms of the spirit brothers? Actually where is our badly underwritten crew? Star Trek Humor is a wonderful thing, when it is in the right place and works directly with the lace, what happened before the Finn Frontier is right. Some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. When we really need another spock revelation? Really? <br /> <br /> Some nice sets and a little intelligent track moment aside, the Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
