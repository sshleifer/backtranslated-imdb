This picture looks great and my praise ends. "Love came in a very splendid Thing" in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when such a candy was mixed with trill-burning artistic girl like a colorful masked "Kiss Me De Deadly". As a trend toward small, socially-conscious films such as "On Waterfront" and "Marty", in the mid-50s, other directors think that it will prevent unnecessary, scary melodramas that have been classified by many other films from that decade, and "love" One of the most important. <br /> <br /> 50 films of this type where technicolor is the highest use of its graphics and the light is always high-key; Even dark rooms or night scenes are brighter than the average day of the day. I do not want to listen to the theme song again, because it has played quite well throughout the movie for a lifetime, and I do not want to sing it with the hearing power, the piercing singer, it belts it on the last title. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really nobody can play this part. Jones's role is extremely horrific - his character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that whenever a character needs to decide something about it, then the screenlists flip a coin to determine what the decision will take. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly tell me that I am taking this picture very seriously, I am disgusting, etc. But I like the "Oh, allow that heaven", Henry King ("love" director), in the same year and in the same way, besides Douglas, Sirgall will be able to make Maleodrama as art. <br /> <br /> I would normally enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I was just bored. <br /> <br /> Grade: D +
