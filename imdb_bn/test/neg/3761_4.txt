Although it can be very tedious at times, this movie is not really bad. Acting is done fairly well, if stereotyptical and production values ​​are considered in a number of scientific-film films that would come later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem in this movie is that it is very old characteristic. The Texas man, "professional" scientist, and all the female scientist who finally understood his womanhood. For a movie to create a statement about mankind, it will lose some of its effects by reducing its character through sexuality.
