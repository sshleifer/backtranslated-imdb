It is difficult for actors to know non-actors. Bad American Movies "All you have to do is know what?" Bad Canadian films can be shown by all young people "single?" Did we learn anything in a century of the movie? Millions of vans are being pulled down from Hollywood by the scripts and the railways, from this terrible TV-movie-made-to-order?
