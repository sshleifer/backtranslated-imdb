Human Traffic has purely a 'been there, that experience' ?? Just this time it's quite long. <br /> <br /> Searchable Major theme is paranoia, male eunuch and jealousy ?? But only silently and weak <br /> <br /> Many films seem to want to imitate the training of drugs (drug / `clubbing 'culture) ?? However, it does not include the time / down-down included with the training spots (examples: issues of mortality / dependency etc). Does it try to bring a similar image of Yan McGregor's classic 'Pick Life' lecture ?? But Milky Bar is on me! Yes! '?? What is all this ?? <br /> <br /> Characters try to analyze their lifestyle but their lifestyle is so shallow? Their analysis becomes annoying and repetitive. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack (for a movie trying to be cool) is unfortunate. Does Fat Boy Slim and Sizzle Balance Prefer? Come on people ?? Good dance music is better than this! <br /> <br /> The letters are becoming very annoying (especially halfway through the movie) and the lack of care is soon dawn. <br /> <br> Have a couple of funny scenes ?? But they are a few in and far away. The mother of the bedroom boy was very fun <br /> <br /> But please ?? I am sick of the death of Star Wars equal view. I was sharper in some of Kevin Smith's films (ie: Clark and Chasing Emmy). According to the letter ?? Yoda is a drug fiend so why is he small and chilly ?? Huh?! <br /> <br /> my score ?? 10 out of 4 ?? See yourself a favor and trainings or go instead!
