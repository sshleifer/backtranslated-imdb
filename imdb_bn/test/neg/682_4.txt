After watching the film, I think both father and mother are reasonable people, although not perfect. On the contrary, I do not like the author, and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's journal self correct portrait? No Most people write problems in his journal because he wants to solve the problem. So a journal is always more negative aspects of a person. In this photo, the authors judge his mother's life in her journal. There is no wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's big sister is so ugly, outward and internal. Firstly, he said, his father's second marriage is "not fair" for his mother. Then she said, she does not love her mother. So, he does not love both parents. I suspect love anyone in the world. His face is so ugly, just a reflection of his heart. Through the film, I feel respected by the author and his sisters for their love for their parents. However, I think the father loves his children very much, even the author tries to portray them as a cold, deceptive person.
