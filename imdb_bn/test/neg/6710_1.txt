The authors Russians know nothing about the prison, the film is absolutely crazy, there is nothing common with the reality. They do not even hold foreign prisoners in Russian special prisons so that foreigners do not live together with Russian criminals. Uniforms of this movie have been stolen somewhere in Latin America. Russian prison does not work outside the jail. Every murder in Russian prison is a matter of investigation, so that the prisoners kill each other, but very important reason. Prohibition of playing football in prison is prohibited, communication between the prisoners is very limited, bloody waist etc etc there is no scope. So nothing is common with the reality of this film.
