You will get the brand ambience for about one and a half hours, I have to save all the works of the world equally, a lineer and woman anywhere in the equation. During this time he played a man who helped people in the witness protection program. Movie cover quote. He removes their past to save their future. Woppi, this will be cool :) I bet kids would love it but a little above top for my taste. And one liners really something else, and I do not mean a better way. After killing a chicken, he managed to say. "You can enjoy the movie if you are in the right mood". And as far as braindead action goes, this is not too bad. But before the movie starts, you know exactly what is going to happen. But if you like this type of movie you probably will enjoy it. I rated this movie 4
