For some unknown reason, 7 years ago, I saw this movie my mother and sister. I do not think I smiled as hard before with them. This movie was very bad. How sequels are produced are beyond me. Lastly I saw this "movie", but there has been an impression stuck with me over the years, "they must have found a dumpster script behind a cheaper movie studio," film ", and decided that it did not suck enough and it Worse, I'm sure they spent all budgets on camera work and the so-called "special effects" and then 13 Enta was the rest of the script and the "actor" to pay.
