I have seen this in the Fantasy Filmmests in the Colony and left the movie halfway with this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe I can not comment properly, but I think leaving "SC" is enough reason. "S.C." A different movie. Those who found a coherent description, character or a platinum were found to have something in this one. It is supposed to be an experimental film, depending on the power of the image. But this image has no power. They have been forced to force people to take over easily so that they have nothing to say. Off-writer's pride is simply boring, the scene is cheap. OK, the effect is good, but if the only thing, why care? Hussein's film wants to be frustrating and worried - instead it's annoying and annoying to its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie industry is without a story and now there is absolutely no creativity in breaking tabs - especially if everything is "S.C." As is not as effective as bad. I advise director Hussein to go to the psychology or film school before making a mistake for the industry again. Note: I do not want to see a baby being slashed again during birth.
