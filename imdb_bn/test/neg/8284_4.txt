Their star was killed by a cross-country runner after a race, stalked by members of a track team and a mysterious mask is killed by the murderer seeking revenge for the girl. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of this photo, it was not very clear that it was very good (at least as far as the true quality goes). At the end of the role scene 'dramatic' track race is one of the least trusted sports events I have ever seen in a movie. It seemed that the winner of the nation did not run before in his whole life. Only tracks are not run. . . However, all runs. Ever. From there, we got a horribly unrealized female navy member who broke the rules of countless looks including his jewelry and agreed that her hair hanging on her collar during the uniform. Incredibly, strange camera angles, artificial effects, and performances, which are scary, from the top to the most annoying (below the actors, you think), helped to make this movie one of the most weirdly ridiculous horror movies of all time. . On the other hand, the writing was not all terrible and the story was just right. However, the direction was horrible, worse than bad bad cinematography. Acting is limited to just slightly abysmal. However, despite all the shameful bad ingredients, there are some things, cheese or anything else that I do not understand, which is very enjoyable and suitable for the watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, a genuine gases or wounds from the knife, etc. But, for the first time, this movie was the death of football. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linna is next to Quigly), and some extra horny high schools, but not anything else. <br /> <br /> - Cool killer: If you think of leather gloves, stop clocks, track suits, and fence masks are cool, it's for you. <br /> <br /> - Scars / suspense: really no one. I was ready to fear myself for a moment in the girls' locker room. . . However, this only led to some general stupidity and was destroyed for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A little, but if you can not find the identity of a 20 minute killer in the picture, then I am not sure about the power of your authority. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dancing Scene: There is a great jump session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and harmonica, which sums up some extraordinary 80 soles. It was followed by a peculiar combination of discs of the 70s and possibly 80s break, which was probably the most horrific part of the film. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Do not take it very seriously and you can enjoy it (just like all other trumpet touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
