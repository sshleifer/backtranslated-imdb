I do not have to re-write this film. Extremely frustrating due to the startling start, Soulo Dios falls into a strange vapor after half a point and ends on a note so that I do not think I see the same movie. The film had a lot of elements, such as chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Barga is so obvious that I think the screen will start, a great soundtrack and a beautiful position. Instead of ending heavy handed religious blumbber jumbo, the film must have focused on the forum films through fate and blind faith versus logic through some heart. The full intention of the director about the film I realized that religion was about to make it, but the fact is that it did not work only, and from the beginning, he dropped such a great thing.
