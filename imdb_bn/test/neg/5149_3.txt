A 'vacky chic' flick. A beauty contestant is dead wind up and the general suspect is round. Another entry for the Texas Cherrider's vein, it is an average example of its type. <br /> <br /> Yasmin Blyth changes her natural healthy girl's performance, and Jill Keeberg works as her good job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ('I want to be a restaurant owner, so I can give left-over food for homeless people.') <br /> <br /> If you think of your child's heart, Ask for what is being used for the brain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
