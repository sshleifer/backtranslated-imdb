If you are looking for Che Guevara's exact screenplay, then Cuban revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro to help with his power, you can read better in Cuban history or you can type his name in the search engine (you are the internet, after all). <br /> <br /> But whatever happens, do not see "CHE!". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And no wonder; Have you seen this travesty? Its incidents are disrespectful for imitating the appropriate Creator, Sharif, even the corpse and Paleness Fidel Castro. <br /> <br /> I said, like if you like. <br /> <br /> It's like watching co-production between learning channels and mad magazines. <br /> <br /> One star. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of the Palance. Wow Can C Fields?
