On the eve of Halloween, the fungus were set up in a small Texan town called Laton, because the people of the city think of it as the second coming of Christ, I mean that Halloween is not important. However, Sheriff Pett (Burton Gilliam) has been called for another murder. Local Ned (co-producer John William Gallt) has discovered a local wooden body. Could it be Feng Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character is a witch who is involved in a local legend who kills the teenager, who knows? Being hello (assistant director and producer Robert Harvey) is a funny guy, she feels convinced that her partner Steven (Josh Gobin) found out at night for the Halloween party, to leave Miss Kelly (Laurie Reeves) in a cemetery. The idea of ​​spending night at the graveyard in the night clearly appeals to Kelly, and she agrees with a girl known as Steven and Camilo (Natalie Woods) and her silent friend Jerry (Team Baswell). Out for a night of fun, many fun as you can expect to have an isolated cemetery. However, they soon discovered that Fang Lady's legend is far away from many of the legends ... <br /> <br /> Edited, executive executive, written and directed by Christopher Abram, The Fanglies is a spectacular attempt by a horror film. The script does not offer a very hypothetical, dull, and no entertainment value, with Fanglys in the right hand and a decent budget, but it is not. It goes along at a fair speed but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it does not matter, I do not know what the fingers have to say except for the bad movie and I do not see anyone getting any kind of enjoyment The conversation is basic, character claying and lifeless, although movies seem much more than the full 90-minute running time. There are some laugh attempts of humor that do not sit beside the scary elements as well and that cage will be maintained? I wonder the filmmakers did not allow the budget to show it. Oh, if you want to know what might happen to you, but you keep an eye on the past achievement because the long truth has been published, you really think that you can make it in such a way (believe it is doing something). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does not specialize in anything. Abram thinks the bath scenes are neat in Neon light, I can tell him that when your film should not be set in wood. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any other thing that creates a horror movie. Forget about the beautiful cow, when somebody eats some skin from the hand and some pitchfork stuck with some throat, it is a bit of a thing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Do you feel ridiculous about the frustrated man and his joke? Terrible special effects, Camcoder cinematography and the terrible acting of all those involved, which makes it more painful for pain. <br /> <br /> Fungalias are straightforward video shit, no feature of its rental, its IMDB user rating score is completely reasonable, it is one of the movies, in half that I was watching the clock and wanting to finish the thing.
