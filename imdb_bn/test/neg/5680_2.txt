It does not hide everything here but beware so it can be a spiller. <br /> <br /> There was a special effect on the effect of original Star Trek video effects almost five years ago. The acting was just unfortunate - some people drowned a voice while treking the blonde across the delicious looking desert. And then. And then. This track and half of the drone is actually made through it. Progress is interrupted by a few fights. The ships episodically blow up each other for seemingly apparently no real reason. Again, this is not a real war that you expect from a movie, like a more affordable video game. Boi, be joyful! Boi, be joyful! Ship explosion. Next ship. Apparently the ship is looking for some blonde. Far away here, the ships may cause near-outlook and unrest, because many of them enter the black color of the stylishly predictive child, but never see him. <br /> <br /> There are some dancers fights that seem to be made by children in high school. Again, the crude video game mentality is prominent. The warriors changed some of their wrists to "Fight Mode", and a loud computerized voice echoes and "Fight mode" flashing. If you try to kiss someone sneaky it will be a sandy design. Then you see a big power station that looks like a current day power line tower and go back to the backup charging plug. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can not make up this stuff, it's almost as good as playing the game just like watching a scary video game from around 2000. <br /> <br /> More Tracking Then he shows "City". (Lam soundtrack gets lameer even here.) He runs right in front of him, although he can not hit him with his big gun who gets into a fight with a match robot in the future. Evidently, remote futuristic robots are as effective as taster ovens in war. He threw the sand in his eyes and threw stones at him. Rofl, I was 95% tolerant by that point, in my note circular red flashing <br /> <br /> In the next scene he finished strapped a rocket with some ropes. I do not kid you, you're locked out of the rocket. It is supposed to be an advanced form of transportation. At that time I bailed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a completely disrespect for the movie that is currently made. Just a freaking humiliation. There was a droppit story but confused by the film - somebody constantly droning about "mother". <br /> <br /> I gave it two because there were some scenes that, as background, science fiction had some nice paintings in nature. Unfortunately, plot, acting, action, cinematography, and description from this artwork has become confused. Do not do naughty
