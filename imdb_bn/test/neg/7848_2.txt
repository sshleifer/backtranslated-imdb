It will be one of the worst movies of MGM and Frank Senators. A weird musical comedy that almost failed in every aspect. The innocent plot is trying to make Sinatara the fame of her father's fame. He is not a bandit and kissing !! She plays the role of "Nerdy" as well as she can be expected to give the spoken dialogue. Scene runner j Carroll Nash and Mildred Nautique Very bad they did not have more scenes together. I gave the movie two stars because the sets and costumes are higher and one of the music songs by Catherine Grayson "The song where you find it" is exciting, exciting. That one may have a repirse. Also, if a funnel type dance number RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CED CHARIS and ANN Miller fun. So for those reasons and for those reasons, it is worth seeing. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's early collection.
