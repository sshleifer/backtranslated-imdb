I'm not so old that I can not think of Bobcat Goldthwaite several times. But for a few years where he lost his sense of humor and his brain cells in all his drug abuse. <br /> <br /> This picture opens, there can be no sympathy or sympathy for female leadership from the moment. After listening to the open line you will not find anything remotely fun. Goldthwaite probably hates himself so much that he feels frustrated to feel better - even if he diminishes his imaginary characters. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how strange the bot was 15 years ago ... this movie is bad. It was not even fun in the accident, it is sad, unfortunate and the total waste of time. Goldthwaits's hands will become crazy so he can not write other scripts. His tongue strikes so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. She is sad and sad and needs a new talent to get to the room for the death of Hollywood
