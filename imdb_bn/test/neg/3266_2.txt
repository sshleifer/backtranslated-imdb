CaddyShack is a good movie by two self but compared to the original than it can stack up. Robert Stack is a terrific replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, although funny just can not compete with Rodney Danzerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the film are played by Randy Quaid, except for the original punch (for example Henry Wilcoxon), strange funny lawyer Peter Blant. Each line of what he said reminds me of the original humor, especially in his office scene (I do not go for law suits or speed. I know where you live and come to your house and close your door ** * Baseball bat Make a bonfire with Chipindell, maybe roast the Golden Retrieve (Arm Fif Arf) and then eat it, and then I'm junior up, a I'm holding you by the color of your brothers and the brother of Brooke're kryamim tight up in your brand new BMW ** We have an understanding?). But reducing his small role, Dan Acreyde, who probably did not replace Bill Murray. His voice is more than a teaser and what he does is not funny, it's just stupid. Overall, CaddyShack II is a good film, but it can not only be cut off compared to the original ones.
