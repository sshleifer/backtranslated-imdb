This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes, who do not believe in themselves. Is the white man a monster that he will call his 20 "good boys" two white children rapists and he must explain that this could be the reason? Black people are universally inspired? Ku Klux Klan really stand outside the court room shooting lawyers with no interference? Do the judges really think that the jury can whisper loudly enough to "kill" him? The black man stood standing on the shoulder shoulder stand? Can the wife actually spend a few months in time to realize that the husband can save her husband from the gallows unjustly? Did the jury really kill the killers, because they have sad reasons? Is the lawyer temporarily insane, to convince people that genuine Sanati uses defense? Worst, any high quality policy for this movie has been lost in the full exploitative and arbitrary use of sexual crimes to sustain the audience. Is rape actually a gang gang rape, really handy? Is it really a matter that belongs to the hands of Hollywood? And if so, why why stripping completely void the abduction and Sandra Bullock? And the witnesses complain of a rude rape after another? It seems that the director did not feel strongly about sex after all. <br /> <br /> It was a nice plot to kill a McGenbird and create a cross, shallow, tasteless money-spinner. Shouting for them.
