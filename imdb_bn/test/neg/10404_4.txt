This sick sweet and hard-working 5-relayer must not be in Harold Lloyd's best films. Gags are spas and mostly uninspired. Lots of saccharine melodrama Setup takes forever, like Lloyd, unusual, but unbearably compassionate, country doctor creates rounds, bringing children's life, old age, and a little sunny life in doggie. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Disgust 4/10.
