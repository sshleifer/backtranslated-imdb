What is the right to destroy Anthony Minghela's two extraordinary works of Kalpana? First, he destroyed the English patient, which was bad enough, but now I discovered that he has destroyed the cold mountain - puppy !!! <br /> <br /> I showed such a strange reaction to the English patient. My son and I went out to see it on the first weekend, and I was very disappointed, but told my son that I felt like reading a book. I went straight to Barnes and Nobel, bought it, read it, and when critics worldwide were saying that Mingilla was faithful enough for enough loyalty to the movie's public intelligence, they tried to understand how they were talking. . That's what he most certainly does. <br /> <br /> I usually do not read fictional stories, but the cold-mounted friends were so much recommended that I feel compelled to read it. I did not see the Synde Mountain when the film was played in the theater, and it was about what McGill did to England's patient. But like a fool, I hired today, and I was very upset, had to reduce my frustration and most, my sadness, anyone who could accept this beautiful story and make it almost beautiful. The screen, and now they will not. Read the book <br /> <br /> and drop the film onto the shell. I will not be accepted by a Minghella project again. I think she could be one of the worst directors of today, and I tired of praising the Hollywood hip over her head. This will not be anybody else in Hollywood. This film is not compatible with the book except the names of characters. Minghaila's ego does not know any boundaries, and if he does not like the book, why did not he write an original screenplay and did not leave the book alone. Even if I can not read the book, I will see the worst one I have seen since 2003; And I've seen almost everything I've been released to see in the US. <br /> <br /> Yale, you are not going to like it too.
