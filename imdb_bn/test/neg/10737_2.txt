Just a few words: This is a good thing that Romero dies in us if George dies, but he will be forced to go to the grave to vote against these 'political satirical' people, and the sadest thing is that I really agree with this attitude . Yes, there are junkies and they have good reason to come back from the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them ended up with a doctor of a prostitute. That's about scary as it would get, people If you are looking for a horror-movie I suggest you keep looking. And if you are looking for a wicked political satire, then you are also in the wrong place and not just the horror master of this series. But do not let me hold you back: Maybe you are seeing something that you missed. Chances are you'll spend just as long as you have. Let's just say I like my zombo-movie with the jambs inside the camera.
