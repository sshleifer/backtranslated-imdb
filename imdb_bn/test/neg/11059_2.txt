Audio: <br /> <br /> I did not see a movie with bad audio. There is a scene where people walk through the grass, and you can hardly hear them at their feet. They must be miking their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how they forget a line in a movie, so someone has to shoot them behind the head. The editor here is not that tricky. Actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's character tells his line without moving his lips! <br /> <br /> I'm sure that for the background of their background they are sure that they have been affected during shooting, because the sound effect will vary or remain unmountable when the camera changes in many scenes. <br /> <br /> I can write the bad audio in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other celebs <br /> <br /> In this movie they probably consider opening credits as special effects because they were so challenging to produce. The first title and the first few names are white with white words on the first word and they carefully hold their hands on each frame. <br /> <br /> Extra use of this movie reusable is great. Caste has about 15 rebels, and yet thirty or more people will be killed in a war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the rebels' base rebels have rebel in their hats Coming out and seeing a scene while going out of a rebel rebel door. It surprises whether it will be prolonged to meet the sudden sudden explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that shows as a mensing in the pair of running shorts, but missiles supply infinite supplies anyway. When they shoot the helicopter missile missile missile, often the unpredictable guides shoot near large bottles of rockets. They still manage to control their targets easily, which is far safer distance away from the rebels mentioned above. Press the Live button to burn the missiles to fire the missiles (because it is printed vertically, for the first time we have seen it, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Note that they use the grenade launcher, Helicopter produces the same explosion that is manufactured by missiles. It is also interesting in many scenes that how the actors of the priest are shooting at a very different direction than the group of enemy soldiers. And often, the soldiers who killed the characters (such as short bursts, killed a large group of enemies of fire) shot to them a huge number of bullets. <br /> <br /> Yes this movie is very bad. The plot is almost thought about as the 5-year-old football game, and the edit is the worst I ever seen. But honestly, sometimes it laughs at a group of adults who have spent 90 minutes in a fun time, who sincerely take part in such horror movies.
