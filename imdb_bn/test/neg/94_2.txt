The most positive aspects of this movie are some moments in the credits (text style) and Ice T The story begins; Two competing teams are going to fight it, betrayal sub-plots, strengths and changes are well-suited, but in this case, it is painful (too) to walk through. Reduced scenery, which adds little credibility to the places, and suspicious lamps, are constantly confused with any interest / identification with characters (the actress's forehead / nose brightness was blind, without mentioning other scenes with the same problem). Even halfway through the movie, I wanted to learn more about how and why to oppose what was going on the screen. Frustration if you have watched the Ice-T in other roles. Regardless of the weak direction, congratulates other actors / actresses who can play their role; Kick and other restaurant staff near corruption.
