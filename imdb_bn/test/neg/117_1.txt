This flicker is time consuming. I'm expecting more than 2 blasts and some shooting from an action movie. Van Dame's acting is awful. He was never an actor, but worse here. He was clearly good in his earlier films. His playlist part for the whole film was probably not on multiple pages on one page of Boca Nonsense. The film's whole conversation is like a disaster, a disaster. The headline "Shepherd" does not mean the title. Why not just say "Border Patrol"? War scenes could have been better, but they could not afford it or the dancer of war was suffering from lack of ideas. This is a cheap low-quality movie.
