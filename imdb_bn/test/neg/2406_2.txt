This picture is worse than cats, which I saw in the same week. It has all 80's styles. MTV punk rollers are not real bad people who are real, commercial type of today's PC, frat boys, and a bad guy called Splater. I really like Splater, and the film does not have that feeling of blue light 80, but the rest looks like it's low budget Canadian schlop. While living in this great country, I saw it a lot and realized these movies due to tax breaks. To avoid all costs.
