Before I rented this kind of "soft core", but I can honestly say, "Rod Steel: You just die until you live" do not expect that - both of which were sexy and funny. It was a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. Gabriela Hall is also hot. The reason I did not expect this movie was because the box "must be paid 18" sticker is missing. I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". First of all, I think movies should not be allowed to start with rehearsing "actors" in part of a talent company (or wherever "actors" rehearse). The "actor" in this movie highlights the lack of preparations showing rehearsing that the actual characters in the film went on to play. <br /> <br /> All right, it was found in a soft-core movie, t necessarily closed off and demanded my money back. However, the extended video "erotic" scenes, which have been added to the late-night pay-cable release, are very annoying and quick to move faster, saying no, rod steel. You know that they had some money, because I think it depicted in foreign countries. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main actor is trying to spread himself without disintegration. I've never seen acting acting boring. And, I saw Torgo from Manos! It can actually be worth the dollar rental fee (that's and Gabriel Hall). Still, there are better vocal films to rent with your friends.
