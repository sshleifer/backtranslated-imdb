This film will get much more votes from me and why I will talk, but first and foremost it gets four stars and it can be four stars because the directors represent the ridiculous screenplay of rape and sexual abuse. Not too far into the film, Wama retrieved it before sexual abuse, and when she became somewhat narrow by her actions, this attitude only lasted for five minutes in honor of the love and carrying her character through the rest of the film. I know that many would argue that this is not important in Kung Fu bit-up-ups, and as a generic fan, I can not say that it is all abnormal, but it does not stop to be absolutely disrespectful. I have time to see it. <br /> <br /> What I would say in this movie's defense is to look at martial arts or even watch a movie movie, which does not give an actual hero to the audience, to get behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; Only a student becomes mentally helpless before police shot him dead. The film's final shot left one with the feeling that Omaa has prepared herself for a big break and she does not seem to care for the woman that she had previously attacked him for love and then followed him with a dog dog like a dog. <Br /> <br /> This was really the motivational message of the movie, or maybe someone can not help after the movie ends, but it seems somewhat optimistic that Wama may be on the verge of suicide. It is a rare mental treatment of martial arts and it is interesting to see a movie that leaves you with a sense that her violence will not be celebrated. If only Karate Bulfighter considers sexual violence more well, then it creates more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or it brings together everyone, it was one of the more interesting films.
