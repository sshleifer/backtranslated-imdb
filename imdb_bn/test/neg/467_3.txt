I can tell you that this movie is exciting as its opinion. But I can not. Other species may come and mutated while I wait for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lives the most conventional life. If you did not know about the crazy doctrine, you could almost make him mistake for the stamp collector. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have duplicated Darwin, who makes him helpless. Even when he lost his mind briefly because of his illogical encouragement, he was still not interested to see it. Maybe great thinkers are dull people? I do not know what I was expecting: wild hair and trembling in the forehead with eyes, hatred of the love of Simians, madness disturbed by madness? A long-haired servant who babbled animals? The madness of the eye is like the beacon of truth? All of the above have been great. Movies for this Scorsese. <br /> <br /> But nobody was there. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no fear Just like Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly's booth School of Function Acting from Fine to Fine. I wonder if anyone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train, then why did this picture reach the goats just like the cold? Frustration is impossible.
