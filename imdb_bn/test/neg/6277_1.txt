I wish I could give this a zero. Of course, I would admit that I thought wrongly this speech version. It is released in a clever marketing plaza at this time and it is being demonstrated in the video store. However, I'm willing to give it a go whatever - I do not want to. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I have read some other reviews here and I do not agree with the fact that the actor was good - sorry even Thomas Thomas Howell Stank. Performance was no good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If the acting is good then the dialog is terrible! "Genomeas" and "Dick Skinny's" are not really cut off. <br /> <br /> For the story now - it was very fit and should be edited by 5 years old. The main character continues to be in a convenient way - or at least appear as how the film was edited. For example, he tried to find his brother in a place called New Hope. During a short break somebody randomly points to the direction of New Hope. What's going on? When he got a new hope, he leaned towards his dead brother. Then he is a part where he has moved away from his destination for the day and his car and boy are coming across the car. He was going to the other side, then the car ended up where he was? She has a black back pack that appears randomly and is invisible throughout the film. There are sections of the photo where the characters are awake in the morning and then the night after two seconds - or worse the next evening. I can not forget the main character and the preacher on the floor of the house for some reason - we did not find that any alien had arrived at home. Which reminds me about the moment when they are walking and suddenly they stand under an alien themselves and they find it. What a hell of a story like hell with two big bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? A point where an alien murders a random citizen, by spitting some kind of junk on his supposedly - but you guys see it flees not only appear on the faces of the guys. The general special effect is terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train debris". We eventually get to the end, after trying to get DC this family to find her family, they just appear. Ask any question asking any questions. Oh, hello, you're very happy. The end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's probably probably the worst movie I ever seen. I rather got a main canal - it would be less painful.
