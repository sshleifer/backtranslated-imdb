A great movie with video quality like Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who challenges "Alliance (James Cameron 1986)", to calculate the movie fan in how many lanes or almost the entire sequence was closed from the first two alin films to create this classic piece of garbage. Cast members like R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with a talent and lead "Jack Scholia" which was absolutely terrible. I think they throw him for his massive molded china. I was annoyed with the stereotyping of the only Black Man of the John Tolls-Bay Set, who would be surprised and surprised at the film. <br /> <br /> In this movie: As I said earlier, the script was a rip-off of the Alien and turned into a submarine "thriller". In this "I got a bad feeling about this" and "kill me" as a crew member was infected by the mutant and his stomach started to "hip hop" before leaving his stomach. A rip off of the classic "Get something!" By Bill Paxton We have a bunch of naval running through the cave with vague crawlies popping out of the walls. Even the evolutionary animal explosion is similar to the aliens' popping, because they charge the marines in the movie "Alliance". And kicker that mutant spit some acid (as opposed to acid for blood). There are many great examples. So if you want to see this script well, then see the first two classic aliens and alliance (with the Sigourney Wave). You will find more enjoyable time. <br /> <br /> The plot was attractive and could work well if it was not confusing at the beginning of the movie and generally for poor editing. The camera shot was quite dull and honesty, it was not very difficult to stop watching and get a snack or to rotate around the room. Many differences between the characters have not been created in little or no sense and it is not anywhere. The entire command structure in the crew and captain is done badly. I'm not sure whether there are military commanders to have complete control over nuclear membership. It generally shows that there is little research done to look at the background information at least a little respected and there are other similar examples (dive depth etc). <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like awesome movies or a big fan of Allian and Alliances and just want to laugh and hold your head down, this movie might be for you. For me this one shelf is going back ... permanently.
