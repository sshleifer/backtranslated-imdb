Director Leslie selandarera thoroughly on a regular basis outside of the yarn, "The Yellow tamahaka" (1954) against the United States kyabhalira ceineke strong adhesive Rory kyalahaunera through the middle of the middle, as has secured bekkina-clad Indian Scout, which has lead to the safety of survivors. Western artists in this United States were color-colored, but the television that Turner Classic Movie was printed was black and white. Adam Reed <br /> <br /> (Black spursera Rory kyalahuna) with the task of opening a number of his old friend and Cheyenne Indian chief, fire ash ( "The Good, The Bad, and The alli" and Lee Van Cliff) , Who dies on his mind. The fire knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne courage is ready to wipe out a nearby fort fort, under construction, because it violates an agreement with the Indian government. About the Indian attack stuck, on the way to the commander of the detained camp, Major Yves ("Purpose, Burma!", Warner Anderson), Adam discovered a beautiful wooden nymph in a lake in the lake. Catherine 'Kate' Boleden (Pegie Castle of "I, Jury") is one of the stupid women in the West who is taking care of the world in one of the world's nude naked naked baths. Castle can be truly nude in her bath scene, perhaps, perhaps all the most memorable scenes in this otherwise predictable West. Naturally, until Major Aivas can not remove Adam's warning from the fire, the commander understands that someone has robbed his ammunition far beyond his guns. This is one of the many questions that Richard Alan Simons '' scrapple '' question raises in 82 minutes water. Instead of putting the fort on the premises, why would they kill their ammunition in a secret place in the desert? Compared to Indians, they can defeat the hero as soon as possible, and release him as the only survivor. Before this attack, the white prospector rides in a rope fortress. Sower (Peter's grave of "Stalag 17") brings his partner to his chest. While drinking hot water to remove the arrow arrow, the greedy swarps swallow deep shafts and kill his helpless partner. Later we came to know that Swar and his partner hit the gold. The question of spreading gold after our heroes have been desperately alive is also inappropriate. There is a final bird of Adam and Fire knife and Fire Knife claims that Adam Major will transfer to Ives or everyone will die. Naturally, Adam declined and Indians started to cool white. James Belt gets an arrow behind her behind in a helpful role as a cavalryman. Noah Berry, Jr., a sexy Indian daughter duly Honey Bear (wonderful actress, "West Side Story," the Oscar-winning actress Rita morano) and "lyasi" fame, Robert Brain managed by a targetable Mexican scout played sick Katrina to marry planned kyaphari Officer Md. <br /> <br /> kanaba, utahe the biggest surprise was the non-Western shot, bad Buddhist officer aibhesa, the infamous Sands Creek hyakare Indian men, women and children were killed, he is a secret that he is a Native American! বিদ্বেষপূর্ণভাবে, আগ্নেয়াস্ত্রের শুরুতে অ্যাডামকে ফায়ার ছুরি দিয়ে শত্রুতা থেকে বেরিয়ে আসা ধনুকের নমুনাটি আমাদের বীরত্বপূর্ণ স্কাউটটি বুলেটগুলি থেকে বেরিয়ে যাওয়ার পরে চ্যালেঞ্জ শাইয়েন যোদ্ধাকে হত্যা করার জন্য ব্যবহার করে। "Yellow Tomahawk" ends in a hesitant note. The survivors reached another corner of Fort Alice, where Adam and Ives presented their reports to the army general on this matter, but we did not learn the results of this meeting. This is artistic ambiguity or yet another backward question. Producer Howard W. Coach, "Casablanca" painter has no relation with Howard Coach. অবশেষে, "হলুদ টমহাওক" অনেকগুলি ভারতীয়-পশ্চিমাঞ্চলীয় পশ্চিমাঞ্চলগুলির মধ্যে একটি, যা "ব্রোকন এরো" (1950) এর পরে প্রদর্শিত হয়েছিল যেখানে নেটিভ আমেরিকানকে অসাধারণভাবে কিছুটা কিন্তু সব সাদাদের দ্বারা চিকিত্সা করা একটি অসাধারণ বর্বর হিসাবে দেখা হয়। Selander, who created dozens of Westerners in the 1950s and 1960s, despite his slim characters and known accidents, this small west is tolerable. Calhoun is always standing out of the above average cast as the leading person on the top, and the well-looking Castle is valuable for her female character. Peter graves played a skunk that was the most usual of his first role. In fact, Leslie Selander did another more dramatic version of the film, which was known as "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. Eventually, Noah Bayer Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to "Rockford Files" regularly.
