Loki, the god of dirty temples, with the strength of the cartoon, made the masker a mask. At the direction of his father Odin, he spent the rest of the movie looking for masks so that it does not regret any more for mankind. Meanwhile, the owner of the mask has a child who inherits the mask power. Etc. etc. If it sounds like a beautiful thin plot line, it is either. This film is managed accurately from the beginning and it is very bad. You can find more bad movies, but you will have to search them actively. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the son of the mask is presented at the school's intellectual level, but in light, the mask-like scene seems to be unlikely to be on this premises, with his father pissing in six different directions. I asked my son that he thought that the movie was the target audience, and he responded "criminal offender", apparently forgot that the Constitution banned cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> A bad movie is not a sin, or hell will be overflowing. It is a sin that makes this $ 72 million waste to spend this piece. To highlight the issue from the point of view, we saw the son of Mask the next day, my son and I saw "Good Night and Good Luck", a film that received six Academy Award nominations (with the best picture), and $ 7 million. That's right. The amount of money spent on Mask's son is just one tenth. This is the only sin - lifting good money under the suave, when it can be used to make visible films, or to feed the hungry kids or to be better used for any other purpose. The producers would really be ashamed of themselves.
