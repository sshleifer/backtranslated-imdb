I rent for this pile of sewage waste hoped for a few good laughs. With titles titled 'Jabomb Bikers' and 'Dead Alive Productions' in Detroit, you will find that it can be a fun / horror movie, but not in the mobile phone. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the police Academy movies). The story (a joke in itself) and the dialogue is starving. It seems like the so-called zombies have been created in two dollars that they have bought at K-Mart, as a 'junky toy like yourself' toy. <br /> <br /> I'll be watching Beverly Hills 90210 whistling about 400 billion new birthday card models while listening to the backstory age and sitting within a single minute of DVD's unfortunate accusation. Frankly, I can make a good movie with $ 3, some poplicks and a slinky. I think 90 minutes of my life is separated from me and taken to Sakadam region. I know tagging in Dead Alive Products does not guarantee a great Flickr, but you are looking forward to getting your monetary value. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me happy (save, elephant whisper) was the title 'Peterborough to Bike Worm'. I feel for Detroit people who have lost their hard working money. Have not you been lobotomized ?? Do not buy, if you must rent ?? But ?? You will regret it.
