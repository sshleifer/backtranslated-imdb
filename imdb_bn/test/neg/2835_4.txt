A young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child. Both nightmares are disturbed about breaking a two-hour memory at night. Interesting twists in a hackneyed story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian Mac Warrior is outstanding in a cast that highlights Arnold Weasley, Wilford Bermelli and Brad Derrief. Brimley brings wonderful naturalism. Kudos to director Brian Yuzna.
