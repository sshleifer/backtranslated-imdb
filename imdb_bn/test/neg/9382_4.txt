It starts pretty well, but after a while you actually start to expect more from this movie. Everything becomes vague and it becomes clear. Czech filmmakers were better than 20 or more years ago. But after they were transferred to the capitalist country, here checks, unauthorized but well-known mentality ... copying ... copyright ... they will do everything well if they see any other film or country or anywhere else. I think it is a good example of "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humorous" and "movies" and money creation. And this is my one single / Floy's of Kaku Nest, which can not be compared with ART and ACTORS and stories and principles. I think these pictures are annoying. It can be done well. At least, they tried. Miserable friends :-( Can not recommend
