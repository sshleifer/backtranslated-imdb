I've seen a few bad action movies on my day, but this one is just plain horror. I'm wasting time to write it but I'll shorten it. Why suck this movie? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very indirectly guided and cut. 2. The whole cast bad bad bad performance. 3. Silly dialog and many checks 4. Many plot holes, many of the scenes are not added. 5. Bad picture (and a lot of persistency issues). 6. Incredible bad performance by Lead female actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not very well, are). 8. Even for a snippet film, she shows a great lack of acting materials. 9. Abusive pronunciation (all cast). 10. Last but not least - CIA background checks to get new information about CIA's new information about their employees, explosion proofs, etc., as many obscure incidents like Football Tournaments in the United States. Summary - It's time wasted, it's not funny, not entertaining, even as joke - don "See it !!! really, just do not.
