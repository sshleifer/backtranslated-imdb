I was extra in this movie, the first 15 minutes was taken to the airport; I was one of the most fledged Bangladeshi refugees escaping across Ryan Field's runway in Tucson (mostly Mexican). At one stage, when we stood around our tire while we waited for another shot, my colleague turned to be the extra one asking me what steps are going to be about. I told him that it would be a remix of Lost Horizon, just as a musical instrument. There was a long break, then he replied: "Man, this movie will suck". He was very conscious, I thought. I had a good time and some money was made, but with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie, I could not even sit the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen the movie "The Swarm", then you can get most of the idea. You have ruined the idea of ​​many famous and gifted people that it is BAD only. The idea seems to be that if you throw enough money in a film and renter a bigger name, then a good story and good writing is not needed. Just turn on big cranks, and come out to the product. It's not just worth looking.
