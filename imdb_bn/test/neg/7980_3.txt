Produced by the International Playhouse photo, it seems as a doll house pictured. Not everyone is a liar, everything is like a dream, not a good reason like a toy. I'm not saying all the movies will not be completely realistic, but the incredible imagination of one movie is way too much and things are way too much. How do they get this subtle actress-actress specifically this movie? Mia looks beautiful again; If we understand why her husband wants to kill him, Mia does it well. Not funny, moving, just fake. Stephen Doroff is briefly shown to the end, maybe suitable for a movie, less for a movie, but it is not about measuring things. Terrible
