It was a spice mash of a movie that did not go anywhere, on the way, the last 5 minutes of a plot was discovered when the title character was over. There were so ugly, mutton-cut boys in this picture, I lost the owner and who was the principal. I have a theory about welding though; All bad guys are played by ugly actors (and a ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims are played by the beautiful actors. Actually the actors who were slaves of the highly hunted slaves were fantastic as the daughter of the innocent priest, when the owner of the seed owner, his small proprietary suit and his principal was very hard at the eyes. Purpose? You call. <br /> <br /> I was hanging there till finally and others might be able to make it. If you just want to see bare breasts, there are lots of them here and if you have a slave / master fetish then you would love this movie. Otherwise, see it once, vomiting, shower and it does not talk to anyone.
