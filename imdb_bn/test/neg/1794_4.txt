The dark heart was terrible. The novel was hard enough to understand, but when a production company decides to release a movie based on it, then it just gets attached to everyone. Charge not only changed some letters and decided to completely remove others, but the acting was awesome and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete ugly one. Realizing the novel, I saw the movie, but it completely stopped me and my fellow classmates. I think the movie is a waste of time, and I'm frustrated to see Team Roth in a frustrating movie, especially when there is a great flicker like Paul Fiction and Rescue dog under his pelt. Very cool is the same with John Malkovich.
