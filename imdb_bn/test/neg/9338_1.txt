This short short film was terrible. <br /> <br /> I understand it is a Disney movie, which is usually a medium plot and a shallow movie with bad acting. However, I must have played the worst of all Disney movies, many bad actors (my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. At the age of 12, I did not like this movie. If they try to do it in the theater or try to sell it in the local video store, then this movie may be worse. <br /> <br /> Take a look at how much you'll be annoyed on Sunday afternoon and change the channel before viewing it.
