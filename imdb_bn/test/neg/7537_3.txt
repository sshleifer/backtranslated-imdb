Frustrating to buy tickets for season tickets for two-and-a-half-northeast England and their favorite football team. They go through the "Comic Miser" series but they laugh at all. <br /> <br /> The trailer of this movie is sold as a comedy and most of it is included in a light heart moment. However, the tone is increasingly peopled with known stereotypes of serious and end-end results in a depressing story. There are no problems with the two "heroes" lying, cheating and stealing. Their opponents are disappointed teachers, parents of parents, pantomime villains, psychological skin headaches and a tsunami but unfinished social worker. Other female characters are a drug addict, a pregnant schoolgirl and a widow who seems to be smoking himself. There are no preferred characters, and the audience can only feel sad or humiliated. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Hottley both play against the type of the worst, but their character's direction and direction are so rare that they do not have much more than their novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris BT and Greg McCallan are two young Leeds good performances. However, they are miscast because they are miscast, because they have mispronunciation. Anyone from the north east, it is clear that they both came from Sunderland / Durham area, and yet we believe they are residents of Newcastle. As Jordy herself, I can assure you that the pronunciations are not the same. Take the words "Let the poor boy speak". We say "tell the full boy" when they say "peer loud speak", two distinct different vowels. This inconsistency creates a ridiculous conflict in a scene in the Sunderland Football field, where two boys are not trying to hide the Newcastle Launch and * they * vibrate that they come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. This kind of criticism can be seen as a soft-comedy in a gentle comedy. However, the silent sound of the film makes it clear that the writer / director Mark Herman is watching the reality of retiimism: it means that "close enough" is actually going to stop. <br /> <br /> I hope the humor and optimism from this movie, and instead of tired old clich√©s are available. Tinoside is not a gray dust that is completely populated by sufferers, and in telling us, Harman should know that he will commit crime. It is striking that compared to the same director's "Little Voice" - comparatively frustrated and one-dimensional character, "Little Voice" has at least one talented heroine and is not looking at the same amount of suffering. I've heard this year's "Billy Eliot" as well as "Beltre", but that movie is more enjoyable and lifestyle experience. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I may be old, but living 42 years on tineside, I have heard that no one uses the word "Purely Belter" outside this movie.
