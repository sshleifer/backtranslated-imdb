This film just does not work. There are no two ways about it. I saw it for the first time in 9898 and got released. I sold it a few days ago, because I thought "how the hell, I will try it". I am not sorry for the money I paid for Hamilton, but the incident was the same. This movie is useless, neutral and selfish. <br /> <br /> Stormer is generally happy, but when it is made in the United States films She does not have the technique back home. Of course the movie has been well-formed (if you forget the weird stock footage here), Hamilton is eventually taken from one of the stars to the trash, the worst of Hamilton's Hawkins. He seriously joked with the character and is responsible for only two good moments for the film. "Swedish intelligence, huh? There is a conflict on condition now" and when he allowed Hamilton to get one or two words with his wife, the phone at the end of the fix. And it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
