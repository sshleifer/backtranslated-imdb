Although I rarely blown myself, I was interested in the plane ... and this movie added valuable sunny stock to air film. <br /> <br /> 1. Why the captain is checking the ground? Why does the oil level measure? This is not a pre-flight check with commercial airline change less than 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> 2. Why Captain Kick Aircraft Tire? The kind of pressure check is weird. Or manage anger :-) <br /> <br /> 3. There is a crew of cocktails. In the 1980s, there are 2 large, large, two engineered jets built in the two large cities. Now try to guess how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter managed to fly along the weak airports. Must be fast one ... and Captain's words are really ridiculous to explain "interference" to the passengers! <br /> <br /> 5. With lift lift rudders can always be reduced to the aircraft's nose. This, for example, when an aircraft moves at a slower speed than the stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. Lift rudders have hydraulic actuators. Perhaps after the collision of a business plane, it has cut the hydraulic lines and thus they make variances for steering, but it will not fix them at specific locations. <br /> <br /> 7. The eastern lane was a stupid concept of fire. It was designed to ask only for the burning of the woman and to fight with the fire, who was fondly trained? Flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. During the collision, the aircraft's elevators were in neutral position. The picture could end here ... <br /> <br /> 9 Flight Engineer (cockpit third person) has three times in his uniform. In fact, there are two of the flight engineers. <br /> <br /> 10. Captain Why Back Cabin Slash Cabin With an Arm Of Test? I thought it was the responsibility of the flight engineer, because he already wanted to conduct technical tests before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. No aircraft, no unused space. At least commercial airlines can not afford the luxury of a compartment that can fill tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go ... but at last I was laughing furiously how the screenlists imagined the plane crash. ! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters can happen in such a short time that you can not create only 90 minutes of flicks. But you can always fill 90 minutes, irrespective of style, with main-sideling and crazy shit.
