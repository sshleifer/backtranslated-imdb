First, IMDB is frustrating even with this film, because the cast list is very "gappy". For example, even main characters like Buddy are missing. <br /> <br /> Now return to the movie. I love to watch movies, but this whole torture is done for me in 82 or several minutes. It was poisonous. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen And why it bothers me so much, because I was excited to see it already <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This can be a great movie. Golden Brooks was a big disappointment. I now see her girlfriend playing a loud, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick. Melodramatic roles are not all for her. He originally killed his character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love Cast Castor, Dobro Cox, Mel Jackson and Darin Davit Henson, but they could not even save this crushing movie. Of course my personal opinion is that I could not stand Hill Hyper as a man and he did not help me like more here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was forced to end up watching movies. He seems like whispered across the whole joint. Director I would not even waste the board-space, he did such a bad job. Editing, photography / camera focus and everything about this movie was SAD. Do not mention the dialog! Absolutely unreasonable and many times the sun shines (when it is supposed to cry and deeper search yourself). <br /> <br /> I said it could be a very beautiful movie, but it was seriously offensive. I will not recommend it to anyone until I become the head of cinematography and would like to see 'do not do' for their future work. <br /> <br /> Day is a great day, everyone !!!
