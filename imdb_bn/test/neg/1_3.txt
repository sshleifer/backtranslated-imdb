This is a pale imitation 'officer and a Gentleman.' There is no chemistry between Kutcher and an unknown woman that shows her love interest. Dialogue wood, incident hackneynid It is very long and climax is anti-climatic (!). I love the USGG, its men and women are fearless and difficult. The action scene is awesome, but this does not do much for filling the movie, I fear. Script is formulas, but confusing. The character of Kutcher is trying to free himself for his own accident? The light of Castner is burning, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud yeast. I saw this sticky preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.
