This movie has no plot. It was a guy who was able to move with his grandma, and everyone hes hes a disappointed and he must free himself. But everyone knows who they are living with? Their grandmother has a big pot party at home. The final screen of the film was not related to the rest. The whole plot was launched in the last few minutes of the film. I can see how it might be related to the supposed story - the grandmother's VG skills free her - but it was not just there. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was as fun as hell and obviously depending on joke. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy smells like a great sadness" "She was just ticking her first ticket ... Yes for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's Devil"
