After returning to greed, there was another failed relationship, he was appointed to the jury duty. Its plans, however, get out of it, when he realizes that the defendant girl has severely crashed from the first grade of the girl. <br /> <br /> By telling other people in the past, her feelings for this girl (played by the camp), greed empowers her to feel the feeling and try to kill the camp, trying to kill the real bad boy at the same time. Be successful and make successful films. The same time. <br /> <br /> I heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States and I know that it has some relation with Ponce de Lyon, so a good place to start backdrop. Unfortunately, it's only good about this movie. The local police are inactive, the judge is a fool, and the defense counselor himself does everything his ability to look like Joan Cunningham! Whether I blame the director on poor direction, or do not know how to cast this cruel effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so annoying, I could not even sleep it! 1 out of 10 stars!
