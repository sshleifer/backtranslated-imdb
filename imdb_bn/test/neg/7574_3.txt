Amando Deosauri never found a way to tell a story of his story about the lack of budget. His "Blind Dead" series began to be a great start but there was some ridiculous moments, such as a small model of a water tank for "The Ghost Ghoston" shot. "Sea snakes", he threw rock and took some significant actors alongside him, telling the story of a silly monster that brings the eyes of Google eye into some water tanks and small aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence determines the stage and shows a boycotted military mission, where American pilots leave a sea of ​​bombs (firmly cartooned in film frames) somewhere on the coast of Spain, for an unknown reason. The army commander gave this order from an office that is a prominent American flag and portrait of Ronald Reagan, a fragile look, which is just one of the few things that the film considers to be eighteen. The other two Hillary is the unconscious subtitle which announces the year "1.985" and Shia Easton Hairdor of Teaira Powers, which looks really cool beside some flexible neon's sweat. <br /> <br /> <br /> Monsters you will never see from the disturbed depths caused by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that atom bomb blast killed a large amount of local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it does not have any effect on Sea Serpent, which quickly falls to the coast of Spain for some small set of Moms. <br /> <br /> Now when I say the giant is unreal, I'm not exaggerated. It's not just looking for "sort" fake. I am sure the filmmakers have done better than ten dollars, which seems to have been allocated to them, but most of the time it seems to have been made from the Crowola marker, a ping pong ball and an old shock. It is not just that wherever it goes, there is this disrespectful music, the music that sounds like "Gossa" is so surprising that it is not a surprise that no one has been sued. <br /> <br /> Tirena power, timothy buttons and ray matching were suddenly caught, and the dialogue was no longer frustrating. Through the continuous continuation of the plot, our leading actors are thrown together in a search ... Well, I'm not sure what the motive is. Bottom and strength proved that the snake is realistic to protect their wounds (he is responsible for snake-driven ships, he is locked in a loony bin after a sight). No one is there in this, because nothing has been solved till the end of the movie. Nobody accepts the snake real, and it's not even dead. In addition, the power and the Bottoms are still on the law to lam. <br /> <br /> It seems as no one except our heroes knows that the snake exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse and a crushed railway bridge) and they start an extended non-adventure to track Chasing down and chasing the giant ... do not kill it, because they know that they have no match for it. Their big plans are used to flare the scars off. Although their plans have been blocked, the bridge has attacked a bridge support after a big explosion and (big sea snakes) become so scared that it can swim. Critics thought that when the movie was not afraid before the movie, it happened after a big explosion happened in a dock. But do not remember. It's swimming away, and our heroes sure it's gone forever. Last <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just thought that they saw the work they did when they were scared when they were scared. A Lamborrhone script and two of a couple of response shots could not prepare them for embarrassment for sharing screen splashes with a spliced-sock doll / stop motion beast. At least supplementary characters scream funny and pretend to consume a monster serpent. I'm not sure what's happening when I made this movie; The giant is cheaper, but there are some smaller size sets, so someone has spent some time that does not involve stop-motion animations. It seems that it played directly, although the humorphism of this film went over my head. Ultimately, the film is nothing but a simple target for a drunk comment. See it at a team for best results.
