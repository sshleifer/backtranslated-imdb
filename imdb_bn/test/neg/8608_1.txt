Why should I see 'potato men's life' sex on earth? Answer: Johnny Wagas and Mackenzie Crook I've seen live in Vegas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I think he is very smart to maintain an intelligent and unique intellectual comic. As well as Alan Partriz, 'The Office', I probably know from the greatest comedy in the last ten years. She was just as happy as Gareth, and I was interested in how big the screen would be transformed into another character. <br /> <br /> OK. So I and Lover went to Multiplex last night and the film was very interesting, only middle-class meaningless conversations and rebellious ferries and Dave were distributed with encouragement and encouragement by the talent of Vegas and Crooke. They are determined for better things (already well done) and I believe that Vegas will create a decent straight actor. Curiosity scenes where he said that he missed his wife almost came close to the touch, though ** ** Spirir ** moved to the scene while his wife took him back to take his wife, it was not believable. And in the forefront of the film, only 2 or 3 times missed his wife. <br /> <br /> When this picture was mentioned, it was amazing, strange and old, good, extraordinary. No, when I added, the screen is displayed. His sandwich in tile was vague explanation and was not even a little fun, and just made me feel a little sick. Jeremy was completely irrational as it included the poking character of her nose, before closing her bog on her fingers. Only a smile of his nose choice would be raised, he was a kind character and it just looked as low as possible to him, but showing off the snot was not just needed and was in rank. <br /> <br /> One scene I think was sunny sexual trivia in Vegas. His blocky conversation with the second block just highlighted that the thesis is not always surprisingly endless. I did not know ..... <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that. I will end up with this, and this is actually my major criticism of the film. It is supposed to revive the British film industry. This is not a 'tracing' which is definitely ... this is not actually 'love' (you do not have to throw the stone heart over it), and 3 million pounds have actually been done in a good project. 'Mike Basset England manager' was a wonderful little British comedy and made up to 3 million. I just hope that BFC will learn from the "sex life of potato men" and will not be so ineffective in the future. Although the film is awaiting terrible reviews only by box office money. :-)
