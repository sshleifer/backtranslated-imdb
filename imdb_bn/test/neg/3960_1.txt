This adorable dog (called various names during the movie) is liked by the whole city apparently ... but he alone. He is friends with two children (Syndy and Paul have played astonishingly bad) but their parents do not give them their dogs. Then meet Benzie Tiffany - another adorable adorable dog. They (immediately) fall in love and they are jumping into the grass, among them a miserable angst increases, drinking from the shower ... slowly at a low speed! Benzie also has the most clearly abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the kidnappers of two children were kidnapped by the most unexpected, abducted kidnappers, and I never knew - they kept hiding the bushes in the capital! <br /> <br /> This is bad! A huge hit in 1974 (for some reason) which is a series of series (which I will not see). The film has played very well with "Humor", so you are just looking at the wonderful TV. The movie has a song that played nonstop during the movie - so much that you want to scream. It was nominated for the best song in Oscars at the Oscars - it did not win. Yes - dogs are better than psychic and human actors - but I need more than dogs to keep me interested. <br /> <br /> You may think I'm a little harder at kids' film but I saw it with my 5-year-old nephew. Within 20 minutes she has been silent bored and basically stopped watching. I hope it will be better - it's not. Truly lousy - but very patient kids or dog lovers may like it. <br /> <br /> Remember the parents: It has been rated, but the dog has kicked a few times harmfully. You do not see it - you just hear it and the dogs live, but it can bother real young kids.
