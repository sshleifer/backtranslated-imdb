I hired this TV movie version of 'Treollas and Cresida' outside my library on Thursday, and could not believe my eyes only. Where do I start? No attempt was made to play a game like Trojan War, like a farsighted, all actors were dressed in Elizabeth dresses. Moreover, most actors were very old and scary mistakes - Anisas (with his white beard) looked older than the Nestor, trollus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax played badly and the theresis were transvestite. <br> <br /> Similarly, the problem is that the conflict between the poor, the Ajax and the hectare is low and the amateur, the camera angle gives more attention to Nestor's face, so we can only see what is going on in the background, which itself is frustrating. . Not the 'war' at the end but its worthwhile respect. We do not fight with Trioslas and Diomedes, and no one shows mud wrestling in front of Paris and Menelawus Theresite. Even Patroclus death is excluded. It was a great disappointment after reaching the points of the last BBC dress drama by 2 degrees. <br /> <br /> Yet it was not bad. I thought that the incredible Aurlando, like Threatites and John Sharapel, as a hairless heroine did well but did not act well. I say the same thing as Kaneith Heiich Achilles, because there was not an interesting look in him and sometimes a little dry. Spilter: The last episode - Hector's death was probably the best part of the film, Achilles' conversation is excellent here and it shows a cold, seasonal killer attitude. However, the wildness of the scene (when Achilles was stamped on the head of the hacker). <br /> <br /> Charles Gray as Pandora was a wonderful old deformity and I thought the actress was playing Kreceida. Ok work The war criminal Trioulos was annoying, and I think this game was even better when Achilles was murdered instead of an impressive person like Hacker. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? All right, but if it was a small cast and costume that at least tried to show the ancient Greeks, then it would have been better not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
