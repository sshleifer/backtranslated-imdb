Patienceous NRI cycle ..... Application for those who are not Indians .... This is the biggest part of Indian film, made by the worst part of the NRI trash .... The story is boring and cleaned (NRI approaches and westerners see India ... ) If you die, go for it. <br /> <br /> This movie works with the plight of widows in India before independence. Most of it is true now in remote rural areas (probably due to its timeline film) ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .. this is one particular miss ... instead of looking at a documentary or searching for information on net if you are indeed interested in the plight of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
