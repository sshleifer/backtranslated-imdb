"Tenchi Moore in Love 2" is the third TENCHI movie. It seems that its creator took the elements from the first two to create it. In the face of abduction of the abductors, Tenchi is kidnapped and the party has to bring her back. There is nothing new there. Yosho's a past love bad guy. That second movie is completed. War between sky and rhyco begins to get boring and annoying. There are almost no action scenes in the movie and there are very few comedy. I personally do not know what the AIIC, it's the creator, wondering. I voted 4 of this picture.
