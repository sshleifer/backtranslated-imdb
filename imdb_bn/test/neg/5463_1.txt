First, there is no relevance to the title of the movie. It started fine with good development, but he got annoyed if his girlfriend told him what had happened to him. Even attempts to tell the police have failed, which just added to the annoying price. There were so many pregnant events in films that seemed more like Filler than any other competence. The plot does not reveal who did this crime, though it would allow publication of a good plot. There was nothing to end, "We went out of budget, now stop it here !!" ... if I write a novel that ends in this way, then I would have kept myself above the top. Trash trash trash !!
