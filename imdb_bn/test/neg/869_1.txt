This is probably the most continuous film I ever seen. I saw it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything that Beans has done has been screwed, my opinion, without the exception of Wasabi script) and Gene Reno. How bad is the film that it is Ronaldo, it is the most sophisticated and usually acting actor Reno (admitting that he is starting here) will not be able to make that movie any moment in the screen. It's the school of all movies: black and white, no dialogue, people are working without any reason, people are chasing each other and running a camera in turn. And, in advance, none of which is entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is not "French Mad Mac", as some people claim (actually, I think they are "Mad Mac 2") - this is a very comparable post-apocalyptic setting of only two movies and it is One kind of comment that you know from someone you know is based only on them. Mad Max was 2 Pulsing, Mad Max 2 was thrilling, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dollar's Combat None of these. <br /> <br /> I know it's anti black and white French films and not exactly saying that you saw something among them that other people did not (but you were able to sit on it without feeling thirsty) Do not trust anyone who claims to like Darnier's Combat. It does not see anything worth; It pleases so much and gives nothing back. After about five minutes I got out of myself and never did anything to bring my whole attention back. Anybody who can take it up is not human, or the most psychologist. (Actually, they probably seem to be "cold").
