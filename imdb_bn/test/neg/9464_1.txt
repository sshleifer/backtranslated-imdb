I can not believe I tried to see this dirty. The popular filmmaker Herschel Gordon Lewis was more popular than I expected in this movie. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the movie, I could not think of this for a bad film for my life. Well, probably Gogli, but I firmly believe that if Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is bad, I'll think about it. An awesome plot that is incredibly slow, drags on any real horror to talk to the movie. However, I will accept the joy of the couple's scenes when Dr. Gore makes her very soon a victim of the mosquito. The camera zooms in its extra large, bubble eyes, and this purely decorated soundtrack adds ample amenity throughout the period. I laugh for a good part of 10 minutes. After writing his "miracle woman", he ruins about 20 minutes to show him and her "girlfriend", when she speaks, talks in the episode, picnic, etc. Unfortunately, music is playing throughout this whole Fedangoura without any comment. This part of the movie will release you that you slotted your wrist with a dust knife dust edge. I almost want to joke about this movie very much. If you like bad movies, check it out.
