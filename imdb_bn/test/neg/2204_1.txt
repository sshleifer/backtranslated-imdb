Such a piece of incredible shit in this movie. At first I talk about professionals: Sandra Bullock is a black bath suite. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is quite beautiful. We told computer programmer Angela Bennett that (online profile ANGEL - How WITTY !!! I screamed at the director for an hour) who mainly check other company's software for error / glitches. So we start with its ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting a fireplace on its monitor (this far shows the distant computer skills). After finding some viruses in a macintosh program, it crashes the entire system after hitting the counter key. This is apparently a big problem, but the virus created to create it can be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> No matter what, we continue. He got this call from some other block (which works in the same company), and this fool says that this symbol can open a secret Internet gateway that unsecured 'top secret information' group! Angela saves this shit on a disk and now people who have created this cruelty are going to find him. Only after he hooked up with a bad guy, he tried to kill him before he could jump into the sea in his boat before he got into a random hospital. Problem # 1: You can not create an incognito on the Internet to access top secret FBI data bunch. Where did this come from? Since a group of hackers can control the initial flow of the Internet (even 95)? Problem # 2: Angel needs proper identification before being released in the hospital or clinic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He returned home and a cat and mouse continues to chase and over. <br /> <br /> Actually all the police and the FBI people are fool and do not believe in it. Then he will use a bunch of strategies to enter the place where he works (where the person is now admitted for that) and he will go back to his old computer. He started talking about some other random blocks and found out whether some have followed everything through some BS IP addresses. The director knows that the audience is stupid enough to believe. <br /> <br /> Then he converts to a center. He obviously had to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But the same fool that caught him before killing him before he was killed and easily hacked into the FBI (Watf?). But remember that cooler virus? Well since he is fortunate that the virus works only on software, though, now it works whole system. It brings down the whole mainframe, which has all the fake information because Manframe was sitting in the middle of some conventions ... what is this cap! However, now the Uber virus works and Angela (now real) goes away and then kills Nustubba with fire extinguisher. He certainly has a gun, goes to him so he is 2 feet away and then he decides to notice. Classic Hollywood <br /> <br /> All of these pictures are filled with BS and shit. If you do not know much about computer, it will be fooled by anyone who thinks this bracket is possible, but a computer or net related thing is not right. And I honestly doubt that I want to see a multiplayer virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* cough LMAO *).
