Steven Sigal is a thief who is poor and unfortunate, loot expert in medicine supplier, Harlan, Robin Hood. However, Harlan wants to go straight for his daughter Jada (Marie Morro), so she works as a brawny car driver for the highest Buddhists (Kevin Tigi, an underrated role is lost). Max used to load his loader, Bruno (Robert Moyono), to target himself and his unprotected colleague to bring him money, but Harlan has other plans. He was threatened to flee from fleeing police, beating Bruno by seizing secret money and threatening to fire Haroon's head. Harlan is imprisoned for the murder of police with other police officials who were injured due to high speed charges and many want to know where the money is. Harlan is a prisoner, Ice (trach), one of the leaders of many gangs in prison, the army joins the forces, breaking the plans of Max Finding and excluding each member of his corrupt terror. Soon DAA agent Rachel Nolis (Sarah Buxton) became part of this event, thanks to her master, Sanders (Nick Mancuso) who claims that the drug is involved. Also, the injection of the plot is given to the heart of Harlan's child's hospital closure and Magic Max is a mysterious dream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Help Harlan, with his boss's Mac There is no reason. Mancus's character is a great duck, despite the threat of his career, Rachel gets a lot of rest. Tighe shows the show for five or so minute tops, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes from prison and finds each rich companion of Max, cracking some skulls, loosening some wrist, and after breaking some bones uncertainly its nowhere to discover. Trach talks in his rap speech and Segal gives him some strange smiles, trying to give him some answers. As you expect, many people shoot and seagulls do not break sweat. Seeing Sigal in prison, it seems interesting, it seems that a group of "ASES" helped to tie out while planning to take him out.
