First, what is really about this film: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! I like very few actors and now he is one of them. She has an amazing skill to mask the characters. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The nine ideas lost in his own world are incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> However, I can only give 10 3 for specific errors: <br /> <br /> - The second part of the horror. It seems that the director was very interested in doing something new, but despite the effort, it was really boring <br /> - Very annoying character Melissa. I could not stand in the scene with him - as it was constantly annoying. She represents all that is wrong with the American woman. <br /> <br /> - The terrible interpretation of the numbers. The director was so busy with the character's development that he missed a good story point completely .. forgive me for koala? Bra ... terrible! <br /> <br /> There was a possible possibility of this movie. The picture is done nicely, the music is really good, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds, then you have to have extra time.
