This is the worst Halloween movie ever made. Bad acting, without Paul Rudge, and without Donald Pleasence. Who played the act (forgot his name) was right, but overall the film was largely a big disappointment. Nothing moves the story forward, it lacks the substance, and fears that Halloween and H20 are so good. All and all, avoiding this movie, it is not worth the rental price.
