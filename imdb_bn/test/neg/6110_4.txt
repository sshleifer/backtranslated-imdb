The essence of one line is actually a punch line of very old joke which is "what a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> This picture was interesting moments, it was quite slow and it was just enough to explain to strangers who are among us strangers with strange Jewish custom And why? How many people who come across this movie will know that the female characters are washing the bathroom, is actually known as "Mikve", which is a show bath used to clean up spiritual uncleanness? The same question can be asked why the groom was roaming around the groom, when his face was covered just before the previous marriage. These two examples are two of the two big moments that remain completely unclear to the continuous audience. <br /> <br /> This film has a touching moment with its excellent love and passion. The characters are truly presented correctly, that the number of dresses must be worn by a very strange Jewish man, as well as religious ceremonies must be awakened in the morning so that he can start his day. Perspectives Judaism generally has both intriguing and occasionally maddening to women and especially wives. <br /> <br /> To understand this story, you need more explanation for why it needs another reason. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people who are interested in traditional Jewish traditions and occasions as well as those who may be interested in <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Best.
