I finished reading books, and was really looking forward to watching this TV adaptation which was broadcast on the Hallmark channel on Monday night (5/30/05). The original book was the manifest that was stolen by people with a steel tooth, but I saw (3/20 out) for an hour and I saw that man with steel teeth, but I never saw him steal the manifest. I saw someone stealing a virus but what to do with the book? This is very bad because this film has a great production value and a good cast, but it is not the idea of ​​a book to change the book in a movie (TV or movie) to read the book as part of the audience. They kept me for just an hour. I think the foundation of the book was great and what they did but threw the entire courtyard. There was a great MacGuffin in this book (paraphase to hitco) but they ignored it. And it has been said in this title that Forsouth was involved in production. They must pay a lot to him.
