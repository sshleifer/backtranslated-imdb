Usually I do not have negative comments here. But since it is a festival piece, so I do not want to waste your time when you can see something that may not be played again. <br /> <br /> I think the actors were quite bad. For example, they did not play with each other, rather, they waited to recover their lines which were quite poor at the beginning. The dialogue is really bound. Whatever Norman or his name is, it will appear, they will be wonderful to choose and bite, but they are rarely dropped. After that he asked that someone was coming to an end and some people were all "yes", and he was all called them but liars. There are a number of sources, it seems like one of the largest cash bucks for $ 500 a day. I mean John gave him at least 20g ... tell the story symbol. Now you are not able to see what is going on, but it happened with time, I did not care for one. I was happy to get there. I asked him what shot he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait for the shot 'Till 15.3'. There is a lot of work needed for this. <br /> <br /> But he seemed like a pretty guy, he made his own movie, he would probably be better and I hope he does not, rather rather flexible, I mean, I wish him luck Do Just remember, it's just my opinion.
