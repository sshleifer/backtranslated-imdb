Let's see: What is the benefit of seeing Piranah, Piranha? Well, if you do not see anything with Venezuela, there are plenty of touring scenes from the people of Caracas and the countryside (and jungle-side) and various local people work and play as well as indigenous wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit of a Git (as he has always been unable to do). <br /> <br /> and that's about it. If it is not for William Smith, perhaps it may be passed as a fund raising film for children or other organizations for the benefit of "Third World". The only time you see the title fish is credit time opening. There is no mutant killer fish like Piranha in the name of Roger Krrran. Twice the title of the fish you know twice, you will get priority over the character of many monster fish, but alas, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojernalist and his brother to tell one of the last unknown places in the planet near Venezuela, but their motivation changes rapidly in search of diamonds, apparently fairly rich. <br /> <br /> There is not much that this movie is a real action or danger. What could be an exciting motorcycle race that is cleansed by the landscape and animal footage mass to get out of the running period. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only way that a movie can really be a BAD movie is to be annoying or incredibly stupid, for the last fifteen minutes or more of the film (which is probably no more steps for the film to travel). . Piranha, Piranha must have qualified for the previous badge, and is very handsome to each other. The only reason I do not rate "1" is that the movie added is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
