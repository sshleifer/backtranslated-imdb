After Matt Dillon's extraordinary performance of CRASH, most probably would like to see Dillon for real or perhaps get a lucky rebound from a great script, perhaps most likely to pick a copy of the factout. <br /> <br /> Well, fact is of course his moments, but the similarity ... everything will be off the audience. But Dylan should not move away from anything. His performance is full of wonderful and excellent Deadpan humor, proves that he is a tough actor with significant chops; It's just a shame and shyness about the script. <br /> <br /> The story "Henk" about Henry refuses to follow anything like Chinkasi (Dillon) and naturalism. He was expelled from his job in just a few minutes or quit his job, trying to find himself in the Darier Pub meeting with even patient while trying to write a noncomformform novel. We do not really know how the novel is related to "everything" (cancer, movie, you, mine). <br /> <br /> Moving from the workplace to workplace and returning to January (Lily Taylor, Hunting), a violent girlfriend who is disturbing herself, is perfect for discovering what she should hold for her life. Tries. He is explaining what to understand that ever. Some might say that he is never, others might argue that his life is simply a way of obscurity. However, with Matt Dillon's good performance, even the fact-room does not have much material. This story can take viewers through Hank's life without any thought. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance has shone even brighter if given a decent script.
