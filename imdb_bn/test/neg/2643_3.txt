If it is not for the most interesting Jennifer Joe Austin in the main role, then I will close "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. However, this film is not enough to save easily, not with long shots. <br /> <br /> Milo starts with a group of young girls with a "pregnant little boy". A yellow slicker in a house of wood where he looks jeans in their embryo. Apparently, the agreement was that if he showed jeans, then All Milk conducted a gynecological examination to revenge. One of the group volunteers to be Milo's "first patient" and he leads him off the door. After a moment the blood flows from below the door and we are shaking on the present day. Write a lovely joysteen who is playing one of the big girls today. Alternative alternative teacher with shallow confidence, whose closest friend looks like a goldfish, he receives an invitation to return home for a friend's marriage. Yes! You realize that Go back to Miloville. Millo, who seems to have drowned a few years ago, seems to be dead while hesitant and started to start the terrorists and murders of women, he failed to "test" those years earlier. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character reminds me of one of the mutants from Kruegenberg's "Brude". He could have been scary, but how terrible a volume can be that we wear a yellow raincoat? The plot confuses even myself and conclusions left me back in my 90 minutes. I'm sending Milo, an inexperienced slashar film, stand in the corner!
