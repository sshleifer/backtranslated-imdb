In fact, Kung Fu was popular in the 1970's. However, if it ever had any excitement or even half-interesting plots, it does not seem very good at all. <br /> <br /> Long story short: run-of-the-mill corography with extremely drawn-out, slow-moving, confusing plot, usually annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and the constant "plot twists" Never end. While reaching the film's emotional measure, I really tired all the winds to take care of me. <br /> <br /> See this as a milestone for the Chinese Kung Fu movie for its historical value - okay leave your expectations on the door, or you will be desperately frustrated. <br /> <br /> For only hardcore fans.
