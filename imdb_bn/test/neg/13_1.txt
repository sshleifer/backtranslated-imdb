A clear vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Black. let's see. Where do we start? He is a traitor during a World War; She redeems that by the fall of love; His friends (who are potential patriots because they are German citizens) are expensive and will die; And he winds up as a heroine. OK. The scene with drunk pilot and buffoons to work for French intelligence can not even be described, and we will not even mention the romantic scene of the rock with a woman. (However, when they visit a museum, seeing their eyes - I repeat it on the video and it is invaluable). Is it a French or a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I do not know and you will not.
