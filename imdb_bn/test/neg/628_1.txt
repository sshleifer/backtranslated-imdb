L'Auberge Espagnole is less interesting than less than any episode of less fun and low-dodgy Gillis. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hikman? A French man came to Barcelona to join the class. He goes with some other students who are not more attractive than themselves and they do unwanted things and say. This movie is incredibly soft. The only bright spot was a beautiful French girl who was a Belgian homosexual. He puts his hand behind his head and publishes the movement underarms, not the normal tufts of dark, odorized hair. But bare left did not make a good movie. El Emmerdeur was funny, so La Cage was aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard surprise you what's wrong with French comedy.
