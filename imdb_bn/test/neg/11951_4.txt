Well, I must admit, when I saw the movie trailer, I'm waiting for it. I usually lighten the romantic comedy and a fan from the trailer, this impression is the films that I got. However, I waited for most of the movie comedy to start. Although there were a number of funny scenes, the film's view was very depressing. <br /> <br /> I was also relieved to fall in love with some characters because they all were astonished, during which time the director could use the character of unnecessary characters in search of characters, which gradually slowly slowed down the feeling of the movie. Gradually, slowly and slowly it can be gradually removed gradually. Very misleading and I will only recommend you go watch this if you have really nothing that tickles your fancy. <br /> <br /> Not fantastic, and I said before; Softened.
