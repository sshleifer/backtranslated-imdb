"Nuts in May" may be the worst film I ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, what he was doing would be such a movie. It's a century's obscurity to say bad to the movie. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of bad; "It is so bad that it is good" or "it is so bad that it is good to Allah". This picture falls into the next section. This little weird comedy does not make for the slow, difficult understanding, for the annoying numbers of the film. <br /> <br /> Short: Spirir ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Angels travel to the rural areas for some R & R and camping, where they meet Ray soon (I will explain later) , Whose tent is next to our main couple Most of the movies show scenes of two beach beaches, a rock excavation and other exciting locations. In this courage, they are constantly talking about environment, vegetarian, fossil collection, proper duties and proper diet, which I want to see in a comedy. They bore anyone that they will listen to them. Dialogue is not just bad, but pacing in some scenes so slowly I sometimes feel like closing The scenery will go away forever and when the build up begins and the scene will take place the scene will end. Half way through the movie, I was thinking of myself, "There is nothing going on in this thing, it's not really a movie". <br /> <br /> Letter repeats annoying and continuous things. At first I felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audiences. The scene I mention is the "single allong" view. In it our two Borosom Bright plays some music for us, in fact it's over the same 4 lines over over. The idea was that Ray was to sing with them, but Ray knew, as well as let us know that they are the worst writers of the people. This scene was tedious, I found the song for the fifth time, I started to question the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> The words can not describe the horrors of this movie. The first thing that reduces you is the pronunciation of British which is mostly cast. Do you remember the thick Scottish touch of the training? Times that by 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our hero is so annoyed that climate war takes place between our hero and head hell. Two male rods involved in the fight to settle their disputes. It's just a stick fight! Now this is where unintensional humor starts. I thought so much that what I thought was unclear, "It can be ready for another 80 minutes." After this violent war, our hero goes behind some Bush to open his eyes and another person calls him by phone for an unknown reason. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood will be proud of a stick fight, a 40-year-old crying nature and a character named Movie 3/4, changed. <br /> <br /> However, I was forced to endure the last 10 minutes again, which took a long time for a pig. Why? Who knows? At one moment we see a pig pasting and start the role on the next credit screen. Always the worst one of the worst films of all time.
