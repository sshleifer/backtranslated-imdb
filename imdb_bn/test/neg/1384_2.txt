Carlos Menezia's (Mr. Holence, please forgive me) Completed something else to steal other comics. Hey, before quarrel with Joe Razan on stage, I knew that Carlos Monsial Cosky and Kinson and others were swiping the accessories. <br /> <br /> To get involved in the crime of his theft, he has rewritten it comic geniuses bokesly jokes <br /> <br /> And he continues on this crime. I am sure the series writers have to share some faults - Jokes should be hard to write day by day ... but for this reason people get so much meaningless salaries! These series writers will have to go back to their day-to-day activities in Bagdatta, what they were doing before their intellectual theft career started. <br /> <br /> It's not saying that he stole all of his stuff. When you have created your curiosity when you see it, you can say that it only provokes horror and scary goes to bad places. <br /> <br /> She likes to call people ***** in her show, ten year old calls him a talent. They will make Carlos grow on this day, and when they do, you will dry up.
