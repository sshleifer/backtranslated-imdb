Really terrible. Clearly, the attempt to cash in the fate of Star Wars, but there is no excuse for the garbage this snowfall. The story is lost in the middle of the day, the characters forget and the child is a non-genius that is made for the camera. An alien planet in which they reside is actually the Navy Stockwoman in California, Long Beach. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me physically ill. <br /> <br /> Roger Karamon has made some good films, some bad movies, but there is no excuse for this. . <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not let you score zero.
