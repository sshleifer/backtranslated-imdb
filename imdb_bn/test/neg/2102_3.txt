Mexican couple Cruz (AJ Castro) and Alma (Julia Rouge) cross the traveler in the United States and starts on a train snake, when they operate seventeen hours in Los Angeles illegally. However, Alma's family did not approve of him and Bruce's relationship, and cursed an ancient black magic on it, making all his snakes a snake, life is a B * tch? As the snakes come out of the mouth of Almae and move to other parts of the train, so they begin to infect other passengers with the same unusual illness. <br /> <br /> The Mallaky Brothers are edited and directed (though IMDB claims that this is an alias, just one person using Peter Marvis) would have to say that I think the serpent snake on the train snake, it's really easy. It seems that the whole film was set up and Samuel L. was cash-rich. Jackson-based Sleks on a Plan (2006) At least one of the favorite producers of Asylum, by the terrible fans, who specializes in closing the big budget Hollywood flips. The style and movies of money that are made are not even more clear than snake-on-trains, only to create a movie, because the title is not a good start with the title, the Rimes with a more successful film. Archie Forbesch's script was a junk, at first, the snake was the most fun of a plane, when a train snake is much more serious and when you break it and see it, it should be a more lenient heart. Actually it probably did a great movie (2000) as well as the Type Spuf. If you know something, I'm struggling to find a positive thing to say about a snake in a train, it's bad. It is impossible to see the character's laziness and to be seen with anyone in the beginning, the story is absolutely awkward and there is no idea (if people raised those little snakes where the big people came in? Why did Alma become a huge demon snake? The last one, did Boozo kill the train driver? How did he go to stop the train while he was reaching Angela? Finally, where did the typhoon come from?), It is very difficult Take the Rootba, the first seventeen minutes so annoying and unknown I'm surprised, I wake up and it's just a very poor film on every level. <br /> <br /> Directors Morvis are just a few carriage car sets in the train which everyone sees to see very beautiful film very repeat and watch watch. There is no blood or beef, some snakes are borrowed under some people's skin, someone shoots and it's about him. Special effects are too garbage, in the end the giant CGI serpent is really awful and at least it is well-said about it. It's not terrible, there's zero atmosphere, and it's a bit of a bore from the beginning. Real bus snakes are a problem, they are simply so stupid and nonthreatening. If you see a scene with a true snake and an actor, then the snakes do not take any action or attack them and actually want to move away from the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It looks like it's cheaper because it's probably less budget and it's show, because it's cheap. No acting is not great for acting with actresses. <br /> <br /> Snake of a train is garbage, I'm sorry but that's how I feel and I do not know how to describe it. I can not really see anyone watching the train snakes, it's really bad.
