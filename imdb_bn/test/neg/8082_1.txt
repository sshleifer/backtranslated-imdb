Oh scientist channel. How often do I disappoint? Often I think, have you ever seen good movies? Well, you gave me a great 'heroes' and reasonably 'The Lost Room', but they are a series, and some of the movies are not positive enough. Bad acting, bad directions, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that's just for beginners. I checked out director Alan A. Goldstein and was surprised to find something of interest in his resume (actually I'm half that thought it's an alias). The four motorbikes are outside of the master-crossing of a national park, when there is an accident in them, which requires a park ranger, so that they can be caught only in the forest fire, it is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens. The main man Brian Janes Park Parker is so bad that it's terrible. The leader of the activist's martial arts cast as many others in the footprints makes this guy Seagal and Van Damme like De Niro. Supporters were better and better, so ultimately some people expect the crew of the film to burn in the fire. To avoid all costs
