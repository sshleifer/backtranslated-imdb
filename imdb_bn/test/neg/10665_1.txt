This movie is shot well, but it does not create any sense and how it does not seem like a 2 hour short story like 3 hours <br /> <br /> <br /> It can be a brave episode and beautiful or oc, please do not watch this movie in a short time because you have a song every five minutes to wake up from sleep, I say this film is the lowest of 1/10 reason, and it is not a true story. Tti it is not complete, more than half of it has been created. I repeat the instruction of photography between 7 or 8 of 10, but the film is a little over, the negative voice of the actor justifies me, and I want to get on my nose. Unless you really do not fake it, this movie is not a big no-no.
