It's a recreational flick. I suggest you buy a couple quarts in the room, renting it, and inviting the whole crew for this one. My favorite part was .1.

Every single gangsta in the film seems to work in a bad "Scarface" camouflage. I mean, a dense godfather as Master P! This Ground Breaking Zone And with the well-written dialogue with the line "The only difference between you and me, I am alive and dead," this film is really a wonderful composition Yes right
