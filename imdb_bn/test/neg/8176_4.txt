This may sometimes not be the worst movie to win the best picture. The best second thought is probably the worst film to possibly win the best picture. Although it will be expected to be a valuable when you film it. Actually though suspicious as well. The film does not contain any depth, and if you want to call it the "fun" then only "fun" At first it is very interesting but it seems that everything is so harmful on such a level. <br /> <br /> The performance was not spectacular, but Charles Hesson found it very interesting to see his first major role. After a while I found many characters in the movie's voice. Who I really liked was James Stewart as philosopher shoes. He has saved me the film so that he gave it an extra layer. Despite the sadness, there was nothing after Stuart. <br /> <br /> Many of the statues of Sicil Dimil did not exist for me. I used to find out who was filming at the time and Betty Hutton's use was a mistake. The look of the film was sometimes very good, but did not generate the magical feeling of the classic. The article was very good considering how much the film was really shallow. <br /> <br /> The words "Hollywood trash" came from such movies. There is no depth, there is no legal effort to draw emotions from the audience and only give artistic value to the film. Then of course, many holes in the whole plot. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. I have also got a sense from this movie that most of what I see is not just circus life and wrong screenplay, but it is actually the opposite. Why did this win the best picture outside of me, but it would not be the first and last time of the Oscars and made a mistake.
