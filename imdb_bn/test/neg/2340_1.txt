If you are a proactive person, it would seem to be a good idea to talk about your intellectuals that you really love this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not look good and do not look good. <Br /> <br /> This stereotypical movie for snobs. If you can start from the beginning of the plot line it will be very stupid. It is difficult to understand only and is presented in a misleading way as an effort to turn the film into a intellectual. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not enjoyable. You will rarely understand the first time you see it. And if you do, you'll probably be frustrated because it's not a big deal.
