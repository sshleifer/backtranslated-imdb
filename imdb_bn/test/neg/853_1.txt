When I first looked back at the cover of this movie, I think my friends may have looked at the moment in a memorable 82. And it was certainly memorable. Pookun was the type of movie where you asked yourself how it was possible. It is possible that all of the DVDs were released. That night, in all the movies found in video rental stores ... we might have liked the worst. And yes, they were buried Ryder. Everything in this movie did little fun to me. Who will be funny about this story, if the protagonist could change the story through the advice of the main character? Among all the stupid things you can completely destroy a movie, it's my favorite now. The foggyarti character of village character, directed by Nicholas Grace, is the most annoying character since the beginning of the film. If you watch a year's movie you will not see this year, please let it be Pukoon, because I do not think it can be a bad thing. I am still surprised that if I could have been the worst way to spend my money and took my word for that year, many lazy purchases were made in the years.
