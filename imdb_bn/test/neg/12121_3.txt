Unfortunately, the annoying flashing, and of course, the only way to see it is Wednesday's private domain version, which is so vague and dark that your screen is becoming harder. Leading actors are a concern. The man tried to show most of the screen time as stutter, charming and sexy, because he was completely forgotten and played with a dame for starting a dame with a murder suspect. Dame walks alone with his light, if he is not intelligent and busy, then he is honored. It is not a rather badly written material, interesting or malicious. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no charming actress or atmospheric set. It only gives scratch on the surface of the section and if you miss a completely missful flick nothing will happen.
