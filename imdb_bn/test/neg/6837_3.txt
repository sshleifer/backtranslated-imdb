This could be the worst rebuild of Hollywood ever produced, and that could be saying something. I will take more than this and say that it is so surprising, scary that it is so bad that it should be seen. I do not know if I'm able to deal with all the mistakes I've made with it - such as casting the name of the hat from the hat, or Richard Gere's character is allowed to go slowly, let's go to Scott free (I'm sure People who say, "It's just imagination, who thinks" if a former al-Qaeda operator wants to return to his bus home then there will be no problem) - So mango Just give me hilaratite said the review, which basically is the scene where Bruce Willis check his gun. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you remember, Zakal practiced his murder in the pumpkin. Pumpkin explosion on impact, an effect known as "understatement". In this version, Willis sets a pumpkin goal, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a giant remote controlled Canon which costs thousands of dollars and can only be stored behind a huge clear minivan (This man likes a challenge ). He has published the gun with a torpedo, while Jack Black, who wants to stay there, jumps around and says, "That rock, this is Roxas!" Almost 18 times (I think Willis did not have to break it first, perhaps it raised it, tape and all on the back of the van, probably even after taking several tons). The scene became Austin Powers' film, because Willis missed the pumpkin and pulled out a tree, then the black pants shook and blackened with mud, finally closing the entire arm of the black. Pumpkin falls on the ground, unharmed. <br /> <br /> If I could suggest this film to an unreasonable cause, it is a difficult Russian main character for the role of Deen Veneira, which has become romantically linked to Cerke despite a face obscurity - a bold step for it's Hollywood feature . I really liked this character through mid-movie, so when she was killed she was shy. I would love to see a movie about her. Since the other, shit is only useful as this pill examines an intelligent intelligence. 3/10.
