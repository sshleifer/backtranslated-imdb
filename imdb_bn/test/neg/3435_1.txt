Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie in the movie. But I missed it, and then forgot it. Oh boy, I'm glad this movie did not destroy my teenage eyes again. <br /> <br /> I saw yesterday, and seriously, it must be among the 10 worst films ever made. And I'm talking about a movie which paid a lot of attention, as well as the great trailer on TV and spent a lot of money in the making of actors and movies. <br /> <br /> The script sucks and plays worse, will I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, nothing else!
