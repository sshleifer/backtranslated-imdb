This movie is a real shame for the quality of the basement, but in the 1940s it was the only type of film that was made to provide food for black viewers due to isolation. So, while MGM, Warner and all other major studios were making highly polished movies, small studios were going to them with shoe shoe. And seeing this film, it is obvious that the film has created a lot of energy to create, even if it is a beautiful lounge movie also called nicely. Some of the actors were not particularly good (especially the French people), the set was short and the plot was completely stupid, but the film had some good music - from classical to jazz to redhead and various styles of blues Thanks for this many genius but mostly unauthorized black performance. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot, it was totally stupid and stupid but still can be seen in a kitten. I love watching Tom Moore ("Kingfish" from AMOS TV show from AMOS) because he is the most ruthless woman in the history of the film (Frankenstein's Bride and many others) - probably because of that, when he does not drag, he is a pretty ugly There was a funny guy. I am skeptical about this movie that will be working as a woman looking at a woman, looking at a distant place like a woman. This ugly and rubber face is watching with a chessy wig, still looking after three suitors is very interesting. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie but it is interesting from the historical perspective, and in this age of young people, it is a wonderful sight to know what America was for blacks. A very interesting and fun time capsule.
