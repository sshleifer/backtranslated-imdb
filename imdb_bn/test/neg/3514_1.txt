One of the most annoying movies I've seen in my lifetime is saying I'm not! The boring factor number one: Never see the face of the "son" (for the whole movie). And infinitely more annoying factor: The phone is ringing irregularly ... The phone is nothing more than listening, over over over over over over Over Over Over .... Old men are harassed but the viewer is too much! At first the picture was interesting to me, but it got very bad. The film could probably be as good as a small but definitely not enough to maintain anything close to the length of the film film. I'm trying to assume that the message about racism (which eventually reveals an image in the last two scenes of the movie) is harassing this old man. What is nothing more than an old man who is sitting and spouting obscenities at what is really an old man calling him? If you do not see a movie that gets under your skin and drives you ... check it out!
