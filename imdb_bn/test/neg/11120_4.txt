In the beginning of 2005, Saif's channel threatened to threaten their publication by John Rice-Davies and said, "We have to star on our other SciFi Original." The scary thing is, he's actually quite good in this movie. Because it's really saying something to the characteristics of a sturdy SciFi animal; You have to make some sense in it for good acting. Unfortunately, nobody else. This is your stereototype "Most Run-Amok" movie of a cruise ship. The cryptologist wants to keep the animals alive, the navy thinks that they are all under control but they do not know how they are working and they are all gone, the daughter of Rhys-Davies, a daughter and animals, owns about 100 ships. What's going on for this movie is that it is very fast-paced and animated; You are not bothered or waiting for another murder. For another, it does nothing to distinguish between itself and it is foolish that this thing crawls all over the limit and is not injured by the naval seals machine guns, but can be submitted by the daughter of Raises-Davies. . Kinda took this bad boy back to number 5, but for the top insulation I gave it 4.
