Owen B. Most of the efforts are entertaining during the fun time, the film is so edited and written so softly, it is a ugly one. Night view with the first ten minutes solo style footage apparently Owen and bandits show definitely shot in the day. Dewyer plays half white, half-apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent and does not seem to pull any nationality! I give this a 3.
