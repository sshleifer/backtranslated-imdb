This is absolutely awesome excuse for a show. Does man say his wickedness and intellect? I do not see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Probably because they are undergraduate, use dry humor, and have 2 dimensional personality. I went to an Ivy League school and nobody played somewhere near the overwhelming as this character. Actually I could have met someone like them, perhaps I could suppress them! Men work like a little emotional pre-teen girls and all minorities are based on stereotypes ... letters are not all formal. Just try to be rich and sophisticated like a trailer park family, they make noise. This show is simply another cookie-cut injury that can be used by the brain's dead prime time visitors regularly.
