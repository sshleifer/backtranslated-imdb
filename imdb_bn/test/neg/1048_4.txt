Verily that I am not influenced by it, it is not a bad movie, but it is not a great. There is a story to say, but it is said in an inconsistent way which makes it totally meaningful and conspiracies to loosen up. This movie can be produced with extraordinary results in other ways, the story is so funny, but I'm not interested in caring for it yet. <br /> <br /> This is not an amateur movie but rather reverse and some scenes are really emotional. Actor and actress performs well and is a director, but the whole movie is so incomplete that I could not keep my finger tight enough. Perhaps you can ignore letters, but all the "disorder" of the film can be explained more accurately and this can increase the 'verb' because of it, it becomes slower from time to time.
