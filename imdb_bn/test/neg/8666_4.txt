Manzfeld Park's 1999 adaptation of Rajam is more than just a few more trusted films. The 1999 film is a bit ironic by many Austen Purists, but I appreciate Rosema working for Manzfeld Park itself. It can not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well-written by good writing, beautifully shot, and superior cast. I do not see the Austen purists can be any happier than the 2007 version of ITV (and Reprint on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The scrapple is boasted with excitement together and submersion to boot, production costs are reduced and cast (excluding Jamie Redgrave and Black Ritson) is basically guilty of bad acts. I can not think of a worse mistake than Billy Piper like Fannie Price. His appearance was all wrong (bleached hair and dark brows ??) and his talents simply did not fit the material. Sir Thomas looked at the wrist full time. Michelle Ryan, like Marie, was in Autopilot; Crownford's illustrative actors (when I think Alessandro Nivola and Amethy D'Davis were in the '99 version, I just grabbed my head) <br /> <br /> <br / > I did not see the 1983 version, so I can not comment on it, but I would advise anyone who is interested in giving the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind.
