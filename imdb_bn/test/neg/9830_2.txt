If you ever want to know more about a cab driver but this is just a great movie, only for information purposes. I can hear it now, "Wait, just wait a second! Why do not we follow a cab driver throughout his day! Cabbies are funny, and so they meet, and they just talk to each other for a few minutes, so Other actors should be cheap! Harry, you're taking care of the production, the young man, you got the equipment, Brian, you go round some actors and we're all up <br /> <br /> If this first 90% movie does not go bad, then that happened, with at least a plan, there is always the surprise element available. They added stuff to some pictures of Jim Carrer and They work well at the box office.The problem here is the first 90% pretty well scripted out, and it sucks quite well. Paul Dillon is working throughout the day who plays CAB driver in Chicago. I see what people see inside his vehicle and outside and he drives around the city, he talks to these people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. <br /> <br /> I will admit, here and there a few Had fun bits. A religious family tries to talk to the cab driver to go to church with them, she takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, abducting a wealthy businessman from her girlfriend, raping a poor girlfriend of her boyfriend and taking her to the victim's house. I think the morality of the film is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a big impact on the life of its passengers, which you can basically remember. For some people, he's just a way to get out of here, but for others, his common words help to change the direction of their life. <br /> <br /> The end of the day is used to try the rest of the movie, and it is a little successful. It was a bit of a reminder of death, where most of the film is rarely finished and even then it will make it better by only one or two changes. I was not very impressed with the film completely, but again a few bits and pieces were valuable. As far as the actor goes, Paul Dillon does it. John Cusack, Jillian Anderson and Julian Moore are in 30 seconds of all this, but do not see it for any of them or you'll be disappointed. I have given credit to some other people that they are not the usual movies produced here, but it was not very good. You did not take enough amount of material for just one and a half hour. It was a decent effort, but it failed any one.
