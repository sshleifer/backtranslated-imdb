This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of fat idiot blue collar slab with beautiful (and sometimes impressive-looking) wife and crazy law (s). With this show, it calls lean actress Kevin James as Doug Hefferman, who serves as a provider for a parcel service. One of his daughters, Keri (Leh Remine), who works as a legal assistant, and senior father-in-law Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stilhar), who lives at the residence of his daughter and father-in-law. Kevin James Dou is watching your standard beer drink, sports premiere, TV sitcom husband's slogan, who observes the tube compared to his marital problems. She has a couple of stupid friends who borrow extra stupidity in the face of this show's couple. This show was generally unclear outside of a few smiles provided by Jerry Steeler's crazy old man's character. Kevin James's disrespectful behavior usually creates problems of sucking problems that are usually solved by his wife. This show continued with Fat Stupid Father / Husband and their beautiful wives in Seitkom, which was driven by the ABC for some reason.
