Germany's comedy can not be worse, do you think after the "tramschip surp"? It could be. This comedy is still another attempt to perpetuating males stereotypes of masks as a wonderful comedy. Early ideas (openly gay men in football play) were a great opportunity to remove some stereotypes, but ... the original motivated message of the movie is that male men are different from straight men. Certainly stupid, of course. Even gay sex is regarded as being less standard than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve live viewers if they want to laugh about stereoiptile gay men. Well, do not waste your time in German comedy movies!
