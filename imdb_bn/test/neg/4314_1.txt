Opie, Tom Gillson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and I did not look at it all these years again. Sorry! It was bad. I said, I have to write 10 lines so I will write a little Taviya. Tom and Tuesday Welles were "launched" and Tom was told to go to the premiere on Tuesday, but Tom said he was not going with Joan Collins, and he did and he only played the role of weld on Tuesday. I returned this very funny then and still found out. The film, when the idea was funny, and the actors were quite impressive, but how did it come up with a little funny. The continuation was abstract, well, I was watching two different movies in the same way. Time, running between each other. Sorry, Bob Gilleson
