I just saw this movie because I was under the impression that I was going to get treated with a heavy sugar syndrome. I mean, check out the tag line: "They have turned into people! And worse ... they are still alive!" Does that make you scream Chesy horror movies? And then the title itself is - "Screamers." What a perfectly suitable headline for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I was not aware that the actual title has been correctly translated, "fish island". So one hour of watching this I almost realized that this was not a Chess horror movie - it was a sticky "adventure" story about Atlantis from thin fish men. "Men turned inside"? No, there was nothing to sort. I was very frustrated. <br /> <br /> You forgot, confusing tagline! I want 81 minutes back to my life!
