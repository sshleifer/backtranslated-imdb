The movie was quite bad. This is not a script problem. It's just that the conditions of the pissing cinema are really annoying. The film seems to be slowly running slowly. The story of San Francisco is the murder of a couple of people under the San Franciscopeople's Golden Gate, but killing morally corrupt people (probably I read too much of it, but hey, it's too much in my nature). The bridge we present in one of the main characters of the movie: Joe Estevez (Martin Shen's brother) as the curse police named Bill Culp. Bill is now trying to find the killer (not seriously his name, he is just the killer) and he is trying to try a local news reporter named Ritter to help him investigate, the bill is hard work - the barrier to genuine police and judges To threaten Rita, he threatened to leave the jail. However, some scenes pass, and suddenly Rita finds a letter from Monocoth (she's a cold-blooded psychopath!) And her heart has changed and she tells about the bill and its partner Joe and helps them in the investigation. <Br/> <br /> The film tries to kill the killings, but it only fails. It looks like a busy film like The Black Dahlia, but it's incredible for it. The film tries to be serious all the time, but its scenes, such as murderous masturbation (apparently a fan of pregnant porn that is "Oh Blood" or something like its effects) and Joe Estevez hit the table: "She is a bloody murderer!" More than once, I accepted to chicling, although I'm sure it was considered a serious serious film. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive aspects is going on for a movie. That's the money I paid to see it (huzzah netflix). And it was tragic because I could see something good in their movie after seeing the dined. Of course, the film's flaws were its fair share, but it was enjoyable. Sadly though there is nothing for San Francisco. It has a fantastic script that allowed nothing too grand to it, but it can be interesting. Instead of what you get, a murder thriller that fails to thrill or even makes usable enjoyable deaths. Other reviews also claim that "a great twist which is frustrating" in the movie, apparently, I was seeing a different movie because I have identified what was going on with an hour mark. Last bit does not shock me at all. But I do not think I would go to insult this debris of a movie. The short story short film is a boring obscure thriller (I'm using the word unexpectedly) that fails to achieve "HitachiChrians Thrills", another reviewer claims that the prediction of ending, dry death, acting with all the emotional strings, and a decent soundtrack . <br /> <br /> I'm sure others would try to protect it normally: it was a low budget movie, they could make as well as they could with so little budget, and it's all the other meaningless. But when you look at it, very little they could spend the budget, very few special effects could work, like the soundtrack it seems to have been recycled from Living Dead or Damaged Hood. , And it's the same elite crew from those two films. This movie really reminds me of a little budget flick which was not good and it was known as Mr. Jingles, both of them were of the same quality, they failed to provide something near the enjoyment and should be faded quickly in blurry.
