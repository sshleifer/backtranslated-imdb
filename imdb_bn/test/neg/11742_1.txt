Van Sant shot Hitakoek's best artist shot for some modern direction shot: a knee guy, and Anna Hiech's nudity. If you want to look nude on a beautiful laugh, it's basically there is no reason to see this movie instead. Hitkouk's masterpiece is so good and Van Cant was unable to understand that nudity and hiding the hole, the main shower scene is even more awesome. Asked about that about Jeanette Leigh. The acting is very less impressive and very handy in technical aspects.
