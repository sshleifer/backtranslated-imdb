When my mother went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson, always take my mom to the video store! Why did he choose it because Colin Firth was in him and he * cough * thinks he's a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with some beautiful veiws in Africa and then goes down and down and down and down. After this film, I was surprised that Colin Firth had gone so far that this silly film could destroy an actor's career. <br /> <br /> The story is about divorced women, whose son is trying to associate with her, told Matthew Fields when she had friends of friends because of her big house. <br /> <br /> Matthew does not like Nami's list and is going with local vicar who does not like his son John. ... and the same with him <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you do not agree with me and I hope I do not bother you, but I'll leave you to all those who have not seen this movie. With one sound, do not see this film !!!!!
