Sometimes the full moon makes the entertainment movie. This is not one of them. The full moon is like a low-key trombone. Their movies are not violent or outside the wall, but they are usually without talent. The performance of this movie is not terrible, but the script is quite bad, and overall it is quite annoying and it has some nudity (like many full moon films) even it does not have to be freed. Leave this one, and go to the "head of the family" to rent.
