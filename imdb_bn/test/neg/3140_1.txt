You know, I always like annoying or strange movies, especially when they are shown in the Hamburger Fantasy Films festival. But subconscious cruelty is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Will this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I did not understand this movie. But well, what you can expect from a festival crowd, "We (boys from the festival) know that you will not see everyone until this end." <br /> /> I like Splatter movies and I Like movies with strong graphical language. But this? There are many bloody scenes here, but why? What is the director trying to tell us? What is he saying that we have lost all morality and religious feelings? Or is he saying that the turmoil will always end in a disaster? Who knows - I do not. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that holds you for a while - see it. But do not expect to think "wow, I got the message" - I did not get it ...
