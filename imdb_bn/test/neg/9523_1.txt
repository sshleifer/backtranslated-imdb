Other than the critics below, I do not think that this great and exciting piece of navy surveillance director should have a great and striking career ahead. A British director feels like trying to stop the convention from limiting, the sole demand for exclusive fame depends on the triple screen innovation. At first you think it can be an attractive device, but its only real contribution to the film is to check your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different corners of a 2-dimensional movie, it is not too expressive or complex. If you can forget the Triple Screen (which is very hard to do), you will have to deal with the strange ridiculous script. Visitors are submitted by chiche on the chiche about the British class system. The film has political and emotional sophistication of an upper and lower level episode. Sum up: Emperor's new clothes. And a rather poor party, too.
