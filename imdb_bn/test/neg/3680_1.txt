If they have a zero in 10 then I would like to enter it. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of taking money from the public themselves. I do not know how to release such film videos or pay channels. I'm frustrated Vincent Galloway Val Kilmer had it in about 8 minutes, so I can not get him crazy. Only the person who listed him as a star. It's like Superman's Marlon Brando. There is no plot, except for searching Galois and finding his friends in Katchomes. The manager only knew why they were looking for the door of hell. They will have to burn this image in Moscow and keep it in the fire to keep all homeless extra heat for the night. There is nothing more to say about this movie which has been written by all other critics. I want to forget this movie, it hurts my brain.
