I saw this picture in TNT and to tell me, this movie is continuously dry and sunny. But after a certain point, I started to stop off my socks and tell the truth, they should be classified as comedy instead of action / adventure in this movie. Delan and Kennedy Loop created 360 French and ordered to destroy Wagoner Concord in order to avoid French missiles, the most ridiculous scenario came out. Our unarmed leader, Kennedy, decided to take out the window to stop the heat in search of the missile. Wicked is still funny --- --- although after a shot, riot gun malfunctions and Kennedy tries to fix it in cocktails and good ... if you want to know what this movie wants to get a hold. There is a total lack of plots in the stupid sections of this movie ---- Yes, take some steps for 25 minutes rather than Paris's place and go for an hour in prostitution and love scenes with flight attendants. Now leave for Sabbatore for ten minutes, then the rest of the movie rests and a plane that is apparently broken and the passenger don "t it sees it !? His right to front of their size !!!! - The final rating for this step - - (4/10) 4 stars out of 4 stars, but it's a comedy
