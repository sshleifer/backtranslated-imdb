This movie was sick to start. Here your wife is going to die and you go strutting around the city with this blonde chick next to you. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. The hunk (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast across this movie. I called him fast han. Fast Han married this beautiful lady and you know that she is having sex with her best friends. She is "doing it" with Kevin in Berner and I find myself hindà¨¸ friends. Kevin stood up, threw his clothes and bamboo !! Just like this other man's weapon and they started "doing it" right there. I guess she's finally what Kevin started. How big !!!! Am I like this lifetime movie? This is a common old man young woman film which says that you get my money but you can get my body ...
