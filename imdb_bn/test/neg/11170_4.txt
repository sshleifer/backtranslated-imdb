Robert Wilde's brutal black comedy "The Grisom Gang", a 1948 British film "No Orchids for Miss Blandish", was kidnapped by a decree of the 1920s, Kim Derby kidnapped by a kidnapping victim; Soon, the gang is robbed and the poor Kim is transferred to another whistle strap - a third-rate gangster, brother sweaty, pasty face and dragging a mother like Buddy Ibsen. First, Derby (very fortunate and not very smart) tries to escape from the Dowling Brude, but they're on her. Finally he just gave up trying, and there lies the problem with the story. Are we supposed to be sympathetic with the audience? Half of the family is increasingly worried about its growing concern being intriguing? These are hateful, slaves, and I wanted to see them as much as possible. But from side stories (in this case, the progress of the police and other people involved with the Phuozi-singer Connie Stevens) is relatively relentless, and there is no alternative except to keep foisting those sweaty faces. Soon, the nervous Derby begins to sweat very much, although her view is sensitively performed in the hello and the clerical moments of the aldricy are unsettling, if unsettling. ** **** to
