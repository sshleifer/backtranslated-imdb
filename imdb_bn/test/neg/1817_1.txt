I felt last night's episode gradually and annoying kinda. I honestly do not think it has something to do with writing. Because I knew the story was well organized and tried to keep things in place. I did not have it bad but overall, I did not enjoy it. The worst thing is to do with the episode director-Stephen Williams. I always hate Stephen Williams's instruction. If Jack continues with this episode of Bender Season's premiere, he would keep it at a good pace and keep things flat for keeping things interesting. I am glad that next week's Jack Bandner gives directions and it will be better and I'm glad he got the first directorial guideline and I'm interested in dragging this time that Stephen Williams has instructed many Sidi <br /> <br /> I always think We need to throw Stephen Williams out of the show. He does not do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why is the target open while in a helicopter? It was so annoying! Camera work bad bad point of view!
