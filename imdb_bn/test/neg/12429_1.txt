There are some strange things in the loop. Water crystals clean, not cold. Rise a giant robotics plastic giant and kill the Scots! What is this movie?! First, I generally love reading the stories about sea monsters, Nessie. I saw this for sale, I had a cheap rod off of it jaws. No, it was terrible! The story was in vain, acting was 100% garbage, the only top side was a cool mechanical ness which they used to use. It was wrong, wrong location, and everything was bad enough. Do not value your time, just look at it (or can trash) you found it. In the second note, this film was shot in a discontent, not loch ness, in Silifila among Nelie's fans.
