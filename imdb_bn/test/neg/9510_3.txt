The third pillar works well for the transfer of Shakespeare to the screen, by Mel Gibson ("Mad Max," Lethal Weapon "", "The Taming of the Strue," "Romeo and Juliet," "Jesus of Nazareth", "Othello") And former "The Passion of the Christ" notoriety) previously played by Sir Lawrence Olivi (and correctly; see my review on my "Hamlet", logical The best explanation (and the most cited tragedy) of Bird's duration was renewed and after 5 years, Kenyeth Branagh was renewed as a full blooded treatment, it explains the running time of 3 hours and 22 minutes, combined with the dream cast (and many additional additions that were well-chosen and Contemporary master of William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, "Henry V" and "Dead Agent" The director of "Lethal Weapon" has skillfully joined Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"), Paul Scofield ("A Man for All Seasons"), Allan Bates, Ian Holmes, Michael Malny (opposite Keith Brunge as Rodgergo ) And Oliver Parker's "Othello" Law and Lawrence Fishburn (see my review of the "Stage" version of the tragedy, though he only played it) Branagyaga his "Hamlet" as the 3-hour version lartesa throw. Sir Lawrence Olivier, his classic version of respect and play; 5 years later see his review), Nathaniel Parker (who will be cast as Casio in his brother's "Othello" version 4 years later) and Helen Bonham-Carter, who is "Frankiestein of Mary Shelley" 4 years later. <br /> <br / > <br /> Zafriyi honored this film with Sir Lawrence Olivia (who died 2 years ago in this movie), and it works quite well in most cases. I was a bit uncomfortable in the line and in one scene, he highlighted a ghost of Hamlet, and Helena Bonham-Carter was not pleased with me as Ophalia. Gene Simmons (who played a role in the Olivier version) and Kate Winslet (who is responsible for Kenneth Branagh's misconduct Hamlet's epic revisionist reconstruction did an acceptable job) Jean Simm Sa the genes with the Simmons greatest apaheliya, so in 1948 the actress was nominated as (he no shame did not). Ian Holm said his line very quickly, slowly, as I expected, with a view, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again, I've used more about the role of Felix Alem and Richard Beers and I think they did a better job than Hamlet in the related version of "Hamlet" (both great directors, editors, edited by text editor, and all versions of Bird's work They) as polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was excellent. Hamlet did very well with his mother's collision scene, but Olivier and Brangha made the scene stronger to make the scene more emotional intensity and scenery. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version time to pass, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend to first see the Olivier version, then Brangha and finally this version is shown). Despite the film's "PG" rating, the film was not really offensive. The only game is called for. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> # 1 Sir Lawrence Olivier and Kenneth Brangh Both were good that I could not determine which one was best. See my reviews of this edition for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Jeffrelli This one was OK. It starts with a scene visible in the play, but the actual start of the game should move, where a guard can cry "Who is there?" "No, answer me. Stand up to yourself!" That scene scares the hell from you because you are sitting quietly and then-left !!, you almost go out of your skin. In short, the rest of that scene sets the tone for the game. Jefferrley abandoned the scene of the huge mistake in the part. It has made too many lines wrong (and the others that I think should be spent), as Hamlet Opelia tells that the line "You go to a noon, why do you want to be a sinner?"; The line was thought to have happened in the scene, where it was not kept in the film ("be or do not be" soliloquy.This version is a wonderful piece of literature struggling to cut too much or too little from Kenneth Branhaa after 5 years of the tragedy Oscar With her remake, her version made Sir Lawrence Olivier more suitable for the honor, because most actors (next to him) Toss / or "Hamlet" in the film, during the various occasions, however, the game with Jeffrey's "Hamlet" was faithful to the game and what I was looking for. The final law conflict was similar to the versions of Olivier and Branag, only previous versions of Branag's version There were more violent than the definition of two trusted versions (more with the line with the game Olivia was pulling it down ... and it worked equally well) and got trapped more closely for the game, threw some of Brangh's neutral touch, his own ... very good effect. <br /> <br /> Rate this Not done.
