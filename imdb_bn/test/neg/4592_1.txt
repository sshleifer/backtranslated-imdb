This movie is terrible. The real hockey fan should realize that the people who appeared and produced in this movie never played or saw a real hockey game. I hope this will be a "movie of the people", but only 13-17 year old women who can enjoy this movie. Hockey scenes are terrible, opponents play like a 5-year-old player, diving targets in 10-feet wide net shots, etc. Although the end of this film is very difficult to predict! For those who saw it, who would be supposed to ?? For those who did not see it, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> I could paint less than half of the pictures through the film. This movie is a play funny to call !!
