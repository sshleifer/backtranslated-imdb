For those who have a few words for this movie, I suspect it was not visible after it was published as "Part: The Clones Horror". <br /> <br /> This is a terrific annoying movie. It missed the marks in at least three ways. It was not good enough to be awesome; It was not bad enough to be funny (although MST3K takes care of that); And, even in 1979, the plot was unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Previously, the brokers "The Resurrection of Zacchira Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clone as part of the spare parts). The movie was entertaining, and it was a fine throw. Another "sleeper" (1973). Yes, Woody Allen Movies. Remember smile nose? And "Clones" (1973). The last two plots are not the same as Clonona, but they predict Clonus. They have been involved in many fiction books decades ago, which deal with the idea, although often "clones" are not used.
