I think many people like this movie (not all people, but many of them) because they do not want to admit they do not understand it. Minimal intelligence is the person, if you, who are so avant garde and trendy who think that Lin Ch is a gifted genius. <br /> <br /> Like me, Lynch is a Tarantino. They both are great, but one would like to believe so many fanboys in the Messianic. Any director can change the world, so chill out. And both of them sometimes sucky flicks, it's just that. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, since this movie was originally designed as a pilot and then hacked into a feature film, it was not created with all the emotions and predictions, which should be kept in the movie. Face it, most of the film is unrecognizability, which can not be understood. We can all make up the meaning, Lynch can have his own opinion, but no matter what. It was cut off about the screen. Confession, the first part was deliberately similar to the kind of funny story, but then it failed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I almost cried out to David Lynch, Forcing around to gather and explain to all of them "How crazy and weird it is, is not it extraordinary? It's weird and crazy!" It's a derivative product in your style if it works weird and crazy. However, when you get out of your way to do something, it's fierce and tired. Just like the half-ass fiction that has been thrown out of the fiction after Paul Fiction. It just does not calm down.
