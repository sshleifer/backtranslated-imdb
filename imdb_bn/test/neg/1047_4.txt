I saw this episode with a high episode after seeing it in the list of many people's "Favorite Piece" list. I'm not proud of anyway, but from the beginning, I realized that they were in some toy toys / cans, looking at them under a huge eye, there are character types. Even though throughout the episode, "Who are we?" The questions, "Where are we?", "What's outside?" Carries the mystery of the episode (which I have unfortunately already found), I must say that the interaction between different types of characters and their interactions makes it fun enough. Although the twist of the story was difficult to guess if all of them (toys) were soldiers.
