Nearly every true great crime thriller's heart is carefully considered, systemally designed out-of-high criminal super crime, which is 9 times favorable in 10, gray-scale morality is taken by a bunch of undercurrent, for which life is justified, for which man's return Returning, well, worth cheering for some. For the first time, the script writer James V. Simpson received half the rights. He doubled twice that there is nothing but our sympathy for the orphan, a war veteran of war in Iraq, the Staat the Yard Columbus short, who has an evil bank (his brother, I'm there) in his house. And he has given a good family friend Mike (Matt Dillon) who is very nice and he gets a job in a car armored company with Benes (Lawrence Fishburn) and some weird French dude (Gene Reno). These boys love to play and play fun, but they are also heavy armored car guys, so that means they carry guns and are difficult. After a while, maybe I started to think maybe maybe - it's a bit awkward, tongue-and-neck, Cornbell's heavy movie, which is the nose character which naturally Can be removed, cranking the private parts of everyone involved in the hope of publishing a truly, truly clever plan with potential 'holy sh * t' moments. I mean, the only music is textbookHestMovie - works great, radioactive overtime, because we treat those characters closely with those who "really do what I am" and "are you crazy?" "For 45 minutes or so, there were some serious images in the movie - Flickr feasibility. <br /> <br /> Then things get really bad, these two, this fool, there is no plan. What are we going to do ... "The scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black van or ski-mask (can be seen in the trailer, even as they 'run the test'), these people are 42 Loyalty is going to steal millions of dollars (which are some of the fancy, bigger deals 'equipped with GPS technology', but are being followed by a short connection to the radio only) and they even sit and discuss. Hell, Mike is just ridiculous about Ty, who is totally ridiculous But of course, Tae thinks of her home as long as Mike promises that 'no one will get hurt,' he is on board Guess, though, that someone gets hurt because they have no plans to run the trucks in a abandoned factory to hide the money, that was how far they thought things out. So, naturally, things start to unravel. These cats are preparing so much that they can get. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It may, however, completely separate the story, and soon, it does not understand anything, even for remote locations. <br /> <br /> When filmmakers do not have a cool "hook" for their heist, their characters seem stupid, and bungling. And when the characters are stupid, and bungling, an audience is investing in them, and hard for their stories. And when it happens, then a smile finds out the bottom part of the movie, laughing hilarious, hollow lips <br /> <br /> Leave it. 3/10
