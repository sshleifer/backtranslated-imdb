Now on my evening with Jonathan Ross, my intelligence is understood, firstly, the 78-year-old man picked up the selected words, and later suggested that the Russell brand break into the house and sleep as a way to make him sad while masturbating. Call him for making pornographic phone. Weird And illegal. The next time he really knows for a big smile, should someone try him, like his boss? Or Abu Hamza's followers? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I saw guests just fine - maybe most of their attendance I know exactly. Does it seem quite poor though as a chat show ?? Whether he masturbated in Margaret Thatcher's film so satirical about asking Terry Leader David Cameron on this TV show? He simply asked Gonanath Paltrow only if he had got him ***. However, the yob mentality of Ross was finally fully open with the above revelations, and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn these few decent people in the world who this person is shameless and does not know for her and her explicit execution. - Unless you think all the comedy should be "mad" or idle / dry. BBC and Channel 4 are jetsing all the values, although we are not here yet. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, co-worker Tasar Russell brand created a predicted sex porn phone call from Andrew Sacks. Answer-phone (Manual from Fawley Towers), it was promoted as broadcast on BBC national radio against Sax's request, and then tried to burn the evidence in order to issue the case to the grandson of Sax. Here a significant number of people (probably many of them are licensed by the BBC license fee) have been laughing at the ridiculous and / or national scandal, but most people still clearly understand the error and at last complained to the BBC about 42,851 incidents. . Many unscrupulous media fools and others do not graduate 42,851 radio graduates (and never want to) - using their logic, they consider a phenomenon similar to Holocaust, because at that time a relatively few people complained to the media and now our Nobody will panic because we were not there. 2 BBC producers were primarily involved in sending it for broadcast, it was a "very funny and bright" comedy and only 2 people accused of brand radio programs - which I only gave to the moral level of its ethical standards only that its 400,000 weekly The audience has drowned in BBC skills. Very moral BBC tried and then failed to use it in OFCOM investigation. Roll on Aristotle, tell Lord Rith! Sax's agent complained to the BBC, but they were neglected until Tore's latest news story was kept. Penalties for general distortion can be generally dismissed and prosecution, perhaps in prison, but both the brand and the BBC Radio 2 chief were finally ordered to resign a multi-millionaire, Robi was given a 12-week leave by the BBC boss. I think he wanted permission for the first time, although for the first time, he could pay Â£ 1,500,000 in cash to save him from the contract) to return to the program in 2009, after the end of his contract. Always remembering more smiling and / or more humorous ignorance for his 4,000,000 spectators - but at least he can spread his way to the bank naturally to maintain his spirit. Some people think that his position will be restless and he can not afford. I think his skin is so thick, because he is so tall that he will return and power back with Vitriol back up. (Update 23.01.09: I saw the first 5 minutes of his new series - "Most Big Cock-Up" - to use its referential phrase - this snigging allows unexpected law-breakers to accept public money.) But who knows: Maybe, after a little British film and TV industry, 42,851 consoled him for accepting moral status and wasted him with the prize. Will, sir, for his service, he will be out of danger. Government At least I hope this wicked Davidians sign up with these distorted commercial TV and radio stations and stay there, so I will not pay for violation of the law and for future payment of illegal pornography. In 2009, OFCOM fined 150,000 pounds for British TV license-fee providers for this "sorry" issue - thank you for thanking Ross! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not the end of the world which is your There is a pair of talented perverts as heroes and cheese in the real world, as there are many more important things to think of this world! To enrich the family of the family: Millions of people (especially themselves) get a humorous wage packet from a pornographic multimedia company, to a comedian, a nasty pornographic phone caller to others. Political reforms and honors so much for our society! As you should be guessed, it is not wealthy and famous and will not, but only applicable to the poor. To enrich the BBC: Huntagate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springgate, Crowngate, Phonegate is now pushing into the dark from Blogger I hope its next crisis will be abolished. I hope the comedy thinks that it should always be challenging and to avoid the frontline, such as objectionable, this particular law is not offensive or upset by my opinion about broken distortion, its distorted program and its current perverted employers.
