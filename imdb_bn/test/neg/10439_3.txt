In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hooper (Daniel Morgan) migrated to Australia to share the golden divide of the continent. Instead, Mr. Hooper branded himself, and threw in the prison of torture; There, he is gang raped. After the release, Hooper Abraham hooked up with David Gulpillil (as Billy), with whom he wanted to take the tragedy Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring) and others to retaliate. Finally, vengeance becomes heroism; Hooper is praised and assisted by ordinary people, and victims by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hooper's "rarely man" performance definitely matches the illusory feeling of the film. Mr. Gulpill is a strong supporting cast. "Mad Dog Morgan" staff not only does it cost a look, but also a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philip Morra ~ Dennis Hooper, David Gulpillil, Bill Hunter
