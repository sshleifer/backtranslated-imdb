Actually I do not think it's ridiculous about this movie. It is really crippled and badly done with no intrigue. Surprisingly, it got some chocolates from me at the beginning with the Malkom X Terminal and it was about it. Seriously Soul Plans look like an emmy winner even making the worst movie as the Gogli. The film has played blind person (another sad character), unless you are blind like John Witherspoon, the film is not really valuable. I mostly cringed at stereotypic joke and ruining Tom Arnold and DL Hewly by casting them to this movie. This movie can only be summarized in one sentence. Nation has won 100,000,000 dollars and made its own air, sex, drugs, homosexuality, sexual relations, drugs, did I mention gender? If I could rate this movie negative integer, the beginning was interesting, which came with the film at 1/10. "T bag" pufting!
