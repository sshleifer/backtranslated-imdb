As a true Canadian, I can always avoid Canadian movies. But now and then I'm trapped in one observer. This is one of the best, which is called Medieval. This is most of the flaws in Canadian movies ... Self-conscious acting ... The spontaneous Canadian practice of using the addition of camouflage and Canadian cities as stand-in for Americans. I am meaningless using Montreal's historic metropolis to stay at Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania. I had a generous mood. I gave it a 4. <br /> <br />
