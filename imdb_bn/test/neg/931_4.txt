The first one was Suu Hark's Zoo Warrior (2001), which was apparently ground-breaking, but there was a lack of acting and writing sections, this movie is apparently often as Zu (though not ground-broken), but the acting and writing section even Bad This seems to be almost complete lack of talent in acting and writing in the Haque film industry. I think that you really have to understand Cantona to know how bad and obscene the dialogues are in movies. It's like some criminals talking on the street, it's bad. To make it worse, actors and actresses look themselves like criminals and can not work even if their life depends on them. I understand that this film should be considered as a comedy for the younger generation of hacks, but the youngest of the HK youngsters is really brain-brained so that they can not praise any other than such a child and pornographic / writing? <br /> <br /> I want to learn some lessons from the directors of Hong Kong filmmaker Zhang E-Mau or Anne Lee and eventually create a movie which is both apparently acting and Excellent as skilled and mature in the writing section. And stop using young singers / figurines as heartwarming because they can not play many fans of HK!
