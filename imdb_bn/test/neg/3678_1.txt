I can not remember the worst movie I saw. The time of the actor and the audience was wasted. If you like to sit on your TV and think about this movie then this is the right film for you. Maybe this movie has been recorded to believe that people have some mysterious past in Moscow. But I must say that I do not expect anything from Rad Serbiazza, but I have more hope from Vincent Gallery. The film lacks a plot, character, development, denial. The film is underground tunnel and how they are mysterious. Some cameras have fair effects but it is also very bad. Waste the same pictures over the same time over.
