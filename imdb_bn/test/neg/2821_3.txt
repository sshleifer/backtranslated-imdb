I can imagine why he wanted to die after acting in this garbage. People are incredible, but even Sidney Poitier can not even save this annoying morality game about racism in the ancient West. He and Jonah Going both are fantastic in the film: screenplay, co-stars, directions, and scores are very bad that neither matches.
