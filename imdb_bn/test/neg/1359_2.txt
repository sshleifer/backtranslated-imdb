For those who have never heard of the movie yet (in which I think there are many lucky people who are not there), I'll make it short for you. Ryan Gosling operates the landmark character of Leland, who acts as a film narrator (a la Kevin Spasie of American beauty, but also with intelligent observation of life). Liland goes to the jail for stabbing the death of a disabled kid, and the movie is why he tried to try it. He thinks that he is a wonderful boy (if he is not mentally absent), and is depicted with a complete lack of violence, anger, or agenda (and if you wait for him to release the crazy side of his film then don do not waste your time. - It's not that kind of movie). Once in the prison in Jellenail, Leland goes to class taught by Parallel Madison, which is depicted by Don Chadle (which is not otherwise worth the quality, even in bad movies). How could one such child try to unlock the mystery of the layer, and then write it a book later on. (Also as a young prison teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring writer) <br /> <br /> The relationship between Liland and Pearl is the story behind the movie, because their statements reveal to the audience the past of the Leland. However, this was one of the scary movies that would mean central focus to call. It's not Leland is an impressive cast of the United States, which seems to be facing film damages. It seems that writer / director Matthew Ryan Hajj (you did not say anything about him, did not worry about anything he never did), the actor had to give each character a personal story character and personality error in order to play them. . Most of these features and stories are clipped, and they can be used up and down. <br /> <br /> I will try and break them down here: How did the father of the murdered Martin Donovan and Anne Magnuson (I love) describe the film as "bored", "mentally inactive", sometimes called "mentally inactive" ) It is apparently a cold relationship, because all suburbs of contemporary movies will be cold. Their two other children Michelle Williams, who was suddenly an ambassador to attend college, and Zenna Malone, who always had the same problem with heroin addiction, always did the same thing. Malone was a girlfriend of Leland, who gave him a link to his hunting. Williams's boyfriend, who was an orphan and came to live with the family and plays a baseball player who wants to go to the same college as his girlfriend, played Chris Klein. She is doing more with her character than any other bit player, sometimes managing to steal the movie. Lena Olin Leland's mother, who feels sad for some reason forever. Kevin Specei (executive producer) Leland's cold and missing father, a famous novelist Finally, you'll see a shining starring Sherylin Fen Leland - if you care even at that time. Oh yes, and a former boyfriend related to medicine, a few younger siblings and a colleague of Pearl, who has a relationship with her long distance girlfriend (played by Keri Washington). <br /> <br /> Sorry that all the synopsis and character breakdown took a lot of time. If it seems nonsensical and annoying, you've spent time watching the movie in just 108 minutes. But the helpless supporter of Extremist Clayne Cast is the lowest among the crimes of this film. The biggest one that is the largest one is completely vain. We are not given a fascinating look at a pensive mind, we are not given an effective explanation, we are not given anything more. It's been sucked so much, I'll go ahead and finish for you so that you do not see it: The Leland has been upset because all the lilies on the earth can see the sorrow, and wanted to release Karki (or whatever the name of the victim was) Sadness in his eyes It has created an album like the world's worst emo band and titled "The World Is Sad, So I'm A Returned Raid". Oh, and Leland finally dies, a sequence is based on incredible events that will destroy the movie, if the movie does not already suck. Of course, he eventually died, because it made the movie so deep. <br /> <br /> I am giving the movie 2 stars, because actors did all very well by giving them the junk. Cheadle and Gosling together were at some level of view even interesting. But to promote the film itself, you have to believe that movies are much more than their parts, Kinda
