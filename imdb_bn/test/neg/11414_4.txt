I am really surprised to see all these positive reviews for this movie. Do not make mistakes, not that I do not like this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Although I can enjoy very shameless Hollywood action blockbuster Die Hard 4.0, I like 'Dutma' type of movie, or 'Real-life-in-it-id' movies as much as right There are, if they are good. The best example is Feston (1998): There is no music, no dramatic camera angle, no special FX, no fancy space. A good story combined with nice acting and the result is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Not live dramatic camera angle, special fx and favored location? Yes Is this a good movie I'm happy to ask you. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Not at all. <br /> <br /> At first everyone looked at acting performance. I am very sorry, but you can do whatever you want, but if the story and dialogue is not believable then immediately fall behind him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Nine Lives, I'm really the real conversation Seeing the real people. I felt that I was trying to see actors as 'real characters' when they said that 'real people' would never say under the circumstances. <br /> <br /> You can not call it Spirio, but there are some dialogue quotes below. If you think that reading ten lines (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience, stop reading here. If you want to laugh well then keep reading. <br /> <br /> The conversation was often ridiculous that it was tragic. Would you like the example? 'Not Live' Those Lots <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE1: <br /> <br /> This image. The couple visited their dirty rich friends in their new palace. The woman sees this fort of a house and tells her husband: <br /> Woman: I can use this (money expensive house). Man Women: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are they and they are we who we are. Woman: I like this word - who are we We are acting like a blurred man <br /> <br>, but he loved that word. Then an old couple kept them in their hands and left. What comes with this woman: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived through so much Have shared everything. I love you <br /> <br /> Do they like kids after school? And then most of the overused clich√© lines have you ever heard of? Ending with 'I love you'? He says, is his man quarreling for him? Yes, very logical, very realistic, no. If anything, such dialogue wants to disturb some of the characters in the film to tell me this terrible, terrible thing. <br /> <br /> Example 2: <br /> <br /> Old mom, dad and a funeral small girl. Dad: I did not understand Andrew was religious. It is for comfort. Girl: It's for energy. Mom life is passing away. Dad and Girl Smiling Smile <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-fishing machine throws me in a funeral especially! Sorry, I want to miss the joke here. <br /> <br /> and it starts moving .... <br /> <br /> How does the camera work? Do not even go there. 'Boring' would be a compliment. It is supposed to be added as 'realistic'; Instead, you missed half of the actor's facial expression (the only thing left to watch this movie), half the time instead of the face, someone noticed the back or the side. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, do not say I warn you! If you want to do something about your date or something during the movie, it is a good movie for rent, because the movie is running or you will not care about it even after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> The grass is more annoying than it is to see and sums it up.
