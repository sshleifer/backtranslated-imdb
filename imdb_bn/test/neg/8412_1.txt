I usually want to find films that are good, even bad guys. Unfortunately, this film is one where I'm unfortunately unsuccessful - and due to very poor reviews on this board many IMDb reviewers share my pain. <br /> <br /> I usually do not see seagulls but I only saw this after "Rosemary Baby" love. What was that was a mistake. It only revisits my belief that most of the signals are shy-though grateful, rarely such a bad. Actually in my mind it is not really a seagull, it can be an intersecting how a satirical The movie is highly recommended to watch-at any time.
