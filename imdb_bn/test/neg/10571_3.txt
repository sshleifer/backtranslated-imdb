This movie is funny, if you were my gentleman who used to sit three rows behind me (repeating every fifth, there was no gag on the screen, and a great "wind" in each scene involved with a computer or mobile device) <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> To everyone else, it is a significant, bungled "comedy." The film follows strictly in the form of the next "Scary Movie" film, as well as following the "Epic Movie" and "Spartan Meet", although the heartless pop culture makes the next two so annoying without the flood of culture. Still, the picture illustrating intellectuals and peacekeepers around the world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: those who persevere in the power of the brain. "Superhero Movie" introduces Stephen Hawking as specially and consistently nasty, a sexually hungry druggie and uses her disability as a car for slapstick. <br /> <br /> Some physical comedy is distributed with the plot "Spider-Man," "Batman Begins" and "X-Men". The film is mostly crystal, but not in a provocative or interesting way. The longest running joke is a satirical joke and early writers believe that when Astrologers throw the main character in special places, spider-bites automatically spell spell from the scene, illuminate the unfamiliar Rehash of the scene. Probably the only release feature of this feature is its power, especially in other recent parodies. Movie makers work even though they're doing something new, and visitors can influence ways to bounce around the screen. A very short length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the encouragement of the presentation "Superhero Movie" is tolerant instead of being awesome.
