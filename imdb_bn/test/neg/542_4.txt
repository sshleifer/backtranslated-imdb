After all, I just want to say that I'm a big Naruto fan. I like the stories of Anime and Monga. Also, the first film confirmed that Naruto is all funny, great work, great story, ... but then the second movie came up. The first movie turned great because I was very hyped. But it did not satisfy me a bit ... The story was lam, the action was not so great ... especially compared to anime series ... that's the quality of animation. I found it very bad ... what story could any Lama get ... no ??? Where is Naruto's kuubi ?? Once he turned the giant ... I mean ... let's go !!! My suggestion is ... see the series (episode 140, then it's only Fillers) and then refer to the Monga because it's still cool. Ignore this movie and hope to do something good in the future ... <br /> <br /> I gave all four to everything, because it was Naruto ...
