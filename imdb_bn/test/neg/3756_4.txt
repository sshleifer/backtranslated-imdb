Here are four main players - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Emmy Madin and McAully Kokkin - the only one I have ever heard of (at that time) annoying the hack from me and destroying the film. Well, he did the right thing to do to drop me and VHS into the junk. I am playing the role of teenager, "Tia Russell." Wickedly, six years later, he played a stunning and highly liked role of "Raven Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus". <br /> Candy, naturally, "Buck Russell", "or the title character," Uncle Buck. "Some actors were better off playing a lovable, hapless slob than candy." I enjoyed her character here, but I can not see that spoiled teen girl more than once. In the first few minutes of the film, the little boy "Miles" (Kaklin) means "G-Don." How bad is a bad, six-year-old child talking about mischief in the film? It's a wonder that these Hollywood people are sick. Anera actor became depressed psychologically, kakkina is a case in point.
