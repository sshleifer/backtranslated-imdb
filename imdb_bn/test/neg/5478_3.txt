Sure, the idea has already been done with Alf and Charming: To expel modern society from one or more places. But until the end of 1990 I loved both shakes and saw them religiously. When I learned about Scorch, I really hope for something new, because the new TV has not affected me in 90 (but at least Star Trek: TNG and Simpson was still going) <br /> <br /> What I got was frustrating. The acting was awful, but considering ridiculous conversations and complete incredible writing, I could not blame too much for what I had to do with them. There were some ridiculous moments, but most deliberate jokes were compulsory for their delivery. The whole production work of the show seemed to be very low budget for what was on TV. It was okay in the 80's. However, this was the first episode and introduction of characters and the whole compound of the series had to be installed, so I gave it the suspicion. The second episode was not bad, and I hope that once it reaches its speed, the show will improve. Sadly, my VCR did not finish the broadcast of the third episode, I did not see it, and the series disappeared from the TV list. I now have the first two episodes that wind off the wind and a VHS tape.
