I will admit that this is not a great movie. This effectively shouted "low budget", although I still like the film myself because it lacks quality, but it is bound to power. It was like a Little Engine and a movie could be assembled! <br /> <br /> This movie is performed on a radio network and is concerned with low level employees - two-page boys (one shock and one brush and another one) as well as a new receptionist. Three have shown the attitude of radio stars, but now they are involved in low job. <br /> <br /> This story shows a killing that looks a little bit out of blue. I did not know that it took mysterious film of murder and surprisingly bit. However, like most B-mysteries, the police lambreren and it tries to save it to our protected hero (dying). In all of these, if death was objectionable or respectful, then it was my difficult decision. I'm not sure yet !! <br /> <br /> The picture has a momentum that is more than 'crunch factor' and two pages for radio page comedians' roles. They look black and imitate Amos n 'Andy's third or fourth rate. Along with being very sensitive it was not funny. Thankfully, the producers that they are trying to feel the same way. <br /> <br /> Overall, It's easy to skip this picture and if you do, then I do not blame you. However, the film's artistic shortage was created in the film's weird and slow motion and I saw that I saw it. A good film? No But one that is a chic value for fans of the old BS. However, I probably do not have a great taste, but I think both ladies singing were really weak voices, despite how everyone in the film was influenced by their warfare. Listen for yourself and tell me what you think. I could not believe that the film was allowed to sing - even if it was too low for the Monigram studio.
