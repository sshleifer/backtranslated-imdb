All these shows, the same plot. Kuszko (spell?) Is the danger of failing school, he must pass the emperor. He has to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses it / learns more about it and realizes that it is not so stupid. Ezma, posing as the chief, tried to convert Kuszko into some animals to stop him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/10
