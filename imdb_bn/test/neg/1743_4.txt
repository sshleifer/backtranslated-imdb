Some Janapese modern horror movies are very good. Strong plots, horror moments, good acting, others just .... Unfortunately, the next camp of Ujumaki next camp. <br /> <br /> I will rate the movie based on 3 elements: plots, scary elements, and acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot - The name of the film comes true, goes into the conspiracy circles and does not explain itself. Well, the city is inspired by spiral curse, but why? And why do people work so stupid? There is a relentless effort to explain what is happening to the reporter .... <br /> <br /> 2) Fearful factor - If it can be a fuzzy blurred, it unfortunately failed. I really can not think of a good scary scene with lots of build it up. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very neutral. People are not saying meaningless stages. I really can not feel much sympathy for our sad heroes. Together with coherent plot and strong character there are many advanced Japanese horror films. Do not bother to waste your time in this wannabe.
