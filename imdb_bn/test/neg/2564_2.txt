OK, some other people have commented that this is not an action flick, so I do not have to rush again (though I have decided). This is not really frustrating, it's really nice to see the actors a bit different. But, unfortunately, not one of these incidents. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: does not exist. This film lacks storyline as almost as 'showgirls'. Sure, they have left some tips here and there to make Sichal happy, some environmentalists, no distributors, or anything else. It's not a story, nor even close. Now, the end is ... even among us who really liked this picture ... the end is, you have to admit it is a little too much, or a lot of fools. <br /> <br /> Now, from what I understand it was a direct video video (at least in the States), but it is also very good for it. This piece of garbage has only been made to TBS or Starz (late night), only.
