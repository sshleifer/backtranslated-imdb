I remember to catch this movie in one of the showtime channels. What has happened to me is that this movie is fully held in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there so I easily spot locals. Still, a ninja killed a scientist, because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, which is followed by the police. Almost half of them took the police force to the bottom and ultimately they killed him, there is no wound wounds in it. His soul still lives, when a woman finds him and touches his spell. <br /> <br /> Then, from that time he became neutral and killed the police officer by killing the original Ninja. Then another ninja of Japan came to kill the evil ninja. It could be a platy device from the previous two movies, or perhaps a plot hole. I know that this movie is very camping, bad and entertaining. This is something to see with a Tub of Popcorn and a few friends and give it MST3K treatment.
