After hitting Chris Gore on the effect of "Five Stars" I rented this movie! Show that the attack is in the show. Well when I saw the DVD and it showed 3 steps of hell, all right, I had to buy it. Just shouting his son, to throw his son in another burning pit <br /> <br /> I was not expecting ECW or CWD for one hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least A short version seems to be the main highlight of this movie. Well there was nothing like that unfortunate. Three levels of death have been done right from the beginning and much warmer than that. Nothing will happen this documentary really happens. It was quite raw, bare and neutral. Not a bad thing, but this is a descriptor. Hope you have opinions on this documentary subject, but he does not. It is good to have a message or reason for this document. There was no real reason for a narrator, only a few less obvious scenes should be explained. <br /> <br /> Do not really explain the lives of these wrestlers. It shows some moments of some dramatic scenes, which seem to be attractive, but the reality does not look as superb as it sounds. For example, for the first time in the public park, seeing his son wrestling with light bulbs and bald. Instead of showing their reaction to wrestling, they responded to the camera, instead of telling them in the interview, or actually seeing their reaction. <br /> <br /> According to the legal document, it is not. To start with the source material was flimsy. Nothing really really happens deep or interesting. There is no conclusion in some interesting stories, the final thought of a real point or backside of the house has not been poorly edited, and it and its originally being torn out of a cheaper, matte. <br /> <br /> Wise, this is quite annoying. Good bumps are at the beginning, and gradually became less amazing and shocking. You have seen Japanese wrestling, indoor wrestling, even backyard wrestling DVDs, these shocks and fears you do not. If you want to wrestle do not make the same mistake and I saw it. Go to some CZW ECW or XPW DVD instead. <br /> <br /> I figured out the only thing that could be a stupid person from this documentary. Do not support self mutilation or do dangerous stunts, but their argument for this to work. Backyarders seem stupid for wrestling. Most of them are unemployed, and probably have some problems with their head, and wrestling is a kind of therapy for them. Supporter seems even more stupid. The mother basically argues that if the whole child is involved in "if not MM bit MMMAM bit", their children basically kill themselves. School authority statistics support their students at their hazardous stunts because it is an alternative to join gangs and the option of expanding a small number of medicines, in which the segment is held in the rural town, where people live 20 miles away from each other. People are stupid <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its more amazing, and interesting than the backyard, and much more entertaining. Oh and its actually good.
