The "House of the Dead" (also known as "Spector") is one of the horrifying floors of your mid budget budget, filled with mediocre performance and cheap influences. It was a family that inherited the old Irish palace, and after starting to experience strange phenomena and ex-apparitions, a young girl was killed in a prison in a wall between the slain and the cemeteries. The couple's young daughter then goes to some level and they seek help from a group of unusual investigators for help. <br /> <br /> This picture is clear from the 1982 Hunted House film "Poultestist" ideas. I would say that this film has a somewhat vague sequence, but it is sometimes very annoying. Acting is not something special here, the mood is OK, the score (which was mostly the dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat boring and the CGI special effects are really awesome. I mean, it was 1996, you think they could do a little better than they are. The house was burnt to the fire where I saw the most poor special effects are very cheap. But hey, it was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the ejaculation that their daughter looks like looks fake on the contrary. And what was the significance of the film? What does a wolf-monster have with a violent house? Here's what really impacts this movie destruction. The acting was very bad. I usually enjoy much less budget horror films, but this is not one of these. "The House of the Dead" is nothing special, if you do not have anything to do, just consider it for viewing. But you probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
