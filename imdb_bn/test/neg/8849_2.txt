I can praise movies with subtitles from foreign countries, and especially those in which subtitles are weaker and really can not follow the story or really feel the meaning, but there were many parts in this movie which are not really understood. <<br /> <br /> Everything, I can admit in some scary and scary part, but they are repetitive, I feel like I see a loop trailer; It seems that it was a small film shot with different actors. <br /> <br /> The ring did not stop the ringtones and grudge veins ... too much length has thrown up thrills. <br /> <br /> If you are not a mortal fan of this type of movie (whom I thought), do not waste your time.
