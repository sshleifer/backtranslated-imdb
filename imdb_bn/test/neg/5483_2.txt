The rest of the views for this show already have a fun way than the show itself and they all are accurate. I feel the same way that I was very frustrated about how far Rick Mercer had fallen while doing something amazing at this moment, now he's only 22 minutes, but now he just wanders and walks around with people. Say. He's doing some bit in the studio that's going to the news, but it's never funny, really sad and predictive jokes about titles. He is going somewhere to talk to people, for example he is going to Rado this week, and the pieces of the video are all making funny faces and acting in fear of wild horses etc. He was funny, but this hour has given less interesting ways since 22 minutes, and the event is no longer fun. Now air freshen the air has closed (finally gracious thanks!) Mercer and this hour will be for 22-minute ax next, only old tired comedy that almost no one finds fun anymore. It's really tragic to use Rick Mars as the most fun person on Canadian TV!
