What a terrible movie Cliches are full, perplexing scenes, very poorly played, and an unwanted script. The people who wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Chan are hard to believe.

Let alone make a signal for it !! ?? It is amazing that this piece of trash film can be shown to children alone! 1 in 10 *
