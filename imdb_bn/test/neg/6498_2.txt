This movie was the most advertising campaign in any film in Russia. "The epic film about Russian culture", "Great spirit of Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. This movie was the biggest disappointment for me. The main character, directed by Oleg Mensichov, is an intelligent little boy who is ready to set up his colleagues, because a woman who does not even see a lady. What's there for praise? The story does not develop in the first half of the movie. People's festive looks look proud of Russian myths. <br /> <br /> I'm an actor and director for his previous works as Mr. I respect Mikhalkov, but this film only shows his ambition to be considered the "tower" of Russian film. .
