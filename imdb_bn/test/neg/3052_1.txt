The worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of annoying film making. This movie has all the ingredients to make the crop truly work. Bad reasoning behind bad actions, bad directions, bad stories, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and some steps taken by character. This girls are ugly because it was a stupid blonde thrown into a terrible nude shot, and a stupid asian girl had a breast shot, and both endeavor was scary. Some good horror movies came out of 80, but it could never be considered among them. Kevin Tennio has made one of the greatest sins in the story: he presented the letter (a Old Man and Old Woman) at the end of the film. I will vote for it in 1 out of 10 but the voting system does not seem to act like that. From the order of the title, I knew it would be sucked and I would return my DVD, but do not return the DVD to the best buy, or they do not call edible products, or because of my receipt. I have "The Deutsche Hurr" and it was really God awful, but still I think "Demons of Knights" (A Clear Evil Dead Ripper-Off) was much worse than "Denne Hur". Like this "hauling", how can these unexpected cows be combined with ??? Save your money and get "Texas Chess Genocide" (just not available in any of its seals) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dead of the Dead". "The Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Each second of it was a drug addict, pain relief for the audience, because the whole film was almost horrific! Do yourself a favor, do not see it! You will be saving some brain cells.
