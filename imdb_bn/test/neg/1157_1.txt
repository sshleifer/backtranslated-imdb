Ed Gein's story is interesting, very interesting. This movie, however, it was actually created that it is only interesting Cain Holder's Ed Gene Screenplay is so far away, it's not even a little bit fun. Ed gene did not behave psychologically in public, he was very calm and collected and always very submissive and spoke to anyone who listened to, this movie is a major factor that failed to show the audience. But the biggest mistake of this movie is that any frame never gets shot, it was because of the death, Ed had never been killed by someone whom he thought was talking to him outside the grave. He killed only dead people, who told his dead mother because it was God's will, and he was very forgiving about it, although it did not prevent him from experimenting with cannibalism and putting human flesh. I was officially able to rate the rating of "1" because only "0" was not given to me as an alternative. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to keep this movie clean. If you want to see a movie that accurately portends ad gin and does not try to put a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fiction woman, who never existed, then I suggest you watch the original movie which unfortunately feels like IMDb Do not stay in .com though I can be wrong, but I can not find it yet. Do not deviate from the real facts and do not try to keep the story alive. I understand the story from a different perspective, but the movie tried to change the story itself by itself, which I found to be terrible by making movies based on 9/11, but it was a wrapping that was behind Canada. Or a WWII movie says Hitler helped a good man and helped in the Nazi war.
