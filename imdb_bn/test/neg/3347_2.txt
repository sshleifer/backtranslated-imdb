To commemorate this flutter from the audience, of course, I must guess the role of the sword again in Panchamol, as Lowell Waiver said, I am poking my head on the absolute number of grateful comments. "African Queen" is not it. The smell of time is amazing, yes. Acting is good, but no matter how great any actor can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of totally tiring and incomplete party and dinner table conversations, and I do not care what Joyce's text is taking from it. Especially interesting people think of spending one and a half hours of a wall on a Christmas dinner (a person as suggested that this is a family, it is not clear to me), listen to their old table conversations, and you have the essential experience of this movie. Nothing will happen. And nothing is said to be important, but it is called at intermediate length. I said, the popularity of this movie is mystery to me. This is a good watch, rather it's a good one.
