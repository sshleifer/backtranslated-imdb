How nice! What could be a horrible, harmful waste during this celluloid abuse. I think it looked years ago and thought it was fun but now ... it's just plain silly. It is not mentioned that "The Exorcist" is a bright rip off where it was republished at a time under the title "point-orchest". The only real difference is that the producers are convinced by the fact that film events are real! Who in the right mind will believe in such a brave face? To make things even worse, there was a video release with cover art that tried to give cash in "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a pair of lip in Dhaka! How could possibly a low sink? Do not be fooled by false claims, stupid lies or titles by the rip off because you are very disappointed if you are!
