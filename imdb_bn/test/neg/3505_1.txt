I can not believe the positive feedback of this movie. I had great hopes for it and were frustrated. After all, they use every Chesei racism cliche in the book. It was so expected. For example, from the second the Latino guy showed that you would be just a nice guy because he was looking like a gangbazar. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a policeman who worked hard for years and saw some degree of light at the end of the film. Predictability rarely ends with those letters. An extraordinary cast was wasted on a weak script. The morality of the story was the highest PC. A few cute tricky twists but not enough. The dialog was embarrassing from time to time. It was not bad at all. I can not believe these movies as high scores. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little intelligent, humiliating. I was trying to achieve this movie, but it was too small.
