Like other critics, my wife bought this movie as part of 20 movie family pack. I can assume that this was a film suitable for the film for the 1980s, but it is very predictable and played without Robert Conrad, usually sub-par. Football scenes are not something special and work mainly as a filler for the movie. The film is now very date-wise, but a modest repetition can probably make it a good movie. However, what is really needed? I mean, how many "Underground sports teams work together for the big game with minors" Are the movies really necessary for us? This is probably a good movie for your little kids, if you find it a tax bent, then you will find it lacking in a sports movie buff.
