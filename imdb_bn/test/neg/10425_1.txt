"Wired" will rate as one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen. Writing and guidance show a lack of imaginative deficiency and I am sure that most actors are still crying while mentioning this movie. <br /> <br /> It fails to act as a tribute to Balucheri's unique talent, or as a precise account of his short life. <br /> <br /> An uninterrupted mess without any worthless features.
