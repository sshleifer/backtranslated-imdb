The title character of the MTV Saifai animated series "Aiyon Flux" plays the title, known as "Muktijoddha", the freedom fighter who fought in the city of Belna city for 400 years in the future. For his latest mission, he was sent to kill the city leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Siskus), but he revealed the secret to the way. <br /> <br /> Ion Flux is in good courts, under moderate capital punishment. The interesting story was still a little dust in the film. Many people say that this is one of the worst movies of the year and it is not true. This may be a frustrating movie, but it's the best of the best movie. I have never seen the movie cartoon version so I can not compare the two. Perhaps it is better because they have the opportunity to explain more stories. The film is not confusing but it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the material. Acting was right, nothing special. Charles Theron gives a good performance and seems devoted to the film. The rest also gave excellent performances like Johnny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Martin Siskas. There are some interesting characters in the film, including Aiathan's friend Sithandra, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carries the same serious tone and it gets a little tedious. There is no comedy and the film is sometimes a little annoying. This was the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious, the dialogue sounds chessy and serious scenes seem to be forced. Action scenes are great, but the film is not exactly what they do not expect just an action movie. It does not seem to be boring at the end but it's still better than the other thrillers coming from last year (hide and seek). The costume is a little weird but still beautiful and attractive look. The scene is well done so that the movie looks at least beautiful. So, the style on the movie material can be a case. Interested to see but may not be keeping your attention for too long. In the end, this is not the best movie but it could be a decent rental. Ratings 4/10
