A Madison Avenue advertising agency is being adopted by black and white satirical black. They are determined to alter those issues which led to Putin Swape (Arnold Johnson). But he is also active to work even than his white predecessors. It's about the origin of the way it is available. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was considered brave and outrageous in 1969, but it seems stupid like today. Curiosity is curious (the President is a dwarf. How is this funny?), Cruel or obvious and the film is full of impossible characters. It is done in a very experimental way which makes it take or makes it even more difficult. The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. The end does not come anywhere. To make it worse with Johnson's only exception, all the performances are bad. Antonio Fergus (Regardless of these films) is particularly annoying like the Arabs. These three stars get interesting because commercial parodies (done in bright colors) are fun and here's a rare good line. I heard this was a godly classic but this is more interesting than the good. Leave it ... Unless you're experimental in the movies of the 1960s.
