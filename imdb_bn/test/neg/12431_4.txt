Choose a stereootype, no stereotype (ethnic, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I believe you will find it in the washers. Do you think that all the Hispanic teen boys are stupid, hairy, disobedient, and dirty? Hispanic girls are sex-crazed, easy, ass-boring sluts? Do black people all start fighting and do not want to carry guns? Do all gay people throw a themed party with pink drinks and young boys do not ask for the model for them? White teenage girls are rich, stuck princess who is indifferent to the age of white teenager and looking somewhat more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to the previous question, you, my friend, a great, and you love Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audience (I was 15 years old for the first time I saw the kids and I think I am still not a virgin), but is not the disappointment of the wash rollers ?? It's just bad. He tried to be real and realistic with his short dialogue and body hair closing, but this character and this story is completely unreal. <br /> <br /> Simply tell, imagine the child of a teenage boy. The 14-year-old boy does not want to be a scatter who suffers, crushes the party, drinks 40 percent, and the hot, rich, white girl says that her unwary sex "seems dangerous?" Besides that population, I really do not know who will enjoy this movie.
