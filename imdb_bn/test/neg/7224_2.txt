The only release feature of this movie is that it changes the band 's time of '81 to NY and shows their music. For the film itself it has at least three major flaws. Above all, there is a description of the film, which is not needed in any way. In some places where some explanation is required only a small way of adding a small dialogue has gone. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio, it is quite obvious that most of the conversations were then recorded without any effort to match the film. The third error was over. I do not end up for the brave souls who endure torture sitting in the film, but it is a major sin in writing screen. It's not worth the money or time you want to see until it is a fan of the representing bands.
