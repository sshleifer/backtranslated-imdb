Although I got nice acting and cinematography beautiful, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the most notable pieces of the novel is that Ethan and Matty decide to kill themselves. It does not appear in the film anymore, it shows that it is a slideshow accident. <br /> <br /> The characters of Matty and Jane are almost non-existent. When they change almost in the novel, then both of them appear to be offensive at the end of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Finally, Matty and Ethan completely destroy their last power and power by ending their relationship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Joan Allen was also astonishing, but his character was much more waterfalls than the Hutton's novel. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the film to be portrayed credibly, but it went far and the process almost destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie until you read the book and you will get confused and frustrated.
