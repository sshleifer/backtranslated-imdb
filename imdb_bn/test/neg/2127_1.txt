Yes <br /> <br /> I saw several bad movies in my days, many of them are from Mike, Tom, Crow and others from MSST 3. So this was a case together and even though I felt very funny myself, but it was not nearly fun without MST3K commentary. <br /> <br /> This movie is a major example of Assalamu Alaikum, Asasalamu Alaikum outside of Europe. Awesome music, awesome acting, terrible plot (what little there is), horrible dialogue and really, really, really, awesome editing. Cripps <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> So, try the MST3k version. It's a pretty fun episode with quite good form Mike and Gang.
