Since I was a kid, I could remember that one of the other movies and I recently stopped eBay - for 20 years, it was not close to me. <br /> <br /> The story 'shallow' kick starts with a 'cosmic incident' (there is another additional order of credit for 'development of weak stories'), which makes joint pests very intelligent. The Ant species used to fight with each other have stopped and now are working together. The thing I want to know is to do, what exactly? You do not find what they want. Nigel travels to Davenport and his Sidekick Desert, where bizarre anti-activity is mentioned and starts to study insects from an orthopedic eglo-shaped laboratory. Perhaps the most cool view of my opinion was that when two scientists visited a huge square of crops (like the square version of the crop circle), the ants would be kissed. <br /> <br /> This picture was not very scary enough simply because you do not know that the fear of insects or their like. You all know that pest people want to leave the area so that they can go with their hygiene - but you can not find out if you are not really bad. It is not a scientist because the explanation of 'cosmic phenomena' is very unclear to be considered properly. This is a chiller more deffo. TBH Flores, left hard styling, tight shirts and nigel devonneports with big collar makes me even more curious than big facial hairstyles! Have you noticed six credits listed in the credits? Yup, that's right - SIX, and you will not see any other human in this film. Do not even distance! This is an obviously low budget movie which is a little surveillance because you probably will not see it like this. I can not think of any way. The image of the ants is quite good, they could have a monthly and monthly film before they were shot in the movie. You can say, 'How do they hurry up to hell?' Over over, but it's all pretty easy. Filmmakers have also offered millions of innocent ants to produce film, so the animal rights live! Good for innovation, but you can not see it more than once.
