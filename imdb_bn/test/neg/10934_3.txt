The only reason I saw it because it gave its stars, CASPAR Van Dean, Michael Par and Eric Roberts and Kathryn Oxenberg * and Jennifer Rubin, all capable actors and good performers in the past. At this point, a weak serial killer story, you can guess who in the first scene of the fiction. There is no way to recommend this disaster, my rating * 1/2 POOR
