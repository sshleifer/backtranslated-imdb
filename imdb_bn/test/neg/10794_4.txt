Camals are a disappointing British comedy since 1934 coming. I like to buy it because I have a Drama that Desires desert event and state. It certainly is not. <br /> <br /> This is about a couple who led Egypt to catch some desert drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> It would have been better if it had been done. A comedy instead of a play, which gives it a lot below. It's pretty scary part of it. Make this deposit, have some good steps and location views. <br /> <br /> This actor, led by Just Hubbber, has an interest in Annie Lea's love interest. <br /> <br /> A view is enough for this movie. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 2 stars.
