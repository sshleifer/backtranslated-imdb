I have to ask myself, are these films come here to criticize and criticize people associated with the movie? How can some of these high scores score so high? When we were kids, our parents went to see more adult themed movies, and there was nothing else in it until we were old. I just remembered two movies which told them! When they got home. This is one, and "Catch-22" <br /> <br /> This movie includes doctors and staff in a dirty hospital, there is a pack of fragile stories and internal townspeople (which looks like rejection in the 1970s ) Norman Leer sitcom) Staging a protest. The worst part is a mad old man who is doing "God's work" by killing the mysteries of murder, doctors and others. She admits, Scott and his girlfriend show a little emotions. They only care about her departure from where she will be "safe and happy". A doctor who risks the death of a heart attack, can trap people so that they go away. Oh, my, what a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does not allow "to think about me", chocolate or "it would be better", but it never happens. Wondering why people find it a failure, no surprise here. I'm wondering how IMDB has a large number of members who think this film is good. YECH
