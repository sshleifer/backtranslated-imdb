Research of a more character in a movie, then COMMITTED is still a young, enjoying just another relationship with the trimmings created for the target audience. The aspect seems very basic, a classic case of obvious dramatic mockery and lost damages is stupid. Committees are sometimes watchable and there is a small feeling of originality to Lisa Kruger. <br /> <br /> Completely purposeless for the first 20th century. We know Jolin but when her husband disappears, the movie comes up. Jolain to find him <br /> <br /> <br /> Some parts are weird. Other time movie drag. The second half is more ridiculous, we see Jolien's spiritual antics more intense. Annoying guitar music is awful, but COMMITTED is a necessary evil as a very little offer however. A complete movie is hampered by some completely uninterrupted moments, the only asset of COMMITTED is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
