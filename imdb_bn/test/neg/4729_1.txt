Today I went to see this film against my own good decision, and if God does not want me to. Awful, terrifying. Featuring a classic like the first AVP film, it's bad. These guys actually look like Paul W. Anderson in a master storilizer. Actually, I used to think alien and / or predetermined film was made by Uwe Bowl! This movie actually bothered me, and if only Ridley Scott or HR Gaiger was forced to pieces in pieces, then tell if the Lord knows only. I do not understand that any fan of franchisee might like this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. I mean, the first AVP was the shrub, but it is at least a semi-interesting story and setting, and sometimes some real tension. It did not take it very seriously and at least it can be enjoyed partly on "leaving your brain at home" basis. But this one, I felt that the people behind him thought that they were creating the next awesome skill. There was a fabulous 'suspicious scene' of dark rooms or comedians, which played frustrating music, basically shedding you from the head, saying, "Now be scared". James Cameron once said, you can not be afraid to be afraid, you can only make your senses higher. People who created this image are not paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to get scared instead of letting yourself go to this level. It's a clinch for internet leaders, which says "God, I was so bored in this movie and felt like leaving", just like that I felt that even in the middle of the action scene. They took this picture with full importance, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. Even the government did not lie to their people, did not even bother about it. <br /> <br /> For the character, I knew that the human character is going to be completely vain. The film is going to be screen but they are critically critical, at least they are relevant to that story. I am not worried about being beaten by the boyfriend of this dream, I am not worried about the mother that "my daughter does not even know her, Wow!" (A pair of night-vision goggles for an appearance? Stop me!) Or the released criminal is just trying to live a decent life and set an example for his brother, whether a man. Hell, even mandatory heating-chick-in-baby pump was more contrived than usual in the moment. I think the audience is so much expected at the end of the day, as well as chestbirds coming out of the kids, raping and liking the expected mothers, which will be made for everything. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we proceed to the stars of the film, and rarely can write. Was Alien designed well? I could not see the terrible thing because I'm not an obvious one. What you see is the face, head, tail of a tail or a wall that climbs over the wall and it's really enough that it is actually an alien. "Cutting the Mirlin Mason and NIN Music Video, I think I will do the same thing here" with the editor slice tool to go into it. Also, notice how the action director is always set to set up their films at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. We wanted to know that the monster could fight monkeys! Yes, this time around the hunter was more impressive, and I think the new operation was calm, but it was about it. Also, when a predator from The Lost World sounds like a dinosaur? Although there were a few things I liked a little. Using sound effects and music from one of the original movies (I woke up at "Hello to Helper!"), Although other references were stupid (the main character's name is Dallas, paused me). I like Visual FX for Predator's view, as well as how Hybrid Eliens looked (definitely losing one from the resurrection). But really, those are just positive things. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this film is anonymity, anonymous, insulting, and humiliating both the creators of both the creatures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> they did nothing to deserve this.
