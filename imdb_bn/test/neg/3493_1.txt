This movie is bad. Just bad. Absolute condition, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog closes the screen and conflicts with its completely artificial mockery, and still lost the ability to detect trace amounts of damage. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. The racism in Los Angeles may be particularly bad. I live in Angeles City, I can verify that. What's so horrible about prejudice in Los Angeles is its dirty nature. It creeps to you with an intelligent eye, or a swallow sound. Just to the full end of the boxing fight, it does not come almost straightforward and says, "Why black should be black!" <br /> <br /> I can clearly see that the car-jacker black, detective partner Hispanic, DA white. As long as the film is rolling through the projector, I can take the conclusion of visual, music and words only, except by telling the conclusion. Characters emot, and we read and read in the line to decide. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership between filmmaker and audience and trust. That belief is raped by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie gives you directions like an audience and it drives you to signal it to run at a point. This film strikes you with its point and insults you and your intelligence. My inexplicable question is, why do we share in society, "thank you?"
