I saw 71 of the 71 best films in this movie, which is the worst. First, I saw the plot line a little irrational - the missing husband 25 years / still love / even a letter! Give me a break. Why was the man missing for so long that the Congress is working with oil ropes next to the women's team? This movie I've ever seen showed some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans. It goes through the air (see Prissy) down the progressive look! I've rarely seen a movie that I like it very much. Esse!
