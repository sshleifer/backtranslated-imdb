Frankly - this small film sucks. The dummy used in the nicro scene has been well-formed, but it is still sloppy enough to destroy the viewing experience. The DVD discovered is crisp and clear and I did not create my mind if it helped or prevented it. If the film is a little stained, then it adds some "crafin factor" to what is happening. I do not have any idea why this image is so popular with others other than the subject - but the more disappointing after this, to be honest in Nicrilia view like Visitor questions among others and others. All these things about film loneliness and other methods of deep philosophical philosophy **** This is an expensive, well-preserved tune. It's not that frustrating, it's not that boring. If you insist on watching it - rent it. I give it a 3 that many people do not make clear films about necrophilia (certainly should be a big selection for our sick people;) - Filming is good and some have "gore" (if a Robert looking doll is seen as a gore to get the cut open Are ...) but without that - absolutely nothing is going on for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - A full masterpiece of a short film, which is actually a well-known director of the Creda, which is actually a truly well-paid director Sedar (available as a "bi-feature" published by "Unearthhed" movies) of CERDA. . Although I do not care about it, GENESIS has made so well that I will forgive Sedar and will definitely keep an eye on him for the future ...
