Just saw this last night and made it bluntly: "Styles instead of Style". We can already assume there was much more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what's described here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis is not filmed throughout the entire hour for an entire hour, but again, all other characters can be just a pencil-stroke total cartoon character. Start <br /> <br />. We've seen Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swagart kiss near the black jazz club and we've seen Geri getting his inspiration. may be. We see how two cousins ​​choose different ways of life (also possible). Then we play Jerry Lee as an adult piano (now played by Dennis Coed) and it's exciting and a little scary. A scene where he first met his second cousin, Mirra. Since then, the whole thing has become a repetition of some of the events played in a style much like a news release at high speeds. It's not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear the new version. The song that Jerry has made. Almele Belvedown as Jemy Sugargart is also one of the reasons that you need to look at at least this point, which will see more success indicators in the next few years. Winona Ryder is the single most characteristic character in the film, as mothers. She teases, she sobs, she chews ghee and coquettish and that's about it. Third minute, there is no reason for one minute to finish talking about Luis and his wife, where the first two? For this reason it can not really be classified as biology, but there is one more wrong news. We see Jerry got his first song on the radio, we see his second unit going to the top ten, we see he has no third number. 1 and so on. Then there comes inevitable fall. There is absolutely no basis. <br /> <br /> To end another minor quarrel: The film takes place from '56 to '58 and still says Mira: "I'm only 13 years" till the end.
