I still can not see STARCRASH (1979) - the infamous Italian star Wars (1977) - but it can not be much worse than this unexpected piece of junk, it's enough to say, so says Mail Brooks. SPACEBALLS (1987) look like a real work of art! In fact, Galaxina is remembered today why his tragic fate that beat Dorothy Straaten in the playboy center, due to this tragic fate that was killed by his lively envious husband - this movie was even its official premiere! <br /> <br /> Although starring Staten (who later took two biology made about him, whom he portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mary Hemingway), he got reduced to the first half of the film, apparently on a chair or another Driving a spaceship for 27 years journey; In fact, Galaxina is a motivated Android that also serves their dinner crew, it makes them all warm under the skin, and they also run for blue stars (Queer Music). She said, Staten certainly looks bright in her white dress and even if her role rarely demands enough work for her acting talent, it is not good. Still a film carrying his name, he is spread by camps and his colleague crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you an idea about the comedy level shown here), will be his long live antics, yard, wing -Supported colored people, a pot-smoking, proponent-quoted ancient contemplation, and the best (more than saying) a fool-headache, La-dietary, hairy alien animals they keep captives. The piece vault is a metal-clad non-entity, however, there are the best smiles in the film, after every reference to the blue star, after listening to the comedy song, "this is ** t?" There is a small point of listing the sci-fi classics, It is usually used in the conventional conventional convention, because it is not only langal but also not obvious; Incredibly enough, a chest-busting but finally Bengoan Alien is definitely played by the Hollywood Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> For what value it is, then, the scene they shot on the planet (which looks more like a set than a planetary landscape) is a yellow, sun-like finger and its inhabitants 'human gourmet' ( Their menu mentions the motorcycle gang serving Skin and Tonic, Scotty Rocks, The Pieces, Baked Alaskan, etc.) their own god (Harley Davidson) and when our heroes Back to flee when their "Lord" Moments do not dare for fear of firing on them. Allah (terrible) indeed ...
