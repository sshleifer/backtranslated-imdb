I was quite enthusiastic to show this movie while coming out. For this, entrepreneurs consider it to be curiosity and I usually like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and both of them seem to be a fun idea. Sadly, I was very disappointed with the nurse Batty. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm not going to go together with graphic violence and comedy, and the only director who has successfully integrated the two, in my opinion, is the Tarantino and Coens. There is not so much violence in the nurse bed, but there is no violence in it when I laugh. Of course, for me, the part of the problem was that there were not many places where I was asking. <br /> <br /> This picture does not work as a play. Ronnie Zeljger's Betty, the hero of the story, is clinically insane and impossible in any real way. I would say, the role of the jailer works very well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kieron also do all the best. The problem is writing; Freeman is the only person that gets an attractive character game. It's really really bad. 3/10
