This movie may be O.K. If not for all languages I think the story itself is not bad, but I would be very embarrassed to watch my wife or children's movies. I know that kids will always learn to swear, it is true, but parents can not help them see and listen to things to watch their entertainment. <br /> <br /> quite used like Robert Loggia; He has a distinct harsh quality with his rough voice, but in the last few years I have seen him play his role in many languages. If we have received an award for additional use of the term F, then he has to be a competitor. Unfortunately, I think he's lost as my fan now. To see his name in future movies, I would think twice about lifting that title. Look, I'm not a pride. I sometimes use languages ​​in very extreme situations, but when we see a movie, it is for the ENTETRITInt NNT, what we hope will be some of our joy and escape. I do not want to remind people of what is happening in the streets of any big city today, and it is difficult to think about whether the movie is right to see my family. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modin, but it is a sad fact that he has linked himself to a photo that has thrown down his picture like this. He is probably an O.K. I got a job in the movie, but I blocked the path after attacking others in my ear about 1/4 times. Why do not these actors say that these actors do not ask them to continue with this glitter language? Once enough actor, (especially the big name), creates a mess about it, the authors will stop closing it in movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend this picture. It's very sad, because I think it's probably right, if it's good enough for a beautiful family! Thanks to God I only waste $ 2.00!
