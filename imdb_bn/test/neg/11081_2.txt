When I saw it, I saw the review for this movie, then I am surprised that people are giving a good rating. <br /> <br /> This is a bad camera-work movie. Everything happened on the 'horrible' closing screen, usually loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly said, "Have you seen / heard?" Well, no, we did not see that! We can not! And when there was no close-up, the camera was doing something weird, like turning around, or really fast, quickly, so that it shows up or makes the body sick. <br /> <br /> Every two minutes later the letters were unlike, they shouted the same thing again. If I could not really be 'good', then I'm not careful, I did not rent a scary movie to see the rigid things! I hope the illogical thing, such as aliens, ghosts, or good acting! They were stupid - let's have a close relationship with the cave! With all our clothes! Which is telling, immediately before his death, what is immediately the end of something. It made me a bit nasty, though no such incident happened ... serious attack on a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> Any plot, no climax, no good acting, awesome camera -work What is the rest? Yes right There may be a 'twist' at the end, but usually with horror movies, there is a proper understanding of what actually happened in the mobile phone. There are six knowledge - this explains a lot. Hide and seek, too. But the cave was a haircut that served as 'interpretation', but you can call it if you can call it. explain. <br /> <br /> <br /> Grace.
