At least for me I have followed Mr. Aldovor's career since the beginning and I'm not crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was wrong, she does not look good as she portrays the painting, she makes the character incredible. Also, the singer scene was just curious. I did not have dots and lip-sync awful. <br /> <br /> As the Spanish, the other thing that drives me to the nuts is the accents. Why do people from the same place say so different? The difference between the two sisters makes significant and no sense. And the village? Are we in 2007 or 1950? I tried to explain myself to my American husband that most of the movie is "old school", which is no longer anything else. <br /> <br /> I was hoping more but at this moment Mr. Almmovar did not provide, at least for me. I'm not saying Mrs. Cruz is doing bad things, I'm saying she's not there, she does not portray the character.
