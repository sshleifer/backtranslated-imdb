OK, sure, this image will never win an oscar. Citizen Ben is not this picture ... but why should every film be examined? The last time you saw a picture that was not funny, why was it good, but why was it stupid? Does anyone remember the king of exploitation, Karagar? <br /> <br /> Well, I made fun. I like cheese. Just do not expect to worry, and ready to throw the popcorn on the screen.
