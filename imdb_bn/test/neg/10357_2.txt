Some people say that this event was good in its early years! I do not agree with all. The show is just stupid and kind. My mother hates it, I hate it, my father hates it, I do not know about my sister but oh well Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. Characters: Kids are stupid to be used as a larger style character. The kids are just restless and annoying. Raised up and adults are stupid and unappealing. The worst character is Angelica Pylkes (it's a long, difficult, and sad day in the office when she actually does this for your ear drum) and also with Kim Finnstrom; She is hopeful and too much on a pain in butt. He can not decide where he is French or Japanese: It does not matter; And that you know an American citizen! Oh, what I'm saying, suck all the characters from this show! <br /> <br /> 2. Story: The stories are irrational and fools Like the kids it's a great adventure to go off, yes back yard shad. In one context, that small fool barbarian, Tommy Puckles Leader broke into a television control room and literally destroyed it almost. Do not give children any ideas to break the control room of the normal TV station (they pay a lot of money in their real life). I can imagine how this feeling of broadcasters is feeling, they would probably start to roam their machines and fear that a child would be scared all day long. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3 Over rate!: The show has been dragging for years now and people are still up for the story and new series and spin-up. Get out Simpson is going for almost the same time but they are much better and funnier than the kids. The show is just plain on rate! People, where are your common sense! <br /> <br /> However, I've been surprised by the TV station around the world to stop the series today. The show should be played junk and not junk. Two cartoons for this cartoon sucked just the same! 2/10
