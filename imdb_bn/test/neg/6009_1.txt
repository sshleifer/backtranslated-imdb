This is by far the worst hammering adaptation. Rock Hudson was completely unbelievable and incredible as a harsh soldier / adventure drawn in the war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her and Basilio de Sica believed that she was acting in any other film. They tried to epitomize a big scale out of a low-end romantic novel and the results were terrible. That was not enough if the whole thing is so slow, overlong and the date that it is virtually unwatchable. Rock definitely wanted to kick himself to bend the "troopers" and "Ben Hur" to create this disciplined whip. <br /> <br /> 0/10. Will have to avoid.
