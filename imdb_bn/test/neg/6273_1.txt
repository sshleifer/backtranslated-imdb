My paraphrase uploaded the top of the slogan on the back of the DVD box: This movie was far more intimidating than a terrible one. <br /> <br /> As long as I can remember it is the worst movie. My wife has accidentally rented it to think of Tom Cruise Edition. The special effects of crude raw effects on the menu screen should stop us. The opening nudity has already made us more suspect in the opening scene. <br /> <br /> But we wore the film, we were humbled by cruel acting - both over-anti-activating - non-continuity and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects under instructions. We give up after half an hour or less; After starting this badly, it probably can not be better. <br /> <br /> Since I disregard the reviews that are panning the product without any particular thing, here are some examples of movies especially painful moments, even if they are spoilers <br /> - lead his little boy off She said that she is going to move away with her mother later, because she will have an anniversary of her wedding but it is not coming because of leadership. Suddenly the business. The boy asked quietly, "Can I see you again?" Perhaps it is supposed to be closed as a promotion, but it comes as inappropriate behavior for a child instead of the condition that the age of the condition is. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien space station has crashed on the earth and sits in an enormous crater. The crowds are standing around the crowd, peering with each other but otherwise are usually looking for unaroused. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One woman said, "It's GI-ideal!" <br /> <br /> - This cartoon has destroyed villages and its residents, lead and pedestrians, now trying to load their cars near their home and their cars. A turn, there's something like this in exchange, in a quietly confused voice: <br /> <br /> "That thing, whatever?" "I know ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a foreign ship shot an explosive in it, the public began to run away, because a director told them that they were not afraid because they were not afraid or In the worst kind, under unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> And many more ... The writing about the film actually comes with the lack of experience, but it is possible A, please disturb yourself, even if your horrific curiosity is packed! The film is so bad that it can not be enjoyed as strange humor (vs, say, King Wieder's "Solomon and Sheba" played by Dhull Brenner). The type of messy observer is very small to waste. Dogs like walking or cleaning a birdcage, will be something more productive and enjoyable.
