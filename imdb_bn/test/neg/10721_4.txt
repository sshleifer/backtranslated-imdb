Like Jim Kerry fan, I took my seat in the movie with the hope light. After all, the fan with Dick and Jane seems to have all the raw materials for the success of this other career. After the first five minutes of good smile, it seemed as if this picture would be supplied, but the plot as soon as the plot was made wrong. The idea is that an impressive, charismatic, top VIP employee could suddenly work on his nearest supermarket. Believing is very difficult and then your head has become a real criminal that this person has also become a major criminal. The situation of the actor seems to be confused as well. Of course, the stereotypical, rich, inefficient head of the operation does not fight a bit to pull one dimensional character, but it is very difficult for carers and others around them. One minute Dick is shown as Kaki Office Pro, which is covered by wealth, at the next moment, he is an explosive mess that can stitch two words together and eventually he will become a small thief, which is happy, otherwise man's head to keep guns. Jane is equally confused with his role and his character is not really going on. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this story is so good and it is shameful that this film is not directed to manage it. Loud comedy can be found to find the odd moments of smile but it is usually somewhat more physical humor than malicious or tricky. Carey tried his best in part to save a sinking ship, but his comedy talent could never improve in a character that has many dense holes for his character. Despite his strong efforts, without presenting him to this film, he presented a strong, brave character (Man on the Moon, the truman show, S. Ventura).
