It was fun in the 1970s uneconomic comedy, psychological profession and Beverly Hills. I did not think so, but I said more about the shame about marriage and religion: Two things that can not just stop trashing of secular filmmakers (money in Hollywood and anywhere else). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> However, despite that messy film, its entertaining moments and even it has some charm. Dan Ikorid is a brown suit and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is good for a great payment. I'm sorry she did not have a big role.
