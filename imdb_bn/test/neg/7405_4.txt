I'm a fan of hospitals and medical shows, I found this one gripping and sometimes ridiculous (especially with the scene with Dr. Whitman) which brings a bit la light relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I hope the bad guys will be punished and the good will be restored. Instead, the hospital management has incredibly fooled itself and it is bad and bad for the good. What can you do to help surprise the unions, or Rob, Donna and Maria do not know what the unions are? Side by side, trees, grass, sunlight are never seen. Does anyone understand the last words? That is how Rob Lake responded to the questions of North Miss Strawberry kids, "Why are you talking about us all?" It was not very frustrating to understand it.
