... when another language is dubbed. Let's face it: Neilson and Schwarzenegger are also good actors in the dialog. And given the camp line they should say this in a loose-loose situation. Any kind of voice-over can be an improvement and (actually - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But it's only a minor point. Acting is bad. Fast-speed combat sequences are. Neilsen could have gone out of a wet paper bag using her floor. Compared to the speed of the child presented by the child, it became painful (which has been given some martial arts training, no doubt) and athleticsism performed by Sandhal Bergman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - There's nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some visual are wonderful, I have to give it. The Dragon Skeleton Bridge looks cool. But it is often not more clear than plaster. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not viewable. Even better than 'Canaan the Distro' (though only slightly). I'd rather see a lot of red gold as it was really supposed to, but I doubt that it could save the movie - oh well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
