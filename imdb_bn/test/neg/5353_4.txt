Here are other reviews here to express opinions, but I still felt for adding my comments. The film is generally well-made technically, perhaps it can be very long. Acting is very good, although Kevin Spacey is not given enough space to explain the motivation of his character (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems like an eye candy, which he admits very well. <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film's heart is in the right place to oppose the alphabet on a basic level, and I believe that it can be a specific treatment for racism, perhaps why so famous names agree to it. But I think the authors are far more than the chin (I did not read the book, so I do not know how low it is to Grisham). One of the biggest problems, as many have said, is that it supports the justice system. Even though I do not agree with the position, I do not think that such scenes actually help in the case of racist racism - it is even more applicable to the expulsion of white protesters to kill black hunters. Finally, the Prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the victim was white - but follow it and imagine that a white man who murdered the accused black rapist ... the message seems to be in the end because you are enough of them It's OK to kill anyone as hate. It is also advantageous that the killing of humans was presented as a complete evil and there is no doubt about its crime, which in reality may remove any moral ambiguity. Unfortunately, it also weakens the plots - he comes to somebody with enough integrity, but believe it. It is hard for him to be willing to hide the crazy application (and in fact he is not, when the push is pushed). We think that it was the reason for facing the death penalty, but at one point he had applied for genocide, even if you were blinking, you would miss it. Why does not it take, is it slim that he should know his chatter? Or if he wants to stand in court, why madness? <br /> <br /> Doctors, whose testimony is supposedly accustomed to humor, they joke - both deny it for very impossible reasons and none of them suggests genuine mental disorder. No The message seems to be that the expert witnesses say what they say to say, and should not believe. The wounded police support Jackson, which is a little wider, but still a bit convenient (and if she dies?) I think KKK will come out on the streets in broad daylight. Go without any visible effort to identify or judge other apparently serious offenses (riot, arson, abduction, attempt to kill). <br /> <br /> My final reaction should be felt rather dirty - though I want to be racist because I do not agree with resolution. It may be that the movie can look for different perspectives and let viewers decide, but if they think they have forgotten it until the end. The film has forced me to think about my opinion, what other people might think about here and read my opinion, so maybe it may be successful at some level - but I think that it can reproduce very indifferent opinions among some people I hope <br /> <br /> Try to see the law and order, this 38 minutes screen time with a lot of depth in it like B Yagulike covers!
