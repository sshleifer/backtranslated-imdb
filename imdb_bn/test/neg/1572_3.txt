An impressive musical classic and such a bitter pill will take it to a highly anticipated remake. Very, very difficult to swallow ... all of it. It was not an ounce of credibility anywhere. And when you do not have a day, you do not have any shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> She was able to produce all that a tricky, funny, glitzy, trademark bate matchre ... all the weight with familiar mediationism Reduce Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think Middleall was going through this time ... to get himself thrown in himself, he could rest on his grave. The greatest musical instrument of all time ... as he did "Rose". But, no, he played safely. She played herself. She made a total dinner-theater cartoon of Rose. Even his song was uninspired. It seemed to me that Millear got the talent of his money-making scotch. He showed only this "Gypsy" promise and it was "Rose's turn." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, River City. <br /> <br /> A huge, huge letdown
