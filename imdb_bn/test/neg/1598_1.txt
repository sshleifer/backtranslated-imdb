I can usually bear a movie, but it's really a sick emotional self-absorbed movie! <br /> <br /> First, the author / director is completely self-absorbed, full of ill joke, which is not funny at all. Secondly, he is ill-deformed, which uses children's mind and poisoned! I can not believe my ears when I hear the sick and perverted nominees spoken by my children! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Jane's Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but Eric Schaffer's dirty little-known movie has become a victim! <br /> <br /> <br /> And what's the face of Eric Mubius's face? I mean, she meets this girl that she wants to get married, but she was not married! Actually there are dirty people in his place! Time did fly really fast? <br /> <br /> However, do not waste your time looking at this movie, unless you want to get a sick Eric Shaffer to become poisonous!
