Warning: Speaker Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your prominent career, you have entertained, expanded, made some extraordinary entertainment. "Blight beasts night" falls into the next section. This is not strange as "favored from 10,000 points" or, perhaps, "the denuclear horror". However, one of my greatest criticism of this movie is that I could make it faster, better and cheaper for you. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the previous and heading. Roger, Rocket Sequence is seeing something from Disney's "Man in Space", which is certainly not good. Predictive rocketing seems to be nothing in contemporary 1958. Why did not you just use a Vanguard, Atlas, even a Viking Launch? Still good, why not completely deliver with the launch and a shot of space and it starts with floating capsules? I did this for Roger. Second, why there is a crash on the spaceship crash? Even a Middle School physics student might tell you, your astronaut world will be extra crispy and widely deboned. I used to see your astronauts become "occupied" by the monster (perhaps using the "negative / positive" element that you used to "fight for satellites"), losing contact with the Earth and landing in the desert. It will again explain how you can "purple" your astronauts to put on the hectic temperature of restoration, but they will still burn in the fire. Even with this stupidity. The first half of your movie is quite good. If you used to spend some money on music music, then it was as good as the "external limitations" middle-stage. However, again, your author described Ad Nelson as a landing system designer, then gave him some stupid conversations regarding magnetism. Michael Ammet is the biggest problem of the second half of "Blight Beast of Night". He is terrible as a destroyed astronaut. You should expel him from the spot and replace him with Ed Nelson. You can combine Nelson's responsibilities with John Donlapp and save yourself an actor's cost. I do not know if you really paid any money to these people; But, at least you save the cost of three meals a day. I also drowned the "Scotch Parrot" dress and used to spend extra money using makeup to make the astronaut a "animal of blood". Perhaps you were very close to "The Crying Unknown", but it helped greatly at the second half speed. If you are going to a "blood vessel", would not it be a good idea to show a little blood? Yes, I know the headline is available from the celestial blood fetus, but if KÃ¶lski pours a little chocolate syrup for you, you can do a lot better for yourself. After all, it looks like black and white blood. Do you have that cost, probably two bucks? I've used some closups For some reason the painting does not seem quite bad between dialogue and bad-acting closups. See about 70 TV series and you can see what you mean. Oh, off, Roger, a note from your author. If you do not have any electricity, you can not use any fluorescope. Remember, you fry the first relay generator? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, could you not afford a fake knife? You know, the kind of where the blade goes in the handle. I was one of them at the age of 9, which became the "diverse night of blood". This is probably the cost of two more rupees. I knew enough then to make you a good movie. I know now that's enough. So, Roger, if you decide to rebuild "Black Beast Night", or if you are looking for a writer / director to work with you on any other project, I'm your guy. I'll work cheap, because I want to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give a "3" night of "blight beasts". Note: If you want to watch movies "Bloodbust's Nighttime DVD" for $ 3299, but very good quality. You can get "blood diversion nights" in places like Bestboy for $ 6 with many terrible horror / Sissy films.
