I'm looking for a good movie about Jefferson, I wanted to spend part of my Independence Day weekend. This image was not there. It was rather long, painted, lazy and unfinished. There was a lot of time spent exploring Jefferson's relation with Koswei and not enough time spent with her relationship with Sally Hemings. Sally, Thandi Newton, the woman that played, was absolutely awful. His performance was so bad that he saw an A1 airhead to try to read Shakespeare. Slowly his nervous voice! Nolt's pronunciation makes Jefferson like a genius instead of a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and his feelings about slavery were also supportive, but an important event that delayed his older daughter's sedition. The film was very long and the lack of power and tension in the script. From a positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and the Greater Skakchi Koswei took part in well. If you want to see a movie about the Revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, see 1776, it is much better than Jefferson in Paris.
