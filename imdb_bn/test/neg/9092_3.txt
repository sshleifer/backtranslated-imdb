This movie was a disappointment. The story is basically a giant instead of ghosts as a castle (or a very cheap set to be specific, masquerading as a castle, with hotels) and alternatives. The budget you see from Cinemax Software is obscene, it was shot in photography, set, lighting and video. The Story is a Failure of Sincerity: There is no easy way to sympathize with your characters than to show their trauma to your visitors. And the trauma of this movie is quite stupid. Want an example? A blind girl listens to the girls learning to wear an Italian tape for which she will never see, she starts crying. <br /> <br /> There were some things for this movie, however: the giant is actually looking pretty, pretty scary. And Raffa Addani, who is a star of Italian "erotic" films, from a beautiful sophisticated amount of nudity. The cows, however, leave much to be desired, as well as acting, even from experienced Jeffrey Kombus. Apart from <br /> I have seen only two Stuart Gordon films: except for the re-animator and the ones, which were both outstanding. But this short footnote will not save him from watching many of his movies in his career.
