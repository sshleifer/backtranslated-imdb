This home movie is basically a scandal, but you have to give them 3/10 to try. Blood is rubbish, but the old woman who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the idea is good, and make-up is okay for the home movie. But thanks to God, it was only 55 minutes long, and the last turn is pretty literally Fight Club (almost as trash as the film). Just read this comment, do not see the film.
