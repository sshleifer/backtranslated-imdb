This film has a lot of knowledge like 'Og and Harriet' or 'Father Naws Best' episodes. An old copy of the Reader's Digest (about 1962) will give more insights into modern life, or relationships between father and daughter than these strange concoctions. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. She appears to sleep through the film. (According to the title of the film, I realized that he had a supporting role but Martin Short even played an independent, supporting character.) <br /> <br /> I understand the fascination of a mythical world made by a romantic comedy. But this image is a legendary prozac version of the world. I have seen that anyone can enjoy it even pure fantasy.
