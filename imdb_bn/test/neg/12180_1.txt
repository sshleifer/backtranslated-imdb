Charles Branson gave a lot of moments on the viewer's screen. But this film does not have anything that should be a thriller / action-movie. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really vague. And when the action scene fails, how does the story store the story? Not all, my answer is The story is even worse than the action scene. It's very easy and annoying, and although I'm a big fan fan, I've often fallen asleep. I do not know how they came with failure. A low budget, perhaps? However, it seems that all actors are not interested in filming. When this happens, the result is really bad.
