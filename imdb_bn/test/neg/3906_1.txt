I have seen this movie part because of some positive comments on IMDB. I had 90 minutes before my life, I had a duty to take myself here and tell me ... please do not be bothered to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue the attempts of the actors - they can give material what they do, but that element is awesome. The speed was deadly - slowly, and you saw everything was coming almost an hour away, and then it happened forever. The dialogue was boring, stupid, not funny. All of the letters were completely disrespectful. And cinematography in my opinion very low quality - "The character uses the home video machine!" Very bad effects are used. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jerry Ryan is a cool person. You do not have that sucker to waste your time in this movie.
