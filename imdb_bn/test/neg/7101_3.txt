"Tank Girl", I think, "Bakaru Banaji" in the 90's and was marketed in this way. Comparing it, is qualitatively; There is so much going on in both of the films on both frames that the story is impossible to sort, it certainly is not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a fun enough ride, if you close your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise you'll end up with a scalp-cracking headache like me.
