This movie combines several well-known actors that I usually like, so when I got a DVD rental, I had at least a modest expectation. I was very disappointed. Actually, I went for some food somewhere in the last half and in some way I went to the kitchen and returned to the TV. The performance of the movie was very poor throughout the board and any atmosphere of the movie was strongly felt. Almost all the scenes were "a movie of sentiment", I sat there and asked the director to "cut!" Before going to the next step, follow the trick after making a little chat with the scene. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters about gangsters are difficult and publicly, the problem here is that this whole bad-minded attitude is so bad that it seems like a joke. The constant guitar-drilling soundtrack really strives to emphasize this atmosphere, but when playing the same track 18th time, it only joins firmly before being fake. <br /> <br /> It was probably just a really bad script, perhaps it is only executed weakly. I'm not a movie critic, actually I think it's rare to see something really good, but it does not matter how motivated and forgiving I am to be. As a hired, even do not recommend!
