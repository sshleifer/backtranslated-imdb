I went to a bookstore in Tennessee Brentwood. I'm not going to say the name because I'm a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with each item purchased here before. Bell Witch Hunting was in front of the shop. (I can mention this is the only shop which I saw this for sale.) I heard the story somewhere and it seemed that it actually happened for the real. I was very excited and could not wait to see it. I had great hopes for it. I can not believe I saw when I saw it. It does not look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression it was estimated to be a horror movie. I mean that the movie will suddenly become a witch that you know. This is no horror movie. You do not jump from your seat in this movie. I gave all the possibilities in the world to get better as the movies went along. I swear I did it. It does not get any good. Several scenes of this little boy torn on him. I do not find that all entertaining. I have seen the whole movie in disbelief that the shop will actually sell it to me. I guess that's how bad this economy has been. I have this to say cast and crew. This film does not show as a material to get other film work. Do not do it. I mean that sincerely. I appreciate you for trying. For those who bought this. I say this. Do not sell your copy to anyone. They might get very upset. Day is good for everyone.
