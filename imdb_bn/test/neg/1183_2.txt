*** May be spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had high expectations for this film based on the trailer. I knew a bit about the real ed gene, so I think it's a real-time Hollywood version of the budget. I was wrong <br /> <br /> First, the text came from eight-grade, which rarely knew Ed's history and refuted the script in about 20 minutes. This film is completely completed with Ad's most striking aspect and his relationship with his mother (referring to the fact that the real police are not found at her house) and initially decides to focus on the young deputy, who thinks she walks towards the set. Likewise, all of the letters of the male seem to be labeled in the whole movie. I'm not exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Do not start even with the historical rumor in this movie. Seriously, who directs this? This image is expected to be held in approximately 1957, but the police are carrying modern sided battles, they came from greed and some elements of the hardware store, and when the police came from the paphone, they were 9-1- 1 (then they did not exist again). Also, Ed was a small man, fearful as the character of Anthony Parkins in Psycho (who was originally based on real-life ed), this intelligent father who did not look too much like the man of the black man of a male black man. <Br> <br /> Another thing that really bore me was that the creators of this photo shot the whole thing in a abandoned, 3-building set. Due to "cute" camera angles, you do not see any real city and the interior of the set looks like old, long abandoned shakes. Pop a sari-horse and bamboo cash articles! - Instant hardware store <br /> <br /> I am generally sorry for low budget horror movies, but it only requests for it. What you had to do was include most of the real events (even hug them!), Instead of 15 crawfy to give five good actors and Pitt's request will take 5 minutes and once in a while, think about the time. My suggestion: Google Ad Gene, you will get a lot of entertainment.
