<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Craft accidentally collides (!) - and 'Alien' - Esquija funifies our crew men from Russian ships as a cyborg . <br /> <br /> Spaceship internally set up a doll factory (metal walkways, boilers, piping). These totally inconsistent settings, 'Cody', 'Snake' and our other heroes crew grimees, hate, almost and continuously and repeatedly shot them and shot their shotguns. Define this movie, and they are not amazing: <br /> <br /> The element is displayed and disappeared. Shotgun is lazy. A cigar gets longer by smoke. Shotgun is confirmed again, sure again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
