Due to the reasons I can not start, Lorenzo Cameron (George ZuckerO) started wounding blood in wolves in a bloody surgical operation Petro (Glen Strange). The result ?? Petro is transformed into a harmful (as harmful as someone might be a bad wig and pointy tooth) killer animal Dr. Cameron uses Petro to retaliate to the scientific community, who curious and ridiculed his idea (and why not compare Cameron's addiction plate). <br /> <br /> Overall, Mad Monster is made of a dull and poorly made Poetry Fan thriller. I'm really positive to write in Mad's mind. George Zucco may be as fun to see as he plays as well as a crazy scientist. His Dr. Cameron's regular cruelty. He has no qualifications about killing; He has complete conversations with those who are not there; And, as the most crazy scientist, he messes "in the domain of God" (actually, I'm sure someone complained to him, but it fits). But beyond Zucco, there is nothing here to recommend. Everything from the cast supporting the music from the effects of the monsters is worse than the old. Compared to Mad Monster, there are many good examples of poverty racket in the 1940s.
