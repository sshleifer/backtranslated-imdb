Kinda funny how the comments for this photo went downhill, now add me. I think the script has been well protected by acting, and played by a good script. Together, it was hard to see, and I did not flinch from this content. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sisurie was the best part (I thought that the relationship between him and his surviving boy was the only new thing this film has proposed in his genre) but even he lagged. Who can not blame him, who knows what is required by the director and / or editor on the floor in the queue room. Feel it "Come, Let's Go", in the whole movie "Okay, it's good enough", when I knew that there was something more to dig from the actor and the script, which had some good lines and some interesting themes. <Br /> <br /> I do not think it's counted as an explosive, but a perfect example, where Sigourani takes his son's guided persecutor home and looks at his face and I thought "this is such a person who resides in the mobile home It's meant to look like someone "and sure, I'm not sure how to threaten us with the next shot, a beautiful house like him A scary dhitaya lethal trawlers. <br /> <br> Many other posters have mentioned that there are many good movies that have similar scams in the same note with scanned script which hit the notes well - "celebration" I have probably seen that the ultimate example.
