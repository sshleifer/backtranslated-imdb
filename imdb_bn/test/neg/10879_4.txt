First of all, just tell me this ... Ghost Story .... hello !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is very different. When the character comes back, the characters disappear, the body should have been given. This film was not billed as a ghost story when you did not even give a hint for renting it in the video store, and this is the biggest mistake made by the studio. If you try to understand its meaning, the main character was confused about confusing you to mislead you, as it was a ghost story sharing market or market. The problem is that they have lost many visitors; Ghosts seem to be "very human and real", without any typical marks, imagery or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to tell you that you are now seeing a ghost ... and this is what they are trying to do. The main character does not know that he is seeing ghosts and not even the visitors. Can you get it now? As long as you realize that the main character has seen the ghost, you can understand the film and what is perceived as the main surveillance between continuity or defect in the plot will not be so annoying. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that it was not a good movie, just as bad as it was, everyone else also made it. Just understand, if you plan to watch this movie, then what you think is not always "always". For acting, 4 out of 10, 3 for originality, 5 for the plot and 5 for the awesome factor, although there were some nasty and wonderful moments. Still a good movie, just misunderstood.
