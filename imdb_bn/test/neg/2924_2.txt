The worst thing about "talk radio" is how bad. The caller's voices have a phone call, a read-to-a-script ring with them. A evening with a boring loudmouth at Dallas Radio Station called with a Sartrean shy aspect in hell. The stone tries for an existential revelation and instead gets an unintended comedy. Whenever a Calcutta creates a "deep" (empty) point about something, the stone pushes the camera to one of the faces of its character because they have some terrifying appreciation that are not exposed to the audience. Bogosian overlay over across one of the most annoying performances ever smeared onto celluloid. Lost in the classic? Give me a break.
