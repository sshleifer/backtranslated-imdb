"Speak" was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer Richard Speake. However, there are not many murders found in this film, and none of which is clearly shown. The most annoying scene of the whole movie, perhaps, when SPEC is stuck for eight unfortunate nurses to die in his own bathroom, it is only meant to be perfectly understood and not shown, Mr. Speck's legs are stored for some uncomfortable downward pressure. The most entertaining part of this movie is probably the voice-over, which should be a rule of mind-narrowly annoying nature. Each aspect of this movie is horrific. If you do not have a fondness for frustration, do not bother. This movie only watches in 72 minutes, but it seems like an eternity.
