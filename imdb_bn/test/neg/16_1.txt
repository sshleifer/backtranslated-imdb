For a few years, I am a fan of the park work and "Old Boys" is my best favorite of all time. <br /> <br /> I rent this movie with lots of hope, I just saw it in a while to find only the worst movies. This is not a true horror movie; There is no doubt in it and even the "light" part is too tall, I do not know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I met the younger brother in Chan-Uk Park and what a disappointment! He got from this. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like the movie "Old Boy", Mr and Lady "Vengeance" or even "Three Extremist" movies, but do not waste your time. , The film has no value.
