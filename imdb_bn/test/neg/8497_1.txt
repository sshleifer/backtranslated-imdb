This image is crazy. I believe the film's original, 'The Mask', was an extraordinary movie, which is very valuable to buy and watch. I firmly believed that they would make a signal, but when I saw it, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This picture has completely destroyed the idea of ​​'mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around a room? My younger brother did not smile at the age of seven, and he was in the film of this child, but it was bad. A load of shit !! I'm telling you now, please do not watch this movie, it's a waste and time waste. Instead you can actually be having fun! Look at the 'mask', but no, I do not repeat, see this alarm of junk. Thank you.
