One day I rented this movie from the local video store, you know, this type of movie with box industry that only arrives and tells you 'hire me'. Well, if you see this dull movie of your video store, then go. War of passion, a rental, because this picture is BOOOoooorrring. Despite the striking opening, the film is about repetitive killing and almost stagnant on a tough hard forehead, dealing with natural problems (wife, a boss thrust etc.). Wondering your VCR works faster functions? Rent this film and keep your concerns in check.
