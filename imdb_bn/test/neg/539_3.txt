Well, I saw the rage of Paradise. <br /> <br /> This is not something I would not recommend to the Japanese war criminals seriously. This is a critical plot of Japanese war Nizama film. About these three "witchcraft swords" about these three old schools of Nanja. I saw the subtitle version (not recommended on the way, it's easy to miss) and I have not really kept it all with it. It was difficult to see some good scenes, but in general, it was not a lot of my choice.
