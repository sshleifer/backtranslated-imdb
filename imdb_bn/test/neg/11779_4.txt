This film which I discovered in the video store, has apparently been sitting with a distributor for a few years. Why is it easy to see? The story is very good in the film, looking for their Paul from High School, living in homeless under the Boardback of two friends living in New York, but at the end, Stann and Daniel have been reduced to weight by story, but rather their homeless friend Richie. The verb is naturally very good and the film is a beautiful look with the spectacular images of Coney Island. However, rather than focusing on the author's action and director Richard Schnecoman Ricci, Stan is very busy with the unintended life of Stan and Daniel. A flashback from a music store, where Richie is a crush on an employee, and the film goes where it really looks. But not the end. Many of the annoying people in Skibel Building have seen. 10 out of 4 ratings.
