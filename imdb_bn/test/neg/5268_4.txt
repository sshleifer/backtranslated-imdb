I heard one of the worst excuses for an Irish access. From a really great actor. This is a bad Irish accent which is not a reference to a Dublin accent (which is completely different), however, the film is fiercely based on the story of gangster Martin Cahill and is much better with Brendan Gleisson in the title role of General.
