This is the worst adaptation of Greek mythology that I have ever seen. It has completely failed as the old mythological expression, inventing the revival of fools and reducing 12 ... 3 or 4, I think. Changes in the bird's body, lions to sphinx, delphi orrell, tireyas, and bulls are like a pedantic, stories about writing stories make absolutely inappropriate things to combine other mythological stories in the question-answer process. The version of the prototype, even combine the aspects, outside the recreational series of Sam Raimi, is never seen on his first marriage, to a woman known as Faris, so that she feels fit for the time. <br /> <br /> I can accept most of it, but it also completely fails in pure movie values; The most painful dialogue, the lead, the strong pseudo-Shakespeare Tripe is. This is a poor review of myths, which made a tragic effort to modern review, which tried to engage with Criton's "13th Warrior" Baufulful legends, although still strictly legendary elements such as clean interference gods and magical super powers. Sadly, sad failure of an entertaining experience, I'm sure that many quality actresses are deeply sorry.
