I have a hard time finding the words to explain how much I hate this movie. The historic trial of Henriet Delois-Desportes and Duc de Pazlein is a tragic and compelling story that I think is likely to be an extraordinary movie, but failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography had to say something for yourself, it did not create any kind of film's horrendous structure, poorly written scripts and all the terribly characterized letters. The worst of them was the children of Dukes, who were so expensive and deadly nets that it was almost painful to watch. At the conclusion, this picture did not seem to be anything more than a bother to me. Deeply frustrated
