This movie was a thorough dappointment. There was no development in the story. The audience is thrown into the story without explaining and left to save for themselves in order to try to do what is happening. The order of action was OK but was confusing. They were not matrix and they were not the Crouching Tiger. This movie is simply the best left on the TV where you should not pay to pay or trust the friend to see that it should be hired and then go and see it. As a huge Jet Li fan, I expected more. Once in China, someone who is involved in this time will keep his name ???
