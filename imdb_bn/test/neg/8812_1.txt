Why do I mention this movie every time, I will hear about 10 minutes compliment. I came to the conclusion that a movie has a wrapper in a wrap, it is considered "talent" to anyone who sees it. Really what is the film? Or is anyone that "wow, it's so cool" to anyone that everyone will agree with them and have any opinion of their own? How much of the film's 7.5 rating does the film industry disagree? It has still become another movie for which it is a "need" of the "two" episode, so I will have to know about this terrible franchise for some time now. <br /> <br /> Now in film and why it is so bad. Its original idea is not really bad, because it was not a good serial killer movie. Writing for this photo is awesome and executable. OK, so it's not a low budget movie, but the story or writing should not change. The actors can not be worse for fear of these killers or to be scared of the fear of this movie. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his characters (whatever happens) are lost because his character is amazing. Why was he in this movie? Ultimately, his whole war became visible and confusing for the spectators who believed it. This is certainly the purpose of the filmmakers, but it was not a good way to do this without observing all the dirt. And then came the "big" turn (this was the third or fourth?) And the whole audience wonders and walks from the theater, such a wonderful composition comes out. The film is talking about the story of man or not, but this film was not the only fault. The aspect was to be very creative with the work it was working on, and the flashback sequences were used only as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> Even after watching this movie, if you enjoy it then go back and review the movie and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of acceptable praise. If you did not do it then check out a wonderful serial killer film Se7en. That wanted to be this film. I've probably gotten into more arguments about this film than any other person and will continue to argue against it. Please do not support this franchise not just for your request, but for me and everyone else. To make a Hollywood 1000 remix, Seagels and "Shock" Factor movies (as such), find out a great movie. Oh yes, sha tagline gives the real promise: "Oh yes, blood will be." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet !! Blood, that means its right? Give me a break. Sorry this movie is loved by everyone, but poor writing, flashing direction, and bad acting do not make a good movie.
