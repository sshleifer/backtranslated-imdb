Wow, what an overrated movie turned into this! It was supposed "a woman hostage and an insane killer involved in terrorism in her house was a highly suspicious story". Well, I suspect that it appeared to be terrorist terrorists in the early 50's and I know it will fall asleep today's visitors. <br /> <br /> "Nuclear Declaration of Times" shifts the spine down. "No, I can only find a shower that leaves anyone out of this planet. Anyone who thinks of something about the NY Times believes in something. <br /> <br /> It was a troubled person, The defendant was in his house but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually violent and friendly. Actually, this act Ryan never played an inferior role! Yes, "Wilton" Almond was but he never hurt the woman and only wanted to trust the friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Be careful, my reader ..... this sucks.
