This is one of the most annoying, boastful, poser film I've ever seen. What is a waste of budget and actor Angelopoulos reached new levels of pretentiousness. Although this part of Greek history is a great element for great movies, it is not virtually a plot. He simply had some supposed symbolic (indeed shambolic) scenes in his mind and he created an entire movie around them. The advertisement is repeated on the main theme of the death and the lightnick, the process and the similar, which should be only a car for the film, but unfortunately it is the film itself. A complete incubator result, which only gives you "Yes?" Can say. Or "Oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, Nada, Zilch. I usually complain about some movies containing two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one dimensional character. It's boring for us and frustrating for some actors. He even thinks my favorite Greek actor Zieroz Armenia is a wood. <br /> <br /> And going to the original creation of AngelPulls: We are not stupid. We do not want to chew the food. Please someone will be fine in this folk symbolism. Are you really less evaluating your audience or are you just incapable? Personally, I think he tried to create Greek "underground". He does not matter how he tries, he can not reach the witch. <br /> <br /> Save only the security: photography, clothing and music.
