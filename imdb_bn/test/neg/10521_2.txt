This stinker is mysteriously rolling in a channel here, and I found myself repeatedly watching observers. The script is like one that brings a lot of drinking to some friends and the price of production is appreciably matched. <br /> <br /> This is meant to be a children's movie, but an unexpected (and weak interpretation) kidnapped scene; The star dog only lacks the star quality of other actors; And this is generally the appearance of somebody portraying the backyard of the house (the climatic football game delights three dozen additional extraordinary placards). <br /> <br /> It's even involved in a budget. When the voice-over sequence out, the story, one relief, simply closed. Here the high-writers must be the producers - or more than the football game!
