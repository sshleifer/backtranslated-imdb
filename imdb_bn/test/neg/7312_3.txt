Well I want to say that I own this image and I just want to finish it. The movie is boring and slow but the final battle is so funny. Just say that if the fake bird does not attack the main evil person, then the film will be 0 out of 10. The bird makes it 3. If you're really bothered or rented and want to make it something terrible to go fast, the ultimate battle.
