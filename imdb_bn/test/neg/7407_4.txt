* This comment may contain technically "spoilers" but it is not certain that there is no surprise * <br /> <br /> My cousin and I hope to hire another day on this day which is a simple amateur crappy plea for a lady Hope to get a good smile Movie Unfortunately, we did not get much smiles, and we were not very afraid. <br /> <br /> Plot outline: A company's head and a peculiar technology technology is where our buddy friends live, so the company combines a group of personality rather than skilled hunters, for recovery it is <br /> < br /> For the first 3/4 movie, the thing becomes quite annoying. In most cases, hidden shots on large legs are sometimes involved in listening to party members and they do nothing. We saw several shots of party from the point of view of Big Foot, and he apparently saw the heat view. <br /> <br /> To set up a plot, we will see the order of the group sitting around camp fire, about the possibility of the existence of sasquatches and justifying the action. "Maybe he can steal bullets ... if he sees them coming". Enough enough, we can see later. "There are many undesirable lands where there might be a sousquach, probably it was one of them which was seen more". And of course it's "Perhaps Saskatchev is angry because the plane has hit one of his family members." And sure enough, that's the case. There are a few of those scenes as well "Oh my god, it's Saskatchet oh, just wait!" Scenes, and sadly, they are among the scariest. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, people started dying. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, past victims have been discovered. The scene of death is beautiful birds. This mostly leaves our imagination, after catching them in the Saskatchet, then spending a different scene, but firstly, we were treated with some scary cry from our camera. Finally, we see the character's final showdown with the monster. I must admit, I found it quite exciting when it lasted. But alas, it is very short lived and treated at the end of the half tries to think that it is deceptive. Then, some close texts with an annoying conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can not say I recommend this movie. It is not enough enough to provide science theater 3000 mystery, and it certainly is not clear enough and annoying to enjoy as a horror movie. Not just bothered about it.
