I do not know how this stupid, shit, junk, junk and not a good blockbuster for a movie. It was very annoying, very weak (or not) story-line and was not even a fun fun. Love (Salman Khan) is a paragraph of the story of love guru and a helmet and romantic sculptor (Govinda) to help get the girl she wants. I'm not saying that I do not like this picture because it was not funny or anything, I would take a movie that is not funny but it's a beautiful story. The only two reasons why I can say this is a super hit: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are on the screen together, but for the first time there was Salam e Ishaka which was a floppy, so it can not be. But it's really a good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is love and all the names of that name have been hurt with mine Pierre Kia. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard that this is a hit on the hit, I did not see it and I'm not happy. Music is just the only good song, do you want a partner, you are my love and Soni Dakha, but what is the use of it in really bad movies, even if you have someone like Katrina Kaif, who is dancing to both of them? He is full pain. He does not know the language, (his voice is always dubbed for him), dance and always fails to influence. I do not like one bit of him, because he was frustrated with coffee. The overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. He kicked him from Bollywood and never came back.
