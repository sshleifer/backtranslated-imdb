The final installment of the Karate Kid series is expected, bad behavior, and enjoyable borders on unlimited it. But not quite, it's just bad. Ralph Macchior Karate Kid is missing in this installment, already one of the episodes. New baby, played by Hillary Swing, Mr. Granny of a friend of one of Miyagi's WWII friends grandson Her parents are now dead and her grandmother tried to raise this young hell. Step by step Mogi to fix something. The formula is authentic, there is a group of neo-fascist bullies, known as alpha truppers, which should be placed in their place and a new katah step, known as prayer mantis. I said before this movie a mess, and should be avoided.
