Only this movie is without any substance. Just accept my word for it and save it yourself full time DUD !! I say the letters are one dimensional but it would have meant there were some kind of character development. I think Eric Roberts is going out in any second, it was close to the B-movie status. <br /> <br /> The 70-year-old girl is beautiful ... but as long as you're her stunner type fan, there is nothing for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
