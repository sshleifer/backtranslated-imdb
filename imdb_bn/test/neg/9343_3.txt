Based on this, I am not overly overwhelmed by the critically acclaimed critics of the film, because Venezuela's film is a bit lagging behind other countries in this region, many people from Venezuela are very excited. <br /> For the first time, the film is very repetitive, most of the scenery is almost the same as both of the important roles, so you will get the impression that it swings at a time. A time filler is also a good point, because this movie is too long with 105 minutes, you will start getting tired after a while and watch the clock. <br /> <br /> All the actors are exceptionally bad Venezuelan Adgoire Ramirez, who bring a little slopstick and play the role of "Pedro" in Venezuela. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the region (Caribean zone), it tend to ridicules them.
