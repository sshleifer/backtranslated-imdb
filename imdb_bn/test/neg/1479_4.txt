It's so annoying to fall asleep after 20 minutes. Sorry Mr. Boutonnat, I appreciate your work (you have guided all these beautiful "movies" such as "Trishna", "Suns Logic" etc.) but here, the plot is very modest ...! Apart from great photography, everything seems to be stupid and there is no jealous to know what will happen to these "media" actors. Moreover, the dialogue is minimalist. The famous question "Where are the kids?" It is often repeated, it looks like a castle. Believe it, it is a pure waste time (related to plot), and 3 hours long long time. Of course this box office is a real mess!
