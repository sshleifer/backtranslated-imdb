"Ashes of Time" was a tremendous project, but eventually became a provocative movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. The plot of "Time Ashes" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". Because "triangle of love", the original dynamics performed by letters due to envy, hatred and love. The color of the color is seen through the eyes of One-Young Fen (Leslie Cheng). Wai-Yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as a man among the different terrorists and becomes Destiny's tool through fate. Unfortunately the "Ashes during the time" love and hate fail to talk about this simple story. Wang Kar-Yi is inspired by the desire to film each frame of the film and to have an aesthetic experience. In fact, with the addition of beautiful actors (male and female) as well as everything else, the failure of this movie Dials are not the lowest and all the originals. The quality of the film is very inequitable, the editing can sometimes be seen in the "swordplay" style (at least by me) and finally the filming of rare sword war is very confusing and obsolete. Even the art of making artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so-called lover "Horse Riding" scene is not funny, loving and vain. Wang Kara-Y wanted to give a 100-minute pure aesthetic experience and forgot that the first one about how a movie is called a plot. By forgetting, he provided a strange movie which even did not fulfill its artistic purpose.
