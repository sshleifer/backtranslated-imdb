This picture lasted three hours, including the International Channel of History, the commercial last night. But it felt like three weeks. It was not cheap, weird and weirdly funny pictures of Dresden bomb attacks. It does not spread in almost all the perspectives around World War II. Even the bombing was not often shown as a big disadvantage for a folly love story. No, it's characteristic characteristic of wood that shows life beyond story. Oh, and if it can be impossible for the movie, then that movie Dresden. Perhaps a good title has been dressed - like Uriah Hip has experienced it. <br /> <br /> This is especially the next point that so irritates. Is the Darsden bombing war war? So believe this movie maker But in general the way they are able to reach the second World War in Germany, they can not talk like "Mother Teresa" like "Peace" and "No War-Somewhere". And, especially for the British, specialization of German aristocracy, is an unreasonable attempt to groovel before "British", when one of the people of "crime" for Dresden, while loading "crime" to Arthur Harris, <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Did I tell a person? Well, not quite At the beginning of the film, there is a surprise from leading character, Anna, who seems to be sympathetic to all of us. "Damned Americans!", He screams, reading as while watching the bomb away. And after a few minutes, a radio voice "America's Terrorist Bomb Attack" warns against the suppression of the Germans. <br /> <br /> The word "terrorism" Got it? This is actually the United States of America's civilian citizens in inhumane targeting. American strategy of almost all war in Europe and Europe was not "precision" bombing of art and war production sites. Before the civilian target bomb attacks in Germany, the British who enthusiastically took "the area" - it was not even before the Germans targeted themselves in English. Americans bombarded day by day, more victims than British, victims of bomb attacks civilians in the night to achieve precision targets. Americans, basically, do not matter that Raf's true terrorist bomb attacks and is shouting against it. Most American officials of General Dalilit from FDR oppose citizens' targeting, though Churchill and his generals have not been able to wait this way. <br /> <br /> No, both Germany and British are dressed in Dresden, except the "bomb" Harris, a doctrine is innocent, it is pointed out, built by evil Americans. And the power and power of a story of love between a German nurse and a low British bomber pilot can only explain the "truth" of tyranny. OK. <br /> <br /> For the readers of the small and perhaps less good readers of IMDB, the way, the first and still to defend the Dresden bombings, the first literature effort was a pacifist novel, Kurt Vanguat - a American pound of Dresden at the time of the bombing. I think Germany's GDF is not finding a nice nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
