When I came to the whip this steaming pile was watching the science-channel channel. Although Wynorski's "Commodore Curse" is not as bad, it still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses "Commodore Curse" on the same island as well as the same actors and houses. The effect is suprising but it's about ........ I do not know what else to say about this movie ....... Oh yes! As "Commodore Curse", the government is involved and the island decides to drop the bomb! Also .... When I saw this part, I smiled fiercely ... a COMMONBERRA !!! (Part man, comodo and cobra!). Overall, the film is also crying even in the worst filmmakers. Remember that Jim Winerski has something to do with the movie .... refrain from falling asleep ... "It's almost done ... almost finished ...". 5 out 0
