My brother played "Mus" in this picture. Although most of his scenes left the cutting floor on the floor. The fun line is "nothing is in the stock." So anyway, this is portland, or where we grew up impressed. Dance Club / "up front fx" is called. What I liked about this movie is that the main character (not named in the box because Bolo brings more riot) is considered a police detective ... it is a great opportunity to roam a red transformable pouch. I have to get a copy of it, especially the director's cut, so I can see all the scenes of my brother. The scene he saw is the dance club at the beginning. He got the spot because he is dating Oregon Thunderbolt, a semi-pro football team cheerleader. It is interesting because its name comes as the first entrance to IMDB. There is fame, fate, so do not.
