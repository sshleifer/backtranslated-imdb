Revenge of Pinocchio is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, most of them were enjoyable above. <br /> <br /> Special effect is beautiful "B" and I said earlier that the doll was really burst. The best scene is a knife with the film ... It looks good, I think they spent a quarter of the budget of 1/3 ... and the shower scene ... wow ... I think they must have spent 2/3 percent of the budget to talk to any other actress. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, it was enough to see me at the end.
