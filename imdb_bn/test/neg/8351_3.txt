'Volcano' is considered to be one of the best B-movies, and the worst disaster that it should be portrayed. To be fair, you have no movie ready to suspend mistrust for a prime concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend science, people's interaction, and in general the suspense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is the sensitist head of the latest Stress of Emergency Management Office of 1990, and she is better equipped with scripts stuck with a fool conversation. However, Anne Hey is a smart ass donkey who gives an unusually bad performance as geological, which becomes the interest of rocker love (when the city is damaged). Goy Hoffman Jones leaves the Dreams and the American Presidency as a life-changing girl for the very poor, poor, and hunting. Don Cheadle is sitting in a really cooolool office and taking Jones's phone call, doing the job that should make Roark and work on the reality. However, when the movie really starts to diminish downhill, when Heche's Geology partner gets sucked into a lava vant while they're breaking the subway line. When Jones begins, the speed increases as they use buses to stream the lava flowing down the street, the heterogeneous geologic (who loves to talk about the science of astrology), which is hot in the air and it has many effects on the metal, and rock, and a dead bus melts Do not seem to be When the film spreads ethnic tensions like Rodney King, the police and the angry black man dressed up, who can not understand why the flow of fire is busy in the river's lava river. But hey, in the end, will have to work together to build K-rail dams to prevent three of them from eating around him, even though the dam is created in the wrong way, and the material used will not stop, though Lava. Alongside, k-rails are very waterproof, but I think Lava does not pull his head in the gap, while Tommy Lee Jones is not looking at it. Do not even start using the Strand-Subway-car, where the hot lava is coming down a perfume, but weirdly enough, it is not too hot to try, it is not very catchy, and there is no poisonous gas that everyone can breathe. This will be La Lava, or Lava Lights. You know, it eats car but echo friendly <br /> <br /> Here are just a few moments of camp that you think are comedy if you are often thinking about it. For example, Hironimus bush painting has complete meaningless and harmful conversations about two safety guard weight packing, and at the end, the little boy Roker / Jones does not remember that everyone looks the same as the cover. Rainstorms come out and dry up on top of each other - and then the sun comes out and he says something like "non, shix, rocker". <br /> <br /> 'Volcano' has achieved almost the status of battlefield, but no one other than hech brings bad things like Trivalta and the technical aspects are very well operated. If you are from the area of ​​El Arena, it is interesting to remove Wilhelm Boulevard's loyalty. I gave these three effects and a small amount of pressure to get from this.
