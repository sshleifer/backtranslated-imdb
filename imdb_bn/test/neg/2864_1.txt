Can this person be somewhat heartfelt? Qasimodo Habba Habba? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its offered a break-out role. There is no sign of his or her character's personality or self-esteem, his entire holiday has torn an intelligent boy who thinks he is the greatest person in the world (primarily he is an intelligent son), but he can not be honest with him for two seconds. For Woman, tell me something; If a person really is in you, he is not stuck in huff because you tried to pass your father as your boyfriend. Maybe he may be a little confusing why you are such a fool, transformed, and um ... offensive, but ultimately it's going to be something that you laugh together. <br /> <br /> Every cliche 'on the plot and dialogue quest hit right'. There is no originality and no intelligence ... but it's rilly, rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, rilly clever. So the spectators who think Titanic is the greatest movie of all time, certainly this movie is great because they will not notice that it does not have a brain in its head. One star
