How to throw a good actor and CGI in a movie is a 'major' example of a 'flood' which will not do a little to compensate a rubbish script. The basic premises are OK: If storm storms threaten to send directly to the Thames flood barriers and toss London so fast that most people probably will not have time to spend? It is primarily the afterlife of the New York Segment of the Day, but it will not reduce any film. However, the script is just not there. It's merely a functional, flat, and lack of depth. Great Britain's talents such as Robert Carlosle and David Sucheta, but the two have achieved their level of excellence, but their character is two-dimensional ciphers, something like the old Marvel comic. And it'd be incredibly easy to turn the tide back. Every actor does not stop hooking - Tom Court seems to be capable of only one passion throughout the film, but then he was not a lot of a challenge. <br /> <br /> I appreciate any chance to see something extra - Floyd for the Hollywood disaster change, and I do not expect the Jillian dollar spent for rendering ultra-realistic graphics. But there is no excuse for writing a ridiculous - especially from a country that has created a great science-imagination made by a budget. This kind of half-hearted B-grade Faffe ciphey channel generates and it is not just a target to target. If you like me still you are tempted to disaster movies such a fan, make yourself a favor and see it with some friends. Still good; Do not disturb.
