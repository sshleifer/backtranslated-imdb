Teaching is going to Tingle, I want to have a fun, enjoyable teen comedy which will give me the freedom to keep it running. Despite a good good half-hour time, the film quickly entertains as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers that subsides in a dull, clich√©d mess. Rusty pliers, that 'Scheme' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed the film and proved that the scrum was very good. Most of the material in this movie has already been seen ten times in another movie; And it was right to steal the elements of other schemes, because it is meant as a grassroots tribute; Here, it looks like he has completely surpassed the idea. This story follows the extreme girl in school, Katie Holus played. After being caught cheating with his two friends; Three teachers decide to take hostage in their own home. However, this is not a teacher; It's Mr Tingle, the middle bitch of the school. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, and the whole host of the previous movie. This is not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could capture the film with interesting characters; It could really work well. The character of Mrs. Tingle is one of the most interesting of the film, but it is very similar to one dimensional and other characters in the film. She is merely a joke. The role of acting title is Helen Miron, largely diabolical, without exception. When he did not have a lot of roles to correct the roles, and his teeth; He enjoys playing the central personality clearly. Teenage custom is not worth mentioning; Kitty Holes is standing alone; And that's not because of his star profile, his acting talent. Williamson's dull soft rock music has covered almost every scene, just as the film is not terrible, it would be really annoying. Actually, this film has a few moments that are rather good; But basically, if you want to see a good example of teen comedy - this is not a movie you want to see.
