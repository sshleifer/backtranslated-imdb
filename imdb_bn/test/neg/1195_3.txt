If the league unknows this script, then the backgrounds will easily rotate and say "no - you're not getting money - it's awful". As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, this is their most important date. Not particularly funny, not particularly entertaining, some laugh loudly. They exist, but they are between and far away. I'm feeling tired and really dragged. Photo letters BAD is the author and it shows. As a film being. I felt the Xmas specially advanced production value; Fxs are usually very poor and it is clearly clear that they did not play the original roston vasey (they portrayed it in cheapness in Ireland). Musical score is weak and dialogue is terrible. Also, the pronunciation of letters was originally closed to their TV equivalent. Tubs and Edward, many underused (again), just do not sound like their own. Really frustrating, because I had some hope for much more entertainment. This was the equivalent of the 1970s comedy league where Caste visited Spain ...
