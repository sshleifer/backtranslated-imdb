I thought "Making vicious phone cracks" was quite a bit, but I do not believe that Carlos Mensia's show also qualifies as a comedy. His main purpose is to make the viewers incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "Veenaar". I have never been forced to write a review before announcing some horror in IMDB, but I really hope this show will not be renewed again. <br /> <br /> Mensia is trying to be the next Dave Chapel, and perhaps he was hiring through the network because he hoped that he would fill shoes. It is clear that the rip of Chappell's role (Blues Boys vs. Mariachi Bands) is straight down. However, there is absolutely no attitude in Menyaia *, and it does not always appear in the popular view of vibrant vibrant culture to bring creative lips. Instead he makes a jittery nickname for a solid number of hard work for his fellow latinos and "joke" about immigration. Sometimes it will take advantage of the little dark skin to make someone else's fun, like everyone else in the middle of culture. These jokes mainly make themselves laugh at covering the style of viewers when it repeats every joke or stereotype made against culture and perhaps some incredible old issues (eg 9/11). I really think that anyone really is scared to insult, so it makes the audience feel awkward. He beats the death joke If you've ever seen "why f *** this news?" You know what I mean. It's fun initially, but he just became rumbles over and over and the Captain became clear at some point. <br /> <br /> This is a trainbroke which is painful to watch.
