Actually, I did not have high expectations for this film, but at the same time I was optimistic. It's being managed by Albert Pine - one of the more well-known B-movie Atoors - my expectations could not be fully raised. How much does Albert Pyun mean that highly high medal? Yes, right ... but still a decent throw in the movie is advertised. Rob Lowey, Bart Reynolds (Pre-Newborn Starodom), Ice T and Mario Van Paibles. <br /> <br /> This picture is so annoying and so slow that this power seems to move away from me and it's gone. It runs for more than 90 minutes, but it is a story that can be called 30-minute flat. I do not know Pine was going here. I think the film dribbles the style of Arts, but sometimes it's a scary and probably I'm stupid to expect more from this time around pien. Here it seems that there really is a potential great shield for a budget and element, but it wasted all. Crazy is not an action film, it's really nothing. <br /> <br /> I think the most tragic incident here is that I showed the last credit to the most entertaining part of this movie. Music scores are actually half decent with some smooth female voice, but the rest say a complete waste and less well. To avoid.
