This is a horror movie, and I'm not sure why it is so terrible. It's an ugly concept with the visual style of the 1970s, which may seem like a good idea at times, but it now enables one to recognize the movie at one time as the 70th product. The film holds stories and songs that have made such a version of the musical version, but the songs are languishing on the screen. But in most cases, the movie develops due to Lucile's bowling performance, which you think someone will be able to do something larger than this. She sleepwalks through the film like a horrible actress shining her emerging night, and the film sinks with her. Even BiaArthur, who I had tied up, was a friend of the best friend of friendship, this stinker could not breathe a life. <br /> <br /> <br/> Grade: D
