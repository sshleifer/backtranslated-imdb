When George Sluijer was told that he can handle the film "Spiralos", an American version of "Hit Gauden E" (outside Holland, the name of this film is "The Vanishing"), it was said that only if the finishing is changed - He is told that the 'American audience' will not endorse the original end. Of course, the real end is better, and beyond, the film loses its effect Because I have already put it in the triangle section, I do not end the original and do not keep my comment spell-free. If you want to know the end of the original, see "Spurlos" or read the book. This movie is completely rubbish, and I do not like the first caf√© Sauberland movie. Check out the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thriller movies in the world.
