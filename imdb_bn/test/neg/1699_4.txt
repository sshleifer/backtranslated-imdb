If you are the Catalan nationalist Anarcho socialist with extraordinary respect to the myths of the Spanish republic, this film may be for you. Two brothers, a real life (one of them was Mark Recharge), rebuilt a fictional version of a real life journey created by the fictional Catalan village and the history is released (bullets-wall panels on bullet-hole, booms on the artillery soundtrack) but not shown . There is very little dialogue and most of it is relevant: the story is called the third-party voice-over, the voice of the real brother's real sister, an actress's voice. There is a little with the story line of what the image has, which is not so much. Some of the amazing semi-dry mountains and rivers (Terrence Malik or Guss Van Sant think - there is nothing between "gerry" and "last day"), some of which are still stunning and still associated with images and motionless frames. . These are enjoyed in the fantastic natural sound environment of the best film and ultimately in addition to exhausting descriptions or even temporary background music (some pretty good, some rather strange, but not all). The best of what is said in this movie is, at times, at least at least the power plants and embankments are included in the comment. <br /> <br /> The relationship between brothers has left sketch and generic; A man-cut catfish, a major character, is ever shown. As much as the commitment to Catalan-nationalist Anjakko-director is given, the more movie-rich, vague messages are abolished and more intense the experience of atrocity. The director said at the NYFF screening that the film began with his third-story story, but I would like to see a version without a single version or music, and this is the only natural soundtrack and without minimum conversations. The results may be more mobile, and in any case it is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, this is the only movie you can see in a year when a guy enters a cloth object (he's bathing bath?) dangling from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole movie, which is prevalent by what's actually happening on your screen (sorry)? Why is it hanging there ?, however, as usual, no answers are provided. Very Warholian, very sixties, and a little tiring.
