Critics "is a movie that will break your heart" etc. So there was a lot of expectations for me and one of my friends with the decision to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it briefly to write about its content to others. This movie reaches your heart, trying to touch you. But it failed. At least for me And for my friend, <br /> <br /> <br /> What happened is only done on screen. It was always, not here, where I am. Most of the time I thought, "Hmm, something happens on the screen, but it's just on screen. This is not real." <br /> <br /> The movies that made me a lot better: the East of Eden (1955), Enerment terms (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Messe Vailla Menneisyytt√§ (2002)
