So I want to know about this movie about the beginning of independence from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Belgian regime. I was excited to know about the statistics related to history, mainly Lumuba and Matabutur. I wanted to see that the new Congo government tried to discuss various reasons for opposing colonial rule, the political objectives behind each, the reason behind Belgium's decision to grant the DRC independence and how the United States and the former US citizens were. Involved. Sadly, all my questions were largely inappropriate. I believe that this film was made by people who saw a story about the drama and emotions, and decided to use it, through contact with the story of the DRC war for independence. Then they tried to try and stuff all the dramatic things in a storyline, briefly filling them through their dialogue, shot them in the set. I could have been wrong, but if so, the cause of all sorrow, because the makers were very involved in achieving everything, and endeavored to focus on all the details of efforts to create a detailed history. Whatever the reason, the sentence statement and the timeline of information printed on the film screen can be. The film goes through every major event, and its main idea of ​​what is happening is point-blank to the viewer, making real details completely smooth when it comes to big things. For example, there is a scene seen by Lumbuva being captured by a growing rebel army controlled by Mumbutura. The soldiers have three possible attitudes in situations: the person who is sympathetic with Lumbubba, one who distorts Lumba, and standing in the middle, sympathetic and still obey the order. In view, there are three visible soldiers who are talking about this scene, which show their views in their absurd way. Then, to deal with the real excitement that these disagreements bring, the authors only add some random shoots, more army forces see, and they all become frustrated. The reflection level of this movie. Most of the time, each character simply describes their basic motives, the other characters react with them, and that There is little to say through action; Even what they say also indicates painful aspects. It is hard to believe that people actually acted like this. Also, in this perception trend, things like political pressure in the community have diminished in recognition of the truth - we know nothing about these groups, what they are fighting for, their power, how they exist, and how they exist. Similar characters are one dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I do not know whether Lumba was actually a freedom fighter for the ideology of Congo Unity, but after an hour or more, I certainly would not believe me to say it. Like many developing countries, the DRC is a complex and important history, especially after independence and later. But if the history of these history is not recognized in the complexity then it will not be implemented. Lumbumaa fails to give proper attention to these details and ends the audience without saying the most common in the world outside.
