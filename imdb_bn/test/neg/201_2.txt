The 90-minute complete waste despite the list of movies, B, C, and D list celebrities. The plot, with its few peaks, was very expected. It was so stupid that I can not believe I took the time to write a review of it too. Felix has gained the ability to work on behalf of his achievements since acting for Michael Jackson some years ago for television movies. On the other hand, Tanji was a bit more gifted in the role of Felicity as a fiddle in the previous year, she was back in the role. When I was sitting on the scene of this movie's debris, with the sound of its awful production and horrible sound, I felt the words of these four letters that I was able to think about this picture. However, to try to write my writing G Right, I would just say that this image is another four letters starting with an alphabet!
