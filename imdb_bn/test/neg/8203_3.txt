A group of seven people fear that they are the only survivors in the world near the end of the bomb blast. They simply do not fear radiation, as well as the surrounding mountains, the mutants fear them. One of the groups is already contaminated, but oddly poses no threat to others.

Lori Nelson is determined to start a brave new world population. Director Roger Corman's best one. This prediction is black and white sci-fi.
