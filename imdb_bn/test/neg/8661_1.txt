As a dramatic fan of almost any time and that huge Jane Austen fan, I was scared by this adaptation. As a supporter of the 1999 edition of Mansfield Park, I was continuously comparing two and it became too small. It felt very slow and very one-dimensional so that it quickly became annoying. Especially in relation to Fannie and Edmund, and in spite of being in a beautiful position, does not seem to be in the absence of a relationship with the little atmosphere. After Christmas, after looking at Jane Austen Season, I stopped it after an hour and slept. I would be interested in Persuasion and Northanger Abbey's orientation, in which I do not have a customized version, see if they can still handle me in such a way.
