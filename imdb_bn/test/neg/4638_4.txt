In the First World War, a shiny, sepia-tinted makeover was found in the continuous curiosity "A very long engagement" by Jean-Pierre Juntet. Junkett's trademark style has a narrative composition similar to mechanical, almost clock-like style, which is equipped with a large amount of chocolate box production value and a faux-laughing laugh. This is a method that worked well with his earlier pictures, romantic fantasy "Amelie", thanks to Audrey Tattoos for his outstanding contribution to the title role. Junet's method has been reverted even worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " A man who was silent with his aunt and uncle, in a small rural environment, which became his childhood sweetheart (Gaspard Eulle), a few years after he lost his battle. Manch was one of five commanders for self-mutilation in 'Birgo Krepskul' in 1917 and he punished him as the highest punishment. Everyone thinks of the death of Mathilde, but he hopes to find him. In order to discover what actually happened, this picture follows the fascinating investigation of Mathilde, and as soon as she is confused, she unveils the sad and even frustrating stories of the rising rising corruption and inhumanity. Matilda must filter the facts from the predictions that are derived from various contradictions, overlapping or incomplete accounts, considered Manik's final hour. <br /> <br /> It should be all shocking and chic, but it is often confusing. The visual and visual clutter with which the binomline pummels its audience. With an intruder description that does not add anything to our gratitude to the story and the characters, it is very easy at any time. Without a moment's interruption of information, I denied the place to reflect the mathild or reflect the reflection of the house to attach it to my own post. Junkett's obscurely busy camera spiral and holes and circles decorate each of its beautifully designed products, but it fails to enter the soul under the story's skin alone. The results are deeply uninvolving, and bad, surprise. World War I was especially dark in human history. Imagine it is rebuilt as one of those great advertisements for a well-known Belgian laser and you have the measure of this movie.
