I've rated this movie 1/10 and have done it in good nature. This movie does not seem to be and I did not get the point. For example, take the first joke. The beginning of their sign that at the beginning. All right, but then they start talking to some people about the hood, and then they die, the people who speak after him die, after talking to other people, people do not die, they come to their birth with death. And he now gets a cake. Then he died. <br /> <br /> Jokes are just stupid, they are smart and I thought they would be better than someone like a horror film director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < sucked and I want to make another comedy next time they do, they do not cripple anything good joke.
