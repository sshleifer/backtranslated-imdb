In the 70's, suspects were "TV to create" horror. This week was one of those who was probably murned as an ABC movie. This is an old story of a concept of new homeowners and / or ghosts. The movie has the promise, but it is not realized. Everything is rushed too much. Need to build and grow tension and mystery. And nothing new. One final thought: I do not understand why Robert Wagner's character would fall for a long film star when he married Kate Jackson for marrying! !!
