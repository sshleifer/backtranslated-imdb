I bought this movie for K-Mar 99cents a few years ago (along with "Hawkins Bread") and Gabriel Byron and Amanda Donoho must find something valuable. It was not. The "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought it) was a little cut on "Hawkins Bread" (2.4 MBBD rate), but not enough to allow me to stay at home. I threw both movies in the trash <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I love Bayern as an actor, but this scholar really feels bad about his resume.
