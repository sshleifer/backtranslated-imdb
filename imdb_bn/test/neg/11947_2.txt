How bad was the idea of ​​rebuilding an Oscar-worthy movie? MOSTHLY MARTHA is much better, depth, finesse and so and primarily a great and gifted actress's leading role (Martin Gedeck). It's a joke with handsome Harun and the whole atmosphere and ugly ... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are many more remakes and movies are full of schemes. .. Anyone can not make better and new scripts there? Or is it a well-tried cartoon image to create a remake or a movie-maker's security solution? The movie is going to be much less attractive this time nowadays. Oh yeah: If you really want to see a good movie then see the original. It is of course valuable.
