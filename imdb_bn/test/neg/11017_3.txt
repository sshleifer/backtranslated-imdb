I really wanted to like this picture, but a few minutes after a fun opening, I rarely smile. I had no other chemistry between both Leads and the other letters were ridden cliche. This script completely breaks the talents of Bid Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> It must be said that there was a lot of laughter around me and even at the end there was a rage of ridicule. Perhaps I just can not relate to it enough. I just glad went to the cheap tickets.
