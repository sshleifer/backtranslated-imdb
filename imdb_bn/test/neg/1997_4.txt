My guess is that these low budget spaces / horror film producers wanted a serious movie, but the director set a parody of his heart. So ... this is what we get. Set aside an abandoned spaceship 1000 years and peopled with characters and props just out of 90's. Some industrial complex sets, perhaps an oil tanker, whatever. The controls contain rack of old TV equipment so they use AS. A position of course is a water cooler game with staff's lunchtime and an old TV and VCR as well as plastic dermis. Tiny Litter and Coolio arguing across the story, get the best line. The dialog has been packed with conditions that still seem to be a pretty date ("non-okay, daddy-o") but at the very opposite of the 30th century? When the captain announced the goods of the ship, there was a load of coffins from "Translivenya Station", which you know it is all a pot-on. It's a bit of alien, part JasonX, shameless rip off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. At one point, the Caspar Vandiene even said "to straighten" his pilot. If this picture was good, then they all just kept screaming but they were trying to make the story serious. Perhaps those people were on that set. However, if you are not very picky, then do not be a bad annoying killer. Set FX as bad as well.
