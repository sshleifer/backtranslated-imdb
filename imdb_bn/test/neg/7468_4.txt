I watched her world premiere at Grand Ecole at Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was writing and if I had any idea then I did not enter. It's the longest time I've seen the most provocative movies. It's exciting, yet deep, tries with her full-fledged lesbian sex scene - it does not succeed! It's nothing but a bad excuse to show nude people on the big screen. 4/10
