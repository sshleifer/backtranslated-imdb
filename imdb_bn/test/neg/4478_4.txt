When I went to the theater I had high hopes - the trailer saw I was hyped as the next person to participate in the participation of great talent in making a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> However, it is frustrated to see the genre ruining the talent - the words are shiny and chessy, perhaps it was composed with a more western theme. I would not be hard to imagine the same tunes with French or English songs. In Mandarin, they just make strange words. <br /> <br /> The musicals were also poorly planted together - can be very quick, and the performer shots were very long lasting. <br /> <br /> Special effects next frustration. Not saying, special effects begin and it closes where it is very clear. <br /> <br /> It is not Moulin Rouge and it does not mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) slow Waltz theme. Together, and tell a simple story hour is too long.
