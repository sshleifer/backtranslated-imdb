I have completely forgotten that I want to see it in a few days, which is quite a publisher among myself. Geron's Phantom of Opera 'Xerx version of the Locked-Do country-house mystery of Loreaux, I've heard that it's a compelling and surprising update. So it appears in the title sequence of the choice and from some obvious touch in the opening scene, but the film quickly stops and becomes unusually tedious and completely unhappy. <br /> <br /> The main problem as a mystery is that it is considered fundamentally inadequate to the viewers: like the worst agate Christians, it depends on a character contained in the final law, which is a wealth of background information that we were not seized. As a movie, it can be a comedy or thriller, the important problem is that the characterization almost exists. In addition to the exception of the murderer, the face of the common suspects in every common country-house murder case - reporter, endangered heir, suspicious drunk, father of skaterbred scientist (an amazingly poor Michelle Launndell) etc. Depth and interest little, and does not help frequently over-rigid or misjudged performance. You undoubtedly keep an eye on anyone, so there is no danger or doubt. There is only something available to work with Cloud Ritch and the Last Roll, Pierre Order, and only at the end, this film approaches the feeling of resonance which is very painful to be very effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, we can get an endless exposure and some of the void comic pieces (committed to a photographer stuck in a grandfather's watch are considered to be very bad), Dennis Padlades reduce with Irving Interpretation for the last third of the pictures. I do not like country-style movies or Agatha Christie's style ladies, so who can stop it more slowly, but I saw it a poor show. When the mystery is revealed to mystery, "it is everything rather than despair."
