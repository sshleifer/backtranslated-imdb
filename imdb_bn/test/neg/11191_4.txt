Some pictures that you will see because they challenge you to touch your soul or to grow. <br /> <br /> Some will see you because you want to express adventure or shock outside of your experience; These will not feed you directly, but otherwise it will help to stabilize yourself in the larger world. And finally, the tough parts of life that you do not like to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are some movies that are not even in these things, you will see the liability, or you have a need for historical context. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because you believe people, but the film is so personal because of a life, you do not really know until you go blind in darkness. <br /> <br /> For me, it was quite worthless. Yes, yes, I know that many bunnies are glorious and rich. And you should know (if you do not) that some of my best movie experiences are very weird films, really very strange. <br /> <br /> It's not a cinema, it's not symbolic deep, or I think that's frankly / politically friendly. How it gets there that goes off the base <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the explanation is not only widely accepted, but only coded in shortend. Certainly this is all true. <br /> <br /> When the word "surreal" is used, it is generally used incorrectly as a film image or a world that is different from reality or thinks strange. But when it is used properly, according to the consensus theory, it always rotates through the vultures, and in particular this film and it really happens with the bridegroom. So they discover miracle movies, they define and control the word. That itself casts me, and does not come from their philosophy which has my own options definition. <br /> <br /> This is a complete opposite of the view. It is not a philosophy, refusal of an anti-order but a view at all. His packaged anarchy, carefully uses those which they use and warns them to oppose them. <br /> <br /> It's OK: Deliberate love against racism, history, against history, against religion (a simple). But for the linear story of an alien, for establishing its own history (countless films are celebrated by the school professor; what else can they do?); For an extraordinary "casual" love. <br /> <br /> This is its own enemy. If Bunuwel lives today, he sells his picture, the first thing he can do is to either church or spiritual attack. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that almost everything is cinematic, I avoid Spanish and French. But in a strange way, I want to consider the opposite: Your spirituality comes from issuing alfred, not wool. <br /> <br /> Assessment of TED - 2 of 3: contains some interesting elements.
