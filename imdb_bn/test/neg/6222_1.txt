I do not know where most of you were, but where I saw this movie, some did not say that some people said that they told their experiences, we laugh people, most campsite plot lines, awesome dance sequences and singing like brochures. The only people in the audience who were fascinated with the film were seventeen generations of people who gave the song the past with comfort. I was DJ at the age of seventeen and even went to the ABBA concert in Northernlands Collegium in Edmonton on September 79, so I appreciated them and I still do that. But this picture should have ended in marriage with their marriage. The sequences were so bad, dubbing and editing were utterly terrible and it would be Merrill's worst production. I can not believe that winner of the academy prize will be very less stoop as this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for the DVD to come out, and then spend your money better like cottage litter.
