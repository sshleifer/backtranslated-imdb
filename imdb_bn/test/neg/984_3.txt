I think it would be great if you get some 'snap preview' before buying any of the old movies that are re-published DVDs. In this way you can save yourself some time, money and certain agro when you breathe so much. <br /> <br /> "Body Holly Story" is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be characteristic of this character, or the plot of the plot, or do not want to bark with the historical events of this movie, because I was already talking to them 20 years ago, when I first saw it Got started <br /> <br /> I recorded it in the old (Manoural) beta machine in the early 1980's and it liked it, it became a regular-acting favorite. The best part of my mind, playing Gary Bushy as a young body and playing her perfect perfect voice and guitar. <br /> <br /> I was looking at that day when I could get it ... stero ..., and wherever there was frustration. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is rehearsed in both the audio and video formats according to the shell information (Android), but I am afraid to leave my sadness in sadness and look at my watch, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My old beta tape voice! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of a picture, plot or character, the original figure card is the music here ... and if you do not hear the main voice, then sinking with symbol, or backing harmonies, or other ambients Is there a lot left, then? <br /> <br /> I'm going to convert my old beta version (mono) to the next view, and where it belongs, keep it in there with garbage! <br /> <br /> "The extinction rules are, of course, exceptions ..."
