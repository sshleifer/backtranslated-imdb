If Andrea Tarakovsky had been hacked, then he instead changed the mirror to the mother and the son. This solo induced film, created anywhere in the world, I'm convinced. A boy without a name, without a name, takes care of his mother. They love each other, I guess. No, they are not, I'm sure. This is not the character. They are not even the actors playing characters. At least it can be nice, but Macintosh of Nature is ridiculously touched and changed wherever needed. And could Sokurov come up with a tactic as a distorted aspect as a hackneyed ration? You have to be born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10
