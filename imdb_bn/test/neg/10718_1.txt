If I had this rating I would give this a zero. The fun was all fun. I got tired of the movie in ten minutes but eventually endured it, I think it would be better - it's not. I saw this movie agree with others. The acting was annoying. I'm tired of jam kerry acting top ham Supporting cast was no good. Although the film was a statement of corporate greed and the labor crisis of the workers when it went under a big company, it was suppressed, but the cars were better served. I really liked the leading characters (Dick and Jane) that their antics were fun but not kind. I am trying to remember a scene where neither I nor I could smile and laugh. A waste movie and time total waste.
