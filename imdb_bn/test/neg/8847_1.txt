I do not fall asleep during a movie. Ever. This movie was impossible. <br /> <br /> Although many claiming the superiority of Japanese horror films on their American opponents, this film was a great text. For example, the film was more than 30 minutes. Plot and camera work would have been helpful if the movie was a little more speedy, but instead, what we got was stagnant silence and very slow speed. Acting was absolutely terrible, bad students were on the border with film level, when everyone struggled to exchange something called script. Did these people even get any direction? They were coaxed to be boring and dull? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, both ways, they All stunk Do not see these pictures. That's what I can say (unless you are an insominium).
