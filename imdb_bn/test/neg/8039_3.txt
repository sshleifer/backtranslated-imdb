The Great War broke down and Daddy was a brave pilot who went on to run some extraordinary business to keep Jerry in her place. Mummy is doing her bit as a nurse, so the children of five children are evacuated from their barmy uncle, where a secret passage starts a wicked sand elf and a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written about a century ago, they do not have stories like this anymore. And there is a reason. People fly in planes and writers books; Women change the bandage and clean house. The guys led the way with their compass and nightly furloughs; The girls are called what they are and Violin play - badly. Fat kids who wear glasses are nasty. All children speak in clipped, vocal accented accents, which develops Soci and primary but some specific economic classes of English. On top of Imperial Albion's Snobberries and Desires, a five-year-old plot will not tolerate a hole. I mean, in a literal sense - my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset, why suddenly the compass did not come down from his hand. The film attempts to strictly target children, until Eddie Ejjard (a genuine comic talent deserves) is a complete inappropriate and unreasonable unity on the final credits. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that five percent of UK's expensive public schools in which British schoolchids find it all wheeze such a cinnamon. Not good news for 95 percent of British households living in the 19th century, Wall-E, Rattatuil, and Wallace and Groot have all come out of the DVD.
