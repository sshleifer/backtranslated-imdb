I saw this picture with some friends that I had to see but from the beginning I knew it was getting worse. So I can give this movie 1 because the effects used were very poorly used and thought that no one can see that there is no "real" ghost. I think the worst part is that this so-called "old spooky house" has a whole group of new items and some "firmly held items". I could think of the effects that looked much better than a chair surpassing a chair. Scratch (or I would say cable). Then when they review the chair tape, then it flip separately. Oh oh is a big continuation error that If this is a really good movie then they could catch all the "old house" items. This film is like moving in the Hunted Mountains and the Blair Witch project has become a bad idea and integrated film. I'm going to be ashamed of how convenient the camera is when it's bad for girls' breasts, effects and cheaper video shots and a little "unusual". This movie is actually the people's objection to finding ghosts and finding true ghost footage on the tape.
