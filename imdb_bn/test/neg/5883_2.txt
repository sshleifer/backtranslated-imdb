Andy Dick, I do not believe I was expecting this to be sunny and it was the best, the only funny character. Most of the curiosity and amusement and writing were very frightening, I mean that it is supposed to be like Blacksplight, but it works. This whole genre has already been subjected to death, with all the modern power films and secret brothers, it seems old, it was only secretive (who was not violent but rather much fun)). Also, the fragrance for a comedy / action movie was fragrance. I do not know what I'm going to get released on the theater, but it is definatley made for TV.
