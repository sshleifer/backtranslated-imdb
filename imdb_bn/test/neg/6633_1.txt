Bad movie! Bad! Go to stand a discount bin. The top of the carrots should really stick to a less lit comedy club. This is a movie that looks like John Agar, like the old Jerry Lewis films Shakespeare and John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a fine talent) is absolutely wasted Its purpose seems to be mainly beautiful and unconscious appearance. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable thing in the movie is Rackel Welchick's role as Alexis Carrington, and as Esther Harris as a Landlady Harrien. The only way I can imagine that anyone can think of it (outside this movie), if the producers are allowed to choose the fourth grade child script, it is a good idea. Well, maybe his third grade. This picture is actually how it needs to be tied in the nose of its creators.
