Wow, this episode did not start at the STOOOOOPID premises! When suddenly the enterprise suddenly, Abraham Lincoln's space is almost floating and welcomes the enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really long-brained idea? Lincoln comes next and they welcome them. Abe suggested that they beam down some barbarians, suggesting where they meet the famous dead people both good and evil. It seems that really a lovely rock demon demon and a group of people of the evil mobilized it to fight it for the Almighty. The whole thing seems to be really bad and unselfishly inappropriate, because the good side is bound to the surac - Vault, who thinks Gandhi is Rambo !! Despite the complete consistency of the complete, the action is quite good and it's great to see the quirky overhead shots in this annoying match. However, do not make this mistake for high industrial or deep sci-fi. The lower line was like the last leg of the series on the first leg of the series and it really looked that they had closed this Turkish and it impressed the irrespective of the premises.
