After watching it for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. A clich√© film with a stupid setup. I'm a big fan of thief film, but it does not provide a new smart or special thing. It's bad about an inner inside because "hot head bad guys" make a left shot, and of course "good-bad man" goes on a moral tour. Why is it stupid and not trustworthy? When you have already gone so far to kill a left, why do not you kill one guy that stands between and 43 million. They take 45 minutes to draw money and there is no robbery there. Okay, do not hesitate to shoot "Mr Goodie" and in this case he is such a guy whom he has known for a few days .... everything and I was frustrated it was a quick progress from the middle, but I duked it and the boy it is I'm sorry
