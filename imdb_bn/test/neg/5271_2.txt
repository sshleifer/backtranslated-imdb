All right, many critics have indicated - this is a simple tie in the story of Martin Cahill - the first is BBC and John Burman's film "The General" - which is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was completely wasted. Characters were C ** P! And as Kevin Speacy - did not come across as a loving rogue but really nothing as real or significant. <br /> <br /> There is not much to break this image. Gags and tricks hijacked best bits from other films. Compare this photo note and "General" - I'm interested in seeing what others want to think about. <br /> <br />
