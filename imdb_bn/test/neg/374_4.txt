Although the story is good and illustrates that I had hoped for Sam Eliot, my DVD copy included almost unbearable synchronization problems. There was a dialogue about 3 seconds of lip movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would be very careful to buy a DVD of the film without checking for this problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll follow the recommended sensor categories specifically related to language and drug usage. <br /> <br /> This image can be a silent classic cop movie and with the above alert notes I can recommend it to the potential audience
