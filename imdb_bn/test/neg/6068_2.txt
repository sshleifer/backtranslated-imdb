I was really looking forward to a movie, I was very disappointed. I did not look forward to waiting for Amadeus to be one of the most important images, but last year, Bethovevan's more prominent screenplay was expected. <br /> <br /> The role of Ed Harris was extraordinary, but the story line was so weak that this picture was easily removed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I felt very unhappy and still feel That was not a bit important at all.
