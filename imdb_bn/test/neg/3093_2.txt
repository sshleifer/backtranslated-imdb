I was suckered by the big name. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Paibel, Bart Reynolds, and this is an independent film. Start incredibly slowly: 35 minutes, two Darya songs and a botched rip off. I do not care about letters, and the plot never tempted me to tempt me even tempted it could be realistic. I do not believe what it does on this screen. I love seeing this picture because it was good after it ended.
