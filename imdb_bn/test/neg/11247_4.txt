The first image was quite lip and was a lovely moment, this film is not exactly the same value. Kelvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to continue his barbershop, but it is not just a beauty shop next to Stylist Gina (Queen Latif), but shortly there is a big dance chain opened by Nappy Katz on the street. With the help of fellow colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainment), Jimmy (San Patrick Thomas), Terry (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Trey Garry), Calvin is doing everything he can to get regular customers and ultimately running business against their competition. Mickey Allie plays Ricky Nash, Leander Arl Hawawe's Dinco, Harry Lennick, Quinnin Leroches, Robert Wisdom as Albertman Brown, Jennifer Jujin Lewis, Kenan Thompson Kernard and Bed Company's Gracele Buevies-Nilon as Loretta. Because of the unnecessary flashbacks of Eddie, I do not like this picture as much earlier, and it's not surprising, I just got annoyed with it. OK!
