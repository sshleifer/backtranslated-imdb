Roger Krrn has spread over more than 300 films, enjoying the share of cinematic notions in his remarkable low budget career. Some (if any) call him a great, his films make sure that he has a great heritage of obscure connections through underground culture (through references, reverence, or influence). Throughout his career, he also created bad habits of his own pictures ("Piran", "Hymnids the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.), without their slightest improvement. "Jr. Andrews" (Jim Wenrowski, my favorite cinematic plea, the man behind the "shopping mall") "Raptor", "written" and "guided"), "Kornsaura" trilogy in the mid-90s with the annoying new tendency. . <br /> <br /> Winroski's credits are in quote because "Raptor" is not respect for "Karnesaur" films, nor even a reconstruction. "Carnosaur" movie of the film "Rapper", or at least the film's death dances inspired by the dinosaurs, is divided into separate traces of the original plot and some new shot scenes (many of which are "Dino's Eyes View" shots, inserted scenes look less obvious) . The "new" stuff is written around the footage, rather than the opposite, and is completely ineffective with a reasonable gap (for example two separate teams sent in the military, so that the parts were sent from footage 2 and 3, where soldiers could be included in different uniforms) , Which is already surprising considering some of the "Karnsaur" movies,The lack of actors in any of their characters (though honesty, the character of a character is only presented once in the script, probably twice), it remembers the lot of wood acting in the 1950s B-movies and it certainly does not do anything observers value ripped off in the attack scene. The new scene is more embarrassing for actors when there is a clear isolation between the new actors and the physical creation of the actors. The only picture to express any reaction to the film is the oldest strategy in the horror book, "Spring-loaded animals", some of the serious mistakes. It stands, it's a disgraceful practice, two B-grade statistics (which do not have to worry about destroying their reputation, because none of them have been found) they snatch their own elements, the cheapest and fastest For dirty tricks, because they can do it (why would anyone else feel that a series of "Jurassic Park" series meant to be closed off?). After seeing this picture, I can not say more than carrying my highest recommendations; The only good thing about this (apart from Melissa Brasel's Navy Watch), I do not have to see any of the "Kansas" films.
