Think of 'skinned' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea of ​​this picture. A very furry story with mid-impact and an anti-climax opens the door for part 2. I hope someone has the meaning of spending their money expensive. I recommend a 'Charmed - Cinema' because this 'Charmed' kick is more than a donkey and I only saw the show that please my lover !!!! Do not wait and watch a DVD on Sunday when you do something good. Or download it better so that you do not waste your money. The first 15 minutes was right. But the film's most fun line and the only brightness of this movie is when Reid says: "Kiss my ass Harry Potter", while driving a steep vehicle. Although they are not good enough to kiss Potter's ass, because Potters are fantastic and at least have stories in his movies. The fire of the fire was even worse !!!
