I've heard a lot about the film's innovative camera-work and direction. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> Some really terrible acting. The main heroine in the film is 'boring out of belief' and absolutely nothing is worthwhile to contribute in any situation. What he does or says is stupid, and he usually seems to live in a mess. If he can fight, I can forgive him <br /> <br /> Overall, all women in this film are 'wide' in need of a man to save them. And all the people in this movie do not bind the muscles, no one is able to save <br /> <br /> This is a poor movie, and I request you to avoid. Instead of seeing something like 'hate swords', I hear it a lot better than this confusing mess in a film.
