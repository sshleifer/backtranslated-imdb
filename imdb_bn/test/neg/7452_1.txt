I've seen this movie several times, it's definitely one of the cheapest activities in the eighties. So, I think many visitors will change this channel whenever the channel changes. But, if you are in a trash, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (McNamara Twin) are playing fantastic bargains and they look ridiculous at their disguise dresses. When one of the best scenes shot his legs and kicked his enemy down in the air. This movie is really awful, but then again, it taps a great team!
