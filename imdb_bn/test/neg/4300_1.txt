How nice. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We started a tradition. We received a copy of this movie, and we simply passed it from person to person. Everyone sees the movie, and then it is considered worthy to see this unique, creative, horror movie. I hope it will travel around the world. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful It's even worse than the funny. Well, that's funny, sometimes it's fun. But most of the time it thinks that something inside your brain is being covered. <br /> <br /> Wow. See it, then pass it.
