I have read 28 recent comments by various people related to this movie and I am surprised that the first time a person on the bed with "unlucky eyes" removes the camera from his face and remains away from his mouth, blinks! Yes, BLINKS! It came in HBO last weekend and I saw it when I saw it, I literally wanted to start it once in a while, once I noticed that I could not see anything! Of course, there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands, but the film was hard to accept. Very disappointing and because it first pulls away from the body / face because the first camera mostly blinks because the first victim blinks a foam. very bad.
