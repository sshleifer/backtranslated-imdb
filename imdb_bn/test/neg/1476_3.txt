The idea of ​​this film is unique, but his death sentence is less than special. When I reached the film and realized that there were only 15 people in the crowd, I thought I was wrong. However, the real mistake suddenly came to an end when the film ended and I knew that I had lost two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The film has 1 rating out of ten, without the old man's cruel recording and stupid funny friends. <br /> <br /> This picture is special, especially because it is probably the greatest movie ever released to the public. <br /> <br /> If you could call it an advertisement for a movie or perhaps a sloppy "north-west", its subject matter. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie for this plot, then humorous, filing, position, and then not. On the other hand if you want to get both end-to-end experience in the film production spectrator, just pick a book, or a small game or just an innovation item.
