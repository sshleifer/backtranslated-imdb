If you are an intelligent person and you have seen movies before, you can not bear this statue for more than 20 minutes. And if you are there then it will not be because you expect Akshay or Parameshara (please do not give Govinda!) But you feel your money is very valuable and you at least plunder a small nip money to plaster multiplex plus they loot you Did! It is very hard to believe that the director of a religious film like Harfiri can read us at this level. All right, he is repetitive, but now he is coming out of the third rate and is hoping he will bring Parash Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, sir. It's not going to work now. Especially with this stupid script! Even comedy movies can have meaningful scripts (who are Lana Rana Munnabai?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not comment for too much. Akshay Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal had leaked some bad jokes. Lara Dutta had the real chance to perform this role, but he sadly failed ... the only high point of the film (probably) is tansri's acting! But she's only for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie is more valuable ... (probably not even this!). So the ultimate warning - do not watch it!
