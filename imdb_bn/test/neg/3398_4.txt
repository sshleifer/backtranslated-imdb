The horror movie icon of Spain is unlikely Paul Nathie gives his talent to this genius without having a scratcher of the film. An action flick begins to end in a horror story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A diamond from a Belgian businessman switches a cache. When the deal is complete, the diamond attraction is very tempting to dismiss Paul, so he kills his Japanese group. His friend, whose brother Paul killed, pledged to take revenge and pushed Paul through the jungle, shot him dead and left for death. However, Paul was found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought his estate to recover. <br /> <br /> Estates, two daughters, Sylvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernández, determined not to lose the sweet and early Azucena with busty Sylvia Aguilar, fighting for Paul in his weak condition. But for Mr. Nasa, things got hairy, who started looking at the land port to see the girl's long dead earthquake. Japanese was happy to see the act of killing Paul with grass and he was pulled from both sides. <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (The story gets many ways and is not completely satisfied.) The script of the girls struggles for Paul but Silvia, whose character seems strong and emerging, Paul Naschy sweepstakes without simply putting a fight in Azulena Let's win in. Personally, I want to ask ghostly apparition for revenge for the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> Vollenses: $$$ (You're a gunfighter, a dazzling child and drying Eat to eat some poor schmuck. This will not leave gore hounds with naschy flicks.) <br /> Activating: $$$ (Paul Nassi, always funny, but he was too much time in bed while recovering from his wound He also plays again with the happy Sylvia Aguilera and the beautiful Azusena Hernández, who together with Mr. Nashey, in the little jewel "The Crowned", both girls work well. Nudity: $$$ (You get very short glimpses in both Aguilar and Hernandez but they are strategically placed, keeping nothing covered in bits. The complete nudity is provided by two less interesting actresses: Paul and Chasing African maid who works for Sylvia and Auscun ).
