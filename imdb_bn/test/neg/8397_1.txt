How did you give me this 2 big 2 stars to surprise me I created an account on IMDB to comment on this CR @P film. The acting is C @P and Plot CR @ p. It will not be worth a star if it is not for the soundtrack of the reproduction (and still there are some shocking cluning tracks, especially the black and white cartoon comedy background music and the way they fit the intended mood intended for hunt) and quality cinematography Dialogues and plots like Dr. Suce Book are almost complex. This actor is awesome I'm actually watching this movie and with every word, I swallowed this skirt. There was no reason to stop the movie because I could create an account on IMDB and post this review. I dig the mainstream film, I dig out stupid stupid movies, I dig out the reverse Indie films, and often play any other kind / continuously. My brother is convinced to hire me because he said he heard that it was good and he usually got great taste in the movies; From the moment he told me the title that I was crazy. Just talk about me because I'm a tough time in this annoying end is very evil. The only way I can make the best rating here is to give you high ratings in this movie. It is such a bad job and dramatic, art, complex, well-written, well-forwarded, even portable. If my hard directory is the final product of work, then I would be embarrassed to publish it to the public, so if I read this, I'm not even sorry for the manager - do you think the man?
