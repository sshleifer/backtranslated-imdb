The first time when this storyline is performed? It should be after the first movie because Kujko knows that Pacha and Chika are their third child, but it can not happen after the second movie, because Cranke will not get any girlfriend or wife or something? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> The whole plot of the show Kujko is going to school so that she can be emperor. But he was not this emperor before? And who is the emperor when he is emperor? Do not have to be Yzma? Or was this time line ejama fired already? And if it is true, then should you wait for it? Also, you know in the first movie that he was trained from birth and became an emperor by personal trainer. So he'll definitely know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is Crank student? About 25 years old they said in the first movie. She is going to an adult high school. Everyone thinks he is dead? I really like Kunk but I think his age and because everyone knows that he is working for the dignitaries, he should have been a teacher. Being a EC teacher in the house, his lane will be okay. <br /> <br /> Malina is very unlikely. He was supposed to be the love interest / moral compass of Kujko. But in many cases, he comes off vomiting and knows it all. I generally think that "I should be proud because I think I'm pretty and smart". <br /> <br /> She has her ESP in Kajok and whenever she is suffering, when she is cheating, or sings Hot Hot hottie on her head, she knows even though she is happy, she keeps the school newspaper and her class all straight + A. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her finesses to do the right thing for her ugly and to do good work at school while dating her. Actually, he seems to be more native than Kujko, then love interest. <br /> <br /> Ijma. I tried to buy Eugma Kujko before I failed, so she became emperor. That's not how it is being fired and working with all. Feeling reliving the first movie of every episode of Yzma. He turns out that almost every show he turns to Kuzco in an animal he hopes to fail to fail in a class. (3 times that I can not imagine that can not happen.) As a jokes movie about Ijma's age, they are not as tricky as to hear. And the classic joke about Yzma was used to see death ("level, crank!", Roller coaster, and lab). <br /> <br /> Also, there are some insightful things in this series. At any time when everyone is hired, everybody can do the job like this appointment or fail in the class, but he seems to have passed each assignment he gives to him. So why do one job so much? <br /> <br /> Who is reigning if this is going on? Do they have a consul or a steward? You do not see anybody governing the state until you have not regained his power or the Ijma Emperor. <br /> <br /> Why is Kujko a common farmer going to school? How should he lead the country, what to do in war or learn something that will be useful for him in the future? I could take some normal classes like farming (so he knows how to prepare the country for the famine) but tie the knot? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , Then they will have more fun things there. All the fun things about the show have already been done in the movie. Also, if they see some of these huge plot holes, why do not they like to have fun in the movie? (For example, when Ezma and Crank Kujko and Pacha and Ijma and Gopak reached the secret lab before they could not explain how they understood the first one.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points in the first movie of the series, See some letters like monkey bugs. She and her family are still very good characters feeling good earth. I think this series will be fun for small children. At the conclusion, this series is not as good as a movie, but it is good for younger kids.
