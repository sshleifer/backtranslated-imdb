A girl is looking for her soul mate - this movie was very weird - look like many hallucinations in the sequence. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable one in the film. It was difficult to determine what the director was trying to say - mostly the main character dressed in strange clothes and makeup. A strange combination of reality and madness.
