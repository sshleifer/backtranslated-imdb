First of all ... I saw porn flicks played well and more realistic makeup. How bad was Steve Agger like "Chris Molestant"? On Sopranos, Chris is not taken very seriously and may be considered comic relief. And then throw "Bobby Buckalla" as one of his Vegas chains. It's too much to take a dramatic movie. Not the actors can manage a serious role and is suitable as a second banana for Tony, Silt, or Uncle Jr. as well. And I want to know, who made the makeup for this disaster? I want that person to be my make up person in the next 25 years, so I'm never one day old. So I will write this movie as it does not waste too much of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes I know that Michael Imperiali and Steve Shirpah have their real name
