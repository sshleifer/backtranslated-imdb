Oh my ... bad dress, bad synth music and worst: David Hasselhoff. The American-Italian co-production of 1980 came back with revenge, which was guided by the infamous Joe D'Amato of the product side and director of short action (thanks to Akash for small miracles), Fabrizio Lorenti Director. Italy's Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series (called "La Cassa") was sold as a series, Wicheri provided some small grocer groceries and bad roles. <br /> <br /> The mix of ghost stories, wealth and magic, the film surpasses any other visible wooden actress without acting firmly, and the blizzard day and night blends slow the progression of the seemingly ending process, with some serious WTF wonder climax Leading. (I just love the face of her face ...) Surprisingly, Lorenny manages to collect some of the secret and vulnerability - fewer scenes; Unexpectedly, for this light movie some of the magic glimpses go down quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> Plus party fans are experienced when hit. This section is a very useful and entertaining reason in the classic LaTeX and the 80's ETO-GOOR red style, when things are made by 100% and can be made as gentle and budgety as a gentle budget. I can only laugh with sad gills and a few ridicule that unexpected characters (and actors) make fun and misusing one after another. I only feel sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently did not try any other effort than any old-fashioned female / female role in her career, or it seems to be examining her filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - do not say anything more, even less to say about. Do not expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and perhaps you'll find at least some light fun experiences. If it pounds your ugly little heart to beat deadly 80 cents euro it helps. And talking about the heart - David Hasselhoff is a square metal shaped metal, and a lot of bloodshed around the house and the straps, it can be one in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - is it yours?
