I have read almost all books, and saw musical production in two different languages. I fully adored everything that has been known before. But recently I've been out of resources to maintain my fancy. I still have a few books left, but they are in transit or they are the series that I'm not quick to read. So I got an idea - sink me! There are movies I have not seen! So, I will see them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series ... were acceptable. In fact, I enjoyed the difference of reason of the fair allegation, but it was different. It went from all the downhill though, though. Was Chauvelin too ... foppish? And, I am very old daresay for this role. Almost that dark and dashing figure that almost with its horrible. (And what was the random bed scene with her that showed him? It was very dangerous - Madame Gilotin and his only interest - his work, and his only interest - Sir Percy?) Margaret ... Women in PrÃªstest France? Women in Europe? I do not think so. However, whatever the reason for the break in the study of Sir Percy, I have very little idea. And what did my Lord Tony deserve to die? Yes, every member of the League pledged his life to Sir Percy, but he would never face them and could not face serious danger to his beloved friend. And if in any way he had to mourn his companion, he used to do it, he used to mourn, just as it did nothing. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. Her screenplay was the most awesome. He was not a lazy snap, not a master and a master of the transformation of the deceiver hero. He did not care too much about the cravat (his ear became blood) and he did not kill anyone with his own hands. So, do you randomly wander with him and kill people? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This revolutionary France we are speaking! Not pre-revolutionary. People dressed in such a crowd are easily standing in the crowd. It was just ... Gah! <br /> <br /> I must admit, after seeing the other part, my opinion changed a bit. Observing it as a separate job separate from the Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerant. Mask is your average hero. But to try to pass it on, it's still sad.
