The only reason I'm giving this movie is 4 because the mystery science was created in a part of Theater 3000. This horrible aspect works only with little shades of character, which is the complete disabling of the work. Leadership is an actor I have not seen anything else and it shows. There is no chemistry with the interest of love and there is no blame on what you do. Dick Sergeant was not convinced that this person's lowest villain seems to be the greatest ... he was even more annoying. Peter Graves was the only person that was not terrible, his part was small and could not even compensate for the lack of talent in his co-star. Someone tried to make this mess again in 2004, it was known as Island ... I personally did not see that movie, but I could understand the same movie. If you want to laugh in this movie then the MST 3K episode it's really fun ... it seems to be the ultimate sight of the whole diverse and biographical references.
