I could not agree more. This book is one of Dean Kongtze's best novels, and this film is a total story. I saw almost half, then bent down the tape! I do not know how stupid directors think of pieces in pieces, but I want to pull my eyes with a sharp stick instead of looking at this vain movie! Everything about this image is just wrong. The first main character changes from a pre-marine to a high school KID. Why ??? In the second book, the life of his life became his mother! Hey I said that Freud has something to say! Hah hah The dog is beautiful and the best thing in the movie and absolutely everyone else is taking away! The book betrays them as a major character in their book. There is nothing good to say about the movie, at least it is less than one and a half times or less. If anyone does not see the film, it is a favor for yourself! Read the book! It's much better than worthless waste of time!
