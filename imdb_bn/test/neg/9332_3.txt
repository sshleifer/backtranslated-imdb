Most unbroken biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags well over two hours. The only thing that protects this image from God's goodness (and only God remembers) is a strange fun conversation, and a good fight scene that comes to the film very late. Work scenes are spoken much more than two hours long; The dialogue is so perfect that the movie only wants to get confused by MST3K <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely awkward. One of the most animated, too-theater performance I've ever seen Brynner is not so good; Its harsh, woodworking, horror luck-cookie wisdom combined with utterings is rather a rather annoying and stupid for Solomon. It seems that if Brenner opens his mouth, oh - so wise and ridiculously high-mighty. In most cases this is not the fault of Sanders and Brenner, because of the absurd, humorous conversation and generally due to one-dimensional characteristic of the Bible, but they attempt less effort elsewhere. Brenner's utterance reminds somewhat of Schwarzenegger; This is not a plus. Only lolibrididaa plays a role in embarrassment itself, and has managed to avoid shame in the appropriate way that plays such a silly film. Describing this biblical character as a one-dimensional, too, will give their unrealized credit; Characterization is half-dimensional.
