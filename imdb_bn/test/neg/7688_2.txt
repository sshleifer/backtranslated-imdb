As a bit of Michael Dudicoff fan, I'm sitting to see one of his oldest employees - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to get rid of US commanders, a group of Syrian terrorists have taken a nuclear reactor. Maddy Rice (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the Commando unit, and of course he was romantically involved with Tom Dixon (Doodick). If Bright woman is a SAS member, I have to ask - as far as I know that they are available from other sources if they are needed. Even if they did, I can guarantee most that they are not as wet as Maddy Rie. I think Tom Dixon will be more responsible for his position - or have I lost this plot? I know these movies always have romantic angles because it helps to provide the reason for feeling, but it must be a lifetime, especially when more important things should be considered - just as nuclear war! <br /> <br /> The signature of the US Air Force has intrigued me. "Holy pen" accepted by the supposed television news staff - there is no security check for anyone or any of these ships, especially with the ability of those people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, action plays were movie bits and it was actually enjoyed for the comedy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a news reporter will really say "Downtown Damascus"?
