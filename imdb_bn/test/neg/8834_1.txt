This proved to be terrible in the WB network in the last few years of its existence. As a homosexual, I must distort this show for his ridiculous, fantastic land, vague and weird stereotype for kids "the strange hippies who have become detached from the highly impressive high school students". Sorry tv authors, the world has watched you from inside your donkey (when you wrote this show while your heads are clearly) we do not see the talented people of the world with our eyes, because we live somewhat in reality. Those who really liked this show ... Please, dear sweet Jesus, please reconsider this statement that you actually liked this whip on a very long walk. The more hollow, the blister and the wood than the stereotypes around the built-in whole show. Thank you for doing the right thing and for keeping this horse out of the beginning. This show was sometimes the privilege ever to be created, should never be so low as the eight horror episodes. I really hope these actors have finally received a source and as soon as the show ends, the junkie has stopped playing the role in TV shows.
