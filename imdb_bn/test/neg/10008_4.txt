The richest horse runners of Buenos Aires have long been trading with Mann Crane of Manhattan, but what happened when the Motala Latin boy falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair and dancing floor with some painful steps? There is a shiny veneer in the 20th-century Fox musical still seems a bit tatty around the edge. It is very heavy on frenetic, gymnastic-like dance, extremely thin on the story. Betty Grable (replacing an 11th hour for Alice Faye) gives it an encouragement, though she is associated with Lead Don Ameche (Tan Make Up and Slick Hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood Betty Pitti Masie, a limousine driver who is asleep on the job and Carmen Miranda himself (who?). Argentine stock shots exceeded the action done in the Fox Backlot and some supporter performance is quite awkward. During the big horse leak, most visitors were enough. * **** to 1/2
