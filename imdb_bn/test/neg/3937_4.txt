Daniel Atuil's Bruno in Petit Kupers 10 years ago, his middle-aged model of Pierre, for the separation of Christian Vincent La. In both films, leftist ideology and love (mutual metaphor) are suffering from paranoia - Pierre has expressed himself as an aggression stuck, and more recently expresses the sex of women in Bruneau. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Atul fans, the actors have become dependent on the common world-fatigue (Lynnto's recent lawn is not different from Johnny's Hall of Fame at home du train). It does not act, and the movie progresses become rather frustrating. As a writer / director of the project, Pascal does not help Bonner. His continuation of the episodes associated with the addition of symbolism failed to face the lack of rhythm. I was particularly excited that Grenoble's spectacular dramatic / romantic backdrop was created unexpectedly by the cameraman, who was clearly cold-chilled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the character of such a complexity, he made a brilliant conflict dramatically called Bruno, which makes him dramatic. It can not be sustained by the forest, and the flagging plot claims to Beatrice in other bourgeoisie's Manchwin. So seeing Bonnie's show, Scott denied Thomas to the Oscars cabinet. <br /> <br /> Immersion of all characters in the bourgeoisie can be an effective and truly tragic result, but in this case it is an embarrassment (like the brutal, painful collapse of the separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10
