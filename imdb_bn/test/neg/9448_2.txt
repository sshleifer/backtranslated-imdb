I see a ton of movies and occasionally enjoy B movies but this movie was awful. Alongside the "homely" quality of the film, it started to slow down and make no point. I'm just commenting on other comments b / c I saw it was cool! How nice! If there is no other thing available then it's okay to see the rainy day. <br /> <br /> The letters were disconnected and no transparent pattern of reality was measured. The dialog is forced into letters and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I guess that if you understand about 51 in the entire area and some other comments it might be good - but for me - the average Joe - I do not get it !?
