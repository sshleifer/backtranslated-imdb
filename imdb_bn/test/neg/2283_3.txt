I bought a tape of this image on the recommendations of other IMDB users and I want to say that I am very disappointed. I am a college professor and have shown this movie in my class; They unanimously voted that it is a terrible film. If you want the old bold shadow series, then perhaps you would like this. (I used to like dark shades when I was a child in the 70's, but now it seems very awful). At least half an hour or so, there is some cruelty in Willie's novel. Then, the story goes off fiercely, compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). The only thing about the entire production of Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is worth watching. The other acting is much worse, the music is melodramatic, and the film looks terrible. Actually, this is not a film - it was shot on the video and its characteristic Clostropophic BBC saw it. The opening scenes are particularly vulnerable, women's clothing are terrible (men's all right), and many characters, including Dariyan, seem like the 1970s decade of Victorian hairstyles. The film includes many wild conversations, but Doria's voice has a lot of garbage in voice-over details that directly oppose the character of the wild. I'm the big Oscar Wild Fan, and I must be rolled on violently in his grave when I was creating this horrors. Its only improvement in the 1945 edition is that the gay concubine is definitely more clear than the heavy tool. I have not seen any recent editions, but if anyone is interested in watching the story well, then I should recommend this 1945 mgm black and white.
