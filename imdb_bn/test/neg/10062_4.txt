At the beginning of the film, when the Paleontologist Donald Swireland arrived at the home of the Argentine family and came out of the house, he was unexpectedly unexpected for a member who executed the death sentence for killing his mother two years ago. Thriller; An innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still nearby. But along with your frustration, the film has inevitably increased. <br /> <br /> "Innocence by immunity" is a neutral and sometimes annoying film that can not be raised at any moment. Nothing interesting can happen and even the final release of events is strange and intense (wet you did not guess). <br /> <br /> Donald Sotheraland, Crisher Plummer, Phoe Dunnay and Sarah Miles ("Ryan's Girl", far away from her good performance) not only plays their role and is not very enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> If you skip it you will not miss a lot.
