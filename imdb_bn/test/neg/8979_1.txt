This is by the worst British comedy of all time, how it was created before the first episode, only the pilot crossed me. Acting starring directly from Ben Miller's actor Sir Alexander (Pretty Coolinger) Many of the lines of plot / story were worried and using many thought-provoking ideas was very predictable. Tolerated a very painful series but sadly kept a slot in two excellent shows. Describing Britain's "meeting with parents" as the answer to it, 'to meet parents and mothers' performs a helpless job and wanders with fresh dogs like old shoes. Britain must learn that Rip of America does not work on such tragic attempts from other countries.
