Although the trailer and poster of this movie suggests that Sally Hemings was an important character, I would not be frustrated to discover this little little (and I'm a small money) character, if the film speaks of Sally's own words. Family! I mean, if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that was ignored by history, would you really tell the person who pushed him to the obscurity of the main character? For the sake of true love his other boyfriend (who is white?) I do not know! I'm not even pale as they come, and usually a great fan of Merchant Ivory Flickr, but I could not beat Sally Hemings' treatment of this film.
