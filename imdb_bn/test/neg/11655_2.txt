I'm not surprised at the film at the Hampton Film Festival. It is a shallow movie that appeals to shallow people. Two actors pose to be a relationship actor who looks for war and a lost dog. This movie is investigating the dynamics of relationships, however, the relation is too small for such search capability. These couples have a dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight something more. The brief moment of softness does not reveal any possible reason that these two will be associated with their toxic and volatile relationships. Nine shots, excellent scores, but without merit in scripts or letters, this is only that short.
