Before I wrote this review I found that "Comodo v Cobra" and "Curse of the Curse of the Curse" are both the same person, directed by Jim Weinowski. That could explain why they are almost identical to premises films. They are both more military-ruled islands, a colonel which is more concerned about covering its tracks than the living of its employees, running to reach the helicopter, which is easily lying somewhere on the island, and creating giant comodo dragons running genetic testing amok. What's the difference? Well, the intruders of the island now want capitalists to disclose public privacy and the island also has a giant cobra, so the title "Comodo v Cobra" is a title, though the conflict between the two monsters is very less relevant. Lesson or less of what you expect about "Commodo vs. Cobra" its title and its channel source: Science-Channel. Although every time and again you will find a one that can appeal to one or the other (I like a movie called "Comodo") I will not doubt about this. <br /> <br /> "Comodo v Cobra" is not just an annoying film, but it is one of the least encouraged sci-fi films I've ever had. In these few movies, they have a breeze that filmmakers suggest at least one specific level of effort, but I rarely see here. It is again understood that "Commodore Curse" SGI for monsters seems to have come directly from the second-rate video game, cinematography and miscellaneous N scene, poor, acting ranges from poor to poor, action scenes are neutral, and then there are some parts that are pure, unreasonably bad. I watch a lot of movies where a person shoots a number of guns without reloading and I can deal with it. But in this movie, where Michael Pere takes the thirty-five hammers and gets lost almost fifty times without reloading it? Well, at first I smiled, but still it just got tired. That 'action.' A giant is displayed, people shout, Perry covers the whole picture once it gets spoiled without reloading his gun and someone gets to eat <br /> <br /> "Comodo v Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only character of the film is charitable, it is an actress named Michel Berth, who is not only very nice, but an amazingly strong performer. Even with the lack of exciting lack and enthusiasm in trashplay, Michele Bert was directed to take a surprisingly good performance, and it simply reminds me that an actress like him could be trapped in this movie as a militant. He probably took it for check, but it would not improve in his career, I was afraid.
