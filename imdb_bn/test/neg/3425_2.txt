An interesting concept has become a killer ... <br /> <br /> My first seen feature, when I first took an interest in it, is an interesting concept ... <br /> <br /> /> Shakespeare + Aussie film + Gothic setting + Melbourne gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that has become a crushing piece of Asalamu Alaikum which makes my country a bad name ... <br /> <br /> Pros: - Attractive ideas <br /> <br /> - A good Cast Stast - Stuffed and False plot - Protected camera angles - There are not many locations - Shakespeare Dialogues <br /> <br /> Overall : Shakespeare's Stick to Buzz Lurmerman ... or Australia's Worst Effort for Warning of Romer's Storm (Warning: The image is dangerous)
