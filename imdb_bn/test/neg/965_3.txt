Sometimes the Hallmark could get it right - like the 10th kingdom - but most of their fiction plots movies and it falls into the next section. The version I have seen can be spared (a monster [?]? And publicly present on the trainer), but nothing that can make the movie smaller can be a blessing. Possible spinners, if you are united with Organic Fair Tall, <br /> <br /> However, the movie updated the story (?) in the early 20th century and the Garda and K (known here as Kai - Made by Lex). Fan, I'm not saying to him, 'The dead do not solve puzzles') 18 years old. Hans Christian Anderson's original story follows: The boy gets ice cream in his eyes, gets worse, Snow Quinn takes him to solve the puzzle in his palace, and the Garda finds him on various routes. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are older than the original, sometimes they get together and spend 'in love'. Unfortunately, I never believed that they were especially in love and were not enough in love with the context of finding guerars. When the original plot reached Cox's Bazar, the motion of the movie became crawl. Hey, when Gorda starts her search for Kai, it only guides to a retired travelogue. <br /> <br /> There are a few extraordinary additions to the story that do not seem to be anywhere. At the beginning of the photo, Snow killed Quinn Gorda's mother, but there was no explanation for this. A smoking beer living in the Snow Queen's palace is much more than that (though it was probably because the producers realized that beer feeling to the Snow Queen would remain in a fairy tale but not in a modern film). Again, this is not explained. Also, Snow Quinn has indicated that a lover's desire for Kai has been reduced, but it does not follow The script is also full of antioxidants, which will tell you from the real 'fairy tale' mood. <br /> <br /> The production looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pitching: Snow Queen Palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai are covered with snow. Three main characters are played with different degrees of success: Kai initially comes across like a girder like a blade, but once she finds the kayak to warm you up. Bridget Fonda Snow looks great as Queen, but everyone else thinks in different movies. Finally, the film is dissatisfied. It looks good, but drags and lacks magic.
