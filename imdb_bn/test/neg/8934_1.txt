This movie is too stupid for the word. Even if you are considered to be a parody in the making of the film, if you consider it to be completely camped, even if you waste it while watching - you've seen it once. But maybe you're a big fan of high-end girls 'voices, you still love Barbie and Kenne and you can stand up to this standard' 80's electric guitar background noise ... OK, you have a chance.
