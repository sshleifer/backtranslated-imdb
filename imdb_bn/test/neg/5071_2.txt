I want to write a short summary of this movie's plot, but there is only one! If you take a look at the plot keywords for this title, you know a lot about the whole of the film: sex, breasts, nudity, female nudity and women's prison! Pure sleaze 80 minutes and more. "Island Women of Pali" (An alternative title that is not listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic, but it lacked the complete brutality of one. WIP-flicks are combining graphic sexual images with violent violence, but violence here has been replaced with more sex. The director, Irian Diarych, certainly can not compete with experts like Jesse Franco or Joe Di Amatro, and he will have to be able to make simple soft-core flicks. The little face like Empire-Cinema is similar to Fidel Castro's quarterly president, and soldiers are similar to the rape of a young girl's group. Girls are violent, but the place for Ibiza is very interesting.
