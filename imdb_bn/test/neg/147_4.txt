I'm usually pleased to see Laurel and Hardy, but it is certainly one of the films made on the way to becoming a successful comedy team. <br /> <br /> This plot is very simple, and basically it's a joke; How strange are the kilts and Scotsmen And that's all. All right, there are some jokes, but I did not think it was too fun; They were outdated and during the first release of the movie (I guess) was not very entertaining. Still, the film has got two of the most interesting faces in history, and they are the best to look at the best weird stories (which I hope was featured without proper scripts) and the scenery <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is only suitable for Lorel and Hardie fans, others have to stay away from here.
