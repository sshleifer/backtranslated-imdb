This droplet plot to Satan vs. ah-nulls, and what I think about the movie is explosion, gunfight, blood, noise, and the burning fiery urine will not be forgotten. The story is unconscious, completely anticipated, and holes filled so I could not take it seriously. If you really want to see a good devil movie and stay tuned in "Rosemary Baby" or "The Exorcist" ... um, I can not think of any good "action" movies at this time (probably because they are 'so far and sometimes ), So you're on that section yourself. This peak has got 3 ratings out of 10 for my camp quality, and for Gabriel Beyron's old debut, acting as a devoted devil!
