One of the biggest budget action films I've ever seen in the last days. Muddling direction, lam dialogue and gaping plot holes, fast-fire MTV-style editing and passing loads with all the poor performances scripts. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the last day is not watchable. The film is interested in me because I made the last move of Ah-Null make a ridiculous folly for being so familiar with logic and stupid. The movie quickly dies without the sense of rationality, due to the huge drop in box office reception at the end of the second week of the opening of the United States <br /> <br /> I will not know why the rationale for the film violates the law, but with this film There are many problems here: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How does it show how to trace it? No snapping fingers, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On computer and, Vioola, Christine York, New York City is the only person with the perfect name! Except my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who interacted with Arnad's character changed the picture later? When I got the recognition of my husband-turned-evil-worship husband, I laughed loudly, the same actress who played a grandmother in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. If you can visualize its wicked transformation from this photo, it was absolutely sunny. <br /> <br /> All stupid huge explosions and gunfighters. What did you expect in Arnold Schwarzenegger's car? <br /> <br /> <br /> The devil took the human body with flesh and blood, yet he disappeared from bullet and explosion by healing through the body. Logically, it is impossible. <br /> <br /> As the demostrates delve into the apartment of the devlut, Arnold's character is a delusion that is performed in the firm Christmas tree and * reads it physically *. <br /> </ br> The Devil could throw a person's brain and move 180 degrees over his head, but he could not always kill the character of Lord Arnold. <br /> <br /> How did the Devil's desire die? And why running after Arnold in New York and the object of will was never explained. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is beyond my comprehension, since the army may die Arnold, and after a few seconds of severe wound he may die. <br /> <br /> <br /> The devil kept him hanging on a cross against the wall, yet Satan forgot to take advantage of his time and opportunity to kill him. . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, a man's body after the capture of Satan, Arnad his bodyguard suddenly ??? Is this an example of an incident or a bad edit? <br /> <br /> The Cring-Eduating Dialogue, like Arnold's laughable scenes, is said to be "You are a twenty-four compared to me!" Free sheet for MSST3, just as Eraser gave the classic line "You luggage!" <br /> <br /> The entire theory of 666/1999 is merely ridiculous. So in the medieval times, the killer wanted to know about the position of the position of pseudo-religious barbarism and the will of Satan's will, about the Christian antitrust with the end of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The violence level in the film is excessive and horrible, and therefore it is vital to serve the plot. The manager's extra negligence is a factor here. He certainly does not know how to create a coherent action movie from Air Force One's screen writer, which is compulsory to write scripts for huge money only. <br /> <br /> So, the last days are worthless movies without any price - Arnold's worst since New York's Hercules. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
