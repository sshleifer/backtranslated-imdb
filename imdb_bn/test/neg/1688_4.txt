In the last days of 1999 it was a painful slow story, when a strange disease spread and I cared. It seems about two people who live in or near each other at the apartment complex. A leak and plumber put a hole in the human floor so that you can see the woman in the apartment below. Since most of the crisis is going on in dialogue, it is really news report ... <br /> <br /> To become confused and do other things which are deadly in a subtitle film Start Basically I do not see, which saw when the events seem more realistic. <br /> <br /> This can work for you, it's not for me.
