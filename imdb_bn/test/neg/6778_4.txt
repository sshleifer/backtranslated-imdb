To confirm this movie, it describes really horrific events. But it all falls below poor performance from cast. It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, because all the mental scenes seem like a parody of itself. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the movie, and you get discouraged, "I'll make it, sergeant?", "Yes it's nothing", but it's playing like a sketch Wayne Brothers movie (I do not know yet Whether it's made in the movie) or something like Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant run by San Pen reminds me of Al-Bundi with married children, Fox can imagine the best person in the best confidence, you can imagine ... thank God, he curses in her Give and smoke. <br /> <br /> Her emotional "NOOOO !!!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> where they actually perform some fairly horrible acts) ... do good work and take it seriously. But thanks in spite of that.
