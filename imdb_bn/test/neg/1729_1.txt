This is a disaster-movie, meaning both words. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, this movie stinks everything big It's embarrassing to see the Danish hopper's talent is broken in this horrible movie. I can give you 100 examples but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: No.
