The tagline for this show is, "He is talking about his mind, we are recruiting additional lawyers." If you look back at the time, any classic shallow comedian does not prided himself in the controversial ones. Richard Love's tagline was not, "I'm crucified, racist and brave." How is this comedy central marketing this show - your face, non-PC and "honest" - but how can a television make itself proud in this way? Where is humility and gentleness? And suddenly Carlos Mensia made this huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappell announces his show (which became unexpectedly popular and controversial) and Comedy Central looks around to open a new push. They hire this man named Nad, who claims to be a Mexican, although he is not. They sprayed their mouths on some TV commercials and it seems like they became "brave", expressing them on the public. <br /> <br /> I have seen so many disgusting issues in the forum for this. Display, and I do not agree with the "Mencia's" opponents. This is not a terrific show. It started crying to me a few times. When it's funny, it's so funny. Yes, it was a teenager - but it was like a chapel. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses the same material in the same amount. And he is very clear. On the other hand, marketing is on one side, "Carlos" now tells Veena how many times I've lost count. He is trying to make it the next famous line (for example, "I'm Rick James, b ****!") But it is very clear. <br /> <br /> Carlos has used so many things to repeat himself and the same joke. For example, on one episode he said that he would like it when the Mexican disappears from America at night. He wakes up and an American man will say, "room savers!" In the southern pronounced <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He appeared as a guest on Adam Carroll's talk show - he used the same joke. It was fun to have a different time, because he was even more frustrating. <br /> <br /> "Carlos" funny? I think so. Her show has some humiliating moments. But he is going with the stream and his comedy naturally gives too much attention to trying to be controversial rather than progress. Fooly shiny face and with loud screaming loud voice repeat stupid little stories are completely outdated ... I just hope Carlos - or his authors - can give a new edge to the show, because now it has started reducing the hell repeat.
