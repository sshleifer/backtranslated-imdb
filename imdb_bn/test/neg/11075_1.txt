I love movies ... and rarely do I watch a movie that I hate ... but it was the worst movie I ever saw, or at least near it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is terrible. Hands down ... I can not believe I lost 2 hours of watching this movie. I'm really crazy, I want my money back and my time back. Awful, terrifying! Do not go to see it, cinematography is horrible, plots are horrific, the last deadly. I did not know what was happening in the half-time of the movie (and I was looking very nice and watching on big TVs), saw the rent, the eyes of the mountain, or the wax house ... Anything you want something terrible, then those who are good.
