Anyone who has compared this to a losing ARK's raiders knows he certainly must speak. He may be following, as well as decoration heroes can compare it with some bravery. Both "Who Hoog" reminds me a little more than Lamont Cranston (Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (Shadow, mysterious person, mysteries- and the first "Dark Knight" - was also considered Kate Alard. If Svez's first name is taken first and Kate is added to it, then you'll finally end up voila-Clark Kent.) Funny, weird? Like Jones, Hugh does not know the archaeological aspects of an ancient civilization (though his theft is often more brighter than Jones's and less "charming sunshine"). Unfortunately, these two pasters have much tears from the subsequent serials (of any era) in terms of overall quality. Some of the first signs that cinematic stories are not telling, which leave the hopelessness of Herscack, breathing behind them, only Hog escapes from their clutches in a hot air balloon. Why are they not bothered to shoot the balloon, there is only one in the mystery of the many film-making films that infect these two films? <br /> <br /> The second half of these two pasters is worse than ever. Imagine, it was one of the first series and, as it should be done in a small amount - but there are limitations even even tolerance. (At one point, not on the screen of the hero, but in the description! Talk about cutting corners ...) Frat Lang can be one of the greatest filmmakers of all times; Unfortunately for those of us who appreciate most of them, the spider is actually a bitter pill to swallow ...
