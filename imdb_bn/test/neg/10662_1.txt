(In HR Himesh's movie, I think he likes it too.) How intelligent people, talented and even trapped in the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like silk. Is that what he is amazing. In recent years some did not return from the desert and made a mark for themselves. <br /> <br /> And I really hope for a great movie (what a beautiful actress with the budget of 50 crore). As severe as Reshmaiah, I thought, he would achieve an emotional and emotional role. Wickedly he portrayed the same but for any care? Cruel disadvantages, helplessness, horror acting, wild background music, sensory aspects make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> The rules of the Blenders (Ex. How can the German police instruct people to speak loud in English, they communicate in English among themselves!) Unfortunately, this inconsistency has become the main line of Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but very bad. The worst thing is that the majority simply do not care. <br /> <br /> The songs are only saving storage ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director (low budget .. no problem) < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
