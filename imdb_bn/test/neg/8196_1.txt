This nudity was broadcasted on a channel night famous for showing off-the-wall movies. Although it is tempted to stop, we have seen it at the bitter end, we want to see some similarities in the value of the prospect. Hey, there was no one. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; The soundtrack was melted; The edit was ridiculous. Then again, the rescue was little valuable. Some minutes after the character of Cameron Mitchell's doctor's character, some of his patients are described, the viewer is tortured due to any conspiracy, repressive writing, abnormal acting, and lack of merger and continuity. The roasting Cherry on top of this faked mess was even the most awesome "special effects" and "makeup" to insult even the screen for television. The main character stumbles through a demonstration of Rubber Mask and his role in a poker of gloves that looks like glue and wax rolling. Probably trying to cover the poor light and the quality of the gag-worthy film, how bad the make-up-to-tenth power was. One can hope that at least one deliberate decision was made through this frustrating amateur video. Seriously, three-year-olds may have produced a good project for a young person. In the end, the poor Mr. Mitchell came back (how he must have been frustrated for the money!) And think that this connection should be made in this epidemic. Please be inhuman cruelty sitting by you and your loved ones. It was so bad, even the mystery science theater 3000 could not retrieve it.
