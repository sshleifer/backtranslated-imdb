I have been a warm Zen Austin fan for many years. I have never seen this adaptation, so when I heard it, I came here and read all the wonderful reviews. On that basis I sincerely ordered it to Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and brilliant comic novels and made it shameless. It seems that each character is single facial expression, a single tone that can maintain their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word Jen Austen wrote, however, it seems that they went close to the characters in a random fashion. Although it worked like a miniciar, the adaptation seemed to be confused and directed as if it was done as a week's movie. <br /> <br /> m Bennett is very tough, Mrs. Bennet is just a chipping chip, Mr. Darcy is a weird girl, Bennet girls are almost different, and Mr. Wikham is a man who does not see twice - very rarely cad! I have entered a lot!
