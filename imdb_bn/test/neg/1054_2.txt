This is your usual junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There is almost no smile. No real moments No memorable line. There are no scenes where you think yourself, "that was tricky". There is nothing. The plot is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to see and annoying like hell! There is no substance here. This movie has nothing to do. It does not matter if this is rarely or not. No matter what a shit movie involves no matter a whip movie. <br /> <br /> Also, David Spade is a horrific curious man who ever played the same shameless character in the movie / TV show. <br /> <br /> This movie died after coming. There is no life here There is no fun. There is no intelligence. There is a lot of other "stupid" comedies that this one. This film is just sad. <br /> <br /> 2/10
