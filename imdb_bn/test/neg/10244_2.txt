I do not have a movie snob. I liked many movies that I hate haters, and I hate the movies of the critics. However, I have to agree with the critics here - "Galaxina" is just low quality. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it has only a few scattered smiles. "Galaxina" has poor photography; It has poor special effects; It has some pretty poor performance; And the production price ... Well, the set may also be made on the cardboard. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship, whose crew is searching for a magical object, "Blue Star" "After a long journey (and some very uncomfortable space battles), the crew has its destination, surrounding the wild west. Coming at a sort of world. A painful, strange canteen scene (clearly designed to be a mockery in the famous "Star Wars" scene), a Space Bike involved a Jazz, and a final departure. <br /> <br /> Try to cast, but this can not breathe life in Turkey. Stephen Mount and Avari Scriber have done well in other movies. James Davids is very good as the crew member of the Hinton Spaceship. At the end Dorothy starred as the title robot in Straton and when she looked great, her role did not allow her to act. <br /> <br /> Apon Maybe this film will see stratena dorathi. However, if you are looking for a good movie, you probably want to skip this one.
