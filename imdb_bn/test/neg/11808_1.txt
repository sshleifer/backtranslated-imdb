The video box for 'Joardide' is called "second-generation superstars," and no one can help but feel sad. Imagine, Melanie Griffith has taken great and good things ... but who is aware of the rest of the cast? So, with great attention in that box, I was stupid enough to buy a movie for dollars, thinking that I would be in a bad guy's country - well 70's movies' Eh, not so much. Although many nonstop films (or plain All-70 movies) on 70 youths, tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, 'Jairid' did not even try it. It's just aimless It is void of any interest. Every character is so weak that it is no wonder that these actors look so relentless. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> They beat up, eat dog food, steal cars, bank robberies. It is all very common but above that it is executed as the most thoroughly possible. There is no surprise and the flow is so bad, and the characters' actions are so confused that you can miss a few scenes and they can not remember everything. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then this one must definitely see. It's still not enough on the lowest rating I can give. <br /> <br /> Best line: "Jesus, everything is with you biology." * Out of ****
