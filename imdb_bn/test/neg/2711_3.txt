********** Possible spinner ********** Madonna plays a former contingent that needs to recover some precious information that can be cleared by the prisoner who was imprisoned for killing him many years ago . Grafin Dunne is a tax attorney who is married to her boss's daughter. Together, both of them should be together, where chaos prevents you from going to live. <br /> <br /> When you get down on it, it's a stupid movie. Not trying to remove the plot **** Possible spinner ****, the movie's bad guys are trying to protect their boss, which retrieves the information that blames them for killing Madonna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wife-maid is all tied up! And let's not forget the same brides-maids who fight up to the front gate from gate, still tied together! And I hate to say it, but the patchy girlfriend is definitely wild! In New York City, only four of them can be in danger, so they can be endangered, but I know that they have lots of them in Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie the Lonesome Kumar" if you really want to see a big "cat"). Look at the old man falling asleep on his chest ... NAW! <br /> There are plots, but all of this movie is there. I am very young when I came out of this movie I was so weak and I had something - like Madonna's fan, but this is the only reason I love the movie, but then she has turned away from popularity with me. She is just a terrible actress (she's good to read behind singer's career ) That is facing. It is probably rated after a "5", but it has been "rarely created" in the year.
