OK,. So I went into this loving silk. I still love him but think a little less. This is a fair movie that shows lots of male genitalia. This is a ridiculous and purposeful act of the 1970's black exploitation films. The only interesting part about this for me is that all the voices have been dropped with dragon raven, even the voices of the real woman. It's a top, nonstop, so stupid, badly-made movie so close to your rear end smile. I do not see it again, but I am grateful to what the filmmakers were trying to do. It does not have a rating but it will be either R or even NC-17. Rupal did a great job.
