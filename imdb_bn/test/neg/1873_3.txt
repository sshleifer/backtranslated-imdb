This is not a good film by a standard. This is very bad writing and acting is only slightly above (some performance is below equal, but Suez and Gray work very well). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The order of the dance was very well-danced and the above mentioned, Swaz and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad <br /> <br /> <br /> "Bad" boys were simply too bad to be credible. The best villains are not very clearly bad. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who imposes the girl) and do not say anything that gives me the belief that they can be real people (perhaps there are boys like them, but I definitely do not want to see a movie about it). <br /> <br /> Another scene, where GRA and SWOGE are the first stage when the resorts staff "dance" meet. Swayze and Gray dance together and feel to enjoy themselves. They will meet next time, Sway's hostile to him. Why? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another mistake, set in 1960. Everyone looked like 1980, who was in charge of clothing and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> Music (original music for film) was ridiculous ("I was my time" which is a good one <br /> <br /> I have never seen the worst movie, but most of the time She received ratings
