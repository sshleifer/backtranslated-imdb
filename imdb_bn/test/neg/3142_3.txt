I hired this movie from the local library that it was based on a book or based on the movie, it was created based on the opportunity that it is sometimes one of the rare, weird gems that can discover at some time from time to time. And really enjoys it <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is not one of the movies. I'm not sure whether this film is a film directed by sensitivity or a bad, deliberate agenda, but some of its elements have made it impossible to submerge. It should be portrayed as a struggling immigrant activist who tries to deal with the difficult realities of their life. This is a good courtroom and it may be made for a secret story, but the death penalty makes me an alternative by being annoying and annoying. Here there is a community of our common farm workers who moved to the United States to find jobs and who repeatedly used and tortured by the bad white men. And when I say evil - I say Evil. All white people in this film are sinister, racist, fanatic, insulting devil, whose only purpose is to have sexual confusion with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was so weirdly extraordinary and not so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In addition to the poster-worthy examples of migratory screenplay, too much of it, it goes from the opposite side. Immigrants can serve as chillies for holy, clean and groom-bows and can cross the world. I could not help laughing when this "ground crew" probably saw in his infamous cleaning cloth and possibly digging ditches with haircut haircut from a top pure hair salon. A little restraint and helm more neutral hands can make it a lot better film, instead of some intent of the sophisticated snickers.
