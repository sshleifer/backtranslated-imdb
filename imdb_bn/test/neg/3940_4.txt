Stew Alive is an intelligent horror film about a video game that kills a man just like the one killed. Those who play this game will soon depict this image and then understand that they will defeat blood poisoning from the video game or take their fate. We have our video tapes on the furious FireDotcom website The Ring. Now it's on the video game. Stay alive some good; Character development is quite somewhat deeper than it usually will be a horror movie. We really can see some characters feeling in the past and know them all well, so the audience may get some passion for them. The film is very suspicious. Tomorrow, unexpected moments are often played through film, indecent, unclear music There are lots of jumps and jolts for visitors. It can be ideal once or twice, but this is a false fear that Hollywood seems to be enjoying a lot of horror films nowadays, thin clothing in the stee alley. The spectators tend to give a sharp angle or a quick flash to watch a giant or witch watch very quickly and to scare them through the sudden blast on the screen. Why? Due to the film's certificate, Gore must be very weak. The surviving script is very impressive and quite ridiculous, and characters play it very gently and confusingly. Also, clich√©s come from every corner, for example, people roam themselves in search of strange noise or they can see an image in the dark, but they will investigate it. However, the use of computer graphics for video game categories is rather impressive and works well with other parts of the film, colorful and sharp look. But overall, retaining this movie is not enough. For more than a minute, it will not be a struggle to survive, rather be aware.
