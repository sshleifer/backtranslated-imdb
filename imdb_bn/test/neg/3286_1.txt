The actors and actresses of this series are okay, but the script is absolutely awesome. This family is so effective that they are not even funny. In fact, the scripts often do not seem to be a parent. The scripts are so bad, they see Homer Simpson as a better father than this. <br /> <br /> If anyone is becoming a parent, what do you want to do with your kids, but this show is a perfect guide. I think this show returns to us, out of words <br /> <br /> Michael Reapport saw many good elements in his career (including his role in the hit). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> awesome.
