And only one, in my opinion <br /> <br /> is because of Margaret Liton. She is a wonderful actress, on screen as well as on the screen. Although we have a few chances to see him I think this is true in the United States especially. <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, he was very nice and meant to be something of a bombing. <br /> <br /> Walter does not hold the pigeon drummer tradition of actors. She is always reliable but she does not have much fun She does not have a rascal or a knave. As a result, this seemed a talky effort with my little action or mystery. But check it out for Leighton.
