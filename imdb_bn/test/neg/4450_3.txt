I just saw that movie, and was quite frustrated. I did not expect much as the film's firmness did not recommend anyhow glory. Sadly, it does not even manage to provide foolhardy entertainment. The main problem is probably acting. Although I saw many bad actors in many bad films, the story will require some people to act as violent, modest, as some people were actually caught in accidental pressure, and they failed to deliver it. Although I have seen the German release, I have seen it with the original audio, so this is definitely not a bad voice-over or something like this. Combined with this, the German DVD release seems to have been cut, the killings are much more left, i.e. the German release is "Gore-Hands" from the end of some semi-glorious scenes. Of course there can not be comments for other releases. Some stupid moments have been thrown here and there, and the beginning is just sunny (sometimes a psychic inspector heard a monster?). It takes a very bad movie very seriously, if it is portrayed as a horror-comedy, and it changes somewhat here and accordingly it can work better. The end is just a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you're not really good at doing anything and do not just stand up to frustration, you might (but it's really "weak" maybe) think of this movie. If there is to see or do something else: choose that option.
