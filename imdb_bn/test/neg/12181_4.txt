First off, I have been a huge Brunson fan, since the late '70s. "Love and Bullets", we saw every movie made on the big screen, which is surprisingly the beginning of its end as the star of Hollywood-blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I hope the things that are going around will surround them, he will make a really good movie in the '80s, but it never happened. And he does not know what he thinks when he thinks Sastajac studio Canon and his Jack Director J. Lee Thompson for her next films <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw Peter Hunt was instructing instead of Thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed. First of all, the film seems incredibly cheap, as it was made for about $ 3 million, reducing the enhanced salary of Branson (I have heard that every movie costs 5 million, which is probably more than the budget for all its canon films). The film was shot on the basis of the West LA VA in the scene of White House - I was taking the bus while shooting. Excellent work to restore the White House, but did anyone think about finding palm trees from Shams? Do not guess <br /> <br />, supporting cast is really bad. Ireland was dying due to cancer and still was not bad, but the Asian Asian woman, while playing Brunson's Sidekick, was the Canon's talent - at the time of existence. I would be realistic to know how I got this role. I can not imagine a bad actress for the part, plus she is less than 40 years younger than Branson! The story is not bad and it is something that is big and high-budget studios later on (like "the line of fire" of Eastwood's "In Line of Fire" and Castner's "bodyguard" film), but the way it was held here is really sad. I wonder if they could not take one or two shots per shot. It is trustworthy in someone who is least. If the Secret Service Men really behave like Keystone Police in this movie, then we want to visit the President (and outside) every few months in the office ...
