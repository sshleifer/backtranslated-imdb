The second woman is the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to harm him. The girl who loves her, wants to help her, but she is believed to be afraid of psychological illness ... <br /> <br /> Interesting plot, acting very well, but it's all bad in many ways. The story is very easy, or rather has been presented in a straightforward way (though there are some of the interesting plot twists). For example, people say that they love each other in only two meetings. I do not want to reveal anything else, but if you see the movie you'll see what you mean. "Come, it's fifty years!", You can remember. Yet I have seen a number of films of the era and I know that something does not look like today's date. <br /> <br /> Something that bothers me is to shoot some scenes in the dark, to see what is happening almost impossible. All right, this is a movie-noor, but it's very silent on some points ...: o) <br /> <br /> Overall, the second woman is not the best piece of the era, but no trash. If you have to do something else, check it out ...
