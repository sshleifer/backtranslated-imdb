This is the first morning of our discontent, and some of my friends and I have just gotten through the "wind" watching. Really a disaster film Damage to a vague population in the sense of energy of nature, but rather a terrible movie spoil distraction on an illiterate audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it is to see this particular bomb, I'll give you an example cited during my first tragedy. If the second time is liked to watch this movie and say, warming myself, I want to say that the choice will not be instant. But instead of fostering "ad peliculum" with Lauly One-liners, I would like to specify exactly why I made this special movie. <br /> <br /> To stop it, I want low budget horror flicks. I even love artsy, low budget horror flicks. I like the "cold heart", "midnight mass," "jugular wine," etc. Films were ambitious and brave, even if they did not even produce production, executed and even executed. In general, an attractive premiere, unusual camera tactic or simply a well-done scene or a little rough running near the two ends will save a movie. With these values ​​in mind, I want to say that I hate "wind". <br /> <br /> This movie was probably the most frustrating that it was impossible to see. From the flow of character (?), From the verb of the main characters, the opening of large portents, which eventually stimulated the dust (and the rest of the film did not even add to itself.) And left the viewer, and some were hoping there was nothing else. ). The conversation was the best, structured distribution and totally unrealistic. By this, I mean that in any case no letter will be reacted in characters or they said as they said. This problem was fixed, there was a clear lack of vision and direction. <br /> <br /> The character's interaction and development was unstable. Claire, "lechery sex goddess" or the growing, passive-aggressive lamsters of the film, because of its fascination, she can pull guns on the characters. Yet, he was the bright high point of the film. Other major characters (besides the exception of Mickey Muffy's mother, who were not terrible) were so weird that they were also portrayed by the same actors. Let's see if I miss something: With a deep feeling of sexuality, confusion and inadequacy, the borders of the personality, millennium gangsters, suddenly-and-illiterate-festive-orchestrated by Kaligar's lazy ornaments, encourage encouragement for tantrums. No, I think it covers me. <br /> <br /> The lack of opportunity was also problematic. How the filmmakers involved in this film were expected that the upcoming spectator would appear from the beginning of the world, from this amazing, incredible, weakly painted wishing pentagon (well, what would you say it?). Mainly somewhere in the middle of the wood? Presented "oppression" was no witness. There were no witnesses anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The credibility problems arising from this lack of attention were also disturbed from the point where the plot started to get sick. Case-In-Point: If that person brought the house from Jim through Jim Jim, and what's here, **** every day ****, someone else had a great chance to see some criminals offense for a while Logically vociferously against the scene. Some would think that in the city, with the murder of a young man among the youth, the city would be violent, the characters would be questioned, etc. But instead, the vision was not witnessed (in addition to Earl, the closet psychopath with no inner monologue). We recommend that * there will be no witness for this photo. <br /> <br /> For the presence of Quantum gay homosexuals, I have no problem with them. Since the second scene, most of the letters of men do not seem to be shouted like a collage case, as if they were astonished. Again, problem and problematic itself, but thrown for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, was cast for the pure "shock" and / or "hazardous industry" pricing and from no point of view it was not shocking or dangerous artistic. What we did instead was a painful attempt to break a boring, quivering movie with an annoying, strange plot. There is a bad indication of sexual tension, which indicates heavy interference in the context of this lethal graduation scene, the film simply pushed down the totem pole from "mediated warranty criticism" "It is so bad that there is an underlying lack of it <br /> < br /> This picture is mostly in film, many artistic satire, very little meat and much more decay We did not get it because of the desire, oh, we got it, all right, we just do not want it. See, in the final scene, we were delighted by the fascinating way of bluženjing which * only * the table that showed senses on its face There was something wrong with this picture. Instead of understanding instead of moving along with its name, this movie is your nose Working on the way to the path of going ahead is steadily moving ahead as well.Ha sums up this sensation that when watching this train debris very well, sums up the gut-up frustration. There is no breath of new air with this movie, only bad ideas have weakened the brain's brain , Which has become empty before coming to pale.
