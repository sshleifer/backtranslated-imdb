New year 2006, and I'm watching Glimmer Man again. Say whatever you like, movies of Steven Sighal are entertaining. Like many comments, consistency of good battles - I especially loved the answer to the phone in the restaurant how long it would be closed for recovery. Schwarzenegger's bizarre bit in former action films - though it continues to be spontaneous. <br /> <br /> But here I like Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors around. The sorrow about his hands and feet, but so much for extended interrogation - must be classified on "farm". <br /> <br /> As the movies are going on, I wonder that sometimes the germs of Sail have been affected. His movement? Do not remember, it's entertainment!
