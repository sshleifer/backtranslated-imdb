When you combine a challenging script with two actors selected for physical appeal, it is a wonderful example of disaster. Being aware of the role of consciousness during the first viewing of the film is rare for me, because I just tried to go with the story and save the analysis for the second time. In the case of "Full Ride", the act was so weak that it was impossible to appreciate the story as a movie; I was very busy (first and only for viewing) alternatives between laughter and vomiting. Thankfully, for most members of Caste, most of the parts in the whole are poor, with no real talent restrictions, with no real active acting. Relay Smith and Meridith Monroe have met at least good physical, found common grounds in search of age for their age of credible ages. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the script requires a strong and strong performance especially to illustrate their characters, but Smith and Monroe's talents show a great lack of talent. On the positive side, they do not know enough to take a closer look at the camera and they are not frustrated. <br /> <br /> Better to use less interesting pairs that can pass physically for a good age. The basic story is not particularly original, but it is one of the diversity of "an official and a gentleman", but it will provide a great showcase for a teenage actress. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
