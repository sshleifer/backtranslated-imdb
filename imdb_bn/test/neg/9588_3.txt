This image tries to cut the Hollywood studio era and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone has been called Rock Hudson, but both script and actor Matt Lashchet have finished a memorable, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton, which creates an unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Gaya Stone is such a reprehensible person that the audience has found it difficult to like this waste of human skin. Apart from Hodson, who was sweetly vague, Stone is a detrimental person who uses wisely and then shares his bed after spending a few hours with a sweet, handsome young man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director does not know exactly what to do with him. The conversation is false in the conversation, which is a little tedious, and it suffers for the film. <br /> <br /> Karen Preston Sally gave more to Allen Green in "Cree Little of Horosc". In writing, Preston's Sally does not like to laugh. New actor Adam Gray has lost in this movie. She can not act, and seems to have been cast for her hot body and for the good beauty. Like many recent movies, "straight-jacket" is a "dramatic" - a drama about two-thirds of a comedy film that changes in a shocking way. And, like almost all the plays, "straight-jacket" unfortunately fails. <br /> <br /> Despite the costly soundtracks of Skywalker sound, the film quality of the film may be very selective. Apart from the extra use of musical soundtracks, there is also a confusing amount. <br /> <br /> This picture is not really meant to make some mockery in the 1950s. In contrast to the "singin" in the rain, along with the appearance of the word, as well as studying the spirit of the studio, it captures Hollywood contests entirely about the presence of the sun, "Streets-Jacket" does not allow Hollywood to illustrate well in the 1950's. Dialogue, set, and behavior of the main characters in the disguise of Hollywood in the late 1950s - Nondescript crypt. Similarly, the 1950s general may be called for lampamping, social trends and fads. Compare to the transformation of Girl's Home - in the 1950s house's mockery of "harmful shops" There is no comparison; The "little shop" hit the nail on the head, even though "straight-jacket" does not even know a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivation seems too bad. Rick Foster is supposed to be generous in a ethics, but he falls almost immediately for an materialist schmuck like Cow Stone. Rick has been fine with Gaia's closeted status for several months. But when it comes to Italy, it is completely unclear because of which the conflict arises. And although Sally falls in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point disappears without comments after a while. Rick Like a gay man in the 1990s, not a homosexual writer of the 1950s. Indeed, modern morality has bitten the film - which should not be done, if it was a satirical look in homophobia in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are lots of plot holes in this angry movie. Saul repeatedly said that he was going to make Freddy Stevens feeds, but never did it - allowing Freddy to sing out. The plot of Jerry and Saul's "In" Girl does not give any idea, and Sally's sudden despair does not make any conclusions. And although Guy acknowledged that he was a gay, apparently it does not matter and he ended a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, no production value drives this movie to be stored. Screenplay by Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. Occasionally, the film looks like a pictured game instead of a motion picture (especially in the office of Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium shots, and the film is incredibly static. The film performed by Chris Conlee, is not any help. Longer scenes will be benefitted from apparently close-point or insertion of changes that will be beneficial. This is not clear due to lack of coverage or poor performance, but the overall effect is to create frustration. <br /> <br /> Designer Thomas Dickens, depending on the CGI effects of Gayi's house, apparently influenced by the film's dominant influence. But CGI looks weird and hokey, and it's very attentive to amateur. <br /> <br /> This photo is my overall impression that jokes are cheap and simple, muddled conspiracy, characteristic inappropriate and way off mark, unmarked nonexistent, performance overbroad and stop off, and comic time off. It's almost an amateur movie. Someone might take high school production and throw 10 million dollars in it.
