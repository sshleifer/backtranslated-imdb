I am very happy that when I saw this sequence in one of my favorite childhood movies I did not expect too much. The story was shameless and disrespectful as a character, and I was disappointed that some of the original characters were not in this signature. I do not think the characters were the same from the previous movie. Charlie has changed, and now, she has a girlfriend. There was some good music in the first film, but the music in this film was disrespectful. In short, this image is not just for me. And, seeing the opinion of another user, it seems like it did not do much for you. It's not worth watching.
