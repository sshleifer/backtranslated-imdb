The movie I have ever seen. In fact, I saw it as one of the more entertaining episodes of MST 3000. It was not good, but for anyone that Manos saw: Looks at the hand knows this one was not bad at all. The giant of the film looked terrible, everyone swam suiting suits, and the plot was ridiculous. I still do not have a formula why they made a monster, they really are not a good reason. The lead lady will be the scrawniest gull I've ever seen. If they throw a gallery that died early in the lead, they would do better. Plus the dolphin acting was great !!!
