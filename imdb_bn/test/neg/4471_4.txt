Steve Martin always respected me for being a funny comedian and a nice actor and I like "planes, trains and automobiles" and "bofinger" - but did not like the "House of the House", it is certainly not Martin's. . Fun work, and it does not seem to be trying to be it, which is simply sad ... <br /> <br /> I do not know; Maybe I do not like this movie because I hired it with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone booths", both of which are great movies, or perhaps it's better than Martin, or maybe it's right. Because I'm in the bad temperament of today's Frankenstein ... However, this film was not very fun or entertaining, and I've never had a smile or a weak chocolate Not more than managed. The film's Gaga, which is really embarrassing, was so committed to the previews of this comedy! I was expecting a "House Bringing" bash an all-out comedy, and I certainly expected more ethnic smile from slapstick comedy and Martin. Instead, we're 'treating' the Queen Latifah to show her on the screen, trying to do her best with her completely inherent character. The funny thing in this clunker is Eugene Levy, but he does not get time to get his screen available. <br /> <br /> I really liked to enjoy the "House Bringing", but I didn t and I would recommend it to someone very hard to find but hard to find Steve Martin fans. Drop it and hire "planes, trains and automobiles" instead ... <br /> <br /> You have a lot of time.
