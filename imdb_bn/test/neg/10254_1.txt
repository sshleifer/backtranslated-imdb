In the early hours of human civilization, they roam around and create long jokes, they hit each other on the head with what they can achieve, and women are never seen and obviously there was a tail at once. These caves lived in a geographically diverse region where there was a cocktail, camel, a monkey - but no women. This movie speaks of seven (or so) spyes about the "sunny" accident - burned their land with a new invention of fire - they are taking water to the new land where they work extra extra for this woman. As well as comedy, such a "great" moment, a fat cave melts in the person's belly, which trembles in his stomach. A monkey throw stones at their heads. A man consume a mouse to get frogs in his stomach. Compulsory "gay" cave This list will continue. The very definition of this movie is the draw of the film. I was bored from the beginning and it got worse because the caves were roaming around each other, creating a humorous joke to kill each other, hit each other and the poor beat Berger, who saw that he had lost a goodbye to a producer. This appears in the dirty. He actually has two bright spots in this film. She does not have a lot of actress so you have to guess why she is ass-ass? Other "bright" spot music. As soon as I heard the score, I sounded it very familiar that I told myself. I never heard the actual score, but the music was for Anne Morrigan indefinitely. This is a nice score and otherwise the best thing about crude, annoying, overwhelming, and ridiculous movies, which is basically a group of messes, is to find a woman for the first time and firstly wants to eat it like some animals, which can be taught. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm fast, because I've tied up the plot! At the end of the film, there are almost 100 or so mostly mostly nude women on screen with the feeling of all the boyfriend pulled off a scab off your knee. This movie was painful and did not provide anything to any real merit. It does not surprise me as it triggered a signal that it offers the one thing that will throws interest in viewers - trail.
