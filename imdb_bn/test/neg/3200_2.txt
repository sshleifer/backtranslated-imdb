I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it is not as good as the first critter. The third episode is a little annoying, but beautiful. And what is this? What a shit! It's stupid and really, really annoying. It's the worst of the series. I can not see it again, because I fell asleep in the first watch. And the bad side of the wig ... eewwww ... that's one of the movie's most awesome moments. In the first 50 minutes, we can not see the small, cyclone monster, that is why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This can be even better. <BR /> <br /> 2/10
