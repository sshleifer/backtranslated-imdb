For most people, Robocop 3 is a film that is really a disgrace for the Robo series. It has some fans and most people hate it for its shameless commercial PG-13 system. Now, I will not say that RoboCop 3 is a good one. Frankly, it sucks pretty well. But as long as the shot correctly and executed film, it crosses this piece of circuit chaos. Yes, the fact is that RoboCop 2 has two bad and unnecessary signals of a free excellence. So if RoboCop 3 turns Rabah into a cartoon super hero, then it can enjoy kids in a very mainstream production - at least it is doing it openly. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know who or what it is about, I do not understand what's going on, I do not understand what a joke is deliberate and which is not. If I try to understand the letters, I do not see any value to say anything, I see the shooting script, no one can trust and it does not seem to work, and I can not believe that Irvin Kishner saw the final result and what he liked to see . Probably he was not astray, Miller, nor Weller and Allen also did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, there are fans of Robocop 2, I know. Most of them are involved in the entire anti-pretension league, any person who rejects any depth, or the first film as an apprentice of academic Roger Ebert Seit. It's just a lot of fun, a good part of the action and great entertainment, the logic goes away. Yes, well, I guess if you are not saying a letter that you can make a fool, you can stay in Arnold's case instead of the welfare. Do not make me wrong, I like a good action film, with pure entertainment pricing it's the only - most satisfying - quality. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not such a thing. <br /> <br /> Look at the first scene. This awesome actor repeated to Roba that he was merely an instrument, and then he went into this objectionable statement about how he can not become a man, where Morphi's wife (who blames the OCP for robot-stockings) after coming out of the blue With this sad moment, and then do not listen again! Obviously, I want to go to this scene, because everyone has this kind of irrationality. It's a twelve-year-old fan boy has completed the screenplay, the character is completely random and says this first, then say. OCP wants to stop crime with a new Robo, especially this drug is called "Nook", but it seems that they really want to be this big capitalist empire and want to control the entire city? Politics is abandoned, I think, comic relief mayor is understood, that villain (played by Tom Nunan, who made a good version of it in the Last Action Hero, and it says a lot) is an addiction, but it is still used for this machine. The woman behind it has an agenda that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> This movie has the infamous role of "hub" while talking about twelve years old, this crazy child who swears by killing people, a child actor I'm not going to be all moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psycho baby in your action movie, go for it. I do not know how Frank Miller's actual view was, but at least credits seem to be "story". And, if I zoom out, I could quite see it as a cool character. It sure, it's a deadly killer kid but then again in this RoboCop world and who would be surprised? OCP is trying to become the monster monopoly in this whole business, in everything Dastopian properly and well. Also, Robboc's concept is embedded in the story through any means by communicating with his wife and children - it would be great, and if I see a natural and logical step, they have to create a RoboCop seagull now. <br /> <br /> But, of course, this is just the idea. Many people have already said that the screen is 100% messy. A scene of a child (torture scene), where it indicates that she is actually a stereotype objectionable child, and then our impossible scene is visible where she is dying and Ol's tin gets all soft and friendly in the head. Why does not he just take Wajee and try to take him with his last breath? What will his character do? Did he think of his life a little second on his death bed? Not necessarily, its last word is "sucks it", so why? It really does not give any idea, and it can be said about everything in this movie. What is the strike of the police force? RoboCop machine or people? What agreement with Robo turning this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, sure, it's pretty funny that I will not deny. But why build it, and then cancel it? And why so much criminal Allen is so guilty? And Weller has a clear desire to express with his character and yes, well, lots of threads and plenty of mess. <br /> <br /> This review is as abusive as the movie. The only reason I gave an extra star because of the actors of the first film, I was sure that they had good intentions. I mean, this is some kind of stable, bad film making anchor to some of the sea.
