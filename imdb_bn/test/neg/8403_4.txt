An annoying film, as it does, is closely followed by a close reunion between a naked man and his younger son, but in his delusional framework, it is a fabulous imaginary visual exploration of the innocence of an ideal fantasy fool. <br /> <br /> This plot follows two threads, among which the growing gravity of Graham / Pablo is increasingly revealed. Harmful through this, a beautiful description of its condition, and its partly awakening towards its awful path, driven by its relationship with Irene. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful thread, when certain platforms are deprecated on the collection of letters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the reason for his condition in a flashy flashback, his impressive b oss and his humorous book crazy scientist psychologist: Everyone has a desire to lose and is dependent. <br /> <br /> The film's failure is in conflict between two threads. A visual, mandatory and slimime, the other has been formatted like a vain thriller, all expository dialogues and deterministic designs. <br /> <br /> I still enjoyed Novo. It is flirtatious with disrespectful arrogance and going away from something beautiful, such as food, bi-basist and two women, when a set-up for a cheap pornography scene becomes part of peace and restoration. Although I still do not get tooth, though. <br /> <br /> Strange, clunky and a failure to describe, but with almost a redemption beauty.
