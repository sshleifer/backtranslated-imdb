There are some strange happenings in the remote areas of the Arctic. An air force's meteorological center has been found, its residents are missing. An eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing ship invisible. Strange spoilers are found in snow. A living creature near a devastated plane is found in a four-foot piece. The piece looks like half of the bird of a giant Alaskan crabs. Army (Craig Steven as Air Force officer) and his specialists are disturbed. A prominent scientist (William Hooper) in New York and his valiant assistant (Alix Taltan) Hooper is frustrated from this raunchy evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous prayer mantis. She is right. Excellent assistant looking at the office window and looking at his face looked at his eyes. He reduces what he carries, tearing his hand in his cheeks and screaming with fear. <br /> <br /> Starting with the Gulf of Mt. south of the Gulf Stream, the main population centers like Washington and New York have repeatedly stopped to attack. Flip the bus and eat the people. Military weapons do not affect it much, but eventually Steven disrupts his jet fighters and severely damages the animal that comes to Earth and occupies the "Manhattan tunnel" with New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, because of his survival in the conflict, took his group to the tunnel and killed a big bug with "3 rd mining" despite his fierce face, threatening behavior and earthquake.

Instead of normal explosives, there should have been 3 argye mines filling. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Nothing else could be spent on anything else because there are so many beautiful routines. Craig Stevens is a moon, a face and a style made for a TV series. William Hooper is right - tall and silver-haired - but his instrument has only one note. Beautiful assistant considers her role, rather plain. Call for part Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They can not work both but carry a little but transparent information with them. <br /> <br /> I think the deadly Montes could not cry loudly so loudly, because you can not roar - even if you do not laugh - if you do not have lungs. I do not think, when the monster met his death in the tunnels. A prayer mantis is a lovely insect in its own spindly way and they have caterpillars and what they eat because they have great in the garden. But when you get it right, they are not really interesting. Male Mantis is smaller and weak than men, as in humans, and when the couple is almost by atonement, a man like a man is also bitten by the head. But at least men know when it will stop. Male Monty keeps on copulating for a few minutes even though he is now headless. We do not have men who are copulating with the target-driven ladies. What are we
