There are a few words to look at this movie: "Sophomic", "ridiculous", "unlikely", "self-motivated" and finally (and seriously), "boring" Badly operated, poorly photographed and played badly, the film can be confused with plot lines (if someone can call it) on all directions. Some people used five-year-old finger painting as a template. As a punishment for the offense of these children in a film, this cast of "stars" should be superb and should be sent to their respective beds without dinner. . After all, it seems George needs an excuse to spend summer holidays with his little friends and we're hungry for it. Bad George! Bad!
