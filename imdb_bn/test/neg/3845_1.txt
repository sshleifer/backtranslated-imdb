This was the worst movie I ever seen. I must admit that I did not start from the beginning that it was more entertaining than to clean the toilet. <br /> <br /> 'The star' I have ever seen is the most unpleasant character, funny or interesting, in fact, strange and objectionable so much complimentary. <br /> <br /> It's painful to see, no acting, especially one of the stars who does not behave as mentally impaired. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The name of the movie is descriptive, she is insect. This movie has to be missed.
