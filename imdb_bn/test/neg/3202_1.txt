Did the writer of this movie not see the three? I love the original, I thought 2 was the best, I've tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hate this one. Who dare to kill the Uighi? It was certainly not the wig that was almost like a brother in Charlie. 2. Charlie said, "You will not leave me on earth, you will be". Wong answered, "Charlie, Beauty Hunter", saying he is now one of them. The authors ignore this special bond between them and make Charlie (especially in painful scenes) a murder, because they realize that the movie is becoming annoying. Actually for the first 20 minutes, we can get a new cast and wait till we know again what happened to Charlie, the hero that we were waiting to see. I said, wait, when will Charlie appear? Angela Basset is trying his best to deny this Turkish always. Reducing the chance of seeing a seagull with the original cast or in our time before moving to the future. The authors have decided that their movie is going to end and they can do what they want. This movie is completely in line with the first two. And it does not even seem that it was written by the same person 3. 3 had less humor and could easily be seen by young children. 4 Just ugly and average-cheerful (Erie Dar) is especially cruel and unnecessary. I hate this movie. Hate, hate, hate it. I hate that that anyone could like it and hate this fact that I destroyed what my favorite camp was a classic. I started this easily because IMDb.com would not let me give it zero.
