I can not reveal any knowledge of cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July, my 14-year-old son and I visited Cappadodia, some residues in Turkey, where his grandfather, Eidern, lived in the year 1923, until the arrival of the vast population of Anatolian Greeks. Read the film summaries (refugees from Odessa). It seems, perhaps I can learn more about forced transit of modern Greeks. If I do not have any houses in Rhodes, I have not been in Greece for many years, I was not familiar with some of the islands and cities of Greece, and if I did not ever enjoy the life of this appealing friendship, I believe this surprise was something to do with modern Greece may be. As a professor of New Jersey State College, I assure you that I know about the history of the time covered in the film. In fact, the communists killed my wife to gain power. My mother-in-law was alive through the Italian invasion and German occupation ... barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek, they hear Greek music but who are they? No, they are not even weird Greeks. Of course they are not only but all people of fairy tales. They invent artists when life is not fully fit or inadequate in the absence of what it was or what it should be. Some aspects of all WWI Greece posts represent that the outer force favors the external forces which they did not deserve. At the end of the 70's in the United States, we were fascinating: "The revolution did not happen." For an ideological / artist, this is not a joke. This is actually the reason for us to suffer for two and a half hours. And for this reason, the power of Eleanir's "protector" to protect various "uniforms" of different uniforms (the uniforms of "uniforms") did not allow generations to follow the call of peace and independence of the "nobles" of 1919 (Spiros) (Nicos and his music colleague, musician, movement, cause) . This dark, exaggerated revisionism, the genuine and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their desire for life through the tragedy of the 20th century, to achieve more than their belligerent neighbors, has become so politically advanced and integrated into the world.
