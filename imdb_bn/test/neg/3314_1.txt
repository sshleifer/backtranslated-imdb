It is beautiful that these three young directors have produced the film with good production quality and moderate acting. Here are some good jobs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they suffer most of the modern gay movies; Recycled plots, very familiar devices (I've seen the "pool" setting in men's films multiple times) and hackneyed scripts. The best of all, "Dorothy", whose initial stability is that a cute young man is relieved of being abandoned in NYC because his identity is not available. Because <br /> <br /> Shorts play like little little gay afterschool special. There is no imagination in their writing or execution; Basically they follow a dot and shoot, follow the shot / feedback shot / master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes. Todd Haines, Sadie Benning and Late, there is hope for quirrers in the works of great Marlon Rigs ... but not here. These films are incredibly middle-class, singly white bread and their values ​​basically pander to a gay bourgeoisie sensitivity. Perhaps why they play so well in homosexual movie festivals.
