This series does not represent the British view of revolutionary war, it is the American anti-American doctrine The underlying theme of the series is that a quiet majority colonists enjoyed British rule; The founding father was a manipulative schemer whose only purpose was to bring Britain to a violent civil war; That Revolution and militia American supporters were duped in racist, violent lawn, struggle. Obviously, the author's intention, Richard Holmes, is to direct this feature to the audience, in line with the American population of 1775 to present today's outline. For example, in this episode "The Shot Over the World" Boston has put a vague impression on the genocide, in which he claims to be a black man and a black man who killed the revolution, intentionally "became scared ". Holmes claims that the portrayal of Attks as a black man has been spreading evil for revolutionary reasons. He never knew how to publish. And there are more. Holmes goes on to do a single, unsubstantiated, tyranny for some length: a British soldier's body's impurity. He compares American militia to Viet Kong and Mujahideen - without mentioning any difference in the goals of this group. The list is running <br /> <br /> Remember that this series was created in response to Mail Gibson's "The Patriot." This is a lot of academics when Mel Gibson feels the need to respond to any issue. Instead of presenting British view, it seems that Homes really wanted to give an exciting, American-American outlook, and in this process, he himself created Roger's chronology of historians - strictly third-rate scholars.
