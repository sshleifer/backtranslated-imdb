Christopher Lambert has attracted me in this picture. What a waste! The plot has more holes than my string west, special effects were not very good, created the mother of the creature, and the animal was not given much credit to the predator as a small lender. Anti-climatic can make this movie even better. It does not raise an interesting point then. When Hollywood is going to discover the richness of European populations, is it just waiting to be excavated?
