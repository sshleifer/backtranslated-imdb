I saw this movie without any idea what it was already. I had the plot for the first full hour. It was shaped up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good conversation. Then it all fell apart for me in the eyes of the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point of view was completely awkward. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4 stars at the very beginning of brightness. I feel a little generous, but I was entertained for some time. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movie. If you are, you can agree with my opinion.
