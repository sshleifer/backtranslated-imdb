Films based on Jacqueline Susan's best selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) a cruel TV anchorman who gets his way upwards. It describes the life of her love by concentrating on Amanda (Jodie Wexler) and Judith (Dian Canon). It shows its complete inability to commit to someone else and instead sleeps with any woman. <br /> <br /> The novel is not a work of art (it's also not good literature) but it's quick, stupid, trashy. But this movie seems to have "gone with the wind"! This is a mobile phone example that can not be adapted to a movie. At first they narrow the horror novel. Stone's incompetence has been tackled in the book and why it has been published. Here it is brought ... and ignored. There is also a real rebel scene where a woman is beaten brutally. It is in the book - but there are reasons to completely exclude the film. And deal with three women in the book - not two. Do not even let me start in Homophobia. <br /> <br /> Actually terrible. The law is just awesome as the stone - very woody and annoying - you wonder why all these women wonder after her. To be fair in the act - another actor was cast but before the start of shooting and a law was a very bad accident in the last minute. Wexler is terrible as non-violent; Morin Arthur is really astonishingly similar to that of Ethel Evans! Shaki Greene is helpless like Christie Lane. Only three performances stand: David Hemings (has a great time) camped as a gay photographer; Canon is really good and Robert Ryan is just great. Also Diane Warwick has sung the song of interesting opening ("He Moving On"). <br /> <br /> It's bad, but I've seen the whole thing and it's (funnily) a lot of fun. I'm giving it a 3. <br /> <br /> There is also a Camio as a newscaper by Jacqueline Susan.
