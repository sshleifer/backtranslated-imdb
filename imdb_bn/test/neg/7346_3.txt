Is not it depressing on how cartoon networks are targeting the most violent cartoon girls? When I did not shoot the soldiers to save the soldiers or brand of the soldiers when I shot them, it would be better if I could meet my violent desire on cartoons or at least some TVs. And something that I would not have been fun for watching. I've seen some episodes (I must shoot for it) and have to sit through movies (now, where can I find a gun?), And it is quite clear that it lost its Spark after the first few episodes. If you want to see 500-pound monsters that can destroy large cities by a few feet of little boys imagining a foot, but it must be seen. But after a while it became very annoying, and with such a program even the main ideas also became obscure. The film felt like a haphazard episode (I could not remember any of it), and the villain was much more horrible than green monkeys. This show is a ridiculous stock. After episode, it releases the same basic prizes episode, and although in a little while it may try some mystery and plot but the end will be the same - "Save the Powerpuff Girl's Day!" All good and beautiful, but all very, very repetitive ... I give 3 out of 10 to roam it as the only risky cartoon of CN, though it is the target of girls, so I will not tune it for ever. I have established myself as a fight and violence films and my reputation will not be destroyed ... 3/10
