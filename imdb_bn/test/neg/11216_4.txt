The young Lord Dustikoff, young Lord Greystock, was released as a child on the Pacific Island. But instead of being raised by Afghanistan, he fell in the hands of a Japanese soldier, who was still there because he had not heard of the war. And like the young boy Luke Skywalker, it became active that he learned to be able to fall into a ninja fighting skills. <br /> <br /> The best thing is because they got separated and the little baby came in a hungry way, but those who do not go away fighting skills. The orphan child, now Armstrong, an army called and placed itself in the Philippines. Already, Obi Van KÃ¶nb managed by John Fujoco himself, and went to work as a plant and estate estate gardener and went to Don Stewart instead of a Chasey accent in French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> All of these happen together in the event and both of them solve the mystery of the past, and protect the girl from the commanding officer's daughter from the bad guys in this Golan-Glabas production. Charles Birston now had a little more time in the tooth and Golan-Globes needed a new star for their activities. Michael Dudicuff has filled the bill nicely, and has produced several films for several American Nine Seals. <br /> <br /> This picture sends bad guys all the work and two fast track records. What he does not do, Steve James is imitating his best Rambo and seeing his significant martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes in this plot to play a single force in this movie. But that does not care about ticket purchasing tickets. Dudikup certainly shows his war dress wearing nicely. No wonder so many sequels are made.
