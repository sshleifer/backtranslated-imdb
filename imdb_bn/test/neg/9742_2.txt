This letter has never been hired by the post office, far away from me. The medical staff who accept it is so difficult. There is no way that post office can do this stupid job. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and probably the movie's point. How can they go to their whole life and can not see an elevator confusing? I did not take this movie very seriously, but it was stupid. Then tried to start the car without his keys? Terrible scenes and terrific acting lots and this movie is not all fun. It's just a sad stupid mess. I liked the moms dress though. <br /> <br /> Send sender as soon as possible Send it.
