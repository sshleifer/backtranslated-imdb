Plot involves moving from Kevin's barbershop to a new, conspiracy franchise barbershop that runs throughout the street. So, he seems to have to change and improve his shop like getting new stuff and such. Real exciting hah For the rest of the film, it includes the same material from the first film. The people standing around Calvin, speaking loudly and closing their face with each other. Cedric was again humorous and entertaining, but instead of doing anything with the movie, he started the study-up routine. And Calvin has another moral problem in which a large amount of money is accepted. He has already shown that he will do the right thing at the end. <br /> <br /> Last messaging: nothing new. I do not recommend it if you were not the best thing from the first pear bread.
