This is one of the most mixed up movies I have ever seen. Everything in the film was connected to justify some other elements glued. There is also a talking torch that wants to get her wet nose magic. Even the barbarian father seems trapped in an excuse to fly the children to a garden. It was ridiculous, but it seems that it was used in an uncomfortable way due to complex issues.
