Cruel action scenes, but the gradual gradual gradual development of the film gradually gradually develops slowly and slowly, gradually, gradually and gradually develops a serious horror story ... In what sense? But, in his defense, the action scenes were quite effective, even if they let you open your head, but why did they happen. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say about the movie. It makes no sense that a slick, stupid action adventure. It's like to see a bad version of Matrix and exclude all the stories and conversations.
