Nilson got the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie does not want to be fun. I think nude guns and similar movies are that they do not want Nilsson to be fun. He played a direct role in the role he played in, as straight as he was. But when you keep him in the movie where he wants to be fun, he is not. The film was only a good part and it could be considered by some as a spoiler, and that started credit was animated. If the whole movie is animated, it can be good. When I saw these ads, I had no desire to see this movie, and the only reason I saw it was because it gave me the competition on the radio. This is the first and probably the only movie I've ever been out of. On the scale of 1-10, I scored this movie-100.
