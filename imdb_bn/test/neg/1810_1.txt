Taylor Erie Mrs. Drake English 10 PIB B4 31 March 2010 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a little step in the opening of this movie. So, how the idea of ​​converting it into a movie seems completely offhand concept, basically guarantees a failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the books are about the mental journey of a young soldier's mental journey through a lot of people in Congo and the people of Marlow? I think printers have failed to capture authors. Marlow's Travel Summary. It missed the biggest problem of light vs. the whole dark. The main point of the book and when it does not translate to the movie, the remainder is about 100 minutes of annoyance and monogamy. <br /> <br /> This is the case, the question is raised, why would someone turn it into a movie? Even a good question could be asked, who would like to see it? It's completely a clock watch. Although I could not contribute to a grade in my English class, I never thought of watching the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If taken from the book's page, the heart of darkness breaks all its insights and meaning. The novel is the pain of reading until the last 20th century or later, but later it is a beautiful book. There is no chance in the world to hit his target like a shot in the movie darkness. <br /> <br /> How is a book that can be described in a physical, visual sense about the psychological process and perception of darkness? I think it is impossible to think properly. Also, I feel the time difference between books and the movie creates major points that do not seem to be associated with them. In the year 1902, the novel of the Hack of Darkness was released, when the film version of Heart of Darkness was released from 1993. Of the two, 91 years may be the reason behind the different terrains. The novel appears to be very harsh, and the film does not represent the prehistoric feeling of the Congo. In the film, the Democratic Republic of Congo seems to be another place, not a dark, inhuman place that this book illustrates this color. I think it's another big thing that really contributes to the novel, <br /> <br /> Two of the biggest aspects of the missing stories in the film, it is with the little diversities of the book's book of darkness. When the light vs dark debate is the biggest theme, until it is included in the film, does it consider the whole movie as incredibly meaningless? And it's It is shameless, unexciting, and a big waste of time. There is no reason to see it. In the book it is stripped any significance. If needed, read the book for some reason. Avoid all spending movies. <br /> <br /> Cast and credit Marlow: Team Roth Curtze: John Malkovitch Russian: Morton Faldas Objectives: Nicolas on the Phobia <br /> <br /> Directed by Nicholas Rog Benedict Fitzgerald Written Time by Joseph Conrad: 100 minutes rated PG 13 (some sex and language)
