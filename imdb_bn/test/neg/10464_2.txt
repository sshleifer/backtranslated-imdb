Well I would probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie, I honestly thought that it was a piece that meant that the actors had done a terrible act and the script was all terrible. Although special effects were not a little bad, I think it should have been much harder to think. I understand how Clara Bryant successfully entered this movie, that means he would do more, if he looked a bit more and Christine is the same with honey, then his character dies and he does not get bothered to save himself. There will be jokes. He has to do better than at least one soldier or heroine or brave line. But at the point, the actors have done cruel acts and the director and writer who created this image. They went to the Film School to think of some good ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my approach because they can probably figure out the same thing.
