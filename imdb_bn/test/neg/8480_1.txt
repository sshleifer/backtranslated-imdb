There was no need for this movie, easy and easy. Actually, although some people hated, I was really really delighted, before Jim Carey started to lose his touch and Cameron Diaas was good, "SmuWeekin!" 'Said Naf. So why a sequel / prequel thing? Really? Jim Kerry did not deserve to be made that it should be specified that it would not. But then they make mistakes after making mistakes. Jammy kennedy Why are these people still allowed to breathe? Writing and Story: Terrible Why would I want to see a baby wearing a mask? Besides, why do I want to fly? Ever? How did somebody think of a good idea ?! Acting is hateful, in fact almost everything about this movie. I'm trying to stay calm, or IMDb probably does not let me post this. Bottom Line: Do not see this piece of trash. Raise the key, how good Cameron Diaz was and how Jim Carey used a carrier and laughed. Do not waste this even a second of your time.
