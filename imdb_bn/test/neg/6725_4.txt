Bad acting? Yes, but it was not a surprise. Stupid story Yeah, so what? <br /> <br /> Why, tell me, Mr. Director, why is all slow shit? The scene due to slow and bad cutting, bad bad, was really bad. Not because of seagal. <br /> <br /> "If I increase this speed for just 2 seconds and then slowly and again in the next 5 seconds ... then do I have to decide on the currency?" Do you think, Mr. Director ???
