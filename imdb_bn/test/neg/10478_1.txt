First of all I accept that a separate peace is my favorite book. Of course, I have some bias against any attempt to adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But when I started watching this movie, then I was willing to give the benefit of doubt. Since the early 1970's, the original version shot at the Phillips Exeter Academy, where the authors of the book read at school and it was faithful like the book, but lacked the true depth of feeling and failed to hold the essence of the character. The original just started to go through the speed. Reading quarterly about the film, you discover that it was cast with most non-actors. So, the real feel is a amateur and it eventually fails. <br /> <br /> Although this new version will provide me that it draws attention to a better time than the real time, it seems that the book has dropped out all together. The curtains are rearranged, no attempts have been made to stimulate deeper conflicts that do not include letters, which are not made in books, and books make them so compulsory. And the basic sin of all: The tree is not considered important, it is almost central character book. This is an unnecessary surveillance of filmmakers. How could they downplay the role of trees? Why did not it start immediately? Why the dead poet-esque start? And what was God's name up with the pronunciation of the jinn? This is to be a movie, bud, garbage. To adapt for a separate peace stage or screen, it should not be a difficult book. John Knolls wrote this a perfectly fine, linear style. The story of the filmmakers should have been written earlier; Change, confirmation; Embrace here and there, sure; Take some light dramatic licenses, make sure. But how does the process of emancipation in American literature get destroyed? What did they think? Story lines cut their corruption, they suspense or no possibility of the drama. The whole film fell flat and unfortunately failed. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of high school or college, you are employed to read this book and you think skimming and watching movies only ... do not even think about it. This picture will not help you. <br /> <br /> Yes, a version of this story must wait a long time before it comes to the screen, which really does judge.
