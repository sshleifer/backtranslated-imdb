Before I left, this Turkey's 35 minutes ruined my life. The main character is completely weird and surprisingly disrespectful, but there is no laughter in her blundering. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the screenwriter is the only "hotel room, you have to share a room with a beautiful girl" stunt. Come on, at least you can develop them first of their bits. "It happened one night" to see how it can be done correctly - then see thousands of movies from it. <br /> <br /> The acting should have been consistently third-rate, and the discarded dialogue should have been left in the floor of the living room. The film adapts television from Greater's moment to a telegraph creator from the destination of relations without any plan. <br /> <br /> The first song in the boardroom is funny but funny. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I only heard those who are the first half-hour) are simply vain and terrible. Most singers tune out impressively, but no deliberately ridiculous way.
