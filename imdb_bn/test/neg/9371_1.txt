True calling was good but it could be great. The idea is inspiring and approved for serious strange and horrific story lines that have been explored in the future. Unfortunately the authors and actors show grief. <br /> <br /> The text was not very bad, but the hole was there. In Episode 13, "Drop Dead Gossesses", incredibly poisonous poison is used to kill victims. This was so poisonous and there was so much time to shout victims for hunting victims or even for help. Nevertheless, there was no logical explanation for what the killer did not get such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> Episode 15, "The Gateway", off-duty police responded unrealisticly. In the second dinar scene, he (humbly) ordered the robber to drop the gun and when he did not follow the order, and actually turned the gun under his command, then he obstructs him and then makes hostage? In the very situation he will be warned about. When he fails to follow his orders and should rob him of robbery while bending his gun. There are other errors in the story but I will leave with these two examples. Despite the flaws of writing, I like the show. <br /> <br /> Another problem was that I could not accept Elisa Dushku in this list. In my opinion, he is very inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part. He did not walk anywhere, he marched; And very often he came to a sudden stop at his mark. <br /> <br /> She had no emotional facial expression or lack of exploitation. She is either a sharp look or a cute smile; Seldom the other emotions are clear. When he tries to appear dramatically, he starts opening his line and then turns his eyes on his colleague. Or alternatively he starts his line towards his opposite side and then looks away. Both are annoying when working as replacements for true passion. At the time of his second marriage speech, the paragraph 20 in paragraph "two marriages and a finerlle", an example of lack of his feelings. (<br /> <br /> <br />) I've liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all credible. True writing with advanced writing and a lead change may be made of it.
