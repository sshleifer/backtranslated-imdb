Oscar winner Great Yule Brenner and others, 'The Ten Commandments' have played blockbusters who have finished his extraordinary career with such extraordinary backlit films like 'Sartana' and so on. Reggable, indeed. To make this stupid thing stand, he should be sorry to see his well-wisher. On that day he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bonson, Eli Wallach, surrounded by The Magnificent Seven, and under the famous Illmar Bernstein soundtrack. Sometimes it is difficult to be alive outside an actor.
