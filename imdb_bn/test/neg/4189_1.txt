This is the worst 'horror' movie ever since, no, no movies, I have ever seen. Even the sham on the block buster for carrying such missile carry. I never want to return to a movie, but I think it will be the first one. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I only have to wait 15 minutes to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The marketing dude should have some silver tongues for this movie so that it can be moved to the organization. Blockbuster.
