Someone has already been mentioned on this board, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires sophisticated skills, pacing, patience, pointing 'distance,' a potential court, a descriptive 'flow' and a true credible performance (senior acting). <br /> <br /> This is not the 'love machine'. It began to show his uncle's hand about 20 minute marks (remaining left for 60 minutes) and the audience began to understand that he was being taken away. It has been flying out. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Arischsen very soon taught. But Erisen's problems started very quickly when he was fair: he explained in additional languages, he wanted to make a real dock, could not finance it and settled for his cheap way of film making. <br /> <PREVIOUS • VIEW ALL • PRINT • NEXT> Eriksen has many clever things - a pushy 'host,' handheld camera, zoom, grains black and white - all, I guess, arouse a sense of authenticity, but it does not work. The film is confusing and compulsory, but eventually it brings down the credibility of the actor and the awesome horror dialogue.
