Tagline: Lucky people have died ... before watching it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the Bulgarian movie in the 1920s, so I can not say that it is the worst movie, but it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not remember it almost. <br /> <br /> I can remember that the family of stupid people who do nothing right. Their car has a wheel stuck in the sand four, so they have nothing to do there and decided to prepare them to save the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who was aware of the presence of a cancer band around, but never told this idea to tell the police. <br /> <br /> The police say ... if the fires have eaten people for years then many people will disappear ... Sheriff has no doubt how? <br /> <br /> I asked the question after the first five minutes or so. The rest is bore. <br /> <br /> I will be kind and not talk about conversations. And acting. And effects <br /> <br /> I'll only mention the final scene, where the gentle girl will remove a snake (snakes! they come out eventually, what do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-specific throw of stones, reality For Mr. Craven and the ordinary earth show complete disregard for things that are happening on the planet. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film was riotous when it first released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even the victims of the shelling will not be punished with a fair penalty on the intelligence of the attack on intelligence.
