"Three" is a serious fool to break the ship. Masking as a psychological thriller, it has the highest "Dead Kalma" (also features Billy Jane) of the nearest relative monument. "Dead Kalma" Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's tragic parents provide good pictured letters to try to redefine their relationships on the ocean cruise. They are becoming terrorists by Jane's proud psycho-killer. As the cat and mouse game of life and death become exposed, it offers a terrific feeling of open sea clustrophobia, a rocketed mystery intensely. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on "three" poorly depicted characterization (not the audience), a stupid and unnecessary Voodoo plot device, total lack of suspicion and excitement, and some players and major players' Hammy Performance. Especially Zane goes the way to the top of an irritatingly mannered fashion. She is tragic, boring and boring with little sexually controlled violence. Here he is bombarded, petulant, slimy, and unraveled. And where does he find his seemingly dry cigarette and unexhaustible supply of cigar? And how does its lighter come full juice of juice for a year? Ms Brooke is very nice, pretty fantastic, but seems to have been overly-inflated wildly by some sort of life-ruff pumps both on his chest and back. However, they succeeded in acting more efficiently and firmly than the others. The dramatic actress, in the pure sense of the word, is not he. The third element of this tragic triangle can be replaced by a group of driftwood playing Voodoo-hexed manual - no one will notice. In fact, by judging by its complete lack of communication in a meaningful or dynamic way, Driftwood represents a possible improvement in the casting cast (excuse). <br /> <br /> Plus parties: The scene is beautiful and cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I guess it's very limited (if any) went into dramatic release or direct DVD and retail DVD. This is because it is not very good. If you want something decent along this line, get "dead calm". It was created by those who knew a bit about the movie.
