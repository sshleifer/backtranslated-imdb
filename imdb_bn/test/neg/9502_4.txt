(Only light spoilers here) <br /> <br /> About stolen, Sinatra is a semi-slapstick comedy about hijacked dimmiters, violent victims, and some other side stories to eat some time. <br /> <br /> You will see some poor performance around this movie. The drama is bound, and humor makes no sense. Do the kidnappers see that those who do not stop the victim or the victim's father will not respond to the threat of the death of the criminal, "Will some tea take care?" None of which is trustworthy. This fits quite comfortably in the "wannabe movie" category. <br /> <br /> You will hear a repetitive secret music track across the entire movie. It's quite unusual, and adds nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Enough tales. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
