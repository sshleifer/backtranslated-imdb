[Probable spoilers] <br /> <br /> The six "Halloween" film is a desperate depressing affair, but unfortunately is not casual by filmmakers. Until now, everyone knows how it was torn apart and released in such a dirty, incoherent way. The second half, in particular, does not give any idea in any sense, because platform elements are introduced and excluded, seemingly random. The very last left me scratching my head. What's going on? What is the death of Dr. Lumis? You get this when you put a shameless hack to charge a motion picture. This is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> In a related note, the most graphical violent entry in this series. I do not have any problem with Gore if it is in the right place, but this film is taken to the stupid level. The infamous Explosion head will be a new low for the series. Michael himself seems to enjoy enjoying the murder of another man, who is inconsistent with his effective, methodical approach to John Carpenter's main system. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who was responsible; Director Joe Chapel or producer, both are probably a combination. I would be happy to apologize to all concerned if I wanted to publish only "Concerned Producers", a complete version of this movie which is a huge improvement from each account. From what I understand, it's like a different movie. If Miramax arrives in his senses and publishes it, then I propose to pay the full price of the DVD. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements, however. Michael's idea being confused by the drums is confusing. Paul Rudd is as strong as Tom's Doyle, whose appearance is decorated with the original Instant visual activities help make a bit more watchable. But these small drugged drills have been put on overloaded people. Finally, the "Curse of Michael Mayers" is well-known for the last film of Donald Plusance. Many of his scenes were dropped from the final cut, and when he appears, he feels helpless and unhappy. The film is dedicated to its memory, if there is any, but it is a vague (if unexpected insult). This is even very depressing for even thinking that a talented actor should end his career. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Released by the movie
