I really wanted to like this movie. Previews looked fun, but I think they keep most fun stuff in previews. In this case, they did not do just that, but they have wiped the clips so that they are much more fun than actual movies. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Von, The Rock, Sidrick The Entertainment, etc. So I wanted to like this movie but it never did anything. <br /> <br /> I did not care to drink it and did not particularly care about it. For me too slow and unfunny. This movie is certainly no good and, if anything, is bad. There were many opportunities for some good humorous moments, but none of them accepted it. <br /> <br /> The acting was okay but John Travolta seemed to be so. Cedric was right but he was in the kingdom to be really fun. Vince Vaughn and Rock are quite good and ready to be funny but they just let it all pass them. I hope they had the opportunity to follow up with the fun things set up, but instead it was just going back to the old stuff and was able to make the land and the rock entertaining (although it did not really allow to give) punchline or comedy). <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a very frustrating movie and I was happy to see it in the video only. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
