Living people, is this game bad or what? The graphic is like the bottom, even if it is a PlayStation 1, do not remember a game. The gameplay is unfortunate and disorienting the movement of the camera. <br /> <br /> I love Warner's Batman animation perfectly and it's good that they do all these games. Batman: Vengeance may become great due to the start of a great introduction to all Gothic visual and voice actors, but it becomes critically disappointing in terms of platyity and graphics. Any annoying game that shows the results incredibly cheap and no sport is fun. I really want to put a lot of pressure on the graphics. Do not let the color scheme fool you. I have seen 64 good things in a combo.
