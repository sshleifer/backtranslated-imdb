OK, this movie has started and it looks like * it's going to be an intelligent comedy about the completely obscure soap opera fan. He has no contact with anything outside of Saban (opposite "main character" in Pliggentville) and goes away from Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, this is an intelligent film ... but at the same time, it is a dark, very violent movie about two Hitman which is out of place to kill Batei due to the complex reasons of mentioning here. A platinum was enough in its own stages, but "nurse betty" has both stories together, and the effect is very annoying. I did not enjoy it much
