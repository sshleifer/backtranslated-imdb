This film is a remote relative with him in his apartment in Istanbul, about the frustrating and emotionally impaired people. When the time is over, their relationship becomes more strained until finally he starts screaming at the guest of his house - who comes out of the job and does not see everything he is interested in to find work. That's actually the most movie. The problem is though, emotionally narrow and depressed people are too much withdrawn and non-communicative, but they do not create a very satisfying movie. Because he is mostly sitting in space (and in his room) and does not say anything. I think these flat moments can be summarized for making 30 minute movies - I certainly did not think so.
