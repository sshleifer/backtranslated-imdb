Now it's 2008, who is really careful about a man like DB Swine, yet he was not a big deal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Again, a proven plot. The problem with this movie is that it is 'so bad its compulsory', besides the script, the script. <br /> <br /> Three people after the cliche saw the same thing in other road movies ... <br /> <br /> Mr. C. McGinley's acting work is fantastic, especially compared to late DB Swine. (His carrier has died, so late, even though I have heard that he is going to TV, good for him). Also, John C is probably the least awful character in the movie. <br /> <br /> It looks really generic that you are watching third-rate films since 1993, or there is Jeff Anderson's movie YouYU (also set me back a few years back, but at least that was more entertaining.) I mean, yes , I guess I enjoy part of it. However, innocent people are annoying, DB tries as a great failed guitar player (with some dominant effects, some of the worst things like some classic rock), which has some strange relationships with a stripper and John C is a gambler who is the wife and boy his father After his death and after leaving an interview with his wife Girlman, she left. <br /> <br /> I am thinking of ways to make this movie even better. But I think the script may start healthy. <br /> <br /> But I have indicated this whole time, this is not the worst movie ever. And no chance I will play the role of acting in McGinley, I will take it. Hope he starts getting some good projects.
