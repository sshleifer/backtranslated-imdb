The film opens with beautiful landscape shot in the North West countryside. Fenceposts from the Sondi world, beyond a freight train, crosses the haystack, clouds of light, small structures by the side of the street, somewhere a motel or a diner in the middle It runs a weaker, twisted-pick piano piano system, and it is an American Gothic kind of way that is sufficiently moody and atmospheric Through this, John Jost, the color frames that declare "Blue", combine numbers that count toward the advanced credits on "12 steps to the conclusion", leaving strange frames, letter blocks, credits open with annoying sovishing words. In the first few minutes it is clear that even though Joist is not able to capture the landscape and ambiance, he does not care about it. There is no affection for the open expanses of the Pacific Northwest that the owner of the Terrence is in Badland and there is no time or twin pickings for David Lynch at any time or for a specific location to create a mystery and trick. <br /> <br /> John Joest frustration with experimental techniques that serve the rest of the film their own purposes. Split screen usage is interesting, I especially love how Ricky Lee's first film is divided into two, childhood memories are described only to him, the other curses his head and pushes his head against the wall, and in the context of Ricky Lee's second episode of the film , The hipster behind the head with the galaxy, which is frustrating self-involved and stupid. On the other hand, most of the movie choices do not work on Stop Motion Animation and Voice Over. Sometimes Joost has written that he painted static shots of little American American Naughtsville but many psychologists of Beth-Eon delivered the most frequent fantasy monotonas, a voice that crossed a horse thief like Stephen Hawking's computer lecture program. So try to pay attention to the frustration so close to the ear. <br /> <br /> Each couple relates to us with their past experiences, their little win and fad and doubts and past relationships. They say little to each other and what they say with empty mouth. But they curl like rabbits. It seems that their only channel of communication is open, perhaps only they can believe in any security. Joest clearly loves the main characters of the framework in the Fake and Confusion, which became visible by the American Dream, but he did not set himself above them. He is not condescending or smug in his portrayal. They may be confusing, but they are indifferent with the moment of humanity, although they may be weird. We are empathize and called to show affection than the dot and laugh. It becomes the most successful framework; When the characters of the film are alive, they do not even come to life, even when Joest goes on his way with his holesome framing and unauthorized camera games. <br /> <br /> Then we get angry with the devastating effects of money, playing an inserted shot of a dollar bill, we've got a strange psychedelic sequence where the joystick glides beneath a large leafy tree, which soon turns beetroot red, Ann repeatedly talks about "the Void Road tree", we can even turn around and talk about Beth Ann and Ricky Leah's couple Just like small towns revolve around a missile and they do not have to return to the end of their death, reaching California and deciding to loot 7/11. The movie is not looking at an emotional crossend after the 7/11 fraud, as can be expected from a couple-on-the-run run-round movie, it gradually stops and you really do not really get the window to see it. Part of the ride has been hypnosis and almost touching and fun part, but all other things have been quite annoying.
