I can get over the political parody; Even if this "Horser Masters" could be flickered. However, what I can not achieve is that the obvious use of our war heroes (and their sacrifices) washed away some of the awesome creator's political statements. <br /> <br /> It was completely humiliating to Arlington, and to insult our heroes. I have family at ARLANTTON. The idea that this guy (Dante) has even bothered to the graveyard of the Atlantic just wanted to blown me. <br /> <br /> I worked with Dante and done it with MOH.
