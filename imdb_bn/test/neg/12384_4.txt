Pilot Mitch McAfee (Jeff Morro) sees a UFO when flying a flying flight - but nothing shows up in the radar. Then the planes and ships started invisible and reported a UFO rise. It turns out it is a giant monster bird attacking and killing. But what is it and why here? <br /> <br /> It has all the right elements for a classic. It actually has a fantastic entertaining script - I was not really bothered. Good acting (for a 1950's giant movie). Moro Macau does not make much of the hero acting and Mera Cord is very good for the interest of the woman in love. He is also strong and taking care of himself - although he is drinking food and coffee for everyone during the movie. Here's the problem giant. Dear God - It's impossible! It looks like a fragile turkey! It has a long neck, a sunny fool, some teeth, a few strands of her head and claw hair. And - oh yes - it squawks! No roar - squawking! The actor did not have any idea what it was like - it was added after production. When actors Morro and Cord finally saw them in a theater, they were scared. Morro said to laugh at her smile, before the movie was over, the theater left! Producer Sam Katzman is responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world a silly monster. And you can see it moving wire too! It gets 4 stars because Moro and Cord are so good and the script is well done. It gets no big for a kind-hearted giant - wait until you see it to attack what a toy train is! Become a horror fan to see what you will ever be a terrible giant to look at.
