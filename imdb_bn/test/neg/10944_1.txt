Most people get the luxury of typing a movie title and looking for the movie before watching it, but unfortunately I have never been in such kind of people. I would not even read the study for the fear of the spoilers, but because there are two parties you ignore such warnings and give a chance even after a movie flopped in the theater, you are entering into your own risk and may be right. <br /> <br /> To say, the only thing good for the Shackleka-Cop-Cop (and the title track excluding seriously) is the title track. Even the talent of Kangana Ran (metro, gangster, oh lama) is also seriously damaged due to the competition, because he played Ruii, who attracted the attention of leading male character, directed by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ Ruthless Music Producer). And Apane Patel (who plays the upcoming artist who is passing through a new way). Selina Jettley correctly renders OOMPH which requires a socialite, who is jailed by Regi (who helped her get to the door of the record industry). Is not it a word like a mix or movie that should be included in anupam khair properly? Well, you're wrong because he's a rage father (another talent talent). <br /> <br /> This picture was not so bad that he died without writing the character of Deol. The moral message was very public (the revenge was a deadly dark side) and the end was so strong that it would surprise you why you were sitting in such a stupid movie in the first place. Really, this shit is epitome.
