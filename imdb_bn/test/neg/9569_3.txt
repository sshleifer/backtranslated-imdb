Well, I saw this movie during the last San Sebastian Film Festival. It was the reaction ... Let's say funny as the movie unreasonably. It happened that they showed a copy with the terrible wrong Spanish subtitles. They began to be a translation from Chinese to English and then Spanish. It was all confusing, the jinn was switched (girls appeared as girls and boys as girls), and my friends and I have to remember the great line ... but they were so stupid. Everything is not good movie, but if they ever show it on TV, and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie) then go forward, "visible secrets" your movie.
