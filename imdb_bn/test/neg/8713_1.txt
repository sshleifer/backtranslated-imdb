A very, very, very slowly moving, aimless movie about an inferior, drifting young man. Not sure who's gone more - flat characters or listeners, almost half of the time went out. <br /> <br /> The film has become frustrated by trying to neutralize black and white and shiny camera corners - even the performance was poor and the plot and line almost existed. Very little music or something to talk about. When Gerardo was trying to find a song running through his head, the film's best scene was there. She used to go to a used record store to use it for her boyfriend and sing the song for two sales clerks before searching for the album. Beautiful scenes have promised, but it has been flying out. The rest of the film contains art, charm, meaninglessness ... If it is empty, then it is assumed that it is empty. Two hours have been lost.
