This piece of fork is actually barb, as barrel bottom. I can not think of the worst; Norris's anonymous screenplay (no performances are a great feature of the playwright) or the violent reaction of Christopher Nee. This image is never delivered on any level. Action sequences are considered thames, plots thin paper, and scenes that look terribly like a clich√© in the fifties. You can not just fill a room with smoking and men in rubber suites and hope to scream the audience in terror. This film is apparently nothing for me. This is actually an uncomfortable mix between an inexpensive porn flickr and Macau's Vice Rip-Off, which sprinkles the hell-spun a little. No, wait. That will be hell-fire.
