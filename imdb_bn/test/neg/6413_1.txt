This is the most stupid movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and child thinks he's crazy. Then they do not. Then it turns out and I think they all knew it along. There's a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault ... so there's Jim Carrio. To know how Virginia Madsen played this role, God only knows ... it's the carrier's sync I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years old. And it is added up to 23. Or it can be for ages 8 and 10, which adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 23 years old fools. Or maybe totally stupid 32 years old because of the opposite 23. Or maybe 46-year-old people will enjoy it because half of it is 23 I think the things on the Internet are looking for number 23, this will be more entertaining than the movie, unless you want to see a comedy.
