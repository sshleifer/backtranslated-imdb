Yes, the film is not a piece of art, but for the first time I saw that I was 10 years old, my parents were outside and I stayed at home with my two brothers. It was in May 1970. (I know that a note about me was found in a network that was a horror movie cycle). It's one of the most vivid memories we have with guys. We cover all the ends of one bed and head up! Our first horror movie! We talked for years and have been happy for the moment. That was a horror movie. Nowadays horror movies are the same. Or was it better when we enjoyed kids without plots and cast and discuss conversations? Mostly it was there. But for me this is a great movie!
