I rarely know that when I signed up the "All Salary Channels" package with Direct TV, then I faced a movie. When we were watching another movie it was okay ... and I was a teenager in 1981 so I was not sure where I was ... but I missed this movie. <br /> <br /> I also can not believe we left it. This is interesting because it sends you back to the machine at the beginning of the 80s ... but I think it was even a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "very intelligent"! It was a "clever" ... but weirdly intelligent ... and not stupid. <br /> <br /> When I saw a movie like this ... I came to IMDB to tell others. I disappeared this thing nominated! Wow ... the film industry has come a long way since the '80s! Oh well ... it shows some old actors ... I am surprised by the other things BTV ... Lineup ... there is no name ... but some real actors / actresses. Have to keep their drug days! Anyway ... strange, interesting, bizarre, and they make one big!
