A few decades ago I saw it in the theater, and I liked it for a vague memento. However, for the second time it has two themes: (1) Mitchell Johnson plays very poorly, and (2) life is very poor music. <br /> <br /> It was not all music bad or bad. Some of the Brazilian music were good, but their songs were clanged theme songs and others were the most memorable of most 80 'pop music. <br /> Johnson's voice is all wrong, probably dubbed. This was confusing. From the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) It is interesting to look like an attractive young man, (3) Valerie Harper has never seen good; and (4) Johnson is very fond of getting ridiculous at different stages There was a look.
