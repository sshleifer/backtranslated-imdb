Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy. 1. Bad acting, bad character, annoying shirt, bad lines, you name it. Really, I'm not surprised that this movie has not seen more people. Only Karzai saw two because I want to think that filmmakers have learned from their mistakes. They do not. This movie is bad, if not bad, then worse than the first one. That shoes .... that great clown .... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I do not hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he is boring out of faith! I hope filmmakers try again after failing to realize that the film is helpless. Our last thing requires a Killjoy 3.
