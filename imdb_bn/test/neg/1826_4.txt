I'm hoping high in this movie, but frustrated, I feel. I bought it at VHS place at 5 taka and the version I bought was English version double. Dubbing is awful, so be careful. "Lola" was not as good as "Run Lola Run" in this movie, and the bad guy just did not come out of nowhere. And what "Lola" gets at university starts to catch up. It seems to me unreal. Although I was amazed at soundtracking the original version of American soundtrack ... they came out of a lot of places. Too bad for this photo, I really think it's going to rock.
