Oh, awful, this movie's unexpected horror. You can call it a film. It looks like the first year's art school project, quickly cobbled together. <br /> <br /> Here "talent" you are subject to the painful mix of an underdressing and in fact all the scenes were terribly distorted <br /> <br /> <br /> This image does not reflect Malaysian culture or social gatherings - someone Do not talk like this here. I live in Malaysia, btw <br /> <br /> Spinning Geschne is ready to showcase a prize in the foreign film category of some western film festivals. And unfortunately, that sheds seem to work. Some critics would describe it as "exotic", but a more accurate word would be "non-violent". <br /> <br />
