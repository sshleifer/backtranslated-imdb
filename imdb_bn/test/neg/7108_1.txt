My poor tank girl, they ignore everything you do about me. Why is it with less possible comics? I liked a movie that followed the plot, or at least had characters right. <br /> <br /> Why was American Tale Girl American? He is Austrian, caught! And he is not in a post-apocalyptic battle zone post, he lives in an outback with Booba like a barbarian. He does this because he wants to live this way, because he is not because Malcolm M. M Dowell is operating Gitt. And why is he taking care of the kids? The only child of comics is beheading him, it is terrible that they have turned him into a hairy mother. <br /> <br /> and my poor jet girl and sub girl! In comics, the jet is a cartoon adept and sub-girl ... with a wonderful cute sunny other cartoon ad. Movie jets are these mousy little things and sub ditzy middle aged hag. And Buga does not see anything or does not do any of his work that he wants to convey. Although the box office in the United States was too hot / human love? Humor was very hair. What about Smith and the brightness that he used all the time? What type of line "will this take long? I do not want to miss Baywatch."? Even the small children can come up with better material than that program.
