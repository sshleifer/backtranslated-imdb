When I was sitting and thinking of Paris for Paris, I realized that I could not be fair with the film. My rating of 3/10 can do more with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot details, IMDB review and 7.6 IMDB rating, I am sure that I have imposed on a little known jeweler. Sadly, it did not do much for me. Whatever, poisons keep me asleep for the perfect ones. <br /> <br /> The story of two little girls in Mexico City in 1925. One of the girls, Veronica, is a mandatory liar and her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other daughter, Flavia, is so convinced that she believes and her friend tells him that she is scared. It's really about it In fact, nothing happens and the film gets reduced and Veronica tries to control terrorism and Flavia. A commentator on IMDB described it as "the most horrific film in the Mexican movie of 80". My comment If that's the case, there were not many horror films made in Mexico in the 80's. Another commenter wrote, "See if you want to get scared." My comment Are you sure we talk about the same movie? I have opposed my opinion in contradiction with this example. To me, it was unimpressive, uninspired, and bad acting. Director Carlos Enrique Taboada is not particularly annoying as the structure of the scene is never seen in other characters. Veronica and Flavia carry long, drawn-out conversations with their families and their teacher's members, but we do not really see the faces of these people. This is a boring hostage.
