Why are there so much raving reviews in this piece of film? <br /> <br /> This is amateur, weird and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is authentic title song. <br /> <br /> If the prices of production are low and the "comic" (if you want to call them) ideas are weak, they feel like the residue of the residue from SNL even they will not dare to enter them on screen. <br /> <br /> I am beginning to completely disbelieve the IMDB rating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - some people do not see much in today's TV and movies.
