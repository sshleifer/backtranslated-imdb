I like different types of movies, so it does not put pressure on the romantic movies of a person who only like Matrix etc. <br /> <br /> I think it's a shy movie. I do not think there was enough buildup for the characters to read in love. They had been there for a few days and while dealing with a serious hurricane and major problems in every of their lives, Richard Gere and Dean Lane were frustrated and helplessly in love ?? This is not realistic. This movie does not make me feel it emotionally and it is a subject that you search for a good plot. Some emotional connections If someone can fall in love that fast, without any true substance, so be it. You're not right or wrong. Different strokes for different people <br /> <br /> Another incredible element of the movie is being nice and sympathetic at the end of Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter movie. A teenage girl who is sad and excited by her mother, could just turn on a switch to return to her cheating husband and be nice? There was some big name in the short story of this movie, but I had a big disappointment.
