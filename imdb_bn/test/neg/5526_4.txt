Well now this strange movie. It was listed as a comedy but I certainly did not find anything to laugh. Actually I'm struggling to find positive things to say about this movie. Oh i go here Alex Farnes is not bad in the main role and I have not chosen the end to change, but two dimensional characters separately from this is not a great side and it is not enough to be a comedy or serious or dark, decent drama form. I really do not want to do anything for the benefit of the characters of any working class who are trying to show this film again and portray it. I think it is difficult to imitate for any letter and the lead character Jimmy has not been given enough information to believe in his motives. Avoid the best.
