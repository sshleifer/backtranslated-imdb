This is the story of a news investigator who hates her employer - which proves that actors - even Tom Cruise and Dingle Washington - are on the big screen and not your neighbors! <br /> <br /> I'll do it - say goodbye - Good moments show some grounds for using time to learn really funny (not just wasted), to try, to try, to take classes, and learn how to learn good movies. ("The dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence all over ... college efforts.) <br /> <br /> there was no light; Production was not; And the script was moments (conversation from the place - very nice effort unconvincingly executed). (This reminds me of "Dark Star" - which is "lost space" - but this movie is lost.) <br /> <br /> The genre was Bertender (he said the dog is so annoying that I knew him acting To do ... he was not ... ... now acting!), Mark Hammond guy, and Marty. I think I gave the movie a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
