I have to admit, I just chose to throw this film, and when Satherland, Skakie and Prokov were - naturally - great actors, the rest of the film was frustrated. It seems that teenagers have assembled with low level scripts, which are scripts no depth, awful photography and lack of editing, and ridiculously lazy scores! I can not believe that I was finally able to see this seemingly long film ... sadly, it could be a great political thriller through an interesting plot. All potential was to make it a hit; In other words, there are two main elements: a great story of national conspiracy, and a great original cast (though many other actors are mostly soap opera standards). But maybe I'm missing something; Still, in my opinion there is no more than 3 worth.
