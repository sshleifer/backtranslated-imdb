Honestly to God, the outline is mostly called it all. The Andromina planet (not be confused with Aunty Jemima) is represented by a cheap L.A. crypto. There is no stripper, so most recent male visitors stop for the appointment of stripes. <br /> <br /> Men are arrested for misbehaving for women or for spying on women (though actually only one woman of them we have got two women and women involved in sex scenes) and finally, throughout the science fiction cliche films everywhere As it is happening, women are sure that some of the men are good. Well, those who made this movie are not at all! <br /> <br /> But boy, we can see a lot of things, mostly in sex and nudity. For such flickers it is naturally less intriguing, so if you do not like this type of movie and if the channel is in such a thing, then change your tooth tooth.
