This movie is not good enough for $ 1 a grocery store. <br /> <br /> I simply bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. She assumes that this time her role may be very choosy. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to sit in the movie itself. It seems they were grasping at the straws with a story. "Boys out at night" will be the most annoying I've ever seen. One minute they are talking and poetry next poem? Even the arguments were difficult to follow. Most of the acting lacks depth. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they are doing for it, but they must have missed this mark.
