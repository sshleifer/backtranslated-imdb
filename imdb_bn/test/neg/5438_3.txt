"Kongo" is based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, which I think is the natural charm of Creechton, the lack of smart characters and punch. Well, sorry to say, but it goes for the same film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A megalomomaniel CEO. (Joe Dawn Bicker) sending his son to the dangerous African Congo (or is he a laser weapon?) Search for working as a powerful and powerful laser communication transmitter for the source of enough diamonds. His daughter (Laura Lynne), former CIA operator and computer-freak, was later sent to her after losing contact with her son and team. In search of her, she was a researcher with the G-hoose gadget and with some strange characters (a mercenary (Arnie Hodson), a conversation gorilla (Dillon Walsh) and the nuggets Indiana-Jones-type, with the discovery of King Solomon's mine. (Tim Curry) After the missile missile from the surface and some fled to some African wildlife, they all discover that often mango The only thing that we want is to become the source of our fall. <br /> <br /> Actor was not talented in this film, Dylan Walsh, especially at the end, acted like a nasty crew; Arne Hodson is unhappy (it is no wonder that She has been starred in TV shows?) And Laura Linie is nothing special. Say this safely, the only talented actress of this movie is very small. Mika: Joe Dawn Baker and Tim Curry, who is always enjoyable actor (though occasionally his life is alive to live in the memory of "Rocky Horror Picture"). <br /> <br /> This movie is a horror style, Chase There are other problems with conversations and the only plain-annoying plot, which has been completely depleted compared to the novels of Crickton. <br /> <br /> Even the effects of Stann Winston's creatures did not protect the film from disaster. I am deeply disappointed in this movie. Withhold yourself with even had a campy quality. It was just general, awful, annoying and ridiculous, and proved to be one of the worst Crickton book-to-film productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
