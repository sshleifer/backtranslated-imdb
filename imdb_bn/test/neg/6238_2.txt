Since I've had a movie as tall and annoying it has been a long time since. This is a slow motion, which is increasingly enhanced by letters, or some aspects of the movie, such as pacing (such as 'lost in translation'). However, there is a difference between progress gradually and stop suddenly, as it happened. From the looks of Helen Miren's appearance, she felt that she was surprised by her husband's invisibility! Surprised, surprise! How wonderful was the wife and wife to meet at the wonderful creative moment (limitations), and this is a great way that the last story is completely different. Really a nice composition
