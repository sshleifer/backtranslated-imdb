Great idea, perfect characterizations and voices, but a complete waste of time. As it was a high goal, so the real shame is that it was probably not a bomb (is); Very dependent way on ridiculous humor for beginners. I am surprised by the comments of "educated" critics, this completely refers to "good science" behind the trash. Like "Nemo Finding", where (some insinuation suspension was inserted) was drawing attention in detail and the science was as good as it was, "Asymosius Jones" was unclear; Do not teach yourself about science. The purpose of humor was eight years old but suitable for some essential juveniles.
