I'm sure I've ever seen a film as bad as it is. Terrible acting, intrigues everywhere, terrible special effects There are some 'bad times' moments here but it's not really enough to maintain interest. Playing Tracey shows the woman terrible. Leave some fairly thoughtful scenes with a dwarf which you feel so little violation On the plus side, the operation scenes are fairly fun for special effects, because the car is actually "trying to force us out of the road" without any contact. Budget estimate does not extend to the car trash. Oh and a postcard in the Taj Mahal, which seems to be seen only when they are cut into fictional foreign countries.
