Just saw a preview picture tonight and it is only a film for kids. It can not improve or add to the original Disney movie. Scottish pastiche has a style, with the help of weak writing (where the motifs are spotted by), and does not help with incompatible and often incompatible acting (despite reading a decent cast). I have no problem with a dog - although its specific "Bush Kangaroo Skpi" (see below) quality about his shot. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was a TV series in Australia in the 1960s, where Kangaroo could be an integral part of all the stories. It is said that in order to "work" Skippi to do bad work, he kept an elastic band around his lip so that he tried to close his foot - sort of contact with human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you will not only buy a series of heroic rescue. <br /> <br /> <br/> Kids should take advice from 8-12. Below that, they might be afraid. Then, if they or you love it, you would love it, but it's tough to create a cardboard cut-out movie for cruelty. This is a missed opportunity, since Bobby's story is the real path and the harshness and this film failed to deliver it.
