This is a horrific adaption of Charles Kingsley's story. Animation, make it silent, terrible. And the songs are disrespectful to the film's song, which the "haikorim" song repeats. I am sorry for John Pittwe and David Jason, the voice provider for the best animation team in Britain, for the printing animation sequence. Bernard Circbins tried his best to perform this terrible production, but failed. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie for the last time on this planet!
