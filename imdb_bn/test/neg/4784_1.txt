I've seen the first 10 minutes of this show, I think I'm berthing! The worst show on TV. It's not even fun. It's a shame, it's annoying. I could not do it through a second and third change even five minutes. Do not waste time. One of the many shows that needed this bye bye farewell. Regularly speaking during the night shows that it needs to go. CBS All Show ABC All Show All shows in Fox and Joe's chest. New Shw Network All Shows NBC All Shows (Taking into law and order series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All court TV shows. And show every reality there !! Every stupid game show. last moment! All home improvement shows! And all media news. All of it. A 24 hour bad news loop Yes, my favorite is the nomination, the law and the order are for me.
