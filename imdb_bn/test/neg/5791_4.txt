As a CA resident, I would like to see the jackholes that shut down power plants so that some jail time can be extended to increase the price. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was quite good and there were some informative pieces. How they were trapped around Enron, I think it's really interesting. However, when the film focuses on its anti-Bush flutter, it makes me wonder if they were right. <br /> <br /> Republicans were happy to direct Enron to any connection, but when Clinton was president, the giant was created. CA power crisis happened under Davis's watch. The office was abusive both Enron, but is not liable in any way. Instead, how many minutes are spent for friendship with Bush Leigh? So what? He played golf with Le Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's bedroom. Why the Democrats have passed so much free passage in this movie? I think most politicians waste the money of their taxpayers, so I am not partial on any side, but when I see a documentary I feel relieved with some political agenda. Yes, politicians are guilty of some blame, but I really doubt that only the guilty people are after their name. As many as Bush's lover, the Democrats got more money than the Demon campaign, and I could not find any value as Republicans' opinion. As I said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious about the rest of my subjects.
