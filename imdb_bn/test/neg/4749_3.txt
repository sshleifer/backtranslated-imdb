I first saw the Alien movie at the age of fourteen and I came to choose it immediately. The original, awesome and classic. Sigarai Baira was the right choice for female hero character and he deserved a statue for his work. In 1979, Amar was born infinitely more than the first in the series, with less fiction than the first one. Allian had 3 different views but I think this section was the most stressful and unique, it was my favorite. Unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. It was strained, irrational, with full meaningless genocide. I did not like it at all, but I never thought that the worse part would be made in the future. Good turned into 2004 as I was wrong. Alien vs Predator was a bad break, and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should not have been made at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Rikmeier, I was completely destroyed. I sat down and decided to look at it with suspicion, even I never thought that such a bad film could be made. Without a screenplay, without the director and without the actors, I do not understand how to make a movie. This image is the reason to miss these three terms. You get a nice genocide show without a story but with a lot of annoying and annoying dialogue. Money waste and time waste. The movie is rather obscenity (alien / predator) than the fans of both sides. Shame!
