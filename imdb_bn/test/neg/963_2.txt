Dazzler: Watch for Fall ... <br /> <br /> Boy, was it a bad movie? I know that they were going to be "victorious over all of the true love", but I would never return about about 3 of these films (which took me more than 9 hours in my afternoon). This movie has two lovers known as Kai and Gara, who live in a remote town in fantasy world. In a hotel owned by Garar's father, Kai is the accidental Belababai. At first, Garta ignored the arrival of Kai, but ultimately the hatred of the father of Gera (you thought it was! As it was not enough to overcome this obstacle, a bad snow queen grips a glass of glass in the eyes and she treats an average person with poorly treated gasta. Koe is finally taken to Snow Quinn Castle (which is just a set of ice-covered hotels), because in Hallwork The good people want to go to everyone) and Gartha came out with a mission to return to Kai. As he goes to the other three seasons, he is particularly bad for himself, but Garara escapes from the road with the help of some dull and forgotten letters. (All the time you want to stop it, you can not force yourself to do it. Perhaps it is the worst and most effective air that has been thrown by Snow Queen) However, I'll eventually leave you because you can do your head Thinking in now is probably better if they end up well. So, in conclusion, Snow Quinn is an incredibly annoying film, which takes the fan out from fantasy.
