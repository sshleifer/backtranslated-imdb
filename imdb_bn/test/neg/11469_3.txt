As a big fan of most modern fantasy films, I was really looking forward to this. I was not familiar with the character, though after listening to some common stories about comic and film reviews, I thought I was for real behavior ... <br /> <br /> From this moment, the lead character speaks for his forced burrun From the beginning, I can directly say that I'm not going to enjoy this movie. The story was weak and expected, acting poor, the effects were very good for a small budget movie, but nothing has worked for the overall plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can get something as a fan of comics, more than this, otherwise I will not ignore it and suggest that you do not waste the rent on the movie on this annoying adventure.
