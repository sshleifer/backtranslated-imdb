I like the 50s sci-fi movies a lot. I really love (like the world's stuffed steel, when World's Clyde, the attack of physical masters, and much more) and sometimes really bad because they can be fun and good to see with friends. Plan 9 from outer space). However, when a Sci-Fi movie is bad but not too bad to be fun, it must be avoided. This movie is just such a film. Posters show that some kind of sexy cats are attacking mankind, whereas the original plot is far less interesting. A woman is married to a woman He is contaminated and starts to grow in a huge size and this worm tracks and decides that it is about to jump and kick his tail. Also, many of the special effects have stumbled - especially the giant Papia Mash's hand, which comes home to catch the evil Habee.
