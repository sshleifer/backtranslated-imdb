Okay, fans, it's a DVD out. But the only reason to see it is 1) You said (due to its superstition), or 2) If you're a hardcore Bill Payston fan. I'm not a hardcore BP fan but he had fun to see and this was the only thing that prevented me from fertile annoyance. It's embarrassing because it's made by some scripts work well with a good film and some intelligence (and with a cast driven by each other, completely customized and beside Jude Nelson). Sure it is fairly, but it's good, and not in a better way. Even after reading all the comments on how this movie is rebellious and disrespectfully shameless, you are still interested, look after yourself, and instead see some of the more wickedly rebellious dostopian abuses. Everyone remembers John Waters' film, David Lynch, "Brinded" by Peter Jackson, "Basket Case", and Henlintlet. There's a lot better there.
