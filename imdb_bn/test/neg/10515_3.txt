He wrote, 'Vampire Assassins', as director and star, Ron is a triple threat. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clinical police-on-mission who found herself in her neck with some nasty vampires. After returning to the street and finishing his badge to bring bloods back to the cemetery, he looks for the killers of the last vampire (no Buffy!). <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horror movie. It closes many other movies (can you say blood?) That it does not even try to establish its identity. The scripts are non-existent. The action is horrific. Who says a micro budget stimulates creativity? There's nothing even remotely interesting here. Without headaches you will not find anything beyond it. Stay away from all costs.
