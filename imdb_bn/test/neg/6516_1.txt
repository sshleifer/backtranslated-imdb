If you do not read the book and do not want to read it in the future, see and watch the movie (6/10). It's a nice fantasy movie with good CGI, excellent acting, a beautiful environment and an average-fiction story. <br /> <br /> If you read the book like me almost 10 times or more and really love it, do not expect too much (or better: do not expect everything). The story is completely different from the original book. It can explain that this film voted 1/10 people from 40 or more people (like me) and a lot better than those who have never read the book before and thus do not expect anything. <br /> <br /> The difference between movies and books is not really necessary and by changing the setting (my opinion is worse): <br /> - Book magic works well with the classic magic effects. (Weather change, delusion, transforming into animals, ...) The film is like "Jade-School for the Medieval" (TM) (wood stick instead of lightbatter). Satan Emperor looks like Palpatine (after the third part) does not really make it good. <br /> <br /> - The book's mills are not completely cut off like the movie. In the book, the story was set up near Dresden, which the Karabat visited once with his master and went to some nearby villages for the festival. (This part can be changed to spend the cost.) I do not understand why the movie is located on the hill, when the nearby graveyard is set in high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The entire surrounding mango fantasy medieval style runs average. Lots of mud, dirty face, not a disciplined kitchen, only very rough house. The book has never suggested that environment. <br /> <br /> - The book tries to make Karrot his successor but rejects the prison. Slaves are nowhere in praise, distance and silent rejection. The movie has always denied Master like a lethal schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The film was set in 1647 instead of 1720. It probably makes it impossible to tell some stories from young people. 170x All right, how the movie stories are missing. <br /> <br /> Some of the explanations given in the book will also be helpful and will not be spent for many minutes: <br /> <br /> - All the work done on the day is simple and night work is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes the boys are sweaty and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few "Gesellen" are trying to deal with the master: If the master dies due to fundamentalist reasons, "geselen" is free and holds their magical powers. If the master dies in a conflict, he will always lose his power.
