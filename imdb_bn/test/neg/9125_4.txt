With many sequels, this one does not have the effect of just quality or effect. First up there with a great rest of the others. This one does not cut it. It was a wonderful "good time" in the first film, which is not entirely absent from this movie. We became innocent enamored in all these characters (minus Richard Dreyfuss) at an age of innocent. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are mostly different people. Although this is happening in real life, we do not expect the characters of our favorite movie to happen! The film did not have the humor which was the original, and we were hoping to laugh. What a little humorous darkness is there. The first film is probably the greatest soundtrack ever featured, though it is good but not close to the original. This movie is basically different, it is not actually a seagull. I gave it a 4.
