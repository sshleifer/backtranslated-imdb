It was not a good film. Writing and acting badly - the idea was not new, the effects were not poor, and there was not a showcase for Arnold Vsule, who is really half the decent actor I have seen it under some protests and have seen it at the very end - forget it. Acting seems to consist of a number of glares and no sincerity looks vain. I hope this will really work and long before I hope it will end. As a medical bit - I'm not expecting a true version of ER events, but it was just ridiculous - I'm a doctor, so I know what I'm taking - and operator bits are simply na√Øve. Do not waste your precious time - unless you have something left to do - go out, look at a long lost friend, dry the paint, draw your wax, do some homework. Avoid your danger.
