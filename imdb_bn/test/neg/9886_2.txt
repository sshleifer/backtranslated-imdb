The movie is nothing like blood and chocolate books. The plot has totally changed and anyone who chooses to read the book has cast cast. The first girl is not an introvert Aden. Vivian was behind Aden. Her mother will survive and be one after Gabriel. All of the assassinations of former former Ralf of Vestian is Austrad. Gabriel is not old. She is looking old. And Aden would not get Vivian until finally, Gabriel did. The title came from Vivian Aden (sweet like chocolate) and Gabriel (deliciously blood) than kissing. She chooses blood because she is more committed and she understands more about him. That reminds me, Gabriel is not against people like humans. He simply avoided the closeness with them because they hit him in the past. The book is really much better than a movie. But if you want to see running, a dating montage, and a lot of jumping. Then watch this movie.
