This image is a dead tie with the original for the worst film ever made. I think this one may be slightly worse, if anything. Spoiler alert !!! Here the ship has been tied for a long ship. Unthinkable? No, impossible. Do not be funny as the entire premises is so ridiculous. There are some big names in the film, even they could not save this sorry thing. I find it really a waste of celluloid. After seeing this, unfortunately I decided that it was my time wasted. Do not bother with this one. Or the original for that matter! I gave it a 2, mainly because they voted out 1 vote.
