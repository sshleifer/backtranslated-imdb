I understand that it is very difficult to live up to the first 10 Commandment films (which was Grandjes and not Charlotte Haieston fan personally). But this movie / mini series was frustrating. Even the animated Prince of Egypt was good. <br /> <br /> One thing that threw me was Ramesses. Compared to the version of Yule Brenner, Paul Rice's version looks so weak and non-ferrous. Acting really was not that great. For a modern adaptation, I had some good expectations. It just does not look stunning as visual as the first one. I guess they were running a tough budget or something. A rare voice narrator who I found is weird and unnecessary. It breaks up the flow of stories. And Um ... the voice / line of God was a little weird.
