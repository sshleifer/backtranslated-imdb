Hello all - it's valuable, I'm in Doctoral program in Indonesian politics and after almost a year's field work, I have returned to this semester, mostly in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I was a big movie fan usually, I went out as soon as possible, and I was in there buying local videotones. In this theater I saw, since I was there it was open, and, thank you, soon after closed. <br /> <br /> Who was the viewer for this photo? The corrupt wife and daughter of the very high-ups in Indonesia, whose curiosity is weak and ineffective? The vast majority of the Indonesians can not afford single plates, feed the food at the center of the central restaurant alone? Or gay Indonesian men, whose country's Muslim-ruled society are hesitant, shamelessly straightforward, how to promote respect and respect. <br /> <br /> If this was not bad enough, the soundtrack was recorded or mixed so that it is unknowable that even the native speakers did not hear the lines too much. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a gay-themed film in a region of the world that seems to be less likely to create such a creature, then forget it. Early in the same era, "Westlar", from the 80's or "My Beautiful Laundrette", it became very successful in dealing with homophobia, and with the help of steady, soundless scenes it did. <br /> <br /> Overall, unfortunate waste in a country that still does not educate its children and can not keep them healthy.
