This picture is about 7 encounters in the Hampstead hit on Wednesday afternoon. <br /> <br /> It shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, broken relationships, gay, old, blind dates and companion services. They are not geographically connected to each other as well, so it is frustrating. The film is a collage conversation without any visible plot. Without any logical film, leave a jump from one pair to another. I find these pictures annoying and purposeless. The only freedom fighter movie is the great weather around the world. It is very sad that talent like Ian McGregor and Sophie Okono has spoiled the film.
