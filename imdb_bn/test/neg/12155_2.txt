In the last 12 months I saw the worst movie. The plot of the story was reluctant, after the end of the movie, he went to Ginjesh Khan, I always thought that after some time it became interesting. I knew that Mongolia and the areas in which the movie was played are beautiful landscapes, but the film does not profit from it. Really poor where joke is. The Ganges himself could have said more about the narrator, Mongolian history, tradition etc. My colleague did not know anything about this so he lost a bit. I was looking forward to seeing this picture but after all I was really frustrated. In the film I sometimes watch 3 movies, where I seem to be going to the end.
