The Silenza incident was set up in Arizona, where six prisoners of death were being imprisoned because they were not explained, because the armed prison went flat on the bus and forced the driver to stop the road. Then two blondes turned into birds and the incarcerated prison guards managed to make them better, six prisoners were released, but in a shooting-out, the car was damaged in their gate, and all of them were trapped in the middle of the Arizona Desert. They decided to walk to the nearest town near Sala√±as several miles away and hosted the police with them. Once they reach Salin, they feel very strange that the place does not completely emit completely with another person. They soon discovered that eating meat in the whole town was killed by the Allianas and they were firmly placed in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Alien invasions are also known as Arizona in the United States and apparently the title of the work is in the terror city, Saif-Fire Horn Flick co-authored, co-produced and directed Dustin Reichter and a real Fighter No sistya. It may be a crisis, the Salin Event is a film that gives movies a bad name. The film can be divided into two parts, the inaugural forty or fifty odd minutes concentrate on the inauguration, guard and escape of the prisoners, although it is extremely badly written and stuffed stuff. The dialogue between two blond birds and prison guards is so bad that it is strange, because two suitable birds do not keep the two in jail. Really interesting thing, unfortunately Salin is not a fiction, it's a horror movie about science fiction. Then once in the jail escaped and their prison guards arrived in Salna, they started returning to Alien and stopped the clutches of our clipped character which is good because it is boring. See, the whole film is badly written, thoughtful and made. Why can not I be really bothered, but believe me that the events of Salen are horrific at every stage. As well as bad, annoying and stupid movies, the Salin incident has been badly created. The action sets of pieces are terrible, the aliens look terrible and are not shown on the screen at the same time in the human character and it is difficult to know what is happening. Special effects are very poor, alien garbage look and CGI computer effects are absolutely terrible as well. The editing is poor, cinematography is poor, sets are cheap and the whole thing is only a sight. Gore has some, some wounds, half of the leakage, and a scattered hand is seen. <br /> <br /> The apparently low budget shot has been the production of the saline, and there is less production value and start looking cheap. Illustrated in the Superior in Arizona. The act is such a terrible thing that I have never heard of though acting doctor acting female doctor is very good. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of Salin is a horror film which is not only terrible but it's almost every way, your 90-minute price, mine or anyone else's time.
