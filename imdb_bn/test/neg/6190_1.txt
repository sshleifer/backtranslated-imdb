Algiers is not a classic, it's a distortion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, and much more interesting and engaging Pepe, played by Gene Gabin, directed by Duvia. If you want to enjoy Algiers's Kasba and Characters completely, I do not recommend seeing this movie and Pepe le Moko instead, because it is more broad, more beautifully illustrated, Lines are cleaned and characters are not much of a reality. In addition, the finishing is so dramatic and the key to Pepe's character in which you will find the Algiers version intolerable. Algiers performs an excellent job by imitating each scene, though the performances are short for the credibility of the characters. In addition, all scenes of clothing are really breathing, especially Pepe's last scene and Gaby's (at all) but when he's on the boat. To be honest, as far as Algiers imitates, it is cheaper.
