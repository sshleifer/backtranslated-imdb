Written in 1935 when the script was silent, it was impossible to recommend poor performance and incompatibility levels. Vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is not natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see it rated here at IMDB. Some scenes are appropriate, this is a film that fails to be completely entertained. If you like this kind of montage, do not walk and "Tales of Manhattan" (1942) is an extraordinary film that follows the life and times of a Tuckot.
