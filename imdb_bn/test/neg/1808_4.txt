After reading the book, Heart of Darkness does not judge the film. The film keeps a shameful book and anyone who does not enjoy this book falls on the story and the plot because it portrays the film so badly. In movies, characters and sets, there were some frustrations that took place in the movie. The director has found so many important and interesting aspects of the book that it is one of the best literary works <br /> <br /> Of course there is no book better than movie, but it was not comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and written words. The movie does not even begin to show any of this. The very important and influential scenes of the book were completely excluded, as did Cartage when the boat was not in the boat. When Marlou went to the news for cartage, she responded differently to the film instead of the book. Another major difference was that Marlowe saw the picture of the lady, which spread to the end of the film, or like the book at the beginning. It was dominant on how the viewers felt in Marlow and the film was completely embedded. <br /> <br /> This book was so beautiful that each location looked like, but the film's scenery was reduced. There was a bunch of glasses mesh background and to appreciate, a bunch of bad actors go along with it. There was an exception in the horror actors and Ishakh de Bancol, who played Mafumu. His character has been best illustrated. Although the movie was not great, I would recommend it only if you read and understand the book very well. In this way, you can see the differences between movies and books and worry about them. If you do not read the book, I do not recommend the film because it's a boring, rude mess. I liked the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
