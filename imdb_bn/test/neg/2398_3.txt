OMG, there is no scope. <br /> <br /> I could understand for Charlie Wilson's war history, morality, legitimacy, for various paragraphs, but I do not think that such a rant could force Aaron Sorkin's fans. Others, be careful. Give your movie money elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Yet, if you are looking for a pithy comment, here's my. You make a hot fudge sauce on a stack of garbage, but it can change nothing. Garbage trash and so on Charlie Wilson's war.
