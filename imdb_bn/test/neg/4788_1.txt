Repetitive and derivative things are great for showers, summer, winter, and spring line-ups, which are great for a show that sets itself apart from many areas. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' is an unusual approach. It's not about "a weird family daily music" (zzzz ..) and sitcoms are not about other boring stuff you see everywhere. The show is about this little white trash thief (Earl) who closes the lottery card and scores big time. At that moment, 'action' took him away from him. Overtime, he learned that the extraordinary phenomenon is probably due to the fact that he is doing all the wrong things, so he set a mission in order to correct the mistakes he made and he got all his work on a paper. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant evidence for a sitcom. Thankfully, it landed in the right hand. Conducting the show produces a very satisfying result: You will find an innovative comedy that is really fun and really touches a lot of time. You look at Earl's sincerity and determination, simple minded mind, good heart and watch over life, Joy's wild, brilliant personality and Darrell's gentle, calile disrespect that makes you very easily loved by him. > <br /> When you combine the show with its real humor, good heart, attractive character and good conversation, then you really have a keeper. With this (and impossible "The Office") series, NBC clearly has something to do. Are they finally free for one or two or more free? So let's hope so. And hope for its more good quality programs, such as line up; It shows that both of us TV viewers and NBC executives must stop the NBC's golden day's long (Frasier, Seinfeld, friend) tears.
