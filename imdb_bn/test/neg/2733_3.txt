Terry Cunningham This hi-fi network indicates the main. Washington state and Oregon are not all good; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to reduce most parts of the Pacific Ocean's oceans. Trying to deprive the world of environmental missiles, a cracking team led by Dr. Jack Rollins (Luke Perry) is taking a huge drilling car called "The Mole" to prevent the imminent destruction of Earth's flames. . The tech dialog really helps or does not speed up this movie. Acting long, but then Perry has always been back. You can only blame him for taking part. Others in Cast: Michael Door, Adam Frost and Michael Tigen
