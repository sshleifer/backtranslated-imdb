Half of a mysterious thriller and a fractured mind half fractured, "Frontier Guardian" is an engaging trip that soon derails. Strong imagery and a compulsive firmness are frustrated by continuous conspiracy, hackneyed conversations, amateur acting, and the most lazy and topical imagery of recent memory. (Here, the fish is not just a fish!). Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman - Miss Wesley certainly was determined to prove that she could be lilid and freely clear like someone.
