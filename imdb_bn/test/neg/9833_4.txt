I noticed that many movies in "Mistry Science Theater" have received very few ratings in IMDB. However, some of the films featured in movies were not bad and during the movie funny comments - a movie that is offered "MST" treatment is not suitable for rating. Now I'm not saying that "Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not bad enough to meet the current IMDB score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Bux and Danny's meeting. Bux is a veteran drifter and Danny is a young boy who does not seem to be particularly vulnerable to the country. Once they are in a small town, Besky has to be repeatedly rescued by Danny because Danny is quite naive - it's a great way to say that there is a tomato's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Some things happen along the way to self-confidence, he finds a beautiful young lady and finds greed to drag him. And, in a strange theorem, Jack Elam starred a super-obsessed sick person, who screamed the city from fear of everyone - still awkward, the police do not accept most of the notice and nobody does anything about themselves. . Finally, when I am going to marry a girl, the downfall continues, things get into the lungs completely. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the time of the film, there was a lot of interesting plot material in this film - enough to score more than 2.1. The biggest negative aspect is the simple conclusion with the mystery about the last time and Danny's total idiocy is often a bar. Considering the small budget, however, it is a watchable little film.
