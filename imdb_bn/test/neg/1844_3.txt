I would not be annoyed to comment on an extremely generous voter in IMDB and the movies I do not like, but it was just lingering. I closed it 15 minutes before ending it, to see "this brick brick" (my gf wanted because ... i just chose two bad temples). <br /> <br /> If you want to see this film: This movie is a collection of bad-average-average "horror" stories like "horror short stories" found in a problem of "Reader's Digest" in the room waiting for your dentist Illustrate. <br /> <br /> I do not expect any particular horror or fun, I do not want to "see blood"! - The type of person, but this "movie" is not "horror" or "comedy" or no entertainment. Another way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Conclusion: between 4 and 7, is for a person "Awesome Comedy".
