Monkees "Head" is one of the weird phenomena that I've noticed - that when there is no knowledge, people try to read things in it and give it deeper meaning, which was not the purpose of its manufacturer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. But while acting to laugh at the show of television, it seems that it is not played for anything other than a deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state, that Cyclalia will force this brand. Finally, it is doing Monikake the same scinti, but now it is "cognition-raising" because the laughter track has been removed. Humor does not mean the whole thing; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The song "Head" should prove to anyone without any shadow of doubt that Monkey does not have the ability to write songs. The tunes are mostly garbage; Even the only "Popez song" to listen, which opens and closes the movie. But the matter is, it was Gary Guffin-Carroll King, and when it was more than Mancas, it was less than Gopin and King Standards. Paul McCartney writes for them that one of the old Peter and Gordon songs is like listening to: You might think it's a beautiful song, but then find out what you've written it and you feel it's a throw. Perhaps Mike Nasimi's song is passable, the rest is worthless. Davey Jones, I guess, filmmakers think of the film as "big numbers", because it does not show the only song presented in Show Show, and does not spend the sequence of a movie montage or dream, but it is flat. Because the song is not good at all. <br /> <br /> I admit that I always love Muke, so the movie is frustrating. Sure, they were Chess, but they were so happy about it. <br /> <br /> They knew that they were Chess and they were calm with him. But then they got ambitious. At "Head", they actually joke about being a produced pop product, but the truth is, they wanted more. They wanted to be great musicians and took it seriously as artists. Maybe not like Beatles, but something that's coming near. "Head" proves that they all failed to count. 1 * 4 out
