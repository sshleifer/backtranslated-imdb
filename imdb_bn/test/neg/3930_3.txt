A cheap and discouraged haute movie with poor character, lots of underwright style stoichi emoticon (think Chu Yun Fat in a good time) and some Chess Cliché have been dropped in a abandoned factory ready for some poorly executed aircraft, which rolls out La John Woke. Even squibs look terrible. At no stage of the proceeding it looks remote like America. Three jerseys old cars do not make a country. The Mustang also has a wobbly right front wheel. Plots, as it is, are so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing. It can not come very soon. Even the cheap junk costume jewelery available from robberies looks like jewelry. Overacting those terrible dialogue and hopelessly who gets the top shot off of a real waste of space and time. If you want to know how to make a cliché-rayed low budget movie, it's valuable to see.
