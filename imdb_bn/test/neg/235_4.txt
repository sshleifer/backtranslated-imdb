First of all, I was not sure what the purpose of this film was - it seemed like a story for the kids, but the kids were not able to understand the stuff and found it boring. There was not much of it, Bruce Willis was not extended as an actor. She glancing a lot of side with her half smile - unless you would not bother her a big fan. And if this is the story of your interest (that person thinks it all but emotionally lacking, then he is taught the child), I will go see a boy. This movie lacks humor, sadness and reality.
