Talk about acting ... !!!! Not only Govinda, Salman and Larao ... The side was awful. In the first half hour you want to switch to most movies. Because this movie is a real stinger (mark my words. <br />) I like Govinda in his comedy roles like Smiley Manan Zaygi, Jodi No 1, Akiyen She Goli Murray and Jeish Desh Gan Ganga Raha Hai. Which can not be compared. Salman Khan certainly can not play comedy role !! He is frustrated He does not know how to do a comedy. He was the only good comedy role, which was Amz, which was bright by Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> There is so much 'inexperienced stupid' view in this movie that you want to find out the DVD and burn it so anyone else in your house can watch it again.
