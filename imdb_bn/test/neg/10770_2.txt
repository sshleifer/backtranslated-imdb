I do not know why they name it. How can I tell the series 'The Scarlett Pimpernel' after the separation from the novels, I can not have any formula. The names of the characters are the only thing they keep, and yet they make some changes in them, and mix them and change the relationships of Persia. Of course, I've seen it for almost two hours in most of the time, but it was enough for me that this series was not something that Baroness Argyes portrayed in her characters, and it was probably moving around her grave while filming and broadcasting. Poor lady I hope the next person wants to create a movie / series of books but they will not completely destroy it like this series.
