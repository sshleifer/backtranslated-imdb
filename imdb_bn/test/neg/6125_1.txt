The French created Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - some of them "Merci pour le chocolat" next to this genre. The opening credits tell the viewer that the music is going to be played and by whom it has been composed, you know that you are going to swim in the Middle East. This is an old man's film with more than 40 years of age. It is directed by an old man along with an old crew, which has nothing to say about the life of the audience. The plot is not only inactive but unrestrained. How many movies are released through dialogue to repeat the same message through flashbacks after five minutes? Maybe the director and actor had a low retentive ability? Indeed, they have no durable plot. It is a good piece of cheese with a nice piece of cheese with a hole. <br /> <br /> Whether deliberately or not, it is a movie about the bourgeoisie. At least one-third of the film focuses on piano and exclamatory satirical twaddle in each scene. I have made some pictures firmly, even though they could not use the sty-cam in this movie - it would wake them all! Other than this a foolless story, the film high-middle class allows a very comfortable Swiss position to parade their values ​​and vanity. Rolph Paolo told Ana Mogolis, when this picture can be said, do not lock his car during the reserve! Oh dear, <br /> <br /> In DVD, Miss Hupert commented on a false tear thrown for a scene. Smirking said: "They are like the American actor studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast actor can learn better from the studio. If I think there is a statement, then Hupperts comments that 'we are with friends on weekends and away from all the servants'. No doubt they all moved away from the mind so that they could be associated with such helpless movies. <br /> <br /> Protection medical notes. In the film they see a hot water scald being covered and a bandage is covered. This should not be done. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> Small 10 signs.
