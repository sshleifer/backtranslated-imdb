I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Lenny. However, in 10 years I have easily seen the worst movie, and I can see the share of my movies. A stinker This is a movie, a bad idea to be executed badly. It's not about funny, trustworthy or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. Instead, it seems that most cast members roam to benefit Leoni. It is very bad, as the acting talent such as atrocities has been lost. Do not disturb. The makers of this photo have given their views to their viewers that they ask Buffalo, the Polish gangsters in Poland to send a murderer to the contractor in sub-francisco as a mortar assistant while attending the AAA meeting. Bill Pullman should start reading scripts before agreeing to the film. Sad
