Paul Newman's Sixth Star of General Grove's painting, negative four for the inclusion of a truly fabulous event to be documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character - or at least his fate - is dependent on a Canadian physicist Louis Slatin who did not come to Los Alamos after the war. He conducted his lethal "dragon trail" test in May 1946.

Before the Trinity Examination, someone died due to radiation toxicity in Los Alamos, it is possible that scientists stopped their work suddenly, and history could have changed. Whether we can guess only good or bad. Someone could attach Marineman's character to dramatic effect or ask a producer and director for providing nuclear messages. For more on hand and correct treatment at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, see TV David "Day One," or better, read the book based on the book Peter Wyden.
