The puzzle as an idea is an interesting concept, but I scared scared, Vinnie, if hard man's role is given to him in his element as lock stock and snatch. In this movie, Vinnie has played a newspaper sports writer (Greenhounds), who rushes comfortably during the movie and a senior bundle in a 10-15 year old balconies. I'm sorry Vinnie looks tough and has been throwing him like ruthless to him. Trying to investigate the double murder of a friend near Themes and drug addiction. He played the role of a police member, although the real police partner player, Charles Dickens's flashbacks. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on screen, her reputation seems difficult since she is already so difficult to work in part, snarling at the camera in part. If you look at the tower machine, then he is completely thrown out and credible and perform very well. <br /> <br /> A little confusing in the movie, a flashback of Charles Dickens, who is describing a different story with characters present on the present day, these two stories are not related to each other. The same actors are used. <br /> <br /> The movie is particularly uncomfortable when listening to the movie from Julie Cox, and her role in the film is not that much of the love interest, but she started the film as Detective, but quickly <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Can have a suitable movie near <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
