I was surprised that the Mindia Mind and the television program The Awful Truth, which ran a few years ago, did not compare. Protected by controversial director Michael Moore, the show began with the same manar as the show, with Moore's conversation with the audience and was introduced, such as small documentaries and skits, which were combined for thought revivals. Recent events The difference? Meniaia rarely crosses shallow and reactionary. What he said and do is often very annoying and irrational and insults his audience's own decision-making. There is a difference between being "weird", with whom I have no problem, but Mensia tries very hard to do this and is stopped as arrogant and with little support. But he sometimes points, but often to reach them, he has to sit through some pretty minds, who try to smile.
