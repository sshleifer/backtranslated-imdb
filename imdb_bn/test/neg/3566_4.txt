Wonderfully this film of Kieslowski sometimes seems weird and sometimes a poor observation which sometimes disappoints me because of the cliche script. There is an isolated young boy. He is with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night a woman who lives throughout their building. See it! She wants her. She is one of the youth who is good to communicate with the opposite sex. However, she likes the woman when she comes home with a woman, makes her go to Tommak. Then, we realize that Kisłowski tells us the story of an isolated young boy who wants to flirt a woman or fall in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else because he knows that it is his salvation. One day, she stops the woman, suddenly, she thinks she is a shy boy but proves that she is not, so she explains almost everything. He spoke and rejected him. Everything else is like Kieslowski films, so realistic, there is no problem. When problems started, Tomk met her, the story of a free young boy who loves a mature woman (but unexpected love), turns into a story of a single-old boy, falls in love with her in the beginning. The woman denies, but after a little while, she started to change her mind. This makes the UK movie cliché the first. Tommac's personality is weird? Or the result of a bad monitoring? I am frustrated with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to say why. When he goes to his room, Magda treats him very friendly. He asks, what do you want from me? Kiss me? To love me? To go out with me? At this moment, I think she is a female fattal. See? To return to the scene, Tomme rejects all offers. Why? Because he is shy? I do not think so, but his communication is silent, okay. After the home leg scene, the movie misses its targets in some events. I think the aim of the film (should be based on the story) is to show us that some people who lack love and do not contact to live from this situation lack of communication and especially for them men. At this moment, what do movies say? It's smoking and frustrating. It is seen that he is not hunger for love or for women or sexual appetite. What then? And suicide attempts to support this weakness in the scene. So she touched her feet, she wants to kill herself! However, as I mentioned before, some magma is a femme fatale. Not fairly. He tried to make Tom happy. Could he not avoid contact with her? No, does he insult him? No, does he like her? No Does he cheat him? No There is some problem with her (ex-boyfriend), so she is not her. However, he did not take revenge from Tommak. She is not an angel, but a femme fatale.
