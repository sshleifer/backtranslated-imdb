I'm sorry but I do not understand how far away this is with the studio. The movie is not worth the price. Maybe not as a theater-game but certainly as a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Acting offspring is good but I did not expect anything less than this perfect actor. Robert Redford plays very well and Willam Duffa is quite confident as a "bad guy". Helen Miron can play almost any role and always (still) looks good to me;). I am a fan of his British intelligence. Yet they just can not save this annoying movie, I'm sorry. I hope we will not go to many movies from this movie "Peter John Brugge" because now it is clearly not the meaning of the words "suspense and thriller".
