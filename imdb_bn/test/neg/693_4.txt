WrestleMania is the only WrestleMania Thank God. | Three will be held in different places, and it was a fun idea, it does not really work. There really are really two matches that really have been out, the rest are honest, or most of them, pretty scary. There are some entertainment celebrities like Susan St James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but there was a waste of time for most of the experience. British Bulldogos V. The Dream Team match is valuable for the price of admission, but you can honestly look anywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Arndorf vas The Magnificent Muraco / Dr. Mr. Fuji There was time, and despite the screw finish, it was surprisingly portable material, the crowd was really having it in. At the end of the crowd chants "bullsh * t" It says that it did nothing for a career. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Randy Savage | C. George George "animal" steel. Not that like a wrestling wrestler, but because of the associated antics, it is very entertaining, and some great steel comedies, barbarous, besides wrestling potatoes and it seems interesting. Sage won when he kept his feet in the ropes, for leverage. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Jack "Snake" Roberts V. George Wells For a hijack, it should have been better than it, but it is too small to make so much impact. Roberts won the DDT, except for the snake, which hated St James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Boxing boxing. Mr.T / W Hottie Kidd and Joe Frazionir V. Roddy Piper / W. Lou Duva and Bob Orton. My opinion is a huge failure. I was stupid bored across this, and it could be a marketing success, it certainly did not succeed in my entertaining. The Rundi Chancellor is very well noted. T is won by DQ, when the piper tips are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The girls' title match. Great Radish | C Velvet Macintrie Ending very fast, it even gets the chance to start, quickly creates a record of the collapse of the PIN, as long as the woman is related to it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Large pop for Corporal Stupid match ups, with bogus offense from both involved, the matter is very very small. With the cane of Brazil, Volcoff trembles when he wins physically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> William Perry and Andr√© get the biggest pops. Despite all this involved in the NFL genius, superb entertainment elements. It is also notable for the appearance of Brett Heart's first one WrestleMania. Undara won when he went out of the Heart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Title. British Bulldogs / W. Lu Albano and Og Osborne V. Dream Team / W. Johnny Valiant | C. Absolutely amazing match, it's one of the best WrestleMania matches ever. You will not have time to catch your breath, all hands in the hammer, and the ring is excellent in psychology. This is the best pure wrestling, if you do not like this match then you can not call yourself yourself as a wrestling fan. Bulldogs won during the conflict with Dynamite Kid's Valentine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's a very modest match, with both men putting solid performance Hercules is an average trick, with above average skill, and it is also good opposite of the steamboat's high flying style. Steamboat won with a high flying cross body off the top rope. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fellow uncles love Elmar, but I do not do that. Adonis won with a top rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's a great deal of a lot of memorable breaks from Terry Falk. There was something else for that time through the table. I will make this rate as my second favorite. Jimmy won the Hanks with the help of megaphone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hog Hogan C King Kong Bundi vs. Worse pop for Hogan WrestleMania is one of the most hip-heavy matches in history. Hogan can not wrestle a lion value, and Bundy is not great at all. For this time violence was brutal, but Hogan's Superhero law is very annoying, and there are many annoying moments. Hogan wins when Bogie escapes before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WrestleMania 2 Failure in most cases. Die Hard Wrestling fans will see this once, but you really do not have too much. There is not enough to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince this one blew it out. The main event is not fooled by the fraud, it's really a boring affair, like most of the cards. Not recommended, and one of the worst WrestleMania is to match the status quo as well. <br /> <br /> 4/10
