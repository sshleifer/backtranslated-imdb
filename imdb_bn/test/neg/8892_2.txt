I wanted to see this movie because I liked "Kawakazesczyk Planic" and "Brat" ("brother") with Sergei Mashkov, Sergei Badrov, Jr. and "Dior" ("The Chief"). Well, in contrast to other movies, the time of "the quickie" was a total waste. The story makes a little sensual, very disrespectful (Leslie Ann Warren was especially bad), really horror dialogue, poor cinematography, and what could be wrong? I feel very funny that when they go alone in the same American language (in this case the Russians) in American-made films, they prefer to communicate with each other in most broken English (and when they speak Russian, because translators are "f ** ks" in sentences Many feel obliged to add, which is no atrocity, literal or non-literal). At the same time, Native-English-speaking actors preferred to speak Russian language broken. Why that? Returning the story, most of the subplots of the film (e.g., betting the house, inviting parasites of Latin America etc.) do not understand anything more than the confusion of the audience or do nothing. It is very bad that Badrowov, Mashkov and Leigh (all the best actors of my modest opinion) have engaged themselves in this disaster.
