Even the "Star Trek" movies are not a movie or show and books fan of the universe, I even find some of the old cast movies and new cast in the "first contact" case. Although it was kind of tragic ... it wanted to be so much, but it failed to be one of the many failed star track movies. This plot seems to want to combine three four stories into a final trek adventure, but when it tries, it becomes incomplete, when it wants to be, there is no excitement and action is not packed so that it tries to mess up the inconsistency. The whole movie to take a phrase from Spock is irrational. Next Generation Episodes are just as good, so it's also great for a television show, but not a big motion picture, this effect is not something special. Initially, the gang tried to stop the speaker's brother, because the plot is ridiculous, then joins his quest to find God, yes you read correctly. Clones get involved in the look, which will actually set up a well-researched country movie. You all know that the best part of the film is Kirk, Hones, and Spoke singing your boat, not singing well, but rather asking questions about the songs.
