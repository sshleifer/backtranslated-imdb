I've recently seen Shem, which is run by Engmer Bergman. The pictures were interesting and very unique. I was in Swedish with English subtitles and it was black and white. These features allow me to associate characters, periods and their stories better. I did not like how you knew how the movie was very slow and how it was going at the beginning. Firstly, it was mainly a story of Eva and John's relationship. The film ended in a very depressing note because there was nothing better than collisions and changes throughout the film. I probably would not see the sham again, but it was a very sophisticated experience.
