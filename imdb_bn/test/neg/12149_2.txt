Good folks, it's a picture of another stereotypeic picture of gay life, but the extra negative side does not allow bad acting, horror scripts, no budget, horror, and an impossible story to forget. <br /> <br /> It is the new Christmas York City and our story "Male Focus" for two men, boyfriend for some time immediately. One of them, his parents (right wing, religious zealot type) does not know that he is gay (adding the disqualification of the story because this guy is influential as gay boys come on this day) and his parents are coming out. They will be in his apartment in New York where he and his lovers are dressed for Christmas alone. <br /> <br /> The story continues to grow near the arrival of parents, no one likes and how only and predictive ways - they have come to learn the boy come gay. Tears are tired of my interest in this movie. <br /> <br /> Cast students of the local chamber, like a role playing role. Lovers of this movie are divided, and they do not seem to be united in their union. <br /> <br /> The landlord's plane and his attempts to become humanitarian in the situation have been reduced and surely it is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> While some people find a beautiful body (again, stereoitic imagery) at night, this story does not help. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering purchasing a purchase. You'll shoot yourself!
