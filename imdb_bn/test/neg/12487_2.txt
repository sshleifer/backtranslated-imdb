A rebuilding may be successful. An adaptation can be successful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scared, there was very poor movie. Firstly, only the letters look dangerous, or macho, they do not bring a sperm about them. <br /> <br /> Nagar (the character of Amitabh Bachchan) was so bright that we have to have his 'energy' and 'generosity' of character? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This comment was told to a commentator and Amitav was confronted. Now Amitabh can give bright facial expression, but it does not mean there is no history or story. <br /> <br /> There was no correct synthesis of characters working under 'Government'. . Just one man was shiny, why should we be intelligent to him. ] The flow of the movie was usually made because of the view of Godfather (because Abhishek Bachchan was raped like a policeman), the elder brother's death was on the death (as directed by Fredo Pase√±o), but too much pack was needed to go in with the movie with very short stories and depth. This was really a problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of complex packet like a godfather for 2 hours and they are very few conversations, then what you get is not a highlights show from a cricket match. A full match observer will be making full impact.
