Subject: Acting: Fair (some of it) Plot: Painful <br /> <br /> Description: The word slowly goes from high to almost unskilled; Music is not entirely terrible (but mostly is); Dialogues and characterization are ridiculous; The main character of the discovery is absolutely clear (and the author, apparently); Animal scenes are only intelligent stupid (as an example, an off-key, forgotten-song, wild horses from a "beginning" to a stupid twin song like "Moon River"). Finally, the "wet T-shirt" contest is so unclear that it is considered unbelievable. (Hint: The girl that won it is not ... well, I do not give it up.)
