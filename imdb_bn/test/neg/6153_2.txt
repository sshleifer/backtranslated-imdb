How nice !! I do not even know about this movie until I was searching for the name of another Mark Hamill Classic (Time Runner). Some things are unknown well left. Mark Hamill's role is quite limited. In those horrific B-movies of the 60's and 70's, I would compare their presence in this film with all the appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. In those movies, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. Do not try to run memorable by playing with such a great line. "You are arrested." I've mentioned that he said that multiple extra things. Bill Paxton Ozumaki's type of spiral falls into medicine and becomes warm after the alliance, because after the wake of a bing session in this film, he wakes up after the set finally ends in the film. Hair .. Hair !!! Invaluable bill In fact, "game should have ended" .. but in some way .. he treated .. and got better ??? Movie Hit this movie It's more dust and boring than Crazies. At least that movie was crazy ... this is just boring. Do not see this movie SOBER.
