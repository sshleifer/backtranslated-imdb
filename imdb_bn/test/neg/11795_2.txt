This image is a good partner for Blair Witch, because it is so wrong that BW has right. Like the BWA, it seems to be a documentary about this spectacular event, each member of the team manages his own camera. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also by working out narrow-dialog and strangely improv works by detecting the over-catching cast from docu feelings. And, the worst, supposedly participating cameras record too many events to be quite completely credible. In fact, with some re-editing, this thing can be a Blair Witch parody. Actually, there is a scene where Blund has eaten a sandwich that historically has a huge hole on which is really funny, it reminds me of the same scene from "Austin Powers: Spy Who Shagmed Me". But in the end the event was played directly without any fifth. It is difficult to know what was the purpose of the examination of St. Francisville except for a glamorous BW format. But it is very sad that when I came to it, I had a real interest in whether a blonde historian would stop her stomach if her T-shirt was not taken in a particular shot.
