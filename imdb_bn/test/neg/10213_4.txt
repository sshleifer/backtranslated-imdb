Hul Hogan, known as a champion wrestler (a real acting sequence ...), who was forced to protect his title, his title and his girlfriend from his greedy corporation, who wanted to sign up for his network (because he sold wrestling! ) But when the rip decreases, the network gets the championship of the circuit war (and I am totally serious) who are "war of strength" Postman Zeus (Tiny lister powered by junior) is probably the most dangerous man alive. Rip refused to fight, until his brother attacked and kept in a hospital. No Hold Barred What I hope is that Vince McMahon is the action actor (Hogan) who has played the lowest versatile actor, most of the time I hope that this is largely unreasonable humorous, strange series of tones, couples just step sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is not unlike wrestling itself, so I give it a fair rating because someone hired to know what they got. The film is cheap but well made enough for it and in reality the wrestling fans will probably enjoy it. I found this to be delightful until this end. They are the moments of foolishness that you just chocolate on your own. (For example, when Hogan flew 20 feet in the air after being trapped in Lim√≥n, how he would bind a man himself and of course send Hogan from his cocktail. (IE: "I'm not going to be nearly cleansing this check!") Hold Barred is a lot of fun, True, though, this is basically how ridiculous. Camp fans should really enjoy this clever clinker. <br /> <br /> * * 4- (Fair)
