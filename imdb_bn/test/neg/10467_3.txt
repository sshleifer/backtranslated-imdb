Now I tell you synopsis before it is a non-spoiler review. Sister Eat hits his mark for the worst movie of the year. I do not know how to get onto this movie even DVD. I would be very upset if I saw this in the theater. Bone Eater about these people who dig an old graveyard and find some bones. This is the 'bone voter' and he will be stronger than he is. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the DVD artwork looks vague and it seems unclear. When I hired it and looked at the DVD label it looked scary. But when I played it I could agree - the title is better than the 'bone-eater' title. Say what's more stupid? Eat a bone that just threw bones and ate you and you disappeared? There is no problem that you can not see what happened in the first 5 minutes. Or is it the stupid horse of 'bone eater'? Do you know I'm stupid? Whole movie <br /> <br /> CGI Awesome Yes I thought the concept of 'Bone Eater' was unclear, but once you see the real thing once it seems that it is a movie or simply cruel, average joke. The film felt much more than the Titanic and it was half an hour. The film is really closed at the moment of mysterious moment. I was good at acting but was not really decent and that violence was not top-top but everything else is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Overall bone banquet can leave you with a film. You want to like interesting movies with great creatures, great CGI, and suspense 'Bone Eater' but this is a movie. If you like bad movies, then 'Bone Eater' will be satisfied if you want them to be cheesy.
