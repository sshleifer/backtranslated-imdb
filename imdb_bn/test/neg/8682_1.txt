<br /> <br /> A very slow, arduous adaptation of Amir's satirical satire. The hero is portrayed as an enjoyable damn crutin but as a mere weird damaged. The rest are pure characters and the Helen macro sets in the true value and provides some of the novel's intelligence. In the 1920s, the time-frame structure of Harrah's comics and rock'on rolls was camped. Even worse than a bad TV TV quality is ugly. <br /> <br />
