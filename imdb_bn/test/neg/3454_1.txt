Seeing the first scene, I realized that the performance was so bad that it probably could not take it later. It sounds like a five-year-old child that if he knows about what he is saying, it is often used to refer to professional appearance through technology references and artificial. <br /> <br /> The second story is completely unrealistic and about the single decision about the scriptwriter, the kind of hope you expect from a lower-grade grade school student. The overall storyline was as predicted as a pair of sausages and packs. Some efforts to make conversation sound intelligible, neurotic, apologies were limited. A ten year old might like it. But the five year old will be accepted to accept the lack of reality; The advanced cell function allows to bypass a code lock by touching a magic trunk, such as by removing more than 100 voices (soap superman) through a ventilation system, and repairing errors by repairing just a computer, Wrong instead? Indeed, that scene was a handsome example: The error was that the cooling pipe (Aluminum Ribbon) was broken down in the CPU, this is a way that exploded by an exhaust pipe explosion of a V8 engine. This is not something that can not happen, and if it is done, it will not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric power running on this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his weapon worked by autopilot because his body cells were very effective), put a push-pin in the rip, one appears in desktop icons. Immediately screen without boot. <br /> <br /> And so it goes all the way. When he escaped from an interrogation room by discussing a lighter from a NSA headquarters under a fire sensor, resulting in open doors across the entire building. Naturally, this sharp predictor of the NSA did not predict the prediction and did not keep any guard outside their room (or anywhere else) to stay in the field of military advances in nanotechnology. So he went out and got a cab. Such examples are not only countless, but in reality only a single scene that does not make sense. Also, the so-called great effect was terrible. He threw a basketball back into a park and threw a basketball, and the child was dropped 20 feet horizontally in the tree. No acceleration or decrease, but constant motion and height like a bout trolley. I was sure that if I had given a break and started looking for these kids that could only keep them, they probably did not know how they could completely remove or annoy them. If someone throws so much away in the tree, they will say at least atouch (or instead of broken bones to the hospital), but the child was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the word for every creative decision made in the entire production. I am going to get the director down to my own personal blacklist, none of whom has been improved by anyone else. I want compensation for it to waste my 45 minutes to see it, and it took time to write it. Although it felt therapeutic, it was frustrating to understand how much it took to get a pilot approval. Only a little intelligent person can be seen this voluntarily, prison or lobotomy.
