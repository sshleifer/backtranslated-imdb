This movie started great; The first 30 minutes is very funny and clever with some fun characters. That's good news The bad news is that the film is very repetitive and then it gets stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> What we're getting is a new age for throwing Santa Claus in the mix with the "witch" forces Baluna It's just ridiculous and rarely a "Christmas movie" which I hope from Jim Verney's "Ernest" <br /> <br /> Be beautiful, it was still a sunny amount and a movie I was recommending May
