All this time the worst movie will be rated as one. The film is shown at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After screening, I just did not want my money back, I also wanted to spend 1.5 hours of my life. I have a very broad tolerance level with some European film-making exploration, but these films are selected for festivals based solely on the fame of filmmakers. This film proves that such elections can satisfy the compositions of filmmakers and the election panel, but there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development, the plot is a murky mess, style strangers, scary selection of the shot, and bad to edit. At the end of the first reel, if you go to the wrong movie and you are sorry at the end of the third relay, you will be begging to get out of your pain. This is a hated picture.
