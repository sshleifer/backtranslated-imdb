This movie is running for a young couple to start a new life in LA, which ends in a deserted sinking stop in the desert. In fact, it really is about the girl (Nikol), because her boyfriend literally disappeared within a few minutes. The film is moving very fast, and soon you are surprised how it can reveal the length feature. It has not been long before understood that this movie is just doing it by wasting time with unnecessary scenery. <br /> <br /> The story is not only thin thin, unselected, stupid and intrinsic. A few minutes after his boyfriend and car disappeared, Nicole found a mobile home in rest. He watched a camera flashing, and knew that people are inside, but he easily tried to get them help when someone closed his door and answered. After her boyfriend is informed by the killer that dangerous, he left all the stupid and unnecessary things left, walking around the rest stop. One of them is to launch a TV (even when he thinks he has fallen into a horrific situation even on an obscene film), even to roam, roam and drink a few hours from the wine bottle. He knew all that his boyfriend was kidnapped, the killer is still loose and pushing him, and he is not taking any action for immediate safety (he does not hesitate to close the door or take precautions). Oh yes, he tried to use a radio to call for help, but why is there a disturbance if there is a mobile home with the rest of the people standing there? While writing this part of the story, the script writer has forgotten this important fact. <br /> <br /> There is no sense about entrapment or current danger in this story. The heroine freely travels around and around the rest of the building, and the assassin sometimes runs to fear him sometimes before driving. There is nothing to stop Nicole from closing (even the rest stop is far better than the other, though it is better than the other), but she likes to stay the way she does. At one stage of the film, the main character, even the Akankallage, which he could run, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The story does not go anywhere, and instead just moves from the pointless segment to the non-pointing part. Nichol finally gets inside the mobile home and it is seen that the residents are refugee families, potential inbred or psychological religious fanatic. They deliberately seem to be unaware or unknowingly about the actions of the killers (but there is no indication that they are connected to him anyway), and then after a few minutes Nikol gets out. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant part, the main character wanders in the bathroom building. He discovered one of the previous victims (Traci, a young girl) who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reasons, Trash starts flipping the ridiculous amount of blood. Nicole Cobb's door closes for a crowbar to open the door, and when he comes back after a minute, both Tracy and his blood pool disappear without any explanation. What was the point? Nicole has found a bulletin board that shows to many missing people and it appears that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. So there was no ghost or something in Tracy? The author never gets annoyed to explain. Then, the Superintendent of Police showed the Superintendent of Police in the middle of the rest, which was easily neglected all day. Nicole tells her all what is happening, and when the murderer rises in her truck outside the office, the police go out to her face. How did the police officer know that some serious mistake? He got up and quietly spoke to the murderer (who also nikol had pointed him out), and the lieutenant's lie that he only gave driving and necessary guidance. Seriously When the police talked to Nicole, the pickup truck wandered around and knew him. <br /> <br /> The police began to tell Nicol√≤ quickly that he is a gentleman who is still "lucky to breathe" and does not die for awhile astonishingly. Two of them are talking a little bit stupid, and the important thing that has guns is not to mention it annoyingly for a long time. Finally, when trying to use their guns, Nicole slaughtered most of her bullets in the house and slaughtered her when the killer was probably behind her. Two bullets left, police told Nicol to lower him. He lit a fire in his mouth, and he kept still for a few moments with a rash leak of his head. Then, he suddenly and invisibly yells out "Miss you!" And he has to shoot him again. Strongly tried shock at <br /> <br /> Nico finally tackled the killer ?? And fails. The film ends with a long-standing visual scene, where a woman is now awkwardly reached more active rest. At the bathroom floor, he heard Nicole crying for help with the calret (locked like a trace). He gets a police member to go inside and check it, but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet. Cop page, it looks like he has been deceived. Nicole Nicole is coming out of some boxes in the cotttech, it looks like if the police spent ten seconds there, they could easily see if the police would say something or do something. WOW <br /> <br /> This movie is apparently the first of a new line of direct "DVD to DVD" movie, highly televised for the theater. Actually, it's just more cliche, B-movie junk.
