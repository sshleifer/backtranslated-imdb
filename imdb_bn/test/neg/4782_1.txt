God! Where do I start? From the beginning to the end, I could not help hating this movie. Grapes? Does cell phone phone make wine?! Oh yes, I'm scared - I'm going to get rid of the weeds of the earth! Come on man! The plot did not go anywhere, when the group discovered the ruins, and the village people (no curse) to warn them and under their mouths, do not worry, there was a picture of Amy (Zenna Malone) there! That whole scene really impressed me why he was not looking at his bees, Jeff (Zathathan Tucker), Mattias (Joe Anderson), and his eyes on the legs. After Matthias, when Idio threw the first rope, how the rope was at least ten feet away from the ground, but finally how was it capable of only two to four feet from the soil. There is not much to insert, I can not start to cover everything that is wrong about this movie. As far as the graphic was graphic, I would say graphics, but the acting and script were so horribly bad, but there was nothing in it.
