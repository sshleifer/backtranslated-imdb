This movie was very frustrating, and without a few moments, was not fly. Some more, it was just flippin 'stupid. The music francine was bad and the plot played like a bwu bowl game ?? Avoid too predictable (scared by scoring, a late game quarrel with the touchdowns, an assembly that is short and leads to losses). Originally, half-child / half-a-will will be dealing with his third member, and his religious confused brother Danny (we call him only a democracy), Kim (film's "Sweet Spirit"), Happles Maran, "Son Band" , As long as the photo man and the father of the photo (stage manager, Jill) talked to the will and made him straight. Trustworthy, Will's personality changes to 180 degrees and he is immediately mature and self-aware leader of the band. This is a tricky, perhaps funny, 10-minute roadshow gig, but if the movie is about 93 minutes long, it really will ruin your life. My advice ?? Will you usually spend the money to rent this show and burn it in your hair garden or drop the toilet down? Much more entertainment with less time commitment If you want to see a good movie of the same genre, get satisfied and get soldiers ?? Not a comedy, but an infinite good show (in fact, Kiba has more fun than SOP).
