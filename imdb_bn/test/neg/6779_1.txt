This problem - and with all the Vietnam War movies - they are all very biased. Antiair films have ignored the fact that most of the US soldiers were heroes, but Proyar's films ignored the fact that this army actually tortured it like this movie. This film sucks. This is not a time for a film that is not provoked, anti-liberal, and conservative, but totally disrespectful.
