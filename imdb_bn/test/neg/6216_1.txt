I do not think, at least in the last ten years, a movie I loved less than Mum Mia. From extremist songs to exist, I was cringing at least once every minute. I do not believe that I can bear a short segment which I have tolerated. I know that I will never see this disaster again. I can not believe that such talent such as Colin Firth, Merrill Strip, Pierce Brosnan, this film could be such a flop. But the lack of performance skills, apparently drug-induced dance, and then, to hear the music of Pierre Brojon (!), I can not see how this movie will not create shame in the light of the film. Of course, a movie that was never supposed to be created, and if you miss it for the first time, but I will not see it again.
