What a dramatic story of the life of Murray should have been seen as a stupid, sappy romance about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with Australian accent), which reads for Padrell-Steamer's Larkin's first partner (John Waters). <br /> <br /> The first half of this half-hour mini series shows some promises, but soon it flattens because it becomes predictable and thin. Some real-purpose veg and sparks were needed in the plot to give some life to the film. Gas Marcureau's early exit did not help him because his character seems to be the only attraction to me. <br /> <br /> This version of TV is probably in depth, because the translation of this video is certainly lacking. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
