It was so frustrating to see this movie. The split screens do not allow you to get too involved in actors' emotions. I'm constantly going behind all these small images which I eventually found myself with wipplash. It originally released a pack of "meritorious Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode" which I tried to cool down the filmmakers. I wish out many other people went out like that.
