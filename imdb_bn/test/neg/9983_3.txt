210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or I heard) or released in the theater R Reti version? Both of course, horrible is terrible. Both Peter O'Howell and Malcolm McDowell have claimed that they want him to not make the film (later it is reported to two people at the IMDB interview!), And I can see why. There is nothing but soft core porn on a platform and a nonsensical mess of a half-hearted endeavor. <br /> <br /> There is nothing other than cheap and foolhardy scenes here. McDowell himself said about the film: "It was just for a moment that I wandered, mocked my mug or something, and the next scene will go to two lesbians." <br /> <br /> true <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
