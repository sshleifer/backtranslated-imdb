Froggie is upset that he does not have a big party like all other kids. Spanky and gang ask him for the remedy that provides him an amazing party. All the decorations and preparations for him are painful for him, for him the party is destroying everything to make it very late <br /> <br /> Okay, our gang comedy fits and works at the beginning. Bit works but I do not think it works entirely on one. The part of the problem is that we all know where it's going and since it's mostly humorous it needs to be surprised that the whole thing is reduced. I think in a strange way the film just missed. The thing that it actually took about this could probably be more than a wafer. If you are less than expected, then your price is worth trying
