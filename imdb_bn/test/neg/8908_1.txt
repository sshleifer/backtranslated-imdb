The movie is what a shit is The scripts are simply non-existent. Sometimes the movie seems like a music video. But it can not be that since the soundtrack really does not match. Combination of action and wrap teeth. It may seem like a recipe for a successful flick ... here it sadly fails. Dialog me in this membrane just kill me. When Harlan is interrogated by some police, the scene is cruel. Generally speaking, recent Sigal films are only visible. What happened to this guy? I know he is old, but can not he get "Hollywood" that does not have him an appropriate script or anything? Is he going out of dough for his escape in India that he serves him?
