A box with a button allows a couple to be financially free, but the cost gives life to someone who they have never met. It's a very tedious film to see. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed, decided to make a film without any concessions. You are taking a ride up slow build, one with unexpected revelations after each other. At certain moments, I think myself, ultimately it will be its main significance, but nothing will happen. The film leaves only a thought, "This story can be said within 30 minutes, except for all the tearing." I hope you avoid this god-horror film and thus keep your close up.
