This movie is so stupid that I want to return my $ 2.99 which I've paid !! First of all, this film is full of talent from the wooded actor Gixes as they come down the street because "real" actors are not shown due to ridiculous script or they are not just frustrated enough. Make this movie! The music of this movie is not enough for you to sleep enough, for the desert ferries, the Musical Instrument Musical Instrument! And the guy dressed as a devil looks like he dressed up in a K-Mare Halloween special costume! There are no dead scenes without a few lame scenes. I just laughed, seeing the terrible killers in the bath dress facing Nasafratura! The whole city is going to run away from the year! This movie is one of the worst giant movies I have ever seen. Avoid this one!
