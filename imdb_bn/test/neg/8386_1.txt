Last night I saw this picture, though I would rent a scary / horror movie from blockbusters and I got it out. The opening scenes were so long in the air, where the conversation does not seem to lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story line was so poor to me, she gave her HIV and then she went to meet someone but she killed the person who was infected (I think she could do it for a long time. Then he pushed the body, and when he met the man he was going to meet, he was in the jungle and saw him dumping the body. Then he pursued them (did he ever bury the body?) And they entered a car and they came from them in any direction and they exploded. <br /> <br /> I think the only good thing on the head was to remove the film because it was quite realistic. And then when the woman ran, she fell in front of him, so she could tear it out !! And then it's refined !! <br /> <br /> Which one relief I have ever seen, the most vain movie ... please make it clear clearly, it was created very badly, I have only counted five different people and the scene where he killed him, So unrealistic and they only swear it and it is that !! It's from me ... <br /> <br /> Steer is well clean !!
