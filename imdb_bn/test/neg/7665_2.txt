'Airport 4' is basically a new cast for Universal Studios - a concordance supersonic aircraft - to combine them together to try and work in the 'Disaster-in-the-sky-sky' formula. <br /> <br /> Strange humor, which is best, when George Kennedy follows his flight from the concert window at the supersonic speed to burn a hefty missile missile fire and make it easy that these foolish passengers are re-boarding all in the air. Despite the problem continue their flight to the same flight. Robert Wagner, Silvia Cristal, Alain Dellon and Martha Roy, many stars as the nerve passenger <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
