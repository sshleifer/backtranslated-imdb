I am proud of being a Dutchman, I am really shocked by the flicks like this. Why? Why played this cheap? Why is this story that just sucks? Why a dozen sequels? Why and why? They added a lot of hot Dutch girl to try to save this film from release, and guess what? Look at all the Underground BridgesLogi of Holland. I was forced to visit it in a group. All the girls were going crazy when Dan Squareman entered the screen, all the boys took another beer and got bored ... but the thing that really bothers me is that these flickers are Dutch filmmakers ... ("Van Gaud Except "Los" and "Lake") does not prove our superiority to another country. It does not add anything to our imagination ... it is only F ** small 13-year-old girls ... Johan nijenahuisa, I hope you burn for ever!
