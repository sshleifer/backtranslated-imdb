You want to be a fan of the little man, but I'm not fair, funny and completely funny to Karmen Burles. <br /> <br /> Recapturing the story of Chaplin Karmen and playing a big role like Don Joss. This is a story about men and women who love it, even though it is unclear why a woman like Carmen would love, because she played men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said I did not think it's too much. Chaplin made dozens and many other good films so that you can leave it on the roof. <br /> <br /> What is the difference between this movie and the 1915 edition? Is an IMDB wrong? <br /> <br /> Full: 3/10.
