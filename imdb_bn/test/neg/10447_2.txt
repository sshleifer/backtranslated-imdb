I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad, but the shark became cold. So I rent it. Bad idea This movie was so bad that I was happy that I had the option of fast moving forward. Shark itself is okay. Its appearance is perfect and it is the only thing that gets saved from this movie 1, (I've given it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and dialogue is just as great. I did not expect much but I was surprised by this suckfest. Any kind of biologist or scientist or something, Antonio Sabota Jr., I was not really paying attention. He took the submarine costly crew to know what was happening under the water taken out of the Shark. However, it does not show all the scenes that work under water. After all, if they were going down to know what happened at this station, then what were the huge tranquilizers darts and halapoons and the stuff. This thing you usually carry with you when an accident is investigated. The shark theory was developed by Antonio, but in the way they did not know what they were up against. Antonio and these young college students, by terrible actress in the way, are sub-problems when sub-sub-controls jump. What's with it? Not everyone is getting sub-training before leaving high school, I think it's a little silly. The director feels that if the crew members work in the background, it is a good idea to cast someone into the background. Metal sub rafting is very important when I guess your sub. Anyway I could go but I said so long ago. Bottom line: Visit your local video store, rent this video and then crash it. Then send an email to IMDB to delete all records of this movie from their site. This photo must destroy all the memory and evidence. We can do it if we work together.
