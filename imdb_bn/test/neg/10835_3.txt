What a horror movie The effect was poor, especially by today's standard, but that was incurable. A floodless flood / disaster damaged disaster is a terrible rehabilitation of the movie that was ever made in this part of the trash. The acting was awful and I mean unprecedented. Michelle Green was a delightful storytelling story that prevented the rescue of a dog from the nearby tower. They see the water comes and run for their lives. (By the way they found old fat dogs so Ms Green could not be disqualified). They took water for a while before taking shelter. What speed! Later, a speeding car is not fast enough to escape loudly. God, he and that dog run fast! If you want to see a good movie about a dam breaking - this is not. Porchlight Entertainment introduced some good family films but this time they just missed the mark.
