As President of the United States, Michael Kanchita Alonjo, Vice President of Women, presides over a semi-credible part of Shi'ad as President of the United States. The movie just stinks. It is a wonderful thing with a lot of holes in the plot that they can block the picture they shot. The late night relegated to the time schedule of HBO, this film is not worth all to see. In this 10 minutes, you are asking yourself why it was written. It's 40 minutes, you're wondering why you're watching this. Save the effort and see Hey Howe or something to run again. Something better than this clunker.
