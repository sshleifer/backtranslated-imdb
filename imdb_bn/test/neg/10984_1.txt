There are some nice scenery to see here, if you can open your eyes for a long time to see it. I am a big fan of life, but these people are just plain blue. Although there is nothing political, the whole movie can be considered as a political statement, it shows how the Communist person destroys the person, making everybody the same dry creature, which only makes his life sleep, eat, and sometimes love.
