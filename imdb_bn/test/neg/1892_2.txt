I'm not sticking to the movie, oh I have seen so bad I can see something. Probably that I finally saw this one. I am also a big fan of RPG games, but this movie is objectionable for any self-respecting RPG. The safety-cameras footage of a game-play would be more realistic in comparison to this movie. Line, cut, audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was painted in some pictures !!!!! (More corruption) !!!!! People who are running around are not allowed to sit beside computers. If I get ninjas around you will you continue your work? Oh and jokes about pirates, yet it's the worst movie! !!!!! (spoilers end) !!!!! At least the first one felt like a documentary, now it seems like someone else examines the home video. You can find good movies on YouTube. Top Line: Do not waste your time and money on it, as bad as it is.
