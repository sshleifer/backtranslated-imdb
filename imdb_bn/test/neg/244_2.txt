Happily followed by the atmospheric root and ridiculous fools, this incredibly slow, slow, and unknown stray came across as a big letdown. Again, the abusive criminal batsman Bat (Hamy Lewis Casenida) Aztec tried to steal valuable jewelry from Mummy Popoca. The bat creates a sunny wooden robot with a human brain to achieve this great goal. Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, with a playful and tedious script, directed by Flippy Portillo, continuous continuation (for example, the bat was definitely killed at the time of the previous movie, but miraculously alive and well here!) Lazy scripts, the excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, A scary story, lack of action and lack of speed, Mo Slowly movements (non) perform an unheard-of-cast cast and go through a bad phase climatic war, Mummy and Robot (The movie finally explodes to disintegrate the stupid life with big bows, but it rarely lasted for two hours and Thus, it is too late to eliminate the intensity of general exaggerated disturbance) as a complete washout, this numbingly dry, drippy, eb draggy snorefest rate.
