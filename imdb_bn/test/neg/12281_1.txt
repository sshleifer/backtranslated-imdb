I had to write a review for this movie, which says poor, non-stop action, great movie. <br /> <br /> These people were apparently watching a different movie. Killpoint really sucked to go from the sound !! I was waiting and waiting for this picture to wait and it was no good. Some say that this movie was brutal and others said, but in reality, I can not find any adjective in these adjectives, which means that many people have seen many scenes of shooting in hell and there is no blood in them, even fun! ! I guess the best way to guess that it should probably be PG rating according to the 1984 standard and now in 2010 there is no doubt that it will be PG! Bad, BAD Fun Glasses "B" Different Movies !!
