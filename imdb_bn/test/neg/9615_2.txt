Oh dear - How did Alfred Hittak (northwest north, spellbank, 39 steps) stop this ugliness, cheap fake shock is out of my way Do not bother looking for hidden depth or deeper meaning - there is no one. This is just awesome, seedy and cheap. A Freedom Fighter inspecting the life of an inspector in the house - his wife calls herself a significant cook and continues her rebellious cooking tests towards her poor husband. It's entertainment, and I've just been saved to remove the film on 'terrible' brackets, but it's completely seen that the movie I've ever seen is the most unpleasant. I believe this next hit movie from Hitcoak - probably someone trying to say something to him.
