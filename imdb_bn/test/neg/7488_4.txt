Obviously, Andres Beethman wants to wear Jess Franco's crown during the greed of Lina Romain (at least cinematic) wife of old workshop This modern, ambitious W.I.P. In Rome, a corrupt, arbitrary, prison prisons are operating. Movies. With some exceptions, many of Franco's films are shamelessly produced and quickly operated on a slipside. Shots do not always cut together and the sound mixes can be awesome. When I watched "Angel of Death 2" (Lawyer "Prince Island Hacker"), I asked myself whether or not he is deliberately trying to replicate the patent exploitation of Franco, or is he naturally lazy like his mentor? Is this movie deliberately bad, which would be suicidal, or is it just neglected? When a shooter is forced to give gunshott blowjob, his rapist fills his face, then he fills his yagna with some medicines. After a few minutes, he is hauled in a clifftop prison due to explanation and reasons not explained under the rough management of the leers and staff and other jails. It's as a WIP film, lots of lesbian scenes and plenty of violent behavior. Gore bloody and tragic, even with teeth tension and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach) as happy. Acting is quite awful and warlike in the hair, but there is a sense of sleaze in each frame that enjoys a love and trash fans. Unfortunately, flat script makes for a flat movie. So, despite the presence of numerous tortures, hardcore sex and Jess Franco's guest presence, the experience is empty. But what does most of the Jess Franco movie do?
