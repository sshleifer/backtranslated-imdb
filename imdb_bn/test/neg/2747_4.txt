'Aphrilif' is a bit insolent, rationally rich person who finds out that his mother is dying, and she shows herself to her sister, who has Downs syndrome. She can not be disturbed with her, and basically just wants to get her hands off; She has good things. At one point he saw that he would take him to the car across the country (he does not like to fly) to him. <br /> <br /> If this is known to you, then it is probably because you 'Rainman,' a film, much better than its imitator, 'Afterlife. 'It is not a fundamental problem for the movie, by copying the original premises (o ck, it is a few letters and even the worst of the scenes). The basic problem is that I do not think about these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother, Kenny (Kevin McKidd), a bit of a man and a man. To him, a girlfriend who came and goes in the story, and who likes Downs syndrome sister (again, it is taken from 'Ryanman'). She is trying to get an interview with a doctor who faces a scandal in the journalist. When Robert's time is over, he does not have much time for him, and sometimes he leaves her alone more alone. When he is torn, he is also upset with her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " She is 'normal', and people want to stop her treatment differently. She starred in Palaga, the actress who has done Downs syndrome, and her performance is the best thing about film; Why does the screenplay not explore its character more? Well, probably because of the fact that the characters have to get in the way of the story. When we definitely knew the story already, did the filmmakers not see the problem they created? <br /> <br /> For a movie about a dead mother and her kidnapped daughter (Parents are absent, I think she is dead, but I'm not sure), it is astonishing to see the impact of the movie on the audience's emotions. Scenes, such as ideological, neutral, ideal, predictive dialogue, I saw myself turning my eyes. <br /> <br /> There is nothing against me in the movie, but it is only if you care about the characters. Here the characters are so weird and bi-dimensional that I do not really feel that it has been cared for. 'Rain Man' has a mental climax, but that moved me, because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climaxes, this film has a stinker. There is a sequence at the end of the film which starts as an incredible situation and ends in the worst part; An unforgivably brutal technique played on the audience. The sequence is designed to move the listener, but the manipulat and audience's intelligence are terribly end up to insult. The audience is not stupid, and when they are cheating, they know. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no visual effect in this picture. There are some interesting sequences, yes, but when the characters speak to each other, I can virtually see the screenplay in front of me, keep predicting and unintentionally, do not hit something that touches the mind or the heart. Especially those who have Foni arguments reserved for movies, where other characters know exactly what the answer is. Why 'realistic' films are not realized, in real life, anger can be illogical, and sometimes people can not express their emotions and they can say something that is not meaningless or can not say everything. All actors in this movie deserve better ingredients. This picture is not really based, but I think a documentary of the Downs Syndrome member's family will be more interesting. Thus, we can have true and passion. For some reason, the characters of this picture think that a passion is just saying something very loud and creating appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (of 5)
