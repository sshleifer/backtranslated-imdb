I would say it's the worst movie that I've ever seen in my life, I can not believe that I lost $ 10 in Blockbuster; This movie will be burned and there are problems that people have ever thought of. This film has really spent money for the money. == This film does not give any sense to some of the great actors and scenes. Well, there is no idea of ​​the whole movie. It is also part of the "Men" Diner (which belongs to the National Securities Department), which has become the worst part of the film. How do they dare to say that Frank Sinter's name is terrible? Also, what's up with those glasses? When the man and the girl stay in the car and drink it, you can say that she is not drinking too! Also, what's up with the freaky diner? And everyone knows that you do not tear the tire, you slash them.
