WARNING !!! Some potential plot speakers, as was possible !!! <br /> <br /> Well, if you still can not find the plot, then I'm going to give it to you. Two couples go to a camping site, but a shoe looks masked killer and all kinds of illusions arise. <br /> <br /> Now it's time to give some advice to these couples. <br /> <br /> 1. Sometimes the locals do not go to the Camp Camp Blood Camp. 2. Do not be sexually or in front of the murderer. 3. If he escapes, then do not go behind the murderer. 4. Do not scream prejudice at the killer. 5. Ensure that your cellular phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone must bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and always carry it themselves. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals. 8. If you need glasses or contact lenses, you do not stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car key. 10. When you go to bed, set camp fires. 11. See your steps. If you trip something, you're going to break a bone. 12. Check the backseat for uninvited estimates. 13. If the killer has cornered you, at least make a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually four main characters break all of these common sense rules. They're the most cruel character ever to please a photo. <br /> <br /> For some brief comments now. This slash film was very tough budget. So 7 or 8 actress plays less than four different roles. Below the line of acting, writing, direction, sound, light, camera work, plot, editing etc. But like the classic movie Jack O. It's a sooooooooo bad job, it's very entertaining and fun-filled camps. So this is the rental and a good time and smile. My rating: 10 out 5
