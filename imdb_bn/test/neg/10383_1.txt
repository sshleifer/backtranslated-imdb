I tell you something ... this movie smiles all the trams and hands down Gore movies because in reality it tries to come as a serious movie. From terrible acting ... "I knew it, I knew he was!" ... the pastor accepts sexual intercourse and gets a shower with nude teenagers ... take a goat cake. I'm trying to compare this to other movies in the same way as bad at a loss. This could just be a custom of all its own. Kicker is actually producing oversaw some capital to ensure that the actual situation was true. I do not know that people in the United States backed by works of curiosity. I am not sure whether I am worried about renting it or have read it in a comedy. It was a very guilty pleasure ... so terrible that I saw my eyes half in hand (when I was not laughing so hard I was crying). The ends are simply made in any sense, perfectly pulled together the whole thing. If you want to see something funny, but here is your movie. You want a scary movie on exorcism .... to move.
