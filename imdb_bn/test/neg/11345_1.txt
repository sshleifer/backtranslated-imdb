Dude ... I saw Biffy and Angel as the next scientist ... but it's too much. The worst actress ever! Even David "Hot Pants" Borianz can not save this sound. No wonder I do not see Fox? Hit it !! We completely gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. We saw four or five painful, agonizing episodes. I want to run a net in SA BAD! Why is spending money on this drill?!? I do not get it and I do not support it, and you do not waste time showing this show ... unless you lose sight of your eyes, you do not like it! <br /> <br /> Shit. Shit
