I saw that c. Thomas Howell appeared in many films as his congratulatory young actor in the 80's. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in some parts it has internet related plots and see how old C. Thomas Howell! I did not recall him in any movie in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> What a big disappointment in just a few words? I give a chance to some low budget movies, but this one starts lame. In the first 15 minutes of the movie, this incest female is chatting with an Asian guy in a chat room. They basically encourage themselves in their chat, then she personally tells the participant to show them. He met him, has sex, closed him up and then killed him with cold blood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> It does not pay to buy less, despite it being $ 1 DVD. I plan to take my copy of DVD to take the GÃ¼ndel. I am really surprised that the reviewers here gave a bad rating to this movie.
