So ... what is it like the high industry for the SXSW Film Festival and Sun's choices, yes? Well, I think the story, script, dialog, acting (to save Mrs Ashelton) can be as long as I can relate, cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant. I think some of the other film makers have been making friends for a few years before the biggest problem of digital video was that now we will see anything that sea shadows will go through the sea in future, anyone and their brothers (or Brothers in the case of Duplas) may end up and make a movie. "Puffy Chair." <br /> <br /> <br /> This feature length video is a depressed, almost all-in-one chapter in the world of "Dudology"; A dvx100a, a few thousand dollars, fast written, armed young guns with shallow scripts, and a few friends, they decide on one afternoon that a filmmaker and villa !, instant feature videomaker Do not make me wrong - I'm about an independent movie (as Hollyvald sucks). But you said that you can not argue with some reality of the system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplas Brothers have to go out and the actual budget is presented and the actual producers would have to be brought, there would never have been a clear script in that light! And there is problem problem. Films (sorry ... video) There is nothing as viting process to prepare for production. Just grab a DV / P2 camera and you're off! And it makes it worse that high profile sources like the above profiles actually embrace and encourage such dirt. And why? Sufficient maker because of its budget. <br /> <br /> I think it is important, especially in today's movie climate, labeling the video makers themselves in high-jack languages, "filmmakers." My book has quite a difference. When you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, then you will be asked for friends and family or businessmen for real money, after learning about the risk of possible losses, what you know will be "filmmaker" to create the "movie" feature. . " But for some DV tapes, dropping hundreds of Sam's clubs, some soda and chips do not cut it. <br /> <br /> ... And anyway ... I have to mention how bad it was to hear a female addressed as "dude" across the movie. Even Mark Borchardd, who has preserved his negligent moniker for his friends, only where his friend Mike is worried! <br /> <br /> I think it was high time that the Indie Film Community started calling me this shadow. No budget video for what they do, and simultaneously scold the honorable festival for such casual effort, high praise. Whether or not this festival has at least courtesy of adding a new category to their festival lineup ... "Dude Films."
