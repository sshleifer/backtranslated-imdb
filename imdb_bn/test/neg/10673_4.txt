Frank Tashlin's censored 'Snafu Private' aims to show the importance of military secret secret sensors from lenses. Snafu tries to talk to her girlfriend that she will stay in the South Pacific but the censor wants to make any effort to send the letter. These first scenes are the best, invisible sensors with long mechanical weapons, nets and even a specially appointed eagle, excluding the letter from the sky! At the second end of the cartoon, Sanafu Technical Pie, managing to send a letter with the first class (actually sending him a lesson), it is less fun and final with the disappointing and only disappointing dream of the only dream. The key point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the extremely harmful girlfriend of Snifu, which can be seen even in Ben-Breasted, though with all the strategically placed kingdoms! In the army it is noticed, Sanafu shorts are often marked by high pains, but these scenes are as much as possible to crabbirds, so far I have come across any of these shorts. Despite all these, I like snafu shorts which go for a little more, usually becoming the death of the main character. For a great example, look for "The Spy" by Tasklin's The Goldenrich or Chuck Jones. The 'sensor' comparison is fairly weak.
