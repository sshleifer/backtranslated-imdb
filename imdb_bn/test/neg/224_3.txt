In 2003, I was surprised by the director's control of Antel. His first American project, Rackencia, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is its second feature and when the visual signature is recognized, the film never goes above the level of the B movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the main premises has twist and twisted elements and it should be able to cast shoes with many quality actors. Antal might have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could flick a cool action but it really is not that division is provided. <br /> <br /> What you have put behind is an unlikely situation, a group of weakly depicted characters and fighting against a lot of money. If you have seen sharp cinematography, cast and tight music scores, then you can stay in the average video below with Van Dame or Siegel in the average video below. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most frustrating movie for me for quite some time.
