I went to see it with myself to make sure it was appropriate to meet my little boy. Thanks <br /> Thank you, because I do not allow a child to see this thing. Why? Violence, death, funeral. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, keep them away. <br /> <br /> Why are these things covered in a children's movie in the world - especially one whose tag line is "Key Party Animals"? The execution of ganglund can be executed on the hello quo cartoon. <br /> <br /> There was very little to laugh and far away. There was no one to say to yourself. Cows are notable as Cows of The Far Side comics. I think everything about this film has nothing to do with humorous violence and unconstitutional activities for kids.
