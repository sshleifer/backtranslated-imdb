I read this image online and saw positive reviews in general and after watching the trailer, I decided to test it for myself. What a disappointment! It starts well enough. The opening scene was actually quite tense, but it's all downhill from there. I can see that filmmakers try to do something with this movie, but by doing so, they have enjoyed watching it all. "CSI" will really pull this movie with the use of editing, music and museum, lack of mystery, fear, or humor. There is a lot of farsightedness and many "fine" sources, so when the first twist comes first, you know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think cast has done a great job, except for the other, I can not recommend this movie.
