I was expecting much from Amitib Bachan's role as Srikrishna, but I was disappointed. At the direction of Ram Gopal Varma, I was not ready for such a movie. The government is considered to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is dependent on the power of others instead. Nomination is a Tamil film based on God's Father theme and led by Kamal Hassan. The film is well-directed and ultimately the power is in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not her son. Amitabh Bachchan seems very helpless in the film and he has accepted everything instead of changing everything. The movie failed to show God's father's powerful influence.
