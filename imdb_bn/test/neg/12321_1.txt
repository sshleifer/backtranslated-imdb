Encouraged, and the correct deteriorating adaptation of classic children's stories is not only due to the lack of elegance of its ancestors, but it is lacking in a talent. Mike Mayers has a clear hole in her, which Jim Carey, who should not be ashamed of herself for her shocking performance, but she will give up acting together. If you are able to jump on the right in the movie, then it would be so annoying if you want to shit from it. The set is ugly and cinematography is very poor. I have seen many bad films this year, but it does not take cakes, but with no doubt it has made one more bad movie.
