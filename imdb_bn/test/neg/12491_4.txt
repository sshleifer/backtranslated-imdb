Amitabh Bachchan is frustrating to play such a weak role, especially when he was out of the excitement of Black (which I highly recommend). One line of the film says: "Cycore is not a mere man, he is a thought and philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma believes in God as the inspiration of this film and it is probably the problem. It seems like a badly misguided American movie set in India. Seven elements of making left elbow index film - the performance, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artistry, and production sets - average scores with 10 to 1 low highs, 5. The film's continuity seems to be high, as an 8th, with the drama going on in places to keep a violent voice and motivation using justice beyond the legal system. But there seems to be a lack of emotion related to the crime of organized crime. Acting rate 4, it seems very weak, even when someone is beaten or killed, it seems that it is huum. For example, when a character is shot in the forehead, I feel frustrated at myself, or when it will fall. He did not, and Al Ronald Rigan was kept in Automobile, and his bloodshot face pounded Ala John F. Kennedy. The plot rate is, in the example of American American Style Gangstisme 5, on the head of his family-based Robin Hood. Character development seems to be static, and the letters seem like chess pieces in a disguised chessboard, resulting in 3 ratings. The conversation remains steady, and seems to be compelling to fit a wife's pattern for the conversation. Production sets show below average - a 4. And, the industry is very annoying, many close-ups, fast panning, and many group views where the actors are re-practiced - a 3. Many of my camera movements were interrupted. The left elbow indexes average 4.4 and due to poor degradation, it dropped below 4 due to a slight decrease. Two questions are raised in the film: One, why are so many people eating so many times? And, is not the crime of the organized crime in India? Such films should be so dependent in western cultural examples? I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can not recommend this picture.
