I happened to catch this supposed "awesome" flick on this Friday night, I went to sleep! Tell me ... a 3 foot tall raincoat - Claude Tiverpus is supposed to tell something awesome about a guiley cycle? Not here, yet MI-Lo has still been able to wear shit from Jennifer (Antonio Fergus), who is three times his size (?) Uh-hah. And the finale is so cruel ... it's what sometimes you leave hanging with nothing! I asked myself, "what is this ???" <br /> <br /> The acting can be found in low-budget movies just as well. The above Fargas delivers a decent performance; But it's my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn could probably strat the city of one of the worst actress ever in Tinsel! Sure, cute face, but bad acting. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1
