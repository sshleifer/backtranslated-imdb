I got up and it was a nice day; The sun was shining, the birds were singing and I fancied to get a movie, something new, a horror movie? Like many other critics I can only be described as a part of the Pope in the gold cover. The front cover is fantastic, and the back comment is becoming fun - 'It will take away from you crops' ... oh how I look back at such proximity and ignorance. <br /> <br /> This awesome acting performance is more awesome than this movie. I do not think, no, when I actually took away this 'awesome' dress, I was really happy, who used to wear some classic fancy dresses. I used to drive past cornfields very fast as I found them quite scary in the night, but this movie saw, I was almost wet around myself (through many smiles) almost at sight. <br /> <br /> I have seen the scary omelette quite authentic, though not mine, I am a dub-hand during the cooking of amlet, and if someone joins this match with my omelet, then just say that I will create a situation all day in a row 3 times will be forced to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If someone has a good crop (crop or pop) film then they can recommend, feel free to inform me. It's a great comedy, if not anything else, well it's nothing else. Enjoy, but make a little bit of advice - before you press the play button of your DVD player, just drag it out of the window.
