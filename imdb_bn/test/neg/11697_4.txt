No serious spoilers, but some are very minor. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The child, who has normal feelings with the dead tree in the family garden, finally when this couple has their own child and then the tree mentioned above seems disturbed by the family. <br /> <br /> And that's about it. The film revolves around 80 minutes for more than 100 minutes. It is essentially a thin family drama with a toxic tree, and is very less in the path of fear, just playing with the strange flashing words above the tree shots. However, the idea of ​​the tree is like a child's mother, but it is not entirely absorbed in its potential. From this type of new wave, it separates "Aksia": Movies like Ju-On and Ring work opposite, and the mixture of milk until the red turns red. <br /> <br /> <br /> The picture starts going towards the end; But the perception of child's fate and parental action does not just ruin the curiosity of the story, but similar machine guns are published that it is difficult to take once. The final order is undoubtedly unclear, but it looks very late. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole film, with the help of "Renaissance" in Korea, could not help, but it seems that this picture could have been so much.
