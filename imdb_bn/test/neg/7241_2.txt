I could be scared if I was still 5. It's a low budget film (I guess). Acting may not be good, but bad - Filming and special effects are horrifying. The story line is thin and does not have the value to live. Excessive time is used in annoying shouting scenes. Follow me or fight with aliens, reminding me of the war kids with the scary mask on. Some thunder with blood and body parts - I think scared a 5 year old child. Apparently shit from some people in the film is scared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the alien ships around the world. It will surprise you if anyone has a signal ...
