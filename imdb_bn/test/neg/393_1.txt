I have a word: focus <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's discuss the finer points of focus. I do not know about the rest of you, but in my first year of the film school, they taught us many inefficient etiquettes, such as 'you will be the most famous anti-garde filmmaker' - but they also teach us how to do lunatic things to focus on lens! It was amazing! You pay a little twist and wham! Everything is as clear as a bell. Alice found that the person needed to learn some things about the fine point of focus. Light, too much This film is not just beyond focus, but it also enlightens as the cornerstone of some of the inner bases. <br /> <br /> Let me also start panning or plots. They could prune the last ten seconds of each shot starting and closing. <br /> <br /> But whoever care about him? There is not enough scope for the film's best friends - focus, and a complete lack of lighting. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise.
