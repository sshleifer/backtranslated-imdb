I actually trold the whole set of reviews, giving this movie less than 5 stars. They were few and far away. That's absolutely annoying! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not run by Christopher Nullan, but the Lord is good. This is straight-to-contract-bucket nonsense. It should have been done with them and bloody things should be animated. What is worse is that the IMDB will not let me finish my rent just because my review will be more! <br /> <br /> "Great" in-game camera shots are taken from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf in PlayStation, the story is a sulking school boy, multi-blank characters and plots development cripples weak setup, and the grand finale is annoying. In addition to <br /> <br />, this was the greatest film of all time in my life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic looking dress, set and sports equipment. There, I said it.
