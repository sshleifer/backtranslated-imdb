Star Warsi is coming through the wall of the movie theater. I heard the only entertainment item to watch this movie (yes I'm really going to a bad movie theater). This movie is so bad that I think my eyes are worse than the cats. <br /> <br /> Let's compare it to the original. An impressive, fun, exciting, well-liked and one of the best movies ever made, the other is not far from the funny thing that you can expect that your eyeball will fall, so you will not see it again. . I'm sorry, Christina Richie is not a great actress, but she has been able to compare with Hello Mills and also took part in Dog E Dog, which captures the amazing and absolutely captivating Dean Jones. The new version of Dean Jones is part of the only partial partnership of this movie, and this is the only reason I can support rating 1 * (also does not go to IMDB Negative).
