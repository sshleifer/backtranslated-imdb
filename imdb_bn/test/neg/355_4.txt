As a physicist, my heart racing talking about blackholes and cosmicism. But I found this presentation very slowly and is not packed with enough information for interested people (who might see it possibly). If you have a momentary curiosity among these things, go to the library and see some books. You will explain more detailed scientific wonders as well as admitting you to a greater surprise than this movie. Also to set the record straight: Hawking is not considered "the greatest mind" or global "intelligent person", as is commonly presented in user reviews at IMMb. Hawking himself commented that "it's trash, it's just media campaign, someone needs someone to fill their role model of disabled people, at least I'm disabled." To be fair, he is probably considered a genius but also among the greatest scientist of history, like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many others are even more easily judged. This is not to condemn Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist but not insulted others who have done more than that. However, if you really see science in the movie then But if not, I think it would be boring for you.
