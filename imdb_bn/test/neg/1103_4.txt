Child deaths and horror films will always have a sensitive and controversial combination, and so my personal opinion that the boldness shown in this movie will attract some extra attention from the horror fans. Of course, in cases of "Wicked Little Things", such controversial themes do not always guarantee a good movie. In spite of the potentially interesting plot, the ambiguity of the atmospheric setting and video of the nasty director JS. Cardon ("The Slayer"), it is a vague and clay-raided film that can not provide single fear or shock. After losing their husband and father, the remaining Tanni women (mother Karen and her daughter Sarah and Emma) moved to small and remote Pennsylvania Hills, where they were the heirs of an old, ramshackle palace. Their new home is dangerously near the old mining ruins, where dozens of innocent children lost their lives sadly in 1913. Something strange began to happen, such as young Emma being friends with a (fantasy) girl who lived in their homes, the locals and Karen's girls seem to be secret. Michael Curtton, the owner of rapid death, is responsible for their death, to take revenge on their descendants, uninterrupted children leave their graves at night. "Wicked Little Things" is rather mere and highly anticipated. The script unexpectedly serves an awesome clich√© after another, such as stuck mud at important times of vehicle wheels, such as flashlight and horridly broken dolls malfunctioning. There is very little mystery, even less gore and make-up effect frustrating poorly. Zombified children do not look appealing to all. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson with black colored clothes, pale face and dark eyes. As stupid and derivative as the rest of this stupid product of tension-free finishing. Laurie Huring is completely helpless in her main role as Mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (now a "big star" thanks to the remake of "Halloween") and young Chloe Mortez is as good as girls.
