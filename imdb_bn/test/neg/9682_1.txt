The "ark of Noah" has established Hallmark's (and Turners) fame for nearly 100 years. However, the bright side of the product ... "How to Make a Movie" is a learning experience for film entrepreneurs <br /> <br /> where the bible literature and general knowledge can find these quotes and the situation: <br /> <br /> "OK, boys, let's saddle up." "It is very bad that God made the sun illuminate only on that day when we really needed it at night." "We're not kissing ... we're just junking in each other's mouth." <br /> <br /> To build the ark with the "Pacific of Georgia" it is stumped long.

There is no broadcasted version available in video stores (no pirates, etc.) ... In other words, that means DO Stores gives courage to save it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marvin No /> <br
