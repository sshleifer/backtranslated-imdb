This film should be first activated by their people as KSA movies and show good things on them. Otherwise, we see that the Rotana cast will show religion people as terrorists and fools in Saudi Arabia, they are not very peaceful and smart. The director is not even less good about me. In the film, grandfather is younger than father, everyone thinks And Saudi women who show our girls as a kid in search of people to meet their needs. Hasham was just another part of the furniture, when he told his lover that I love you and will scream his friend do not talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or true fools <br /> <br /> The father only He could not move it, and he saw this movie as Cast and as the word "A5zo al Shai6an". The strange thing about this movie is when the girls' family was set up in the restaurant, while the voice behind the young voice while talking to her girls "kiss me" many times >>>>> What happened in Saudi Arabia when girls and boys grow well and Muslem is not bitches and adulterous . No Saudi would allow his stupid movie to have heart patriots
