This is one of the worst movies I've seen without any questions. However, it is one of the most weird sunny eyes. I want to compare it to Plan 9, which can be so bad, so awful, so stupid, and time wasted that I saw myself laughing aloud. <br /> <br /> This is my biggest problem. It's the complete pickup of Robin Hood, and be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Rol Flin and Robin Hood: tights in men. But let's face it, from the forbidden love in the pack (it must be sliming, though it was fairly clear, but it was a wonderful compilation of McKingbard a few years ago) and the female character (who forgot so much, apparently I forgot his name. .), The final scene where good people beg for fooling fools, they shout "Robin Hood" all over the world. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think the pictures are viewable. On the contrary, I think it is one of the most fun movies seen in years, even if it was unknown.
