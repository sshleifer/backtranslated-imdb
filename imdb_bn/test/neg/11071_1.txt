I agree to watch this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme disagreement for scary movies. However, turning off this movie was not a giant shock, it was a terrible act and absolutely annoying ending. There are no freedom fighters inside, or cavane- it is made weakly, ridiculously scripted, included in a sickly blooded and unused final scene will revive me. No, it's not my dislike for horror movies that I hate this movie-I saw a great tinge as the "House of Max", it is true that this video leaves you with a terrible understanding that you rent the video, you support the manufacturers inside Is
