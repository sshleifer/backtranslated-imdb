Each year, the NU company creates a couple of "Action Packed", "Full of Suspense" movies. This little towel known as Shadowokster III (until I visited this site, I was not fully three-dimensional), it is a great example of the company's good work. Frank Zagarino is always as average and almost undefined (?), Schizophrenic (??) does a great job as Android. I will not waste any more words, because I do not want to publish horrible plot and you do not want to destroy two great smiles. <br /> <br /> Ratings 2/10 (Those who rearded for hard-working Tehniks. Man, putting such rubbish together should be nervewracking.)
