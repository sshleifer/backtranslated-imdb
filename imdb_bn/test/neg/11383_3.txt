I started off being interested in the movie a bit. It seems that it can be a fictitious drama, related to death, grief and cure, to some realistic human conflict. Alas, it did not hold up. <br /> <br /> I need a somewhat consistent movie. Trusted characters. Many of the characters in this movie are depicted as extremely vague and inconsistent. Look, I was not supposed to be this Shakespeare, but let's, I need some quality of scripts and charlotte. <br /> <br /> Actually, the writing was not so much. At one stage, James Brolin's character is surrounded to show a stylish, picnic. He said that his order would not work nearby. His new wife said that if he goes home and changes, then he will tear his clothes later. That's a crazy This movie was a bit weirdly funny line. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to take care of James Brolin's character. When he gives his first wife with his new wife so easily, even if his daughter-in-law makes him, then most of my sympathy is lost. Who really cares about what happens to her. I must admit that I did not finish the movie. If it's 180 in the last 45 minutes, I have to let you know. It was unexpected to see and so predicted I had no need to end it.
