It was a fast graduated sculle comedy and admired as the German film of the year, so I tried it, though I have already seen some films by Danny Levi - or at least part of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I hope: there is no comedy, unless you feel that heart attack is fun. It's a great example of a skoppy screen writing, loaded with people who can be true with a great plot and characters, but it's definitely not funny. <br /> <br /> The worst case scenario is Zakor's wife, Hannelor Elsner has played. He has incredible curiosity in moving the plot. For example: He does not know a single thing about Judaism, but the reasons perhaps that it is unknown to him is that he and his family are Jewish laws that follow the Jewish laws for his husband's family, who are real, and very meaningful and self-righteous. To make it even more complicated, he invited them to stay in their city flat because they came from Frankfurt in Berlin without booking their hotels in advance, a businessman who was 60 years old, would never have been a better German. This gives the audience something to swallow, but still fails to make a joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No one can see each other for forty years, but his daughter is now - lesbian - and son of Samuel - now a militant guard - once a boyfriend , And she's the daughter of her daughter. Samuel's girl - goes after a Nympho - Jacob's son. Is this the cruel tendency of the Jews to be somehow ridiculous parody? Perhaps it is an incredible way to add something "love boring to love" in a scrollable comedy. And certainly no joke fails to create. <br /> <br /> The praise of this movie is completely political. So people who enjoy watching movies that are considered "politically important" will enjoy it - even though "Alice aufe Junker!" Obviously there is no important importance. <br /> <br /> For everyone else: Do not see it without "fast forward". I really miss it.
