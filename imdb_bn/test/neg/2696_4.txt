This is one of the marvelous martial arts movies that started with two potential gang members facing the park; And when the contract goes wrong and the war starts, they all know Karate and Kung Fu! This timeless (usual) Anthropomorphic, DeadPen, Good Police, in the Stone of Sinteria Rothrak in Los Angeles. He and his police partner are attempting to break a fraud ring, and when the plot line becomes tired, the story changes to something else and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of the wealthy, great looks. The film definitely has some swimming pool pool scenes with Bimbos in Thong Bikinis, and an amazingly good horse cakes, in some rocky action, some speedboat action, some speedboat action, some carriage, a rebellion where the Antitia hit each other in the country-West Bar, About half a dozen policemen were shot dead. Plots do not happen in any twists that just do not have any ideas; Do not worry about them. (And fraud money is a federal offense, so where is the FBI? I guess they were very busy.) The dancer of the war dancer, Cynthia Rothrak's co-star Richard Taylor, his enthusiastic and diverse appearances in front of the camera undoubtedly made this a good movie. When she appeared together, Cynthia was convinced to make a good actress, and undoubtedly she could use it; He feels tired and bored, and is playing the best in the Guardian Angel when he is playing against a dog dog, whom he provided to drunk drunk nominees. The dog almost does his job! In any film, any leading lady is wearing the most dangerous dress in a dress: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-blown areas on every hip was the most frustrating. Other actors are all on the map. You can cast a few more pictures of this short character: "Hey, me and some other guys I know will be in a movie. Do you want to stay in it? No, my friend, I'm serious!" Then the slumbering professionals are: The most interesting is playing the diverse variety of players, such as Ledi Danisha, the classic French model and "Red Shoe Diary", "Bewach," "Melrose Place", and sexy French bomb; Here he plays as a Sysopathic killer, as he was in BAISEZ-MOI or an "Alyas" episode, and it is not a direct die-to-cable trash like this. The tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicruck is now also the regular of "The Bold and the Beautiful", John O'Leary, who has played an honorable elderly in several movies and season movies, and has done it again here and in Harrahon Aipple, probably Arab star character actor Probably known as "Pharaoh Seiten" from Mummy and Mummy Return For these professionals, Guardian ANGEL will be the most ridiculous entry of their resume. I could probably get a better rating than this film because perhaps my girls, those enthusiastic martial arts students, kicked both donkeys and liked seeing a big step view for change. They are very young at the very least to take care of the low-quality image, and it makes Synthia happy as the Soviet-leased, high-stick, stick-fighting thing. If you like this type of flick, you probably can enjoy that level.
