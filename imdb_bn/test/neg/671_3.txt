I am surprised that many comments about this movie are positive. The book has been read many times (and all the other historical novels of Mickael Walter), there is no way to say much better in this movie. If I forget the source of the story I would consider it a good epic. Of course, the bricks on the big screen should not work to bring a brick, but it can be done with the class. I do not understand why the name of Nefarferfer should be shortened only in Nefer. I used to make Peter Ustinov as a captive and Marlon Brando, but I love to judge Hollywood's overall attitude. It looks like Mika Walteri has shown in the middle of the movie in the middle. That's how much she likes it.
