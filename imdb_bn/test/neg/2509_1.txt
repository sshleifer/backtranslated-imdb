I can not believe I'm sitting by this stupid waste. I was very impressed with how unjustified I was, which I could not move. It reminds me of the feeling you could not take your eyes away from an awesome car crash or a cow rolling bodies. You can not help but, but you are sick and bothered later. Please describe me in detail: "Plan 9 Outside", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. They both are terrible to see, but both of them have some attributes, and at least they give you the strength to reach "close" -button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (only to be named) scientist Fi classic saved me crying, why trying to work hard on why the scripts were shot, why someone would soil the original classic memory, and I I wish I could restart my normal life or suddenly peace and death wishing for peace <br /> <br /> <br /> If I die, I have realized that this tied V Ikara not take no rest from memory, probably because the poor soul is forced to go to hell for eternity over again ...
