Lots of fire, thousands of extra, beautiful sets of battle scenes are many. I do not think the plot supported such a huge cost. This story can be said more effectively and if it is not so much in the field of production, it is more psychologically valid. Chinese experience in my movies, tend to be this way. And I think this film detracts from.
