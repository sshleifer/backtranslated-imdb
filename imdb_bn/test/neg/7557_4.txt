A young sculpture of his first decade of the decade, Harrison was seriously injured in road accidents. The story ends. <br /> <br /> "The end of the story", that is, "end of a physical action" in the sense. In the sense of "film end" is not. Ken's life has been saved, but he is paralyzed from the throat. When he discovered that he was unlikely to recover the use of his or her organs, he decided that he wanted to die and advised doctors to end their treatment. The rest of the picture is a right to happiness and a long debate about the wrong and right to die. <br /> <br /> The main head of this debate is Canton, his physician, Michael Emerson. Though a case against religiousness is often presented in religious terms, it is presented here completely secular ones. If you Emerson has a strong religious conviction but these films are not published. He emotionally believes that death is an enemy, against which he is the duty of the doctor to fight against To make a patient take his own life, surrender to the enemy and the inconsistency of that responsibility will be presented. Cain finds himself a "catch-22" situation. He must be very intelligent and reasonable enough to decide to end his life. Emerson, however, thinks that the desire to die is evidence of insanity and irrationality itself. Cain's hesitation can be solved by appointing only one lawyer for a hospital case. <br /> <br /> as chem and John Cassettes. Richard Dreyfas as Emerson has skillfully and sincerely shared their own views, but can not conceal it, "Whose life is it anyway?" Just does not work as a film. At one stage, the illustrated versions of the drama were completed in the same way as theatrical productions, but due to differences between these two media between the seventeenth and the eighties of the decade, there is often dissatisfaction. When the plays are painted, the general tendency is to achieve independence with the writings of the plays and "to open them" through filming on studio sets, often introducing significant changes to the plot and even extra characters. <<br /> I have never seen Brian Clarke play, but I think it's a story that works well in the theater than the movie. There is very little physical action; Most of the action is done in a hospital with a long discussion around a bed in which the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot does not lend itself to the "open up" device, and as a result the film is very stable, affected by the cost of action. Although it has good writing and some good acting, I am surprised that a movie was ever made with such uncertain things. 4/10
