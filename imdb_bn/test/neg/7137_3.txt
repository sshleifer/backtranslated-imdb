Hollywood film industry is one of the most Lazier in the whole world. This same repeat again requires a single hit to flood the theater with the same basement. Take a superhero for example, for each X-Man and Spider-Man, there is Deradeville, Alcatra, Ghost Rider and H. Japanese awful remakes even worse. It only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly due to Mr. Gore Verbinski), to bring horrible women-based horror to a spectacular example. Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but in vain), and miserliness. <br /> <br /> The first blame was not completely bad. It was mostly awesome, which one might expect from it. Plus, the plot of some brain matches the plot. Teen 2 is just like before; It may be a good thing, but O, what is the second male male to black? Was it a great thing for the whole screen joxox and only changed the villain? For the sake of worry, critics go the same way. <br /> <br /> Tired of fear, bad acting (except Amber Tamblin), and all over the place. Three places are performed at different places and at the time. Aubari (Tamblin) is investigating that his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller) died; Alison (Ariel Cabbell) who was adopted by colleagues in the event of the incident filmed in the first film; And finally, an American family witnessed that strange thing happening on the adjacent apartment. Not saying (and I want to mean it) everything tied up to the end, but a good picture does not have to depend on the end of creation, when everything else is simply exhausting and lazy. <br /> <br /> The cold is everywhere, the only girl in the locker, nobody can enter the house, others dig deep. Meanwhile, ghosts are killed and killed and murdered, which seems more deadlier than the ten world war or Ebola epidemic. Hey, is it not like another bad Japanese Ramadan, is it called Pulse? Yes, day by day being easy to put a blame against Hollywood bullshits.
