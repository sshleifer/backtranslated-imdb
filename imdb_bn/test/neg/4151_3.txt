My wife and I never went to the movies. We thought it was for sloooowwww and many subtitles. I realized that they needed Vietnam, but it took a long time to get out of Asia. She wanted it off I said I was going to get it. Well It never happened. There was a hard time for trying to go to America, but I wanted to see him and wanted to see his father. Not to last, but to create a relationship. I did mention that it was sllllooowwww.I could not feel sad until the end of the movie. I know they do not make much better movies anymore. I think action movies are only for viewing. I've been renting a lot more from Netflix and now Blockbuster, 20% valuable. I am the reality or the fact that only a movie is fun and you do not feel well. Gary
