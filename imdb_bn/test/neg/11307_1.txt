Awesome horror movie, I still can not believe my friend is saying this to me! No plot, bad acting, unfunny scene, and very very stupid dialogue. I just want to say that I saw the worst movie in this movie and it is worse than Halloween 3 that I also gave 0 stars. So I gave it 0 into 0 stars and 10, well here 1, but you get points.
