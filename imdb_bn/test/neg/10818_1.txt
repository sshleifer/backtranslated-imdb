This is probably not right for me to comment on this movie, because, for the first time, I stopped a movie because it was very bad. I can see something, but this movie was so annoying. Before I installed the DVD, I was bored and thought it could be a comedy action / action movie to mood up. Even it is not that it is an instrument that increases the level of frustration with the power of 100. After 45 minutes it had to be stopped because what happened at the time was that some people have discovered scuba diving and a great drilling. Seriously, this film is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy bad movies like me, but you can avoid this movie like a plug. I've seen most of the year.
