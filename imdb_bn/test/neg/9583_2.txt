First looks like a nice silly choice - "monthly employee" can be bellied with the name "office space" and the bell "office clerk". I do not think so. It's not even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, the man's name, was a complete quarrel, and has a sick, distorted mind. There is no joy to feel sad about the whole person who is cheating his wife, steals from his top job and gets his / her teeth 24/7. The second time when my family was watching this, I was roaming around the house (and believing that they only saw it because they were praying that at least some relief, perhaps some pleasure would be sent even a warm message to be good justice done and good guys look good ). Many good people were murdered so long ago that they did not have time to look good. No memories were created. <br /> <br /> This photo has an unlimited sense of humor. It disgraces the old, the dead and the woman- and the director tries to like it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie both because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not memorable. If you are lucky enough to see it in the theater, my friends defin definy-at home do this.
