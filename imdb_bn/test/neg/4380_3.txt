This is simply another bad chalk Norris movie. Norris women play a police on a curved serial killer's carts. He had thrown the man three years ago, but the man looked like a tooth that was going to the nuts room repeatedly. The killer then escapes to a clean van and takes 400 feet to the foot and survives to spend time near a theater through renewal. Irish Jack Ohloran is the best thing in this movie, but Superman 2 likes it, he does not say a word. Since that is supposed to make him more menacing. Super Fly fame and Steve James Ron O'Neal are destined to play the city mayor and Norris' Sidekick respectively. In this movie, Norris and her girlfriend also have a wicked concubine, which keeps the child out of marriage; It's so 1980's. When Norris's "serious" performances signal the high quality musical signal every ensuing scene of the expected fashion, the film becomes a joke to sit. The build-up was attractive enough to find murderers in the theater, which crawled with a shadow to find the shadow with Narsi, but the frustrating after the last war started in such a promising way. This is another disappointment from Canon, and it's just like a movie made for television. * 4 stars.
