This movie produces a real low budget, but I will not say anything about it that has already been covered. I give this film a low rating for the story only, but I've met the movie that I saw at night and gave me an extra reason to dislike the movie. He asked me what I enjoyed and I told him that it was not easy to choose. My main objection was the lack of relationship between the two main characters, I never believed that they were close. I told him that the scenes where the main characters were presented where the boys are becoming friends, the film is too late. <br /> <br /> She told me that the Flashback view was not in the original script. They have been added because he felt that I did not see the two main characters closely. He explained that these scenes were not drawn from their satisfaction because they were out of money. I agree that they did not do much for this movie. <br /> <br /> Another truth about this movie, which I was not aware of is an actor who wrote the script based on his own personal experience. It is usually a bad move because some writers will not consider the audience's emotional response. This story is so close that the author has accepted many ideas as an audience response to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, this did not work for me, because I never care for a letter, at all the lead. Two evil people were presented in a way that could harm a naughty person. When Mrs. Young's decision to leave her in a bad way, it seems that she is ineffective because she is ineffective because she does not know she is wrong. If the movie contains a message, I suspect that only the authors are aware of it.
