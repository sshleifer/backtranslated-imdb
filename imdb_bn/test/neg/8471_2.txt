I saw this cooking show for several times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question ... if you can not cook plain together in 30 minutes, you have everything you need, it has already been played, sometimes pre-cut and you have only a few remaining except a few green nuts. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of them chef do all their work (without Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yes ... they also have a whole meal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Add the word "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tags. <br /> <br /> It's obvious to you ... a tall, respectful woman who truly is her best listener. He smiled in his own lam comment, because the camera used to mugs many times because he wanted to remind us that he thinks as well. <br /> <br /> She is not "the most beautiful thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who does not have DE-LISH.
