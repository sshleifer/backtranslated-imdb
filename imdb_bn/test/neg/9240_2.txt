I just saw this yesterday and wanted to comment on other people but got some high marks. <br /> <br /> what ??? This is probably the worst Asian horror movie I saw. There was so much basic problems with the story <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Many Asian people are trying to help the awful soul but it seems scary (notable exceptions: pig and junk-on). They are not terrible here, but it is here. A little Asian woman looks a little pale, not all scary. The character of "monk" directly describes everything as a whole natural cycle of life; There is nothing scary about But the woman does not get it, she will kill herself and her child, then this poor ghost is reborn. My friend and I started to laugh when he stopped building twice and the ghost began to wait a second time why he was following him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, firstly that he has an extra abundant hair that rides a taxi with a ghost (taxi ride on ghosts?) which is unreasonably vague Just after the bus stop, you should see that it is very nice. <br /> <br /> All these movies have total bombs, I give it an extra point for the above two scenes. . This is a poor quality Asian horror fetus that enables you to fly into pregnant women while trying to frighten with similar images.
