I feel very much from the readers of the book that it will be a true adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. Do not read the book, I do not know whether this adaptation was faithful but I know it was not good. Indeed, the pornplex was the best part of the movie to impress Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I plan to take the Carolina Moon forward due to Kerry's foresight. I'm not sure if she is a good actress. He has some movies, average between others and this one has been really decent in the worst. However, the Fortalani was not alone. Performance was everywhere. Oliver Hodson was wood and boring. Josie Davies was Hammy. Then, all these B-rated performances, Jackin Biset is there! He could not do anything other than fornication, but during his sleep he was miles away from others. <br /> <br /> Still, one of the most exciting women and I have been a part of the folklore films. That power was not disappointing here. I believe that Forlani may be more than eye-candy, as long as she becomes a good performer of good film, she can make it even better. And, I'll look at the part that I participate in it faithfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie though the moon was very bad in the movie. In addition to bad acting (fake south accent is really confusing) the direction was pedestrian. It was not terrible. It was only TV's ability to create annoying things that you used to see lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of stars, you probably can enjoy the Carolina Moon. I did If you are a fan of the book, you can enjoy enjoying the story of the screen, though in a weak form. Otherwise, this movie is not markable.
