The idea of ​​this film was a tragedy with America's second World War generation as well as its apple pie silence and hypocritical morality. Those terrible hippies apparently destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice performance with a lot of performance - especially Lemon which is really awesome. Otherwise we have an annoying tile-life drama (more than 24 hours of Jack's life). <br /> <br /> I saw it.
