This movie is really amazing, for years I have achieved a taste for Japanese giant movies and I am well aware that the primary example of this section can be poor. But it has reached a new low, because it seems to be an endless supply of horror giant monsters to war against his war against Johnny Soko (?), A small boy controlling a giant robot and his evil Gargoyle gang. Their disposal.
