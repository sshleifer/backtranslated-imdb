How can you call a family film in this promotion? This is nothing but a PC, a disgraceful insult to the churches in the small town. This film portrays a woman as a great white protector of a small Middle East city, and everyone else in the city (mostly men) is the only daughter, incompetent, who can not bind herself and depend on her main character for release. This movie is just a matter of love, which gives some uneducated, arrogant, and slightly shoveling footage to the producer, who expects the audience to appreciate. <br /> <br /> The person who made this film was probably the garbage dump in his majority as the investigator-sensitive church, and looting rubbish on the members of the small church. The same person who pays for the Christmas Salvation Army, collects donations for missionaries, poor and homeless, singing, co-ships and forging friendships with each other. What is wrong with this cruel group that these self-righteous traitors object? Most Christians in this world will stand in front of the train and will be able to give their life to a person, even if they do not agree with them. Most Christians did not think that if a church church or some churchman accepted his coat (or outer shirt). They will not condemn him. This picture is ridiculous!
