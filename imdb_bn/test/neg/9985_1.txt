I found the movie at my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I have heard about explicit sexual scenes, horrific violence, and infamous revolt. I sat down and started to laugh! Set pulp and industrial direction was cheap and mesh; Nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; The story was badly written and it was the only parade of incredibly beautiful and gifted actors who hosted to quote the worst conversation ever written! Cruel relationships can not be taken seriously in Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his stupid beautiful sister Drusilla (The Terrace Anne Soci√©, a weak beauty) ... it is not even frustrating or distorted! During the first thirty minutes of the film, Peter O'Toole and John Gilgood were held hostage while making the film. Cinematography was a joke and when I used to use biblical quotes I was even more delighted! Mark less books. If you are looking for shock values, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking to value the religion of the camp, you will be more frustrated. I know I was. I have seen the disappointment and it will never come back to you two hours of life.
