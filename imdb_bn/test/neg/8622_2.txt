Most American remixes in European movies are quite poor, but they are in their own league. Actually it might even be the worst (Sandra Bulk) movie. I'm scared that I could not see Spololos as Dutch, like another silly bad thriller. Here the substitute substitute is quite stupid (and especially executed with disqualification), but a far worse offense eliminates all the intelligence and depth of character that marks the origin as a classic. The real horror is that the same person sponsored by SPOORLOOS is responsible for this torture. Will the real George Sluizer stand up?
