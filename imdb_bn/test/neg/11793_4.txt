I understand why people hate this image. And, I hate the Blair Witch project, so go figure? This is similar to Stage and it's an insult to your mind as it is objectionable. I really like the story of Madame Lallauri though it is probably more than being made. However, I do not fabricate this film as the main reason, when the ghosts do not attack them and start abducting, I become cold every time and I have to pursue my mind to remember something. I know it's my imagination but the horrors of today's cinemas and DVDs that do not give more than half of the drill makes it a great pleasure. Not for everyone, suspects will hate it and there's no gore for PG-13 ratings for GigHound. And, women are very annoying! You will desire that demons will stop them and all of them will be tested before they are tested. ** Out of *****
