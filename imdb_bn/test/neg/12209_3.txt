I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not claim to enjoy this movie. This was probably the second worst movie I saw. One problem I see is that the range of novels is requested for a few hours instead of a regular movie. It is impossible to capture an important quantity held in the story in two hours. I do not enjoy the brooding flashback layout. It was uncomfortable for anyone that was upset and did not fully know the story of perception. Also, I do not think filmmakers have correctly explained the personality of Copperfield. The idea of ​​roaming around the beach on his life is thought to be incompatible with the active, reactionary nature of the conflict. Agnes also bothered me. She came across as a decoration of a ditsy family rather than a powerful woman. Dora was perfect. This movie was involved with the issues, and I'm waiting for someone to be interested in creating a decent screen version.
