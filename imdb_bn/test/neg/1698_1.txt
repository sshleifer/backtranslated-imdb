The most annoying thing about "DIS Destost" (August Day) is not the only thing in this film, but director Mc Recha strongly condemns the nerve to give a little respect to Catalan journalist Ramon Barnals. There is a number of times "respect" is formed until the name of Barnell is mentioned, this phenomenon is a complete forgery. You will not learn about Barnell in this movie or learn about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) or about the special role of the Catalan in the war. You can not even learn about the punitive punishment of the heroic Catalan people by the forced and fraudulent franco many years later. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> A clear indication of the lack of concepts: During their camping trip, Brother Mark and David's aimless drift are compulsory films. In contrast, its most powerful impression is that one of the movies created and made by Mediator Hippie. Do not waste your time. Instead, read a good book about the Spanish Civil War. (I strongly condemned Stalinist "Revolution of Felix Morro and Spain Revolution-Revolution ", of which 1937 has a secret account of the revolt of Barcelona.) <br /> <br /> Freedom person
