Personally I saw Lee Thompson's appearance and I really did not expect to enjoy such a movie, but it is not surprising that I'm finally watching this. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - it's just a story like Saga and not particularly original or entertaining, but weird it just keeps you on TV. My opinion about my own will will be much better if I do not get a point that I can not get. <br /> <br /> Here is a beautiful and truly touchy scene where the character of Lee Thompson is going on. The street child is on the street, snow falls, she is cold, scared, and does not have a place to live, she does not know what to do next. And then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she leaves the same child without any warning, to which she was dreaming she took care of her career. I do not see it - I do not see how she would do such work, she had the opposite step in her life, when she was doing what she was doing aimed at surviving the child. After this character flips I just could not enjoy the rest of the movie.
