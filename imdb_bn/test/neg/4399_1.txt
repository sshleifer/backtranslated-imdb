National Lampon's Dormy Dais is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the movie Kazam. Anyone who thinks of this film is well by any means, shape, or size, there is no idea of ​​a good movie and they will never see another movie because it is a fool. <br /> <br /> It's hard to make all the wrong names with this movie. First off, plots can not follow all the places and all the many "misunderstandings" very well. The acting is mean to say horror, and the whole thing is made badly. Anyone working in this movie and who can sometimes have no children in any other movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to add to just one paragraph or two, because it is very bad, but please do not see this movie for anyone reading this !! If you want to watch a good movie then turn on anything else on television. There are even better movies than the US. <br /> <br /> _friend
