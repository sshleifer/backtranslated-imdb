I hope (or even anticipate) the well known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow, extreme zoom and all covered fish eyes. In short: a) Searching for interesting visual events and b) People can not be attracted to the point of view as human beings are not able to see them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This third part is not wrapped and wrapped. It's okay, especially the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and I saw nothing left. Then half of the film is converted into solar or colorful or posterized or any other filter. It has seen many things like the effects of your video cameras, but you never use it. The pictures were beautiful like giraffe and zebra cheeses without many filters. You can say that 'technology or whatever the harmful sources of human beings transform our beautiful nature', but why does this use seventeen effects as symbols? I was ready to leave for more than 10 minutes in the row of this cheap showing effect. I hope the rest may not be bad for me. But then it was slow: good slow speed because it gives you time to analyze moving pictures. But if it does not exceed 24 or 60 seconds in 50 seconds, there is not enough speed at slow speed. Please record fast speeds, such as foaming and splashing water (some) ridiculous people and drill songs are done with beautiful shots of singer soldiers. I acknowledge that the pictures of the archives can not be reproduced, but I have already seen that footage in many cases, besides this it can also be done. It has been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and it can not be easy to apply effects as well as make arrangements. On top of that, many of the work is mixed with each other. It shows that the creator could not raise the movie or abandon it. But I do not like the mixed elements a little ... the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even tricky, but the implementation was inadequate. Computer generated images did not disturb me much, but out of date. 'Bit' streaming with circuits (in the first part of the film) looked more and more beautiful. Mandelbrot was always fun, fractal mountain low. I crafted a solo playing a major role in music. At a certain time the composite was suitable for glass music, but it is a matter of taste. Of course, as above all,. I hope another story will be announced soon, where computer imagery will have less important role and it will also inspire someone to enter the field. <br /> <br />
