Jordanian Host and its driver American boss Ed Hoffman (Crow). <br /> <br /> Anyone who saw the trailer can be forgiven for thinking about the double-agent action and betraying the Ferris of Hoffman, but the real story is far more human. Instead we move with virtual contrived with a worrisome look on his lap through the teeming streets of the white American son Amman Jordan or with the attention of locals as the ridiculous subterfuge is serving a tepid broth. Only the time of the scene in which Feris took tea for his newly found Iranian sweetheart, the reality has become frustrating, because a bomb explodes with a pair of Jordanian men in the light. <br /> <br /> The film's problems are revised Plot twists and turns that seem to be designed. As nothing more than padding Ferris flew from Jordan, Ferris was expelled from Jordan, Ferrea moved to Washington, Ferris went to the UK, Ferrans returned to Jordan, Hoffman flew to Jordan, Hoffman returned home to take care of his children?
