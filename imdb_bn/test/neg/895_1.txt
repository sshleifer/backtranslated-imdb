I know it sounds crazy but yes, I'm a huge fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of !!). I hate part 3, and then here comes the part 4. I was like you're having fun with this? Kid 'n play is not available in this movie, and all right, if they do not get the foolishness of Movie House Party 4, as it relates to their predecessors, shape, form or fashion. Every time this movie comes in late night in the US, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Quite obviously, it's really that nasty. * Harling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n' Play, actually admitted to being a fan (t he hey), I was scared. Remember the stupid small boy faults in the group? They threw their way into the House Party 3. OK, good and good, but part 4, how about them and nothing else, and they seem to be not like the same kids from the part. * Confused !!!! * House party fans: A bias of yourself and house party 1 and 2 and class act stick. Without that, all the other ridiculous.
