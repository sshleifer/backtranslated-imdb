This movie takes many freedoms with known historical events. Little things like Flints kill one stamp after another, when he used to use a moist sponge, it was one of the boring things. Flin was not genocide or attempted murder. He is not known to have caught his mother's love for another man, and was known to have no homosexual relationship with her and she did not end up in the sky row in Sydney. Infected in the wake of the bait did not play more than half of the role, and this role did not make him an industrious film star. <br /> <br /> This is simply a middle-movie where Aurel Flin's name was used to sell more tickets and more videos.
