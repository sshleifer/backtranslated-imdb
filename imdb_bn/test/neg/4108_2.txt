The acting was terrible, the cheesy, fake, CHEAP green screen effect was ridiculous, and the creature was completely upset. The only good idea about this movie was, and I got a smile on such bad films - I was very angry because I realized that I lost 4 rupees for the rent. Why is such a movie ever in the theater? I know this movie came about five years ago, but did anyone make any effort to make films? I'm just writing random things to fill the space - because I need ten text lines to publish this review. This next line should just be about it. Anandeddad there!
