In this movie, we invite the descendant to show a moral and emotional trap of a person who is not interested in starting. Then what was the point of making the film? To show that the shoot was not good at blaude - a book that I feel, eventually - keeping our hero's integrity intact? Hardly In the same way he plays in the party at the beginning of the film, similarly he behaves after reading the winner of the book, so his degree of degeneration is the subject. We care enough about Capet, does he claim that he and the killer Perry Smith are spirits? I was not touched by Mr. Kapot's plight, I was afraid, so if the central concept is destroyed by me. But why could film makers visit our uninterrupted project, I could have guessed, even though this incisive story still bothers me as well, I too would get annoyed. If Hoffman could not have any emotional impact, Career and Cooper were so warm and interesting that I was more interested in them. Believe beyondreary
