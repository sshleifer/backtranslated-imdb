Once a great time I would see a movie that completely surprised me. As it does not come anywhere, luxurious entertainment Pure fun from one start to the beginning. Well folks, when a stranger calls that movie that does not. This is an incredible fool and much better 1979 awesome camp classic remake remake. Our lead heroine Jail forced her to force her after moving her cellphone minutes and harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious collar. Every clich√© in the world can be anywhere any time from stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-spot spot spot spot spot spider. This movie is bad ... a "so bad it's the best way" even worse "even annoying way." Leave this godly film and save your movie for something else. Thank you after me, believe me on this. Grade: D-
