No wonder there is a shortage of youth's attention. It seems that stage (dance) production at this moment is about how many cameras and cameras can shrink a director / editor in nearly 1 hour of show. Is there a special Emmy category for this achievement? Sometimes try to count them to do something different with them, otherwise, completely unwanted shows. <br /> <br /> I tried to find at least some faces of other dancers in production. It was impossible. They did not face any face, just unclear - it's just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's Bayern Boost (excellent Shane!), Michael Flatlie's feet and Patent Flatley Over the Knee-A-Pine-Anti Bar Bar Infinity Table. Since he assumed this cut and paste work was an executive producer I had expected. One does not have to wonder as much as those who are the target audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> Reversion was a great production, because the program tried to present itself as it could be seen from viewers, not a catwalk, side wings or floor nail perspective. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Sir Michael retired. Thank God for the small blessing.
