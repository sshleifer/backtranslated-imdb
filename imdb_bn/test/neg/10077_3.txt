(A potentially lesser spoiler) was the first "Jurassic Park" an effective, but stupid film that worked and it was actually quite good. There were a few decent moments for "The Lost World" by Sequel, but the last part of the lamps was destroyed, where a T-Rex was playing in San Diego. Now the "Jurassic Park III", which is the first and only a short story window out of the squeal and has been replaced with only 90 minutes of non-stop action, which does not work in the film <br /> <br /> <br /> Sam Blue dr. Returning to Grant, who offered him a couple (William H. Messi and T. Leoni) so they could come to an island to find them. The boy has been missing for two months. But of course this island can be populated by dinosaurs, and the aircraft can then crash them after trapping them with a bunch of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This is probably a romantic ride, with no real story, but at that stage even the movie is not delivering. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji"), in some way, did little magic in "Jurassic" films, and was able to straighten the life away from him. <br /> <br /> Although the dinas looks just right now they are not just fair and very scary. The following line is an exciting movie as it is not a very good movie. * 4 stars out.
