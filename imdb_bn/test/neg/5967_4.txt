I saw the original Italian cinema. It must be said that the acting and interpretation of the TV-generated trend is the most severely polluted, it is suddenly talking to the frivolous voices, not liping, pulling tones, which originate in "real life" and "keep on walking" - my audience -Translide "-Screen-dramatization.Door Massimo Giro has towers on other characters for greater intensity, expression, and clarity of intellectual integrity. There is a good indication, however, (in any other comment before me) it lacks a focal point and dropboard which gives many low and low relevance, another trend is dragged into TV production, it is well-known to the Italians. Some drop in style is available to the public Can be abandoned, such as Patissy Drag (culinary skin and aesthetic beauty, sweet) See the sweet hive, chocolate, babbit lunch, vetel etc.) Hmmm and the fairies are definitely truthful. Ozzatet learned the tunes of Italy in the early 2000s and is also facing threat ... though I will give him the last chance ...
