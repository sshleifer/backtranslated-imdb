It starts with some hateful sex-comedy gags, but soon it reveals its true colors: it wants to be a "Death Wish" clone. I say, "wants" because the script can smile so fast that the minute is over, as it ends, it seems "turmoil"! Filled with a room full of candle from a room, "heroes" who wear clothes as commandos and their machine guns because they do not want to draw attention to themselves !! Many days after a black van has been recognized as their vehicle, this film contains many ridiculous topics to fit into a list. Another major problem is that you can not say most of the characters; Of course, you know that bourgeois and rotundry and even James Van Pattin, but other scenes have played different actors of different scenes and you do not know the difference.
