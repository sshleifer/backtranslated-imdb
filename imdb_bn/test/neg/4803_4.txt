Although it is one of the two movies of Odu Volume 1, there is no miracle or miracle in it! The box labeled "HellHole" but the screen title escapes from Hell. This title is critically similar to Hell Hole (1978) lawyer "fleeing from Women's Hall Hole". A group of women bath in a river and perhaps the worst thing they want to recognize is that they are easily defeated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She invites Indri and her uncle MG. Once they went there, it became clear that MG Indri wants to take virginity. M.G. She runs a house of prostitution, and she is in charge of the corrupt branch of the military, or operates a semi-military force, or likes to wear all military-style uniforms for her guardians. <br /> <br /> Woman who denies her or otherwise suffers in jail is in jail. Indra sends there. Women are tortured and sometimes raped by guards. Various failed attempts have been made to escape or rescue women, but inevitably failed with the obvious benefits of women: they mostly cross the guard force and relatively few protectors have automatic weapons - mostly semi-automatic rifles or handguns. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />
