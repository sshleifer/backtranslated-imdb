In 1904, a wealthy American woman and her two children were kidnapped by the killer desert pirates who killed the Moroccan government and kidnapped such "American epidemic" by the attention of American President Theodore Roosevelt. The fabulous historical epic is less than a great courage compared to the 1940s Desert-Shik films with an extraordinary, somewhat perfect touch (little by little "The King and I" interrupted). Cloaked, MacAisaud, a bloody leader and his snippets, proud captains, Shan Connery and Candie's Barzan, can portray in two completely different films (how far does a person think of their character and the camp-components of dialogue can not bear, and both are without proper direction Seems single). Various (and anonymously) slashing and titles are deliberately: We do not know any of these predators, and the big action scene becomes moodled by the violence of sand on horses. Plus: Jerry Goldsmith's extraordinary music score (Oscar nominated, but lost to "John" by John Williams), great location shooting and film screenplay. * **** to 1/2
