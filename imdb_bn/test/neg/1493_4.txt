I was very frustrated with this series. It had lots of graphics and it's about it. The amount of detailed information found in it was short, and I was always feeling the patronage of the audience - I felt a lot to me - "It is very cool but we are not going to explain it in more detail because you will not find it any way. Show some beautiful pictures. "Without any effort to explain what the host was like," Spartyl "And" Super-samamyatri "leave the attractive terms. We wanted to see it in Wikipedia. Besides, I know a little bit about the superstar (for a common man) and I could have been better with his explanations gradually and gradually. They could choose many good examples to explain the concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject. In addition, I became so sick of repetition. They could easily shrink the series into one episode if they were all repetitive. They will show the Quantum Cafe clip about 8 times. The hosts keep saying over over the same thing again. He can not remember how many times he said "the universe is made from small shaking strings." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is considered an educational program about quantum physics, whether or not the United States is better than Europe or vice versa! I felt that it was part of patronage - "There will be some conflicts for the audience to be interested." Please Give me a little more credit than me. <br /> <br /> Overall, 2 thumbs down :-(
