After farther away from the city of God, the town of Menon was very disappointed. Strong predictability of lost sensational and unpredictable tales, and rather, in its place, the audience's manipulation of explicit efforts by the production and distribution group of a sponsor. This story has ended a feeling of a hungry soap opera rather than a great indie feature, which is what it should look like. This is when distributors try to look for a secret story and character and look for larger audiences (ridiculous shot shots of Rio de Janeiro etc.). I could not really care what happened to any characters in this film - they were all so diminished in 2 dimensions. In short, following possible potential city of God should have been a slam-dank of possible tragedy waste. Yeah!
