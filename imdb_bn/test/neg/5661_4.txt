The first time I saw this show it was just right. There were some fun moments and I have been a few times sunny but this show is being bad and bad. Carly and Sam's web shows are not fun at least bits. They make a stupid video from the internet, scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. And then the smile goes off the track?! There is a problem with the show that main characters are no fun. Carly is not funny The performance of Miranda Cosgrove is the best. This show is nothing like acting from his acting Tarek and Josh. His friend Sam is very unreasonable and weird and the show is written in a way that makes him look like a mountain. I mean that he jokes about his mother running a drunk old truck, hijacking an old TV with his mother's bat, and then joking about failing at school, always detaining and fleeing from the police. Anyone is funny Then Freddy has a computer geek. She is not too funny until her mother treated her like a baby. The only fun full time character of the show is Carrie's brother Spencer. He made some funny jokes and made some fantastic fun by pretending to be a space ship during the spaceship crystalline, as they did the same thing to retaliate against the cookie table for girls scouts. The only thing that's ridiculous in its element is the thing. As well as other things in the characters make the show very bad. Some children doing a local web show from the Seattle apartment have been injured worldwide and traveled to Tokyo free of charge? Another thing is that a 26-year-old single person can pay for a 2-level apartment in City City without any practical work and can increase its 13-year-old sister and provide full room with camera and sound equipment with a remote controlled projector. A green screen and an HD camera? It sounds like a 10 year old wrote. The worst thing to do is show some pretty suspicious content. Curley (13-year-old girl remembers) is seen on her internet web show in some of her bikini times. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddie Curley and Sam said that he had "fixed his socks before the night." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode where Kelly's rival Nevill receives the rights to her website and blackmails her and gives her consent to return her website in exchange for a kiss. Creepy! And I saw an episode where Kelly saw a boy who had gone to her apartment building and she was hurt a bit back and she closed her shirt and Kelly stood over her. I can not believe Nicake even if they stop stuff like that and I can not believe it was made of the same person who is responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under 12 years of age and it is even suspicious. iCarly Horrible Nick Programming Long List Only Another Extra
