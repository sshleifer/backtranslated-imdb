OK, so my summary line is a cheap strategy. But the movie has got filled up and it has been unreasonably appreciated, so ... <br /> <br /> I grabbed it on TV (void, since the TV shows all the movies here, so Americans can tell me what I did I do not like it because I saw a cut TV version - luckily it was just a US thing), and there was no idea about what it was. I switched, caught a last minute show, and started the movie. In a minute, I was begging that it was a comedy, especially at the beginning of the ridiculous Claydeath (yes, it's a bad movie-movie, I know, but what is the way to try to keep the audience interested! I know why not even the channel switch). And, yes, actually the movie has become a comedy, though it is a stranger. <br /> <br /> Marina Judina is beautiful enough, but Lord, what horrible performance! The role is smart enough while throwing a foreigner (he does not talk about the barrier by the way), yet, sorry, Marina baby, playing silent means that Harpow Marx is not a mask. Her acting is strange, funny at times, just looking at her when she painted an X in the air when stalked by the killer. He wants to kill you, do not have time to play hard. In most cases we are getting temporary things for "the most moving" stan, such as the worst slash, and things like carpets and bad guys make the shot. Esse! Will you ever learn Hollywood? Yet the best / bad pearl is electrocuted to a bathtub in a bathtub and ... well, I have not seen anyone dead in the bathroom death, but I'm not sure that you can see blue cartoon rails in real life. And how to trust a looking guy immediately because he said he is a policeman, and is not telling him to show his credentials? OK, so he turns out to be a real police. But still the badge can not be asked (Plot-based, we can always believe that certificates can be stupid or they may be an infamous police.) Screen Writing 101). And how about the big packing? Do not tell me that it's not coming from 200 miles away ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the poor old age of Alike Guinness and its vague stock footage cameros. Now I think about this, what is the point of paying a "mystery guest star" credit in the END titles? The end of the movie, there is no mystery, and everyone and their brothers have identified Guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize the old man of "Star Wars"). Still better in this way, so we can say that we are not great actors. <br /> <br /> People compare these, hitcoaks I think it will be the owner of John Hitcoch Milk, because late Sir Alfred will be embarrassed by this observation, he can create it alone. And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? It's 100 Elements Below! But then, we're talking about a rating system that allows the ring of lord: the return of the king to show as the best movie for the third time (check top 100), so ... <br /> <br /> / 10
