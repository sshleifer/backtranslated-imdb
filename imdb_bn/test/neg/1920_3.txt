Rich vs. Small city vs small town. White collar vs blue collar This thing is not the main theme of the movie. So when someone likes to include these themes, the situational line is very original, or very good. This one was not there. I do not believe romance of two young lovers of this movie. Both are believers or compulsory, it just falls flat. Do not even bother with renting a video.
