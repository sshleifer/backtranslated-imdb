This film goes to my "worst movie ever made" file. I have a copy of this picture when I want a good smile, and it's not a comedy. I'm disappointed that such a great actor agrees to be such a piece of garbage. This film is wrong (screenplay of hockey), objectionable (to the Canadians), and I was not impressed with such acting. Even the stories were a little weak. If you have never seen this movie then you are lucky. If you have, I'm sorry.
