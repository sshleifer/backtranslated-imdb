I know this movie is a low-budget horror film that is in favor of threat and "cheap" to Gore, but considering that, this movie is very neutral, filled with music, filled with an incompatible plot, and obvious signs <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the girl is really insomniated Interesting, but still there is not enough reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of those coveted movies in the 60's and 70's, you will see it, but be careful that it does not even reach the normal plate of such films.
