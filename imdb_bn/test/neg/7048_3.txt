I and my wife have seen this movie because we are planning to go to Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) landscapes and seas (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expect reasonable good written and well-played movies, but frustrated. His only release is the grace of an extended and extraordinary fishing sequence that is pure truthful: the drag, the net, tall wood boats, and the emotional, the weird fishermen. <br /> <br /> The film's growing visibility, its dialogue stilted, and played strictly from the "top-top." One scene, in which Bergman, forcing her to be a "innocent" (but apparently already dead) for her head, as a native and decent husband, will make her fertake perfect for the Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When a volcanic eruption we are suffering a sad last hope (and cast us). Unfortunately, movies continue, at the end of a medodramatic and irrational end. If you are in the old time tuna fishing, pass by this hokey effort.
