There is something in this plot about the white hunters adopted by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plain. It's a turkey and anything It's really wildly mixed footage from what's soon to be mixed with the recent latest (release) footage of men on a safari from sound and silent movies. A man's scene in a gorilla suite, the native of the South Sea ocean (representing the African people in the middle), the women of bikini, the terrible narrative and a lind cloth that is made up of the whole body (I think it is a national dish so dishonestly). It's a movie for sitting and fun - but only lots of alcoholic beverages and malicious friends. Any other time this is going to be a curly through. This is a bad bad bad movie. Outside I'm stupid
