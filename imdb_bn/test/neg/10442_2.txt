Now I have seen all the sharks out of the movie, this cake! The film's plot was good, but after the sorting of the excitement, it took a noxivive. Antonio Sobato, Jr. plays a nice role as a boy who searches for his father's murder shark. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks and the most dangerous as well. The shark scene was scary in some corners, but the effects were a scar and the scenes were a little weak in some places. There are mini-sub weapons, which will take away the entire school of sharks. The boy will take appropriate vengeance against that nudity, though it really costs his life too. Like they say the price of revenge, but what was it worth? That could go on and on, and this movie was a big letdown. The start was good, and lastly, it went like a titanic. 5 out of 1!
