Just saw Acacia, that I would agree with negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had a lot of expectations for this movie. Man, I was frustrated. Seeing this, I was thinking, "Surely they can keep me guard by this way", and for a little while I hope a little bit. However, I gradually realized that the film is really bad. So far the cheapest cash in Asia's worst market. <br /> <br /> The original story is probably not bad, but the way it is portrayed looks like the most ridiculous plot. It's okay to use the tree as a 'awesome' device, but all the filmmakers are giving us different shots ... Yes, a tree, over again. She hopes that the tree will do all her work for tension and build-up, but it seems like it is a tree shot. For righteousness! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Sure, we see a glimpse of an invisible tricycle around an angle, and again, above the meaningful shots of the tree, a glimpse of a child at the bottom, or side, but these scenes are not just scary. They seem stupid, especially because you understand that the directors seem to be meaningful to them. They are not simply. Besides, I agree with some other critics, that the characters are ridiculous. Especially one of the characters 'progeny of madness' is ridiculous. However, what really breaks Acacia terrible editing. It is difficult to see why the scenes have been spent together, but it is bad, and it might kill an interstitial spark in it. It makes me feel sponsored, because I see what they are trying to achieve with it, but I can not believe that they think I'll fall for this cheap ployas. <br /> <br /> There are many great Asian Scratch films, and a lot of bad, but this is the worst I've ever seen. They were going through the list of 'What to Do in the Ghost Movies' list, and they all kept them, but eventually they forgot to add real movies.
