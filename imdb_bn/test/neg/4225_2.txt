I think the cards have been stacked against the webmaster, because it was a bit irritable from the beginning to the right, as if something was wrong but I could not make it my finger hard enough. Then it hit me. Dub. For a while, they run most lines as voice over screens, it indicates a bit here and there until it becomes painfully obvious. This kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, is not anything remotely interesting about it either. I hate Dubbing, but at least, misguided, there is humor about how to shoot martial arts movies badly. <br /> <br /> What I want is a hacker's real hacking and a film like stuff. Perhaps the hackers want to reverse the table (instead of trying to get them out of the person trying to enter them). What I got was a poorly written, one-ton bad chez series of unmistakable murder mysteries, a supposedly unknown hacker who was discouraged without his little arrogance and did not know who was a director who would probably drive the camera. I just wanted to get there, grabbed the camera from the man, and blurred myself. The edit was not very good. Acting? Well, I think if you do not have such bad scripts from the lead person, then at least they can see. The main bad guy was right, but mostly everyone else had a joke. Dubbing was not helping, but the acting was very bad even considering that. <br /> <br /> Before I get even worse, let's do some good things till perk. Well, one or two. Despite the basic graphics, I enjoyed the Cyber ​​World ingredients, what was less than that, and I saw a film about, around and around the outside world outside the real world. The false proved thing was a cool thing, but in the end the scheme became vain. The Heart Gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, although the plot device leaked directly from the escape pages of New York, it was thought to be awkward in the long run. Here is a point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is okay. Why did not he try to print thumb of bad guys (since the thief of the heart device was active)? However, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, only if they could be used better. <br /> <br /> Now, what is the comparison of the brave runner brave to this movie? Both films take place sometime in the future, and there are some types of mortgage romance, in both the movies. There is a murder investigation, but I saw many movies with a murder in his center, which is nothing like a blade runner or a webmaster. Example, for example. Where matches are met Duration There is no comparison, just as there is no blade runner and hackers. Ridley Scott is a great director for the art direction, knowing a bright director and some basic things about filmmaking, where to set up the camera. The webmaster is cheap, and not just due to budget. It is cheap because of bad writing, and because it takes longer than taking the easy way out (like writing in a letter, who at first appeared to save the girl to the end, she wanted to point herself to the point in point, so that she could do her thing. Very convenient. Or, because of a sympathy for a character, we can not have any reason. So invisible things are enough to leave someone.) <br /> <br /> It tries to absorb, trying to absorb it, it tries to end even an abstract which is not least surprising and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of identical chase crosses, bad writing, editing, horror shots, bad acting etc. do not create an exciting movie.
