When I first saw "Fear of Race Angest" (you just do not like LMN movie titles?), I should keep my head skull. Was this meant to be serious? Why the main character might even run like a normal person running, very little like a star runner? How did I know that the coach film was just 1 minute bad? All these questions, and no answers. Then, I just removed the inin script and the terrible directions ... it was easy to resist ... Then the movie became more fun in minutes, and now I've moved it from LMN to my top ten junk films. Someone said here that Ariana Richards was really talented but the material was faulty - I sincerely disagree. He simply can not believe me as an athlete, he walks extensively throughout the rest of the story to land. Perhaps the coach came out of the prison and ended him ... at least I hope.
