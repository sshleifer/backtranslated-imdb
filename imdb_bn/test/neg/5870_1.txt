You've never seen that deciding what is the best movie is often difficult, because it can vary according to the trend, preferences for actresses / actresses, and even the exact mood you are in! Said that this movie is far away, in my opinion, a great movie I've ever seen !! I thought acting was terrible (there was no?), This plot was just stupid, and the props were completely fake. Could a low budget production be made without an amateur production? I do not think so. Even I agree with the friends I saw that this is the worst video ever broken, and we've had fun by watching this movie till date.
