This is not a horror movie, only inspiration. The plot is deeply flawed and inseparable. It tries to be a successive and fails at each. It fails as a comedy, as a mystery thriller and a horror movie. It is almost as successful as science fiction. The direction is unclear and Katie Holus, that should not be played, that attractive cherub face she should not be acting, her clothes. One of the 10 of Helen Mirren's films is the only one. Its performance is fabulously nefarious and it suffers (almost) through the rest of the price. His ability to transmute from disgraceful to his devilish manners and elegant range of control of his victims is miserable, miserable. Except for Morris Kaflin's delightful exotic show, Miran is the only reason to watch this movie. A solid 3.0
