The movie was so weird and ridiculous that you shout your teeth and hit your head to move around at the door for about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I love bad worse than the next guy, but almost a million times in the character of Matt Dillon, "We do not have any blood", and when the character of Matt Dillon draws the main character, I do not think anyone can take care of the blood. Literally on his hand. <br /> <br /> A non-magnetic term for about 5 minutes is not my idea of ​​background music with heavy metal guitars, but ultimately I had the worst headaches. This garbage.
