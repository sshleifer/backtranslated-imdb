Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and other so-called intellectuals have got the title of intellectuals because they love to portray India and Hinduism in bad light ... and Deepa Mehta earns her money even from her. Since Hindus are very gentle or afraid of protesting against Muslims, one can take any freedom with Hinduism. And it is true that even in the West when the women of the 1930s were a widow, they also behaved poorly ... Only nobody wants to say bad things about anything other than the West and India and Hindus. He illustrated the illogical illustrations of India and the widow's situation there. Wherever child marriage is not considered illegal. He finished the film with 34 million widows in India. Of course, among a billion people, there will be many widows. But how many lives did he live in the movie? Finally Deepa Mehta sold India and poverty to sell dollars. How indifferent ....
