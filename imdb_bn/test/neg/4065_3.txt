I have seen three other films which are worse than this, "Outspace from plan 9", "Side hackers" and awesome "Blair Witch Project", there are many technical flaws in this movie regardless of the film's plots regardless of the plot. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an Amtrak train with whom the skirt or handrail car. As the car goes out of the car, the murderer walks behind his victim and shocks him with the train. <br /> <br /> At one point a murderer entered a woman's apartment. She wants to kill a girl, what does she do? He turns his stereo! I heard my stereo suddenly shouted loudly. She killed women in a tub by throwing an electric hair curler. With five-foot cords, electric hairs of Carllear can be seen at ten feet high and having a plug. Apart from this, the apartment looked adequately for bathrooms' ground fault outlets and the victims were still supplying electricity. <br /> <br /> Boeing 747 is one of the most famous commercial airplanes on the planet, so this part really surprised me. The first cockpit was not even close to the original 747 and the second was not above the top deck of the aircraft. As a pilot and a co-pilot (I was a flight engineer), I was surprised to see, I crossed the spiral stairs and walked towards the right and proceeded towards the airplane nose. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see bullets too. Aluminum service cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors can not penetrate, but the roof makes the fuel leak run out of a small hole in the lungs. is not it? In less than a week, it was amazing to see the runway three yards away from 100 yards. <br /> <br /> I did not check, which movie was this week or something? It was very terrible.
