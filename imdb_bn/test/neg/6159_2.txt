This movie was weird because the plot was so helpless. The title refers to violent winds, which seem to be almost helpless to patronize the surface of the world, but it seems to have nothing to do with what is happening. This image appears to be a very poor rip-off of Blackarunner, i.e., the unprotected Android is being followed by bounder Hunter (or this ruthless police). Luke Skywalker enabled an amazingly good performance as the previously mentioned infamous police. At the end of the movie nothing is considered, we never find any substance or its objectives of Android. Bill Packston (who has kidnapped Android) for a particular reason, on his cardboard plane, a playable scene as a special song (the song is called "earboards"). This will happen again in a scene where the same song is not seen for obvious reasons. Does this music movie have any relevance? Do not think so.
