The film is suddenly suffering from the fact that there are no sources of how to package Jackie Chan for the people in Hollywood for years. His low-budget Hong Kong films were all the fastest movement thriller, which highlighted his amazing gymnastic skills and talents for light comedy. His first Hollywood films kept him in the same movies that were packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie, for which the character must be Asian apart from his character. Chan was never soft in his Hong Kong film, the films had a faster martial arts sequence, but "The Rentar" was lifeless forever. Danny Islo did not give much to work with both, and two of which probably did not meet the two chemistry of unexpected chemistry. Both bad movies have been good. The best thing about movies is Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the hacking challenge, which is so colorful and soaked in Jackie Chan. How to make Jackie Chan's film in Western character, will not be decided until the "Rumble in Canada" created in Canada.
