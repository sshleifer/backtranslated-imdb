It's seriously the worst movie I ever see, from the beginning, the movie goes straight to the mountains with its Chess music score, poor performance, and total deficiency or real story or plot. Even down to this right down for a B movie is terrible. After reading some of the best reviews I thought I would keep an open mind and see it. But all the bad reviews were so accurate. I could not fully understand how I could enjoy it. I had a huge sci-fi fan and the way I could swallow. Definlty is not a step in a step in a different movie yourself. Many other good movies that they deal with this issue. You have been warned.
