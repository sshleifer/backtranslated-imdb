I was almost embarrassed to see this movie around. I do not mean much to do a good zombie movie without special effects, lots of blood and gore, some terrible moments and a decent plot. The dead house is two, which of these is correct? No, not one. Of course, it is not as bad as the predecessor, from Woollie Bowl and about this movie that only makes me afraid. <br /> <br /> The dialogue on this movie is notorious, like "What do you do for a living?" The response "I kill the zombies" and "I was not a disc jockey, I was a soldier." It is also shameful for the special effects TV made for TV, I seriously say that bloody lips have spread over the cracks. This movie has a military based parking garage, a desk and an open gate room. The movie is so low that they could not even get a co-ed locker room. Actually this film seems to be portrayed in a middle school. <br /> <br /> Also, why are all female soldier models of this movie? And in that case why everyone in this movie is so surprised how they are running, they are standing alone in favor of killing zombies. One person even tried to give junk food. <br /> <br /> Overall, the worst scenes on the CC channel are also amazing in this movie.
