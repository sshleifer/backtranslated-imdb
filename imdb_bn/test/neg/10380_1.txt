Although there were a few scary moments in this movie (for the sensation of the music and film's extraordinary use), it was obvious director Ethan Wiley and script writer Elary Eddie, who failed to study his subjects at any time; Which also asked them about their demands that external scenes were looked after by the genuine Catholic bishops. <br /> <br /> In many inconsistencies <br /> <br /> * Jacob Roman Catholic priest, when we show him outside of the first church, he is usually wearing academic clothing in his clerical classes rather than elbows, chessballs or surplus. Not to the Roman Catholic priests, religious clothing is usually attributed to Protestant Ministries by religious groups. <br /> <br /> * Jacob has quoted some vague and annoying scriptures about the pastor's surgery. She features it in St. Paul. This verse is not written in the Bible, not from St. Paul's. I can not even find it in the Norwestic Scriptures. <br /> <br /> * Jacob told his bishop that he did not believe in the possession of the giant and stopped the request for insurgent studies but only 180 minutes (later on the same day?) within a few minutes to talk about Isabelle holding. Sure, this is possible; But a little unrealistic. To see a suspect-turned-believer more realistic, see Father Damien as a clerical / psychologist in the main culprit. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, turned out to be a former pastor's farmhound, is the first to try an exorcism in Isabella. He quoted scriptures, and he quotes back. He said, "I know you Psalm 65" - He corrects him "that Psalm 67" - they both are wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, who was the only past priest who created the mark on the cross - called the name of Christ, is using water from the Holy Water - told Jacob that he does not believe in the church and he does not believe in God. (Maybe he just did conflict?) Jacob compiled him for keeping the home made garments and went on the other side. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former Roman Catholic priest, surpassed himself (or previous Orthodox-style). As a Hispanic Roman Catholic who became a priest, he stood on the right side of the stairs beside his own head. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The idea was that the devil was not only in Isabella, but the entire family; But even at the end it was difficult to make sure that if someone is guilty of a picture on his head or if he is the giant incognito (except Sheriff - it is clear he was guilty). In Positive: Isabelle had Cripps - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole film and I liked Plover Twist with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure whether the movie was there <br /> <br /> Listening to the ongoing comments with Cameron Dado and Ethan Willie, I believe it was a joke.
