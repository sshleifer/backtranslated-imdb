If I ever saw it is a bad movie now. In the 1999 film's greatest year, Detroit Rock City stood in a barrel of junkies with Runkywey Bride and Wild Wild West. The plot is masterful. Four Scandian High School youths finally have the chance to see the KISS Hard Rock Theater in the third year in row. So when their tickets are torn off by super-religious, discipline-smoking mom, the friends themselves get blurred to Detroit, and I'm sure you can find the rest. <br /> <br /> OK, not right; Four band members (No, Jean, Paul, S and Peter) are going to get the tickets to explain the extreme step: losing your virginity in a confession; Save a Smoked-Out Bimbo and Your Mom's Volvo (Promoting Steve Sherippa, Still); To prevent robbery by slashing a piece for a 12 year old loan; And of course, after shutting down a full blender with Bourne-Leftover, M. Break your bare essentials for Ron Jeremy Looks funny, is not it? Perhaps Detroit Rock City has a point with all this tomfoolery in extreme how these fans could go. And we do not understand a comedy in this movie; It is supposed to fill the slapstick. But Detroit Rock City aims at the right audience? This is the meaning of rating R, the only way for older teenagers - I can see the audience, which will ultimately make it invalid as a classic-will-vey. <br /> <br /> Detroit Rock City lost its own to the end of the 1970s. The quality of the camera's texture is very clear and very bright, it is not necessarily the mood of the film, such as Spinal Tap and Sid and Nancy. This time viewers will be allowed to 'feel more at home'. Pre-90's garnish is not just a strategy for kids and others' Disco Infronus. The environment means something you know; I suspect, Detroit has made this 78 'attractive. If there is something positive from this film, it's hard rock from the 80's to the end of the 70's, hard-crack soundtracks. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, all of it here. Of course we can not forget the KISS, the band was properly operated. <br /> <br /> Any impossible failure to handle this image, why the nightmares of Cheyenne's services (it's really just KISS) moms around so fearful nations Sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup can be a part of that; The youth can also find good encouragement to explore themselves and get a good time. But, to this very rebellious group, do we call the KISS to listen to music all over the song? From the rest of the song, how do these songs of night [ing] and roll [ing] separate and partner each day? Most likely, these questions will be in a music communication class and they will not be in the movies they will have to answer, it's KISS and they rock and we all have to apologize to God to see them. <br /> <br / 1.5 / 5 stars
