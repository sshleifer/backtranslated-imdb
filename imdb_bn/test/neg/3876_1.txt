I'm not sure that this movie can be mixed with the first, even if it plays the original seven (even though four were killed). It just does not have spark and chemistry. All actors seem tired and they seem to be going through the speed to get their piccakes. <br /> <br /> The original film is "great", but this sign is firm and disrespectful. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, Westward and Futureward revealed his character (similar to black pants, shirts and hats) in the same mystery and the appearance of Chris Adams of the 1960 film. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in it 1966 It flashes to value observers, even on the wire.
