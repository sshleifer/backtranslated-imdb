This strong effort to fuse Robert Oatman and Quintin Tarantino (who boiled himself brutally) is not informative and entertaining. Character development is arbitrary and unbelievable - especially among kissing and in the final scene of the little boy, other critics have mentioned. Also, the ridiculous moments, the film is not funny (black humor or otherwise) the director thinks that it seems.
