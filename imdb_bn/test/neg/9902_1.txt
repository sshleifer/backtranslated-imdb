I can not believe I actually saw this for about three hours of my life. It should be one of the most incredible, anticipated and delicious television movies seen in a long time. I was expected for some good special effects and action, instead I rolling my eyes full time and on the screen "hello !!!" Cried. The dialogue is shallow and obvious, the role is spreading occasionally and the story continues, is it not that everything happened at the same time ... there is no mention of the obvious and annoying end ... I've seen more than my share of disaster films, I'm really a big fan, and think that they can often drag the whole unreal stuff into fun ways, but it certainly is not. It's an insult to intelligent visitors everywhere. What were they thinking when they made this movie ?????
