After all, I am disturbed that there are no choices of "0" in 10. <br /> <br /> I was disturbed tonight, and while I was flipping through the channel, I saw Chopper. Due to nothing else, I decided to watch it, it is expected to be just another vague horror movie, it is similar to the Cabin Fover Plot. <br /> <br /> The man was wrong ... Dr. Chapper made cabin firearms seem to have won many Academy awards. I can remind you, a small hiker boy from the cabin fountain screams in a veranda in the roundhouse, "Pancake !!", characters that leave the harmful friend of death and the boy's daughter-in-law <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, This reminds me of a horror movie made in the 8th grade known as "The Campout". "The Camp Out" is a good script (we wrote it an hour before filming), in addition to good actors, plots, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to smile something from a weakly made horror film, but instead I wondered myself as I could see myself wondering, "This is made by 8th graders?". <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, the events and a few of the little concubines were thrown together and they were not understood, and the cow and the violence were very few. How I liked it from the little stab wounds, people died instantly, and the killers were only small pocket knives ... If you are going to create a horror movie, at least killer is a mad kill device <br /> <br /> <br /> What is the commitment of girls marriage? Girls running around their bras are the best way to bring some scenes, even if they have no relevance in the story. And I would like to say, when my favorite line was in Dr. Chopper said, "I want to introduce you to someone ... my inner anxiety." Her "inner bitch" could then catch a garbage, Dr. Throwing it down, he misses, and the killers return to terror. <br /> <br /> Hello .... Well that was long, but I felt that I had to express my feeling of how terrible this "movie" was. I know that everyone has their own opinions, but if someone has more than 2 films in this movie, then he must shoot the hell ... <br /> ... Importantly.
