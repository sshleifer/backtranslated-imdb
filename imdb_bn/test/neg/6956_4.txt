On paper it shows a good film. Michael Kain plays a tough and ruthless boxing promotor who is the boy for the title abuser. Sadly, when the story is transferred from the paper to my television screen, it loses a certain thing. I hope we have seen to imitate his strong role in getting the cartridge and due to the progress of the film, it seems to focus on the thriller's attributes of a difficult diagonal revenge, but the whole voice of the movie goes so far that you are confused, what is it trying to fit? For example Caine (she can not believe you as "Shiner" Simpson, she only Michael Caine) has a humorous line that she refers to someone as Hanty Jacques then breaks the hands of someone of his hechchmen at the moment of an inferior humor. Hello how are you I mean it is supposed to elicit a laugh of ways playing out on the screen? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Irvin is not a bad director and has been well-considered for her battle films such as Dogs of War and Hamburger Hill but she is suitable for such violent plays and it can not help anyone, but it seems that She might have been somewhat scared. Living legend like Caine. Cain gives the idea that he is doing this only for money and well-known faces in the role of Lundua and Cranham, there are basically only common ones that can be played by someone.
