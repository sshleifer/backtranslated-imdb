I went through great efforts to get this movie after reading comments on this site. I really did not have time to write reviews but I felt my duty was as a sci-fi horror buff. This is the second review I wrote. Another dracula was for 3000. Now the point is. This movie sucked. Very easy I was thinking that if I saw that same movie then those who wrote that "nice" comment I saw movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad words, you name it and I saw it. But this really sucked. I have no distinction about how much I can not spend or spend, such movies and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew were arrested and imprisoned for time. However, I mentioned that I sucked this movie. I mean really sucked. The plot was in existence and the performance was weak. It seems that the author Peach Black has been seen and disturbed because he did not think of a plot like the first, so he decided to stop his own version. But instead, accept the suction factor and possessed him. Do not see this. If you pull your pants and sit on burning coal you will get more fun.
