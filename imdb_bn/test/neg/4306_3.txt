I will learn more about this movie before I rent it. It's one of those movies where you've got to get it even better. Then, when it is finished, you are stupid to lose such valuable time in your life that you will never be able to go back. Ice has done its bad guy and, well, it was highlighted in the evening. Shuttle's picture looks like this was done with a small toy inside a box and the spaceship scene was fun because you can see the attached string in space suits. The script was lacking and the man with bloodshed was in an unbelievable and unbelievable scene because it was better than a day of my best day. After all, I saw bad but I do not recommend this guarantee or I do not want to remember.
