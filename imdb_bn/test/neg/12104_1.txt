... from this movie <br /> <br /> Sorry, it was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so if I have problems with printing, then ask the festival crew. "So ..." I was told. "The manager wants this way". <br /> <br /> Not to mention again, my French is at the lower level of the election level (3 decades ago). Most of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed a few words about my understanding of some key words and a lot of details. <br /> <br /> I gave it a "1" rating, mainly because of a managerial rebellion that once subtitles refused to keep subtitles in a movie seen by an American audience. Forgive me, though most Americans do not know what Europe was on a map, even a movie enthusiast should not even think of knowing the "local language" of a given movie. Even some of us do not know Finnish language, but I still hope to subscribe to some "dolts" subtitles which are not advanced to acquire skills in 37 different languages. I will give this pride to David Lynch, not from litawk.
