Simply keep, this mini series was terrible. Tell me the road. 1. Excellent plot. 2. Extra acting. 3. Character Scattershot approach. 4. Annoying description. 5. Ability to create audience interest. <br /> <br /> This image can not pass the "Sap opera for dummy" test too. Sorry, I did not read this award-winning novel, so I'm just judging it as a movie, but it's really frustrating. Going to a party where they imagine you display dozens of appetizers. You look at different sorts and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, many characters were presented and never dragged. There are enough stories and characters in this film to produce 20 episodes, but we have given it less than four hours to digest it. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris has more facial expressions and feedback shots than you. 10 thousand monkeys will be found! Speed ​​is pretty slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so prominent that their characters are not trustworthy. Joanne Woodward's character is one dimensional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> This evil and retaliated cat, who followed him and his seat, followed the hero of the neighborhood - well, now let's do - it's also good Stephen King! Perhaps the most striking character in the film, and who is not well-groomed, John Vos, this annoying boy, whose ultimate act of despair is for the only conspiracy instrument that works in this film. <br /> <br /> Only everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> To enrich, here's nothing to inspire. The drama is weak melodrama. It's just a terrible attempt.
