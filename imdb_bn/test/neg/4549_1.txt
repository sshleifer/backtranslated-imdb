This will be one of the world movies I saw. I tried to like this movie, but they could embrace each individual aspect related to this movie! Cheap conversations, no character development, no excitement, not enough stories, there are no steps except for some really good scenery. It seems like they tried some things on the set and said to each other, "Hey, it seems to be cool, why not put it here" Then the director said, "Yes ... this genius!" And got back to snoring coke or something. While acting, I think that Dan Squareman, the only person of the TRED to make the film, but ultimately everything is nothing for him. This movie suks because of! 2/10
