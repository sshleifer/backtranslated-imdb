A friend of mine showed me this picture yesterday, and I am really surprised that anyone can make this film terrible! <br /> <br /> Mix the most awesome, closed dialog, which you have ever seen, that the most impressive special effects with timber performances tell people and you get this great creature! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' I have seen more fun than most humorous, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was sewing at the scene where the character of former police / vampire killer is being treated with internet journalists. Just look at it and you'll see what you understand! <br /> <br /> I can not honestly believe that someone did this with a serious purpose. <br /> <br /> Sad, but really good smile To believe it is to see.
