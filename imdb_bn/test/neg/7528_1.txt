PEP Squad is at its very low points with its confusing plot line and awesome performance. <br /> <br /> First, let's tackle the characters. Cherie (Brooke Belderson) kept a fierce, angry anger throughout the whole film, due to his extraordinary emotion of being a promorian. However, the audience wants to be prom queen in the first place, completely unknowable to the audience. Before reading the nomination papers, he travels around the school regularly during the time of uncertainty while he is there and does not show interest in the beginning with the place or his students. Why is he so much care to be their prom queen? Brooke Belderson obviously presents a "complimentary" performance, but in reality, he only spends full time in anger, roams around, kills people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you transfer a script to a young actor / actress who just wants to get angry, you're not asking a lot. You are not allowed to develop the character very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dereling, is even worse. Touch is absolutely no emotion and whatever its character shows no connection. When harassed by his principal, he pushes him down (after a few seconds) with a feeling of hatred or shock or some homosexuality. His line is reading as he is reading quarterly behind a cereal box. <br /> <br /> During the rest of the picture, her kidnapping charge is more than what students are charging a barbecue plan <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry kills several female candidates of the Queen of Candies and even somebody Do not look or take care of them too. (Yes, I found it, I got it, concerned about the whole town prom.) Very realistic. At least you could throw some funny scenes with the police, but that might be too much asking.) For example, Cherry after school students in the right school Between firefighters and firing, Beth interviewed in a local media interview. The reporter mentions a "shooter" that anyone who thinks that someone killed this innocent student, but then one second later asked, "Are you thinking of guns in the small hands?" Or something like that effect. Where did the journalists jump out of such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after killing the queen winner, and seeing the media again, meeting the media again, Beth only added that "he (Cherry's) need to hear" and in a quiet, unaltered mood Smoking cigarettes, walked away with his friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The city, Julie lives in a large house in the presence of a parent, and the party in her home (maybe I'm left out of the scene, but the end At the time I knew that high school parties were not involved in the artist's dance of naked women, man's ammunition for head hair and everyone lived in their "I'm very sensible and mode" attitude Beth's father-in-law played with his terrible role, and his father simply spoiled everything of his parents, in order to tell a fool-like figure (and not a recreationally) like a new black overseer running with Cherry, he tried to fire him with a gun Do it. Yes Very realistic <br /> <br /> <br /> The only praise I can give to the movie is that the photography is a wonderful one. The corners are impressive and the screens with each shot are very clear and crisp. <br /> <br /> is not very bad acting and scripts.
