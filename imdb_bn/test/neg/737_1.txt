We do not know how to start talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely doubt that anyone who wrote / produced / directed this movie will never read the book. Because they missed the whole point Sertral, not terrible. Just a hint. Second, bath scene. Enough said. Third, added characters. Sketch Gothic French lady and her black leaf enjoy those who hold hands and cartwheeling. We do not understand where this came from And then there was welding. All of them were really unlike. Catherine and Mr. Tilani finished together, because we were very unlucky that nobody wants to see them happy. And ... music. We believe that BBC producers have gone out of money, so they run their grandmother's campaign. And they found some old records. Saxon, crying female voice, and a temporary electric guitar. * shudder * <br /> <br /> Plus, always the best line: "As you've gone, white rose bush has died in sorrow." If someone has any explanation, we love to hear it. Because it does not give any sense. <br /> <br /> We are still wondering what everyone was thinking about in the world involved when they brutally released the film's cruel excuse. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is the worst we've ever seen. And I saw many movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie to the person you hate. They will see it, and want to kill themselves. And we agree with the previous post, we can give these 0 stars, if possible. Not at all !! And we firmly doubt that everyone who commented so far for this movie was involved in its production. Or was mentally insane. This is the only reason we could come up with an optimal review.
