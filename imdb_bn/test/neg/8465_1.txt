Five Fingers Apparently the brutal, shock value relies heavily on Hollywood tactics to clear the response to a positive movie running. This movie is completely graphic, mainly because it is very graphic to take it seriously. I was bored and hateful that five fingers were even created, and basically it was to strengthen myself to continue watching. Torture and horrible within yourself. Even a word coming from a room where someone is torturing. But obviously the makers of this movie think that it was not enough. It had to cross the path more than it was needed, and this film was easily and effectively crashed as a kind of legitimate point of view. For this reason, this film is nothing more than self-gratifying. Most of the five fingers also carry themselves in the B-movie status with its temptation in manipulation. In other words we are shown current and then the past snippets are released. This is a little bit in Hollywood's general manipulation with a twist. Visitors are usually shown at the beginning of the movie on page 100 of the 100 page script, and then the rest of the film explains the ending, five fingergers are dedicated to the back, which is quite tiring. Movie Overall, the five fingerprints seemed stupid to see me throughout the film, because torture was certainly obscene, and of course, this point did not have to be used for graphics breaks. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney does not end up in a guest camio appearance as some hugely suppressed superhero. A perfect example of what happens when this movie falls in the hands of an avid greedy, stupid Drollt.
