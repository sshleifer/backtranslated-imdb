In this picture, a man (Bardham) has a different plot, who wants to earn money for his construction business and in the process of marrying a woman he does not like (with wide eyes, Maria de Mediaros). He maintained his passionate relationship with his first and true love and eventually confused himself on his romantic web. He never gave up his joggling action until he met three main characters. With boring results, many free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reaction of the movie is weird, incompatible and of course, very stupid. None of the characters is credible, which makes the movie a bit annoying. However, acting is surprisingly good for such poorly-directed films, which makes it a little interesting, but if you can, please see another movie!
