Disgust Stephen Baldwin I did not notice until I got the DVD home and saw its name in the credit. Double o What's worse, he shoot'em up this low budget, NAME, stupid, terrible, wannabe I mean, where did they get the man to write this denial? When driving a catalyter in El City Dump, is the film's game hoping to break? Sunny condition in the whole plot ridiculous situation. Beldwin Believer as the poster boy for American Gothic, Sun Pitchfork. Looking for the exhibition of his full performance he needs ribbon and then he is looking as it is available. So, there are your folks there: Bad script, unsuccessful acting bad actors, low budget settings and a hero who is a cookie customer as a convincing hero like a cookie customer. I'm too late for getting my money back in the DVD, but you can liberate yourself - unless you're among those who see the dogs laughing and laughing ... To be honest, it's very annoying funny.
