I bought this picture because I thought that Cast was nice and I like Jennifer Rubin and Passi Kansit. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the acting is not high quality. Stephen Beldwin often disturbs his character and dies at another time. Passi is not so strong in anything but a few scenes, and the supposed poem in a particular scene of his hotel room is totally meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very stimulating and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by the best in this film. Ms Rubins Character is the first innocent, then sexy, as she plays Stephen Baldwin's character (Travis) for a fool. Supporting cast Adam Beldwin (not related to his famous names) and M. Amette Walsh appeared in several films. I also saw Art Evans, who was a co-worker with Die Hard, 2 people. This movie is beautiful and there are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but it is certainly not a fast dynamic or intelligent thriller. They drive cars for a crime, and Stephen Belveen's character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again, instead of blacking around the area around his eyes, then the sunglasses are shown again later on. Crime scene and police are pursuing, editing is a very obvious error. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Women or Baldwin you will see something here, but others should be cleaned. This is a reasonable but unacceptable thriller and if you want it is not worth more than a few dollars.
