Bad shots, badly edited, chaotic dialogue, flat characters, failing adaptations of a novel. It's not really so bad. Least acting and good popcorn saved me for this half - three hours more pain. Sometimes a good one-liners. <br /> <br /> David is not recovering from a gradually young, who lost his brother at a young age. Although he believes in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, it does not seem to help him much in real life. David is a debt collector gang member, where each member has an IQ below sea level. Unintentional shooting and worse edits as well as a needy script, the appearance of the failed debt collection as an amateur amateur homemade reality show can be quite funny. <br /> <br /> Hired an apartment from David Elementary School, Haraldur, who has read some sentences about his importance, he believes in David that he is facing the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. Due to a serious lack of script based on his opinion David did not offer anything. A few scenes of Harlan's show that David explained the mistake. The probability of the movie is opposed to the book based on this film, it is not exploited. First, David's relationship with Haraladur increases his position among the debt-collective gang, but forced Paraniah, who is present in the criminal world, to show his loyalty to the show. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is fine, but it is based on the book. This could be a much better film. A good photographer could create some of these components. Sadly, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually good. Petur Johann David is as nice and trustworthy as Eggert does not get much to work with Þorleifsson, but what does her good works with her little material. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (a tiny role) manage just fine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The overall opinion of the debt collector can be a fun and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero, a poignant, badly-made film made after a poor manuscript. It will be more enjoyable to look at your toes for half an hour.
