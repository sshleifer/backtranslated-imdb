This is not a mental connection, "Who are you calling?" (Sic) "police" (sic) "you can not do it, drag the steve phone" (sic) "jc has found a T-T load and drug money, you can not involve the police" (sic) "I'm sure It is not a crime to steal money from the criminals, even if they arrest him at least, but he will survive "(sic)" Listen to me, Steve, it is not handled properly, Jessie Gown is dead till now, now the phone is on the phone. Tax collections. "(Sic) best friend's brother began to load the gun," Hey, what are you doing? " No answer "Hey, I can think of a family."
