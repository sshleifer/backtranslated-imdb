What do you do with all the elements that do not finalize a film? A director's cut or extended version can be one day left for you to be released. You can use it as a stock footage in another movie segment. You can just terminate it. Or you can collect it, make more and more compositions from each film you create and then make another film, use it to ignore the accompaniment or no sense. Put a descriptive a very primitive skeleton in it and a number of slots in your celluloid cast-offs line up (not the excuse), line up. Make it into a horror film director's mind, forgive the strange nature of the plot and you've got yourself a horror movie. All these shooting can be done with a few days. And stupid like me can see their life hours after two hours. And then come here and try to warn others away. A big waste during the whole chain of events.
