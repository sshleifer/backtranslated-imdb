There are many reviews this movie has made the worst. There is definitely a lot of wrong: lazy acting, but rather annoying and clipped and occasionally incompatible scripts and stock B-movie sounds and "special" effects. As mentioned, there are plenty of chocolates, _Cave Dwellers_ is creating a tissue of fantasy film, especially compared to the Lord of the Ring Trilogy. However, this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most, if not all, these reviews (with this review) are written by MSTK3 fans. Therefore, most of these reviews are mostly the summary of the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Joel, Tom Sara and Crowe have commented on Mad Scientists that they have ever sent the worst movies. Of course, loyal fans took this quote and ran with it. I respected this movie-not like anyone who respected Format Gump_ - but customized a bit in this movie. Also, this movie is ridiculous without its MSTK3 treatment Because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take it seriously and it does not try to import a few godly themes to its visitors. For all the monster dolls, medieval gliding, and decreasing continuity - this film does not advertise to any subject which is rather shallow illustration of a shallow style <br /> <br /> Similarly, I do not bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred is Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arc Hall, Junior, etc. <br /> <br /> <br />
