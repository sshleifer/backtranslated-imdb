The Southern Cross written and operated by James Beckett is the best celluloid and actor's waste of effort. The film is not necessarily bad, it does not necessarily mean that the movie is closed by a source that closes its promise. This is a tedious conquest of movie clich√© which can be traced to thousands of different movies in the past. It adds random and empty plot twists to nothing other than any purpose, to follow a villager (unexplainedly) who is a trip by guard in such a ghost town. It was apparently decorated as a pretext for a shot-out and overwhelming border crossing scene, when people entered each other at the entrance to the pistol shot and went out of the door and ran the windows. Someone believes that someone had said that the baked under the cheat was a scurry city and he said, "oh great, there is a visible sight there. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your rent money on it. It's a bunch of random bits and pieces from hundreds of different movies thrown together to call it in an action drama.
