This film is almost complete waste of time. I am studying my English-language book, and the film only contributes, and it is fully seen that the whole scene is set in rural Ideal. Acting roles, cinematic humorists, and so-called dramatic scenes of the film were mostly in my class (with me) in their books. Although the book is not like my favorite literature, mile better than film, and the soundtrack is simply a common miscreant. Do not watch this movie until you find a timeless, quality story silent, until the media is turned into waste.
