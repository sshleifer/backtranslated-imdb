When I write it, Norman Wisdom is a very confused adult who spent most of his growing sleeping nurse while spending most of his sleeping and old cats-phrases. In fact, when you read this, then probably will join next day and obituaries will record 80-year-old hysterical mirth-made career from lovable funster with a weird captivating hat. Most of this homeland will not believe that Norman Wisdom created a form of suicide in the late 1960's, with a surprisingly compulsory article on this self-inflicted poor, yet her movie career. <br /> <br /> The signs are close to evil ?? Go to the "Tony Tenser Presentation" title. You scratch your head ?? "Where have I got that name before ..?" Well, just give your favorites to the title of the cheapest, unpleasant British movie titles of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> then say ?? "A Mnhem Golan Production". Oh dear <br /> <br /> The combination of confessions from Paris Holiday Camp and the Last Tano from what I can do. Sponsor by the Southport Tourist Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile in Norman Wisdom (or its change). Even in such trash, he never closes the form, and in some way you monitor through partial fingers, because he is all (apparently insane) birds and drebals to Sally Gasson. Tony Tensor and Mainham Golan are responsible for the horrors of some of their true movies, but the bedroom scenes of filmmaking persecution were resurrected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the old Norman + sex + Hippie. Get me out of this mess! "I guess it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> Although sorry for the fantastic things, they probably said" Yeah! It will blow up for yardbirds for us "<br /> <br /> And so ended the career of leading Norman's leading man. He stopped his little ball in Southport. <br /> <br /> I once went there. It was a depressing place.
