Ten years ago I had done this torture. Thankfully for me, no one knows it because I do not have the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theater, I was happy! My agents (apparently for the first time) were run by filmmakers, scribbled the script every day, and often changed their arrangements with agents. Later they told me, once in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" were worth 4/1 hours footage! Even up to 90 minutes, it needs to be at least twice as fast. I saw Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - the waste of the film!
