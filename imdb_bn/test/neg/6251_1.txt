Even as a big fan of low budget horoscope, I could not find the disaster quietly fun. Terrible acting, a painful generic "plot" and no dimensional character, it does not matter how disturbing and drunk you are, it's not worth your 81 minutes. I do not make the same mistakes. Rent something else. anything else!!!
