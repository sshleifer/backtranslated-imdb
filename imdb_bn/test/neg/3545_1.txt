I remember flipping through the HBO channel and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with reaching a small town with Candice Cameron Bure. She lived with a couple, who coincidentally had a daughter named Laurere Faregut, who acted like her and starred with the same actress. Even the dude agreed that they are the same. Things, Laura was killed a year ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This attitude and nightmares can prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer after all. Throughout the film, you see that Ray Ordwell Senior (Dennis Arnt) once again raped him and killed him. <br /> <br /> The film is very long and very annoying. The film just drags on and over and over. Surprisingly, I saw a television movie called 1997 (Clood) which was good but I'll review it later. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
