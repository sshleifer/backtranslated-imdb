This movie was so terrible that I could not stop the whole thing, it was just bad! When I was seeing it, it seemed like it seemed like a cheap movie that came back in the 60s or something with those terrible special effects, but then I realized that it was created in 2001. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and acting were really very awesome and the plot was almost existent. I do not think anybody will go back to making cheap movies which are very cheap and old, I'm not sure if they do not work for this purpose or actually have no budget for this movie. It actually seems that it was shot at the local person's house or something in Camcoder. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it really looks like Chess. <br /> <br /> I do not really know if anyone can really enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 *.
