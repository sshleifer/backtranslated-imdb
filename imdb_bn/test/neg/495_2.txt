No emotion Bad music (and I'm a reformed eighty metal guy, so I will risk some good things.) Everything is done in half. There is nothing left for us to keep nothing from without stopping a parody of the brothers, seeing what horror they will pull up next. The tour manager tries to bring humanity to the thing but does not give enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is slumming. We know he did not need that money. Can he play the only role this summer? Surely he will have to flatten each time to pop his forehead on VH1 - it is often slightly less than Ozzy. It just qualifies as a TV movie. It is hard to believe that it is actually released in the theater.
