Sam Oson, film editor, editor of "Rosemary's Baby", from 1968, gave a series of instructions to create a fast-moving TV, in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, for Mia Faro) ran out early - and unexpectedly - probably the devil of the world This harmful story about the son is probably more likely to help flesh in ghoulish direction. Roth Gordon is the most attractive to come back to the minnie cassette (as well as his husband Roman with Milford) in his Oscar winning role, but he did not do much - and it seems very uncomfortable in any way involved. This script must be strictly low-priced products, and original author Era Levin (who went to write in his own sequel) must be absorbed. With fairly slowly and rural, poor photography and no mysteries or scares.
