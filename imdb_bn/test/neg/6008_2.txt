Being a huge fan of Laura James, I picked it up at the rental outlet to see just another Emmanuel movie. Boy, what did I do wrong? <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with Emmanuel in Isabelle. Laura James is with her husband Gabriel Tinti, but it is the only connection with Emanuel. Here, Laura "Laura" (Original, Hah?) Plays a beautiful supermodel who goes to see her wealthy friend Pia (Anne Bell) in Egypt. Among her is a ** hole photographer Carlo (a molten look Gabriel Tinti) and sometimes some blonde ladies who are named after. Also living in Pia's palace is Hauratio (Sexy but Boca Al Cleaver), which is nothing but a secret but speaks secretly. Pierre's two daughters, a small-haired lesbian and another brunette to come to the weekend. Sex is meant a lot, but it is rarely shown. A handsome actor, Ali, plays an Egyptian servant, who is lucky with three women in the palace. Lorra has sex with homosexuals; Lesbians Hauratio, Pia, and blonde have sex with Huratio in the Egyptian Belle, drinking Laura's blood, and holding her during the Egyptian ceremony, Carlo Laura is raped. It's all one of the worst movies I've ever seen EMANPLE in Egipt that happened with all very little flash. Far away from the boyfriend, even the actors lacking during their sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> There are two famous couple (Laura and Gabriel and Al and Annie) in this film, the number of available sexual scenes is uncountable. Instead, a movie that offers a top quality euro cass, and sometimes the product will not be supplied, which Laura will close each audience except for the fullness of James. Otherwise, clean EMANULELE in EGYPT!
