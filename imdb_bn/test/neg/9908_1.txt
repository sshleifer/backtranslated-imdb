I hate most of these rubbish, the arrogant attitude of filmmakers and network executives, which maintains this ambiguity over the public because they really think that the audience is so stupid, so illogical, so useless that such an inconsistency is appropriate. There is a neutral recreation that is watching disaster films and today's CGI effects have given artists powerful tools to explore the fact that they were previously denied. With that joy we sit down to see some greatness and destruction. Well, guess, only Mahmud we have seen on Wednesday's episodes promoted ads. What a let down! But wait, there was even a big one. The script itself is a big disaster! And then this was the direction played and flaccid by everyone involved in Turkey. But we just knew this before! We knew that the only effects are not entertainment, but this TV movie does not take care of the network buzzees properly because their endless line of mantras "does not surprise the audience's stupid". These guys will actually live by this policy, and I'm so annoyed with it. The audience has abandoned the drama in the droves of any cast and show their cast of the camp. At least those programs did not want to see anything like this: Intellectual Pornography. Well, worse than Section 6, it is considered different and it is considered "real". Yes this was a disaster movie but the catastrophe they are not advertised!
