Some years ago, this picture was set for TCM UK broadcasting as part of TED Browning's anticipation ?? But what they really did in 1937 in the remake! My brother saw it (and, in the dark, it followed the scene for the original scenes, even set designs) ?? While no classic, she had a much more satisfying viewing experience than the previous version of the incredibly creaky ?? <br /> <br /> The first cooperation between this Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had high expectations? But it became instant when after the first screen of intense conversation it became clear that the original concern of the film was still to enjoy the novel's sound technique and as a result it is periodic and extremely stable. The thriller plot is not just exciting; Even the hungry British-Indian setting (with character-effect and high-class barbarism?) "I say," "rather" and "now seeing here" "?? completely risible rendering than anything else! <br /> <br /> In addition to this there are some unpredictable hawlers: Margaret Wicherry (as a fake medium) Police Inspector LuGosi (if anything, its expected screen appearance is already clear) with some time The crime of double murder really 'works' (The evidence indicates his own daughter, by Lilia Hyams)? She is deluded in a tapping hearing and the thought that the spirit world has been interacting with her truly. But then Lugosi enters the room And in his absurd accent, directly facing him, "I knock twice ?? You do not hear me! "My brother and I fell beneath the sunny! The edit is really fugitive, too: during a high-angle shot of the main set, a mic is dragging quickly into the camera area. And some of the worst examples where an individual off-screen is visually In the next shot walks to the other part of the set ?? But each shot is unjustifiably long for other actors. It is displayed so that it is always a few ducks walking for this person !! <br /> <br /> I saw the third terrible Browning talk on thirty-three even if this and Merilus for Cell (1939) deal with murder and confidentiality And even now, it can still be associated with the series. A lot has been said about the director's clear demerit with the arrival of the sound: however, although they may be, even though 30    জুড়ে যে 4 টি সরাসরি ভয়াবহ ছায়াছবি তিনি বাকিদের চেয়ে অসীম ভাল ছিলেন? যা আমি সর্বদা স্টাইলিশ এবং বিজড়িত যথেষ্ট সুপারিশ করার জন্য সুপারিশ করা হয়েছে যে ব্রাউনিং সমুদ্রের সমুদ্রের সমান নয় বলে প্রস্তাবিত হয়েছে ??
