This game was terrible. I think they worked very hard on visuals and did not do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visual looks incredible, but the game is really "fun"? No! I mean, "hello the jump of the building" and what I'm doing is Holding and A / X. The game is not okay, and I do not agree with Ubisoft because they had this hot girl (the game's producer, J Redmond), and they "All right, we got this hot girl, let's pump it up" and if you go to gaming websites You can not see Assassins Cride's gameplay stuff, you'll see his face with a microphone and it's "We're about to add Z. Ramon to his favorite cookie. Der interview! "It's like a human being, F * @ K stops in the UK, CARE?! Apparently ... many people work because they bought the game and liked it ... I mean, I compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not really abuse Wii Remote, but it still provides the most innovative and most important part of the gameplay! They were able to do a bit about Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was archived and looked amazing and it is a game that is best for the year. Not a murderer's religion, people, even a nominee for the game of the year even does not deserve. This game was popular with "Oh it's next generation gaming" .... really? I do not think So let me get this right here because I think people who like this game just like it because they are Z fans, so I will tell you, JD will not have any relationship with you or if you like it or oppose it Do the game! If you want a real game on PS3, Get Uncharted: Draft Fortune, if you want a real game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games) and if you just want a real game all systems In between Get Super Mario Galaxy! I know many people will hate this comment, but seriously, press two buttons to do all these great things, is it really a fun game? The only reason that the other game will be more complicated is that it will end after being more innovative and fun. And this game is not just that. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 a live hel!
