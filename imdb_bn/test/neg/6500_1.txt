If you plan to schedule your program for a movie festival, do not confuse what you say in the booklet. It is a complete waste of time and energy. I saw Bunu, I saw Dalai and praised them; But it is not spirituality, it is not always supposed to be. Did they ever think of the fame of mankind when taking this picture?

With respect to this endeavor, it is a good idea to cancel all copies of this movie or whatever it is.
