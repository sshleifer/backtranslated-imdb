It is amazing that this gifted actor Chappa is seen in this neutral, compassionate, sticky and long life gangster film, which seems to be white, half the Mexican, the acting is quite bad and most well known stars have given a script for the 16-year-old known trash, I Sure that this movie is a career for actors like Dwayne, Wagner, Kitch, Tilly and Busce Imna points. I'm pretty sure that they've ever got a photo of this in Turkey. I suspect many have ever heard of chips and after this horrible movie I am sure that they will disappear wherever they are.
