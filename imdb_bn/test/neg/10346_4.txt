I mistakenly saw this film that it was the zombie flick of another radio station. Shonky production standards and low rental cast soon gave away another cheap knock-offs to these cheap science-channel channel styles. <br /> <br /> Central performance from Bill Moseley is primarily as suspicious as the radio shock joke, but when the film is reduced, it will become less and less believable because it is really bound to work. There is nothing more to do with the rest of the cast than the corresponding look and there is no depth. <br /> <br /> The so-called movieography of this film is neutral, flat, and completely obscure. It does not even manage to be a strong believer, literally hurt without a significant exception at the end of the Jammy make-up movie. <br /> <br /> In the film originality and injecting a message it is half-baked concoction and this outbreak with the tolerance and terrorism war against Islam equally halts the opinion. It is managed with all the 6 year old intellectuals. Characters and seemingly authors can not distinguish between race and religion - they describe specific skin color as "Muslims". Most notably one character is revealed to be Muslim by skin color alone. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists who create the outbreak are normal psychological stereotype. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there was a similar budget beyond the high Pontifull far, where the Dead Air is weak, and it burns everywhere.
