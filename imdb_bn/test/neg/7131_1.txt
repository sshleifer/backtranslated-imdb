That was a waste of 9 dollars. The movie was terrible. All the "scary" parts were vague and sad repetitive. Apparently all parts of the part can be fully predicted, and the audience does not seem to keep any bit of attention. Also, during the whole film the plot line did not advance in advance and it is just a big set of mockery 3. It looks like a big plot looks like a progression, then it was just a pointless scene. These directors should follow the example of Hitako: Every view has a point. 90% of the film can be excluded without changing the plot. Final Opinion: Do not waste your time, energy or money !!!
