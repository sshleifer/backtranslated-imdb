According to blogger behind the DVD case; Jonathan Ross 'came to the thorn weeds.' I doubt he has more to do with his fullness. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the series for one reason or another, so maybe I do not have any necessary mark. As in this movie; I saw the first 45 minutes or so. Once I laughed, once I laughed, then I reached for the newspaper to do something else to entertain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the last few years, most of the comedy series took place on television, of which at least 'button', 'The Fast Show', 'The Wife of Dublin' and 'Father Ted' Was not there, everyone was involved with an intimate group. Comic characters and sketches. Anyone this cockrap could hit in a cocked hat. <br /> <br /> If the series was something like this movie; I was surprised they got the fund. Happily, it was one of the Â£ 2 Tesco Bran-Tub purchases and is now in the local charity stores. <br /> <br /> The morality of the story is; Do not believe the scholars, do not pay the top dollar.
