There are some beautiful parts of this picture, such as closing a bb bit and biting another bigger. Castle Freak is a good monster in itself. I would be afraid of pieces if he is coming after me. However, there were some diverse parts about the movie. <br /> <br /> A husband consumes alcohol and kills his 3-year-old son and blinds his teenager. I think death is a bigger loss than blindness, but you never know that parents actually think their daughter is blind. They are caring for all that "JJ dead!" Although her teenage girl walks around and she talks about what she can not drive. Parents like "honey, keep on walking without guides, you know better than him," and then they are crying and J. J. It does not cry because of its death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialog's line is not very realistic or good. For example, when a giant crash is heard in the fort accidents, everyone goes to the basement to see it. It was a huge mirror that was upset on the ground and was disconnected. The husband runs a terrible brittle mirror and expressly says, "The mirror has broken." I do not know, say anything more than me, if a giant mirror mysteries falls to the ground in my castle. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife have some major problems and how to see how they are fooled with each other. Nobody ever believes in blind girl. Tip: If a blind girl says that she hears something, trust her and do not silence her. I think this story is moral. Listen when people say something to you or else you can kill yourself to prove your point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the best character was the chief police officer. She was the best actor and character. Everyone else (besides Castle Freak) had a good run of the mill. 3/10
