Critics started to call the Oscars winning club. After the Hell Berry the monster won it for the ball then going straight diabolical catwoman. Hillary Swank triumphs among boys do not cry and follow it with the core. Jamie Fox takes a nosiveive as a pilot in Dull Steve after a gong scope for the verdict. Now it seems that Hollywood star Charlize Theron has crashed all the photos of his "Monster" Oscar with the biggest cipher chocolate on all of these pictures. <br /> <br /> This image is lost only after 20 minutes of visitors' interest. The real thing to live for is that the film is fattening even after Charles Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a weird and ridiculous compound. Just ion Flux is finally shallow but for an action flick it's really very dull. It will appeal only to fans of comic book and Horny teenagers, who would like the thumbnail's half-naked idea for 90 minutes. Flux only fails to fail. 99% of the world's virus, and the last city of the world, Bregna, survived, some 400 years later, that year of killing the virus in 2011, 2415 is going to live in the Good Cold Dynasty, the name of science who has improved its healing. . <br /> <br /> This ostrich is not good at all and it is not beyond its high wall, it is sometimes a citizen from the last jungle but this undesirable ban holds up and unfortunately unites it, which paranoia, similarity and illogical obedience to this wall There are vague, unwanted restrictions that keep them in. Pictured around and surrounded Berlin, maliciously, it is a state of sovereignty, a walled city, where its people are no longer able to reproduce and set a story against the terrible and secretive plot of how it sustains life. <br /> <br /> Ã†on Flux is employed by underground rebels to change the way of human life for the killings. This is the story of his fight for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Ian Flux combines lacey details, rapeseed pacing and real deadly effects. Want an unrealistic video game rather than a film. The only thing fortunate to be a failure is not to do any of these things, Flux may only start and which one of the worst franchises in history can end, thanks to God for the supervision of the House Box Office. <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this real lie? There really is not a story here: Charles Theron jumping around a black suit like a grass storm. Out of today's other movies, many woods are moronic and emotional. It made a lot of effort as an adaptation and I did not accept much from the cartoon I expected, the only thing that adorned the cartoon was to fly the eye scene. To avoid all costs.
