Well, that's the way to the old way. Wentworth looks younger than he and he should not. Louisa is very nice way to Mary sister sister very very young and very lovely. She is not supposed to average, beautiful. When this actress considers Mary to complain, she complains that she is very nice to be a complainer. Lady Russell is very old. It's crazy. If you read the novel, then he becomes an old man of Anne; perhaps an old mother can be about 18 to 20 years old than Anne - so about 50 to 70! Its not crazy, fits. How are you happy so happy? When he laughed, he laughed, "Oh, worst of all, I saw him now the worst pass." Yeah, okay. If you can compare these two compared to the 2003 Roger Michael version watched OK. That one is right. This one way off. Read the novel and know what you can understand.
