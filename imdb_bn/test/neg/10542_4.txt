Oh dear! What can I say about half past dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking ... a Steven Sigal movie! Cool! We can see people kicking and surrounding people and breaking bone. We could even see the stick with somebody fighting! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I was in for a strange awakening. This image can be summed as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of A-Team, remove loving and lazy characters like Murudoch, Hanib, Mr. T and Face. Then Edd Wood will be ashamed to make a plot call to the writer / director, and a fan of his Matrix and John Wo is a fan for himself. Really throwing in a bunch of people with the power of bad acting and those who do not have true names. Finally, add a major starring around the midfield and get their own stunts seem to not be able to. <br /> <br />'s result? Half past dead An employee movie is so ridiculous that at least smile right through me. The holes of conspiracy are great, big on Thursday - for example, prisoners, who attack the prison, instead of trying to flee, fight with the attackers. Or does the prison itself have a heavy surgical and rocket-propelled grenade launcher? You have a helicopter (an interesting duplication with a hue), a video game machine is mounted with nose. <br /> <br /> Then there's Seagal itself. I like the guy He can fight He is not even a giant that will never be in the Jane Cloud Van Dam. But through the film I was optimistic for that great, defining war scene. Never happened Instead we got lots of people shot guns and did not hit a complete hell. I mean, when someone runs a narrow handle and you burn a sub-machine gun on them, there's no more space than the bullets under the corridor and the target. Yet what they think? Even the team will have a quarrel with this stupid. And then when it gets some kind of physical stuff, without a bullet-on facility, we treat a Shabi Matrix Rip-Off. People kick 20 feet through the wind and are caught in other ridiculous intelligent disguises. <br /> <br /> Steven, you're better than this. Your career can not be over. Say it is not! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the party kind of way. But I doubt it will be high on anyone's "re-noticeable" list. This is not the case for justice. Like more lunch out.
