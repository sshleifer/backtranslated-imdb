<br /> <br /> I did not play this movie because I'm a fan of high school basketball fan (I actually rarely see NBA games) but rather I'm a fan of Gen Hackman, who usually operates to bring an impressive depth of his performance. In this case, however, I was extremely disappointed. This was not one of Hackneyn's carrier's bright burning stars. <br /> <br /> With justification with him, there was not much to work with him. He was not invited to play a lot like Norman Train, a new coach of the High School Basketball team in Indiana. Basically the ranting up at its performance referee made the basketball down and down pacing. I'm not particularly credible in her role to be honest. I was disrespected with the necessary romance between Dell and Maya Flanher (Barbara Hershey). There was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Herrei. The romance never attracted my attention, and the basketball did not even happen in "Action", which was quite predictable. <br /> <br /> This was very convenient with this movie. I discovered the depth of hatred hate that many people were with Dell, almost before it came. Character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. In my opinion, there is not much basketball and enough human interaction. What shoots of children's shooting do we need to see that it is a basketball movie? No doubt: Is it possible to suspect that Hikori is going to win big? I understand that this is based on a real story, but I guess that it is not true that every true story should be a movie. Quite obviously, it was not a very interesting movie. Surely a movie Gene Hackman wants to forget. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, not even better than 2/10.
