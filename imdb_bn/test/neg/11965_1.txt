For the first and foremost, I want to say that I am back after retiring from writing good comments about horror movies. Only the movie titled "Scrapbook Will Wild" can bring me back, so here I am <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to close this comment as I say this. Seek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really awesome, I mean that it's going to be bad. But I had no idea that I'm going to spend more than 60 minutes in a 90 minute 90-minute film, which I thought was a horror film. <br /> <br /> Let's start the biggest mistake of the movie. ). Ken Shamrock Now memory serves me properly, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now if memory serves me again, then she was stupid comic relief in this stupid film (or it was looking at me). I'll explain how you all of its lines. My favorite line in this so-called movie was "It's a long time" OK????????? The most interesting thing about that line is that five minutes before that and did not say that he was sitting on the embankment, the child of the death would not die, as soon as he talked about becoming a child. So if he knows about this, then why does he see the earth, as soon as he sees it (that's horrible). As I said earlier, he will definitely be humorous, I do not think his laughs laugh at the UFC friends. <br /> <br /> Now I have finished that good article in the movie. <BR> I will admit that I can not remember many scenes, and it is not good that I could not see the movie fifteen minutes ago. So what I'm going to do is make the top five things wrong with this movie. 1. Usually when the horror movie monster has its own theme music, it can not be heard either by the victim or even by the giant. Then why each person involved in this movie is able to whistling this kind of Here. I thought I saw a terrific face and was not saying anything about it that he was the type of whistling. <br /> <br /> 2. Why there was a beating on a beach in the world. I'm sorry, but history is associated with beach party time and leisure type feeling to throw out. But I think this horror film thinks it's going to be such a success that it all will change. Plus it was or no one seems to be living room size on the beach. I mean every time an actor or actress wanders on the beach, it seems like they are moving in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3 Girl running gray sweat pants. That really bothered during this film. I think she's so ridiculous. Yet he can not help anybody who looks out as the youngest out of the whole team. I mean what was twelve or something like that. There is no excuse for anyone to be thin that camera. I mean the camera is not ten pounds or something, so what was the excuse? <br /> <br /> 4. The camera is trying to get record records. When I thought that there was no chesair in this movie, Goth wanted to be Brooks and he was laughing. I do not remember the whole scene, but I remember that it was not nice. This guy started singing this song about something which is not there, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the movie. The most interesting part of the whole incident is how everyone is enjoying it. I mean, the only person who does not respond to this is a "token black guy". And that's tragic because if I did not go wrong, he would encourage this recent addition to American Idol. But here it gets interesting where it is. This guy is all about his new song or whatever. At the distance we see whether Villen Ucka is very awesome. And the boy is showing off the PI ** Ed. I'm actually a moment where he looks like he's jealous of this man. So what he did about this jealousy, is good to ask you well. He waits for the person to finish the song, and then he fined the man. I do not want to give death scene, but I can tell you this. If that scene does not let you laugh then there will be nothing in this world. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was way longer than I expected. And they did not try to pull some durable twist bulls ** to waste this image for more than 10 minutes. I mean, I'll admit, I did not see the diagonal coming, but as soon as this picture is finished I hope I was involved with it. But they could not do any of their work ** t Not saying that when I say that coming, I just stopped the TV and I said ** ** It is no way that the movie can be damaged. Thanks to me for speedy trial, I can say that I will never know what is going on. But I promise that I do not care !!!!!!!!!!!! All and all movies are good for a smile, but please do not buy it. Just hype it on one of your friends and watch it at the expansion there.
