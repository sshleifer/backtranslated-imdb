One of the bad gay related movies I've ever seen is one. Since it is not the character of this story, it is difficult to comment on real movies. Therefore, because Carton Ford (Ur Glenn) keeps everyone open to keep his life open, I guess he is a game worthy of criticism. And that's not that difficult. Goes here 50 Glenn is a great time porn star who wants fame and fate as a great time singer. (I think 11 pictures make him "star") at gay and forty years of age, I have seen porn and I could not recognize him or her boyfriend. Personally they all look the same with different hair styles. That's the face, guys, he's a Jeff Stryker, Jim Lampy or Casey Donovan. That's okay, though. The purpose of these films takes place in approximately 6.5 minutes, so if you know what I mean, they all have the same requirements. <br /> <br /> So Glenn dumped pornography who wants to be a serious (legitimate) singer, but he can not take him seriously. I wonder why? Did he think that he was so stupid that he could stop his clothes and make sex in the film? And according to the movie it is not only the pornography, it is living in a house with another "star" where people can hook up through their bedrooms, bathrooms and webcams. It's 500 dollars per hour to entertain a personal party. The clothing gigs at the clothing "Hotel" optional What I said was a drug made by meth. And then when you get the balls to get angry, someone in the club tries to touch you ---- because he is now "valid". Okay! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a documentary, well considered, as pornographic porn. <br /> <br /> A Glen Hyper-Nelly Manager (Kyle) who wants to sell him as a porn participant in the hope of getting him gay. Sevenogly-routine tries to try. "Wear it" "do not smile", "tell it" how to control these things, but our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. The first mistake. I'm not saying Kyle was right, but if a rising musician starts to question the manager, they can not go a long way. Such: his own lawyer who is a fool for a client <br /> <br /> If it was not for a little bit of information, it would not have been all that bad. Drum roll, please, she's bad. She's there with her singing talented Ashlee Simpson. It's hard for someone to root - when his dream is trying to be true - at 50! --- Does not work like normal people. There is no work. Can you say lazy ass? They did not accept me. "After a few months of patronage of music and music, he said," Why do not I have any record contract now? "The actor is a waiter, no matter what the authors are at a lower-level newspaper or mag. This guy is on top, it's true, he wants his success right now because he decided that he wanted it .. Ghanchan. Whine Whine. His boyfriend left him to return to nursing But I say that I do not want that body to be treated for me, because both of them were in vain. Airheads. The movie is vain. You really do not want to stay away from the whine and the cheesey people. Do not waste your money in the painful lives of vain people, stuck your shoes down There are many more interesting things to look for.
