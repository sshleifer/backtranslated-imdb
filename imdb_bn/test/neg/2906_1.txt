This is the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I saw these frogs like Mans, Space Rebellion, and Pesticides, and I can honestly say that they did not keep a candle of science Crazed. <br /> <br /> There is no stimulating plot of science Crazed. During the time when a woman became pregnant by a Turkish barster, and the baby * born * after hours * got fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, because of being a stranger, it takes about an hour to kill him. The director continually loops the footage, and takes a fifteen minutes to set up a painful death. There is a page for dialogue for the whole film, but the conversation comes almost a minute after the conversation. <br /> <br /> Sample scene: The monster is walking down a hall. We know it because there are footage with its loop for about ten minutes. Among the loops, we are treating two women who work. Repeat advertising breaks for about 20 minutes. When the giant shows up, nobody moves away, and everyone looks like a headlight like a diamond because the monsters take another 10 minutes to kill them. By the level of acting, you will assume that people have already died. <br /> <br /> I know my description does not look very bad, but believe me, I can not fully describe the pain <br /> <br /> Stay away and carry all the videos Exclude the store. :) <br /> <br />
