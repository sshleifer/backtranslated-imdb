We are almost impossible to see this movie. With such a super-cast, the writing and direction that shame it was so awful. The exciting story that was told in the story was drug addict. The flash back back was racky. The letters were one dimensional. Heavy elephant metaphor - river, cat - is often repeated repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The film Nobody's flower was infinitely better, based on another novel by Razzo, perhaps it was more tightly written and directed. <br /> <br /> Ampiar fruit photography was beautiful. Too bad it was not a travel event. <br /> <br /> I read novels and enjoyed the writing style, but the novel was somewhat different. I'll give the novel 4 novels out of 5. Perhaps the writer and director were so surprised to see the fame of the novel that they thought that they should include every wealthy person in their movie. It was supposed to say that, in a television movie, the guys do not have tape books.
