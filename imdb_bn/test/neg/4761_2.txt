This movie is simply garbage. I said I am an expert in junk movies. I keep the rating "1" for movies, but it's funny but funny, but this film is not only tedious and of course funny, but obscure in a painful way. It gets a "2" so that you can differentiate between those who can laugh at you and those who sleep you. The scenes in this movie where the actors are watching something, their expressions are wonderful, and the wide-eyed and slow jaw tells viewers that what they are looking for is going to be amazingly amazing, it's not just a cupboard or even more deserts. It will be a very dangerous God to walk for me, I tell you, I went and so did several people.
