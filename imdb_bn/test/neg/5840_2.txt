This film is a strong commitment that anyone is capable of talking and a surefire conversation starter. 'Do you sleep with someone who dislikes or does not know for a million dollars?' If there is a lot of potential for the film, poor execution makes it a B-grade soap opera. The film has a great leadership, and after the proposal is made we are really in film, but it falls dramatically. He played the last three quarters of the movie, complained and apologized for what he did! Finally, my tears were so weird! It's a very similar premises 'honeymoon in vegas' which is a lot better. See that instead.
