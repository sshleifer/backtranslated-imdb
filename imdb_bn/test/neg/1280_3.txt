All Growth UP is more of a spin-off and original Nicholson Raggers cartoon than Tommy Puckles, Chuckie Finster, Lil and Phil Davil, Angelica, Susie, and later Kimie (Chuckie's sister) and Deal (Tamie's brother). ). I grew up with RUGRATS and it was a great cartoon. It was an excellent comic, beautiful story and show's creator, Classy and Sippo, it was very original and creative with the idea of ​​children's original objectives. The new show tries to recover all the UP UP cartoon magic. I was frustrated when I saw it. I found "All Adult Up" Chuckie is just annoying and the whole "pre-teenager-played-mature / try-to-be-popular" (unfortunately) * all of the characters * Soft and washed out. There are still some funny scenes and comedy in the new series, and it was interesting how artists will see the entire group of RUGRATS in their original ten years of age. Overall, this show is 'fair' and only accessible if a) you are a mortal fan of RUGRATS, b) have never seen the main show, c) you have nothing to do with pre-teenagers, or d) you are so annoyed that you It is compulsory to see this show in any way. This show is not that good. It does not compare to the old RUGRATS episodes in quality, humor, and everything else.
