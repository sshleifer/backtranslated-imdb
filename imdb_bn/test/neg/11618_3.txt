Oh oh! I just said that this "classic" film has a plot that stains! Well, it's true, so get over! This film was a Vanity project by Joseph P. Kennedy, in which his mistress played and money flowed to create even greater stars. Today, only a fragmentary copy exists - one that is restored a few years ago. However, if the film was in perfect shape, it could even be a stank for many reasons. And, without any audio, I have some reasons here: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson played a girl at 31 year old Convent School - perhaps 16 or 18 years old! Come on - he seems old to many children's mother. Second, this movie depends on the stupid concept of "Love at first sight". Although some people believe it, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince will drop everything on a woman who he does not know! What a lot! <br /> <br /> Third, the film is a hit and a plot nuts! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and then becomes "Whose of Queens" - and later, after the queen returning to Europe (which is convenient), the princess can get out of prison, she really finds Kelly and her marriage with him And then he becomes a true ardent country queen! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) That's almost parade as a classic! There are many good silent movies - watch them first and avoid this tripe.
