Although I am convinced that the idea sounds good on paper, and when I first heard about it, it applied to me, this movie is often almost equal and flat and when I see it, I want to finish it. The film about Lau started and ended with a problem in trouble, though I think the lengthy police department is ridiculous. However, I was thrown together for these two great comedians that the barrel script was not found to laugh little with the bottom. I thought it was wrong to keep a musical instrument and it resurrected the "Wizard of Oz" rap-off (with songs and black and white color). I will not recommend this picture to anyone, but they are posthumous and C fantasy. Anyone else will be disappointed, and they have many good movies.
