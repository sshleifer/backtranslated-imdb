Living in Edinburgh, and there is a great thirst for history, I was very close by "libertys". Dogs wrong species for a start !! Bobby Malik Old Jack was an old man, who came to Edinburgh and was found to be a victim of a death in the film because of not being a movie. Whoever is coming to Edinburgh and hopes for movie visitors, you will not find a cemetery in Princes St. Gardner !! There was a few minutes that a tissue had been great. Padding out a rather tempered script to the actors was fantastic. I do not think the poor Watermelon Bobby really got enough screen time, probably because of being "lost" at a time. All that said, the film was fine and would suffer any 8 years old.
