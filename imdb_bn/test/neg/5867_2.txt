I bought this DVD for this little boy who likes ToyStory movies. I would never have lived in the same league as the toy movies, but what I found was another lazy Disney cartoon, which I expected was more than Disney / Pixar. The story is original, character-neutral and two-dimensional, below the animation, even the buzz is not that great. The movie can be so good. I especially hate the paint by the number of stories. I know it is meant for kids, but even the kids know that there is a problem in this level. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspect of the movie, I really liked the movie opening section, the Mutant monster, it just went downhill from there.
