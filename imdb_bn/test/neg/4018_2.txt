When you use Postman always use twice in the Turn Turner ring and compare it with low budget, low talent, low quality movies, I play 'Guang' (more talk) of Id Lupino and non-piano scene. When the first non-singing scene begins and all the people look at him equally, I was positive that they would turn their eyes and at least start talking to themselves (he was frustrated, let's get out of here). The actor is flat - the emotions are deflated. And EDA is a really spoiled bi-ochch across - just a 100% turnoff. There was somewhere like Betty Boop on conscious sedation met a gas station attendant in Ville United States. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, in his chest ... there was no mind. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Probably, if the right actress was given a major role and male actors had more passion, then the film could have a chance. Sorry to insult those who came out of this world. When I left the world, I did not worry.
