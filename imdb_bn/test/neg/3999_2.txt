Psychically unsafe Tom Rasso (Asbestos Filter) has read the secret diary of his sexy wife Lisa (Courtney Lerrara) and discovered that her life's love is sleeping with clearly marked blocks; This shocking revelation closes his race and sends it to the poor Tom, and he proceeds to take bloody revenge on people who believe he is making his old lady disgusting. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really bad movies can often be really good as much fun, and any movie featuring a decapitation by the machete extended ceiling fan should never be considered completely worthless; Although Killing Spree is sometimes directed to entertain with its innovation and cheaper and delightful gore, I have found that the terrible aspects, the terrible production value, the ugly film, the uff sound, the terrible light, the undoubtedly tiring and the great story (which really is the beginning of the mobile phone To telegraph, plus a pointless junkie finale), nasty synthesizer scores, anne dialogue, and thoroughly non Esadara performer writer / director Tom from the rotor in order to serve to serve this effort has virtually experience joy.
