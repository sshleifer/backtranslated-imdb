Awesome writing, direction and acting! Writer / director portrays South, especially South Law Enforceers, who are ignorant, back-odd, homophobic and racist (a very popular, yet unconscious, stereotype, which likes film industry to last forever). Acting (or overacting) and writing amateur and came across as a low budget. Plot line is the story of the Old Stall Hollywood of Ol Racist and Homophobic Redneck, which is ultimately defeated by "New York City" by the Enlightened People. <br /> <br /> I went to small Louisiana town where the film was portrayed and was looking forward to seeing the film but quickly disappointed within the first few minutes of the film. At the beginning of the film a gay bar located in Louisiana's "building" is featured. How a ridiculous idea! There are plenty of gay and gay bars in South Louisiana, but there are no gay bars in the Louisiana "buildings" or small towns. Then we are known to the sheriff who used the word "homo-sex" in the worst south drill and sometimes overdone performance. Then the police at the police station are watching the local police. I could go on and about the awesome Chess acting or staleotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his crew are welcomed to this small friendly city and shown true Southern hospitality. Leicher Arthur was humiliated and humiliated only for the final edict of the city and Louisiana state. Lake Arthur's good people were excited and "Hollywood" became obsessed with the city, because at the end they did not know that they would be portrayed as an anonymous, racist and homophobic country Bompin in the low-budget amateur movie that went straight to the DVD. My suggestion: Avoid this or see the signmax at night if it spins them.
