Mad Scientist professor Tabani sowed seeds in his laboratory but instead turned into a blood-beginner vampire. Dr. When Akil gave a visit to see pictures of Tabani Akil's wife Shabnam, and after making Achille a vampire, she named her as his bride. Akil's brother discovers Tabani's castle and his brother's grave and kills his brother with a knife to release his own soul. Tabani succeeded to bite on Shabnam and once he tried to rear his young man, there was a rivalry against Akil's brother to stop the nephew's curse. "Zinda Lash" almost kept me asleep. Although the plot is very slow but less or less following the famous novel of the brom sticker. Suspense is completely absent in pregnancy and nudity. This film is only recommended for the horror fans who want to see the second horror movie made in Pakistan (after "Madman" since 1964).
