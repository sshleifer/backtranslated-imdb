Have you found the title funny? Oh, do not you? Well as you are excited. Learn to laugh because you are not laughing, you are not alive So please believe your belief is least fun to have children. Now you find it funny? Not yet ?! All right, because you have fulfilled yourself and are easily offended. If you do not laugh, you will not live. And if you do not like me then send me hate mail so that I can write another review and I can get a hate mail and try to make it feel like I'm a bad ass. Are you still laughing my headline? Not yet?!?! That's okay! You are a racist! If you laugh or otherwise you are a racist. Why do not you laugh Oh, that's not funny !? No, why not be it. So it's like I'd be funny !! Smile smile! Thanks !!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdu !! Please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, that's it. Where is my notepad and pen? And where is my Richard Pair DVD? I have to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> and ...... scene. Thank you, thank you. <br /> <br /> It's basically you'll get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please make a favor on your behalf and change the channel while this left show arrives. Even basic cable channels have this thing like 100x. I'm not saying that because I hate him. I'm for real This show is like looking to grow grass. Not sure if at least grass steals the joke. I'm honestly trying to save you time. I even tried to watch her show. I told myself "maybe she is not bad". But no, he When I saw his show I completely out of the area. I tried to collect myself at the break and I paid attention to the show, but I could not. I screamed again, I think I was thinking about remaking my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks more interesting. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my final thought - In addition to 30 minutes you can do a lot, this person can not shout nothing for half an hour. Do not see a show that tries to fool your face with colorless racism. I can support enemies who try to ease the tensions of the nation, but this person provides more racism instead of just stopping it.
