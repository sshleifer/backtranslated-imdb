Above all, try to see five pictures of universal "Mummy" movies, not so much for continuation of movies, but for its very clear lack. Of course, the main Boris Karloff classic "The Mummy" should not be mentioned as the true "Sixes" as well as the same breath, which is closed just like all camps or cultures. This time around, it has been revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Anakara have come to the United States. And again, your eyes deceived you, Khiri Mummy did not really die for "Mummy's Tomb", but for the second time to find alive and her lost love prince Anakya, with the help of decorated notched leaves brewed during the full moon cycle. To complete myth, Kharis needed a caretaker, who was filled with Youssef Bay by John Carradine, and gave the job of George Zucker, the High Priest of Arkan, Jordan Jukor and Osborne. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Anak will be brought back to their final resting place in the mountains of Arkan in Egypt. But as we have seen before, the responsibility of the high priest's duty is to ensure the end of failure, the character of Caracrine has fallen for the rebirth of Anaak Mansouri (Ramsey Ames). Yusuf Bee was surprised to see and hit a huge Ameni in POED bandaged. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, both "grave" and "curse", Lone Chaney Mammy depicted helplessly across her chest with a long right hand. When he faces disappointed Amina, he raises both sides without any problems; As soon as he returned to his again disabled position in his right hand down his right hand. <br /> <br /> The most notable of the end of the film - gets the giant girl! But this is a short victory, such as Mummy and her abducted bride leaning toward a satisfied grave, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled - "Those who deny the will of the ancient god, their fate is a cruel and violent death".
