The fundamental foundation of this movie is that everybody in the world knows that a man without a person is gay. And the person who likes the show show, has a good taste, and the appearance is obvious that it must be gay. Yes, the film is fun to be part of, but the fundamental foundation is homophobic and humiliating that the whole film was floating in something which is quite painful. Performance, especially Joan Cusack and Kevin Kline are very good.
