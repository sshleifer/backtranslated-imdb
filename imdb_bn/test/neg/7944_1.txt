Because I do not think I need to outline the plot for you, because the site and other users have already done a fantastic job. Who said, take me here. It's by 2005's worst movies, and some really, really bad ones have been. I do not have to break anything about this image because even the details will not go. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects-you name it. It sometimes does not stand alone as the worst movie created, it is tied with some other piece of crap. I'd be embarrassed to know my friends in this movie. But hey, most people who are going to see it will not do anything to their opinion, so too much energy. Do not blame me if your nights look harmful in your nerves in the evening.
