I saw this picture in the movie theater. I was taking classes in the second city of Chicago and certainly the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a woodwork film among the negative boys of the second city. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about John's history. Everyone knew how he died. Some people knew that lover Impov or comedy can not be especially friendly to women. <br /> <br /> But hey. Man led his life and loved them deeply by those who were in his world, and Laur also said that he treated his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well Unfortunately, Michael Cycliches (who really is a great actor) have forgotten the idea, really are in bad movies, and really only open the person to make a disguise. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not achieve any rights to Baluishi ... and SNL scenes have never happened to be portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Woodward's work does not follow this half-story historical information Bob. Kinda says, okay ... we are clinging to Belusi ... now let Woodward go ... "They also decide it ahead of a wonderful life and it turns into a terrible life of the crack. <br /> <br /> She What a guardian angel or devil? Pinball machine is Satan's assistant electronic device ... How many different tasks can you do in a movie? It's a movie in the end ... it's a Look at him with the word and go into unbelief in disbelief "What was that ?!" Some circles have turned into a kinda goddess classical. But for good reasons <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a ritual movie is good And most people will not see them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see some classic bad 80 stone stone stones? If you want to know about John Balushi ... you can get more information outside the City of Chicago than the second city.
