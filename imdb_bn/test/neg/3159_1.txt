Okay, what do you think about a "learning" and "informative" show like Hippies probably "burn"? Well, there are so many hatreds against me for these reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that being a personality and personality is immoral. The show has no personality. Everyone likewise dressed, likewise talked, acted in the same way and danced in the same way. Even in the "Being a person" mountain, the children try to tell Barney what they like, and everybody on the planet should do whatever I like. Do you want to teach your child that a person is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. "A Stranger Friend Friend, You Are Not Made Too" Episode. Quite ruthless, the show's producers soon rush that it can be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, many young Barney-lovers from the United States were victims of Pyodiophil, who used the show's friendly message to raise children from their parents. This episode is drawn, but it has been damaged. The "innocent" mistake in the programming is called, such, clearly show why parents need to watch television with their kids. <br /> <br /> 3 If you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. Nobody shows emotion but happiness, in no case does he have any condition. For some reason if the child's parents get mad or get saddened, then the child can think Mami or Daddy differently. No good messages. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic is the solution to everything! It seems that every problem is solved by magic. At least like "Froggle Rock" sounds, it teaches us that magic can backfire it to solve your own problems best. Barney does not teach this? Not certainly not. There's magic to be there. And the problem is that the two-year-old can not imagine from many realities and it seems that their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but they are confused when they can not use magic. They think weird Another sister pulled again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no difference between the theft and sharing. He even said in particular that "if a crusher does not think it is okay to steal it". Children know that if you really want something, it is a perfectly acceptable way to steal. It is not something that the preschoolers need for the statistics of the authorities to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I have the right things, then I can solve all my problems." When the kids have a problem, Barney lets them solve any problem. Send the message here "Do not try to figure it out! It's too much work, and probably the solution will not work." For this reason, children may stop thinking about things (Barney said it was too much work) and became dependent on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) This is probably a good message for Barney Marketing, but it is not good for the preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. Fraud that message is OK. In another episode the children are involved in a competition without carrying a sugar on a spoon without dropping. A baby keeps peanut butter on her spoon, and easily wins. The child is then rewarded for his creative thoughts, when the child actually rules the rules, and changes the game so that he can win. It's good to cheat, you win and people think that you are often disinterested in creative, real life, often disqualified, or bad, and disagreeably dislike other competitors. <br /> <br /> 8. Does this show kids do not eat anything other than cakes, cookies and candy? Despite the so-called "health food" song of Berne, it is okay to eat junk food and eat healthy meals. Apart from that, everyone ate sounds junk food. There are many kids in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Use "magic". Barney could do that, but instead decided to use it that A was the best for the marketers and B) took the lowest time and money for the scripts. This is a great reaction that shows how much the Lyons Group is actually concerned about the children. <br /> <br /> This is my revenge for you.
