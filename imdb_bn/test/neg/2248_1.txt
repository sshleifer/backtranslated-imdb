This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans entered into France under Nazi occupation and started killing the Germans. You see their enemies scalping and beat their death with baseball bat. <br /> <br /> Some people will say that this movie is a certain parody parody. For a parody, it's funny not funny. The content is zero. It is extremely brutal and disgusting. Below is a delicate political message false, because it again "good guys" kill "bad nag". The whole plot is steady if you turn it on. Can you imagine the story where the Nazis (during the making of jokes) all die in the Warsaw Gateto with Flaththowers? Probably not, but this film is exactly the exception that satisfies the strange moral expectations of a particular audience: It is very quiet to kill people by right people. <br /> <br /> This movie only works because under the hidden Nazi ideology. It does not count the enemy as humans. And if the next is considered to be fun stuff, then I'm glad to say that this kind of fun is always mystery. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate Americans; A nudity of the crowd will be wounded when the crowd. But if the nude body is pornography, this film is very bad pornography with its cruelty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
