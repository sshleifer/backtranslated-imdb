I'm definitely frustrated so I will be short and your time will not be lost. First off, the plot was uninspired ... at least. It was worse than the animation, we achieved God's reputation for 2008 and it looked like a bright version of GIJO. I will not even be disturbed by characterizing the performance and dialogue of actors. Or maybe I'll see because I saw here that you need 10 lines (?! ?? !!!) to post a comment here Where are we? Oh yes performance, well it was completely flat, lack of passion and talent if I excused. Now for the conversation, just acting, no memorable quote, nobody would expect that nothing. Let's hope the movie will be good ... at least
