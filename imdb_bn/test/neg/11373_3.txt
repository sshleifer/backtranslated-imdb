I got 3 ratings out of 10. <br /> <br /> And sadly, I have created a point to find film schedules for that channel so that I do not want to see it. I wanted to watch this movie because it was based on a book by my favorite writer Barbara Wilson. As a homosexual, I want to like this picture. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Mrs. Wilson felt about the film, but I got a big disappointment. It should have been curious - it was a mystery in Spain and the main character, Kassandra, is a language translator who is contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who is her former husband. <br /> <br / > <br /> Many hidden mysteries have been uncovered, but for some reason it is not a matter. It was, oh, so what? I may not be involved with these characters or come to take care of them, or think for them. I could not even identify with this letter. <br /> <br /> I think the main role of the actress was a large part of the film's failure. She looked old, tired, worn out, and damp as dishwater. Her hair was a perpetual mess, her violet cloth was boring, and she was not just interesting or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film was listening to a Dean Martin recording, but even that was destroyed by the song's dance and lip-syncing, by wearing a weird make-up. Believe it - it was nothing like the handsome beautiful Mr Martyn. <br /> <br /> The last page will be so syrupy that you want to take some pancakes with syrup. <br /> <br />
