Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckert played in a "romantic" drama about a hot-headed Chef playing a Jata-Jones, who ended up carrying her niece when her sister died in a car crash. He stood outside while taking care of family matters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was wondering if anyone thought Jeta-Jones's character would be so impossible Wants She becomes so emotional with cooking and what she does cooking for her therapist or talking about food. Disgust I think that many puns will not be used in any of that. I could not finish it.
