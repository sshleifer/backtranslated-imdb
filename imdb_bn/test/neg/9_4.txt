David Bryce's comments are often well written and informative as often I think about Darling Lily. This huge musical instrument is so weird and flew, it has been produced and could be the cause of breakdown in the paramount in the 1970s. It costs 22 million dollars! That's just illegal. Darling said that LILI will be green from a board meeting "Hey that we got that Pin Panther guy and the music eagle sound ... get this too" and handing over a blank check. The result is Jigi, JPPline, a hybrid of half the six numbers, some MGM 40 songs and a style (Daisies and Boaters!). So frustratingly like the musical clutches and the old metaphors like old drama plays. The production is amazing, delightful, exciting, but the rest: Humorous romance, Julie has shown, Hudson is already dead, disrespectful comedy, and surprisingly annoying songs have provoked this spectacular movie. Lily is like a TiVe to spice up with some weird bit like the 1940s mega musicals. Star! Unfortunately, the year was released before the disaster and now finally praised for the excellent movie ... And Andrews is fantastic, mature, especially in the last half hour ... It seems but LILI POPIN and DOLLY FRILLI and I Believe that the seeds of the Mega Musical Seed of the 60's have been killed ... and Andrews again looked like Poppins ... which I believe Edwards did not mean. When they saw it, it was jointly frustrated: and $ 22 million in Catholic view of 22 million dollars, and a clear day of $ 12 million and $ 25 million depicted your wagon .... Their financial instability was $ 77 million in the clopatore ratio. Tagged in 4 films with uncertain prediction. Perhaps they should ask DAY DEEPLEGAMBOL on a clear day ...... LILI was very popular in Australia's first War of Liberation and ran for 70 mm in a number of months, but it always subscribed and failed to stick and failed once. One night that surfaced after Sunday night stood with a clear day as a double. Thanks, Paramount has captured the story of their $ 1 million (yes, one million dollars) film love story and $ 4 million gangster film, which is ready for $ 77 million in recovery for just $ 5 million in the next two years. Incredible!
