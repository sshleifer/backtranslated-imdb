The chip is a wonderful talent and the end result of the project is really amazing. Co-host is not a good job. I especially enjoy watching "project" come together. After today's mechanical and cosmetic progression, assembly results are closed, the end result is much better. However, I think the "project" is already rich and / or famous property to get a bit annoying. It is very bad that those who can promise to get reinstatement can carry. Let's see, Madeleine Cruz's Vince Neil made a car for his friend. Hello! If he (Neel) was a true friend, he used to pay for the recovery of his friend's car. What a joke! Another episode shows the girl doing seemingly good work in a middle age, completing her body '56 body named Betsy. 30+ year old husband was behind her. The couple looked like there was a little short supply. What a shame I think the people of lunch will live for days like me that will never come. I would be the owner of a '53 Ford Project Chip. Will anyone choose me?
