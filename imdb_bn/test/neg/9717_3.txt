At the end of 16 people, a group of four young men, an honorable private school affiliated with an old agreement established by their ancestors during the drowning victims Each of them has the power that they use when they are age, and they suspect that a new child may be from a family that died many years ago. This new man wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror film because it tries to present itself. Yes, there are magic and all the occult elements, but it's really an action movie. A very middle-class movie. There are lots of sadly unused rooms for interesting twists, which are almost cold and sticky and focusing only on giving only small attention to the plot. But if you do not have more than half of the movie, you know what it is and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, especially an explosive car which is magically reconstructed after collision with a big rig, but that's about it. The worse thing is, director Ronnie Harlin, who does not have smart movies for his credit, has some fun, he relies heavily on metal music and too sexy to carry the film, and as a result it is probably dangerous "alone in the dark". It's not as bad as "album in the dark" because some sticky scenes are not really sticky and ludicrously incompatible, but eventually this image can look forward to a beautiful and comfortable home for late night cables. 3/10 <br /> <br /> rated PG-13: Violent Action
