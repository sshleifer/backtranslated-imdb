This is the worst movie I've seen most. Over 85 hours of fairly bad acting, (horror being suffocated from Aspsar syndrome), scary wigs, strange makeup (including tide around the wig area) and holier than dialogue which you want to dialogue with vowels with holier than your characters. A ridiculous view of this movie, if you are patient to see it, change the shocking numbers of clothing costumes that are visible from the scene view of the scene - this film was supported by a catalog manufacturer of the frustrating pestle casual wear? The money was given for the sake of their efforts? They certainly did not deserve to pay with anything else! Delivering a brutal plot in the first half of this terrible effort of a movie, later similarly confused with the Christian Biblical Faith. The whole cast and production team should be captured or rarely burned by crucifixion!
