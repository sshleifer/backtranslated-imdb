This movie just stunk. I know that some people will say that nobody thinks it is good "Not only does this get it." I like American friends and designer wings. But this is the whole drake. The main character is so annoying that I can not take care of what I can. He has been asked to review another bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. I just can not force myself to stand or take care of him. This is just enough for most of the characters, which seems to be very difficult or strange. I like Mel Gibson's character and matching Jovvitch characters and they want to pay more attention to them. Mila is definitely beautiful, kind and you really feel for him and for how he is walking and why he is in that way. I can see Gibson's character almost like Frankenstein. I just wanted to save Mila and put it in the hotel with all the nonsense boring characters in the hotel. Match rating 10 movie rating 0
