This presentation of the popular children's story in the film is very kind to see. I know it's one of the first movies of moviemaking, but this 15-minute image is unknown and badly shot. "The Great Train Rabby" (1903), which I commented on, it is more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We can see a cow of a long-haired jack (2 men in a cow) from a merchant to a heart bed and then a beetle that throws them in his mother's garden (I I think the poor Jack has achieved the wrong kind). Jack's dream of a hunch (actually it seems to be a chicken) and the golden egg and next day the stalks in heaven climb. <br /> <br /> There is no effort to become creative in this picture. The stalk looks like a rope, like a leaf, the giant is not only unusually bigger than a tall bearded man and Jack, and when compared to Jack, Jack escapes with a poultry and his golden egg comes from a screenshot in place of a stuffed dummy giant and then The actor took his place - an exaggerated death dance like early movies He is on top of the foot. Benstic (leaf-covered rope) is coming from the top and the giant forehead coils neatly. <br /> <br /> See something else.
