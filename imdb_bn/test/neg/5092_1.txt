Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... what !? This movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason is that Kiefer fans on the cover of Kifa Sutherland are sold, only have their hearts broken. He killed a person, died firing and died halfway before the movie, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then he disappeared till the point where he died ... Why does his character cover blossoms? . Where is the EPIC war scenes promised before the cover? 3. It was very confusing, what do I mean with the girl? He forced the film to draw our attention, he failed! 4. If Kaifa dies in a movie ... it fails. Now I'm going to go 24. The movie fails!
