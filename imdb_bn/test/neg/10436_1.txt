This movie is labeled as Comedy on Good Human Man's latest DVD release. It is rarely about a comedy, rather a group harmed in a harmful indie film. Set in approximately 70, with too much muted color correction taking its place, there is little attention to detail over time. The exclusive soundtrack only helps to strengthen the film's repetition (perhaps it's the point, but it does not enjoy watching the experience). Approximately, the movement of the victims is just like jumping into a position. It seems like packaging movies as a comedy, which is meant to deceive people to rent or buy this movie, which is a waste of time all the time.
