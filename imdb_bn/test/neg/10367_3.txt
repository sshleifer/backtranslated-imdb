This one and the earlier "Toulon Revenge" and the next seems completely different from the first two films where the dolls were not so beautiful. It basically selects your series, the first two go together and the doll is drawn as a killer, but the next three are a good series between them. These three parts play as much as some cheesy television series episodes as well and I was not really trying to see the part five of the series and see. Basically, a child gets a doll when some strange dark lord or something sends his deadly puppet to kill, this dark lord looks like one of the living things, like Ultraman. It is over before the movie ends, but you will get credit because it is not too painful to watch the movie. It seems to be okay for many plot holes and things only for it. If you see a person playing the last movie toulon then still you have a very anti-clash of war, and the movie has ended before it really starts.
