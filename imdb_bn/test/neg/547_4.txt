I found this to be a great disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the whole acting was quite good. Reginald Owen, as mentioned by others, did visible champ, but I found it moderately amusing in its short sight. TCM has created an Anne Harding fan about me, and I was fine here as usual. Jesse was on a field like Ralph's old battlefield, to order everyone, Frank Morgan, always starring Frank Morgan with a twinkle. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was the script and / or editing - the deviation was painful, the motivation was lazy. The film was too short to publish the story correctly! I felt completely left down, especially since I had such loving memories of the next version.
