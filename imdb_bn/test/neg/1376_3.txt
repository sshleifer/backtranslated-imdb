<br /> <br /> I became a fan in Menacea but this event does not do much for me. Occasionally he will say or do something to bring to shine, but his hunger is restless and completely destroyed. <br /> <br /> I always thought that he was funny because he was angry. That is not widely used in this TV series. Instead, she just smug I guess its comedy seems so funny: when she is not in the correct mode of delivery, she is unaware and reluctant. I sometimes walk into his show sometimes, but in most cases he laughs laughing, and it does not match well with him. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion
