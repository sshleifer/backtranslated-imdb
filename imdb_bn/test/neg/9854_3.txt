I'm going to be some fun with this series, some dynamic plot and a series of action with great performance. I was roasted. Although I like Jamie Denton, this event is not very valuable, unless you see some people brutally and the actions of agents are supposed to be according to the theme of "National Security". This event is widely publicized for the present government, and publishes genomesism, although we talk everyday After a few episodes, it was boring to me, and instead I started watching the rebels of the house invaders in BBC Amarkaria. Rather see CSI without a doubt and without a trace.
