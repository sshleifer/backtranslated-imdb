I loved gorgeous Greek scenes but the story, which you can not follow anyhow, was even harder to follow in the movie. If I can not read the book, I can not imagine how anyone who sees the film can be involved in it, and then like me, they would probably think why the Australian Allison became French and many other unexpected changes in the story. The book's mysteries started to go away or to the movie. I saw it when it came first and had the same problem, since I read the book several times. I recently saw my grandmother (very intelligent and generally I like movies at the age of 20) who were mostly surprised by Michael Kine and Kandes Burgen, but otherwise it can not imagine why anyone might see it except the scene.
