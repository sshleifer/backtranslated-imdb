Compared to recent Gork Flick hostels, this movie reminds me a lot - I would say that no recession is a little good but not much. A very complex plot involves some criminals who are sent to clean a cooking hotel in a small jail. Children who are soon finished to be killed by their lasting religious psychology are cleaning their sins (I guess). I was pretty scared to see that it saw a WWE wrestler, who bought it. He is doing a decent job considering only two sound lines in the film. A couple is a fairly good moment, mainly an eyeball and a pretty memorable scene where a girl gets a cellphone touching her neck - perhaps the most effective death of the movie. <br /> This movie does not really show us anything new and certainly far from the fantastic. It can not recommend.
