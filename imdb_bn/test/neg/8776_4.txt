I liked this movie after the first movie was released (but I was only 12 years old - and I forgot the movie that one day I found a used copy for sale at gas station. I bought it and I could not wait to see this picture For what I liked as a kid, and when I saw this picture many years later, I got hurt ... why in this world I love this picture as a child, seeing it as an adult, I have realized that this film is terrible. The most tragic part of this movie is that they had everything for the creation of the greatest Western of all time and they blown it out !!! Clothing is perfect, good actor, Archershire score 2 music score Wonderful and old duration Lone RA ZaZer keeps the classic spirit alive, the second score is a series of songs by country music artist Marl Haggard and Stuttler Brothers and songs such as "The Man in the Mask" are so bad that they are funny, this movie is a brilliant storyline, and the best one in the West ern Plots are sometimes, and for a while after John Reid's health care, he and his colleagues, Rangers Hah La after it found the joke. Her new life and Lone Ranger have been fascinated by her identity, and her brother and her colleague Ranger, who takes revenge for the gang to be held responsible for traveling with them. But unfortunately, it is a story as well, all of what it was destroyed by Merrill Haggard describes what you are seeing (as they did for love for God?) Marl Haggard's description and stupid Brothers song stupid (stupid) "Raid little cowboy" songs Playing in the background is impossible to take this film seriously. I would like to see a really good producer with this same script and story, and this movie is re-fixed because the heart of this silly film is a wonderful western .--- I'm the ugliest costume given to this photo as a beautiful women's clothing. I can give 4 stars to your 12-year-old 4 stars and you do not know well, you may like it.
