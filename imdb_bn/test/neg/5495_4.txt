I really liked it in this movie - it gave a title to the movie festival early in the year, and played an all star. But (and you might say there was a "but" coming) it's a film failure. The extraordinary character played by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by the editing and supporting cast antics. Turturro's performance is poor, and most of the comedy is overplayed. Repetition doll shows pointless, and some scenes are completely place. <br /> <br /> That said, the film has sprinkled some nice moments. A really sensitive moment, some of the most tempting and comedy colors really work. Unfortunately, they're overshadowed by diffuse, incoherent scripts and some bad acting.
