I saw myself an animator and around the media, when I saw this movie in $ 5, I think it's a shot price to add to my collection. Although I'm never sorry to add a new addition to my animation library, this picture is definitely frustrating. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of possibilities in the premises. A penguin named Hubei finds a suitable creature to give a girl rich in trunk as a trumpet but before she can give it to her, she is thrown by an evil rival and lost in the sea. Then he made friends with another penguin, who helped him find his way. That set up is not great but it might be a fun adventure enough to set up. Unfortunately the exploitation of two really does not amount to a lot and it all gets pretty repetition. In most cases, they find themselves among themselves, they are really vague and lacking in creativity ... and the relationship between them is both chessy and forced forced. <br /> <br /> Animation is good but not standard to Don Bluth's normal. This guy told us about the secret, role, and an American story of Neem, which gave all the attention to detail, which has often overwhelmed Disney's Animation's GrandDD Disney. This is not a great deal beyond high-end TV fair. <br /> <br /> The music is okay but quite forgotten and voice actors are all the spoiled talents ... Martin Short is a straight man direct through the whole movie, despite the conversation as Bamlar who is particularly spoiled here as the main character. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
