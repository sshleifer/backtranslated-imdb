I know rather inappropriate than commenting on a movie without a piece - but I'm going anyway! I wait for a smile, I try to give it time. I think it's enough for a romantic comedy for 20 minutes. My smile never came, so I left it <br /> <br /> It's a fool, so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It's not that high grade is nowhere near. Let me fix it, it's just stupid * - Not a fool's humor. They might be intended to be fun in some scenes, but they were not. I think, if you are really annoyed then you can mix film with hallucinations in some way and end up with a modest recreational experience. <br /> <br /> A very unfortunate attempt.
