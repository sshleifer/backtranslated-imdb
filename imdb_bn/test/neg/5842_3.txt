Mind-numbingly annoying, completely anticipated and ultimately ridiculous. That's mostly suggested to encourage disaster. The whole thing started with a decent premises just unravels and becomes a complete mess. Basically the story blows the question, "Do you let your wife sleep with other people for a million dollars?" Here the answer is definitely yes because otherwise we will not have a movie. If we did not get the movie then it would have been good. <br /> <br /> We are married by (and financially annoyed) couple Woody Harrison and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes, that'll work. However, a millionaire operated by Robert Redford, liked his wife and offered millions of dollars. He gives them financial protection for one night with his wife. That night, the film is really all that night. Unfortunately there is nothing at least bit entertaining in the near future. The script is so predictable that you can tell lines of letters before them. Performance leave a lot to be desired. Harrelson will be good off sticking to the comedy as this attempt to critically miss this mission completely. Tears are not something that he thinks capable of illustrating. And for Demi Moore Academy Awards, it's pretty safe to not have to clean up the space in her house. Why is he a movie star again? A part that should be full of emotions, he conveys to anyone. Only Redford mostly escapes unscathed. She is definitely slimy yet suave and definitely the best actors in the bunch. But he can not save this image. Horror scripts, lazy acting, rural speed, zero entertainment ... The obscure offer is terrible terrible.
