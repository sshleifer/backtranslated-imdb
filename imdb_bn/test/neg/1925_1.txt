An empty young cast tries to adjust to a tricky comedy and an insightful play that is destroyed in this empty, Mecca, manipulative film. The plot continues so slowly that the 90-minute characters seem impossible because the characters simply measured and watched. This dialogue is filled with hanging clich√©s and fate-cookie efforts on pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film has become just blame on the dynamic and deeper aspect of life and love. The only real weight burden is that they are forced to carry the gifted cast as well. But, never fear - they are held by the contract strings of the plot of the plot.
