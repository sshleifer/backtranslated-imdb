Lois Weber's film was "Haipokites" and still a very brave and courageous movie. I've enjoyed it and it is very influenced by filming and storytelling. The priest tried to see the hypocrisy of the man in his church and to show them the "naked" truth. When people express the authenticity of the nude image portraying the truth, people are scared and fail to guide them, and a few go a step further. People do not want to face the fact that they make some mistakes, but it shows that they have put things in front of God, doing inappropriate work on the beach, their material means, and other things that people in our world are not morally right. In the end, if a follower fails to gain, he must enter the gates of heaven. This film seems to me very brave, because a nude woman has been shown across it, especially considering the duration of this movie. I found incredible imagery and symbols in this movie. They reverse nude women and display many creativity and art using nude women by symbolizing naked truth. They showed people's sin on their way down the road and refused to follow along the way; each was a great way to represent today's people with various excuses, hazards, and / or higher priorities. This image does a very good job of receiving moral messages across its audience. Lois Weber is a great way to attract the attention of its visitors through its creativity, emotions, visibility and audience. Even the piano music across this film is very nice and suitable with the full theme.
