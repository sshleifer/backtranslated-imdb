I just will not get this review! I think they can not think of writing the type of LOG fan which they will worship anything they question about whether they really are good. <br /> <br /> I was a huge fan of this program but thought that this picture was an unmatched project. I could forgive the sunny plot if I laugh twice outside the movie. At one point, I thought it might have happened before me that any smile was being dug from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I did not expect too much of a plot (very few TV comedies have stood for more than 90 minutes) but thought that classic LOG dialogue or visual joke (at the beginning of each program) will carry an intimate movie. Five minutes after the plot of 17th Century, I was begging to finish (I do not know that it will bear for the rest of the part). It was not just fun. <br /> <br /> I was just very frustrated and could not remember history as very kind, even some mortal fans could write warm reviews.
