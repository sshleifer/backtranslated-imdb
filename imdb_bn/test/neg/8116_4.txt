I admit, even though I'm ashamed, as an emotional young teenager, this low-profile film was one of my favorite movies all the time. Even after the first nine years of Stephen King's horror story I have come to my senses and I can now freely assess the work of the freezer kayyar. In fact the story of a small Nebraska farmer community is a bona fide story of a young demon missionary boy and his sad sadky is really annoying on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show for celluloid. Most of the results can be the reason that this case often leads to a hacker-slash show at the beginning of the film, and then makes the finale a nightmare for a special effect. <br /> <br /> Cast is reasonable, but they can express as much credibility as this incredible, the top movie will allow them, and Sparkyck is more than Jonathon Illusion's soundtrack photo. <br /> <br /> A real shame that short stories of George Goldsmith's screenplay Stephen King's hunting turned into a sudden horror. Isaac, Malachai and all other "chickens" are not really awesome. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
