In another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-DVD DVD set called "Movie Who Kick Butt", but it seems to promise an action role Shannon Twidd on its original cover. In fact, during most of the films, Tvad manages the white and cheerful female character, which should be rescued by male leadership and even when trained in the jungle war, he has to drag him around! A female rebel is a strong character, but she is mostly kept in the margins of the movie. Male leader Reb Brown, and there are some of them (oddly, I think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocute). The action scenes have been poorly operated and played poorly: Some stuntmen need some lessons in "how to shoot and certainly die". I think if you are in the right mood, then you can find some things in the "firing line" (at one point, we can hear the tvd speakers but his lips are not running!), But most of the time I am just bored.
