I've heard this new bird flu in the last three years, killing dozens of people in Southeast Asia. Apparently it is a very infectious thing to transform thread threads and millions of people are being wiped out in a global epidemic. Just thought that if I do not get a round for writing your wish, then I will mention this. <br /> <br /> I also thought that I saw something called carrier today, which was not 'not about naval warfare but a scene that openedBREAK and opened a cross with an episode of X files I saw many years ago. After thinking about the dangers caused by bird flu, I thought I would look at the extra resonance, but after not opening the opening, the carrier is cheaper and ridiculous like TVM and other TVMs you can see the main characters are women, of which a powerful authority Image, another lead female mother of small children. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the cervix on the face of the nurse and the very impressive Joe Walker is walking down the stunt, but These bits quickly forget because the mood family fell in love with this - and only made any other TVM - was originally made for a female audience.
