I heard that this move was compiled by a bunch of high school students. It's not too bad as a high school industry or theater project. You did not live with the militants in seventy years or anyone involved in the filmmaking did not know, but it is quite awful. Most actors are not definitely the actors, but the local volunteers. Bob Wilkins (Auckland's KTV shows the original host of animal features, but only for one minute). Some stops on the giant effect are done with a man in stop motion animation and a giant suit and each task has its own right, but there is no continuity between the two. Without seeing the dialog, you would guess that the movie had 2 monsters. I guess the most unsupported aspect is that even the original characters, which I suppose, the children can not even play behind the movie. These children must be involved in the theater if they want to do this project, but they show zero trustworthy emotions in front of the camera.
