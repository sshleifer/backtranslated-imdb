I'm looking at a pattern here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, but if you go to IMDb.com then there will be lovers of movie lovers, but it was chosen on TV shows because it was very bad. I'm sorry but a little limited scientific film about rocketship X-M, which intensifies the reality. Well, in this case, with the knowledge of the 1950s, I could write for some paragraphs even if the film is not completely faulty. Gravity may be the first obvious observation, or MST3 has been a skit "selective gravity", how did they know when they were at risk of their death and they stood out looking at the window, the shoe would not overtake the scene that impacted below? I think they started with good intentions and it went on to raise budgets or something but I think this film is just as simple as the bottom cheese. Compare it to "Cast World's Claude" which was released in 1951, where the film was transferred, there is no comparison. The film can be 2 or 3 on its own, it's not even funny to keep an eye on yourself. It gets about 5 or 6 as an MST3K episode because it does not have any work or fun, just bad, bad, bad, oh I mentioned, it's bad.
