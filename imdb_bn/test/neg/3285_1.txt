It's easily the worst, the most aggressive part of the furor on TV. I want to completely ignore it but Fox has stuck on their Sunday lineup, I have emphasized to see American parents and other family singers. Dean-headed male star guy is the least initiated, unfortunate excuse for any human being seen on TV. Nothing about the show is remote, and many things have already been done and it has been very good by other folks. <br /> <br /> It is clear that their strategy runs on Sunday and deeply and deeply and strictly. Someone started to like it ... but I need to break it down at Fox, the wrong hole. This scam does not work on me - I only see elsewhere - but let's break you in the bone, this shocking scary SUCKS, and it gets worse than the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup. <br /> <br /> The latest development for this steaming pill?
