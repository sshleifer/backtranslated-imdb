What a movie is a nuclear bomb. The story goes somewhere and does not come fron somewhere. It says together with the theater gear, "this is it". What happened in redford He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks he can show up on the set and create some scenes and it is an acceptable one. Wrong What a stupid film? I do not mean to be so cruel, but what a movie is a crap. Incredible amateur shit. If I had lived in this movie then I would be ashamed that I would not show my face. I'm telling you, if I was involved with this movie, then I'm in big trouble. In the filming history, this movie will be considered as the king of the bombing, with whom all others will be compared.
