Even the plot is not original. Hmm There were several cones that were quite interesting, but this film follows the 90% Hollywood movie path. Most of the time, Samuel Jackson's performances are not available in most of his other films, but he was even better at this film. She was very annoying and went further instead of one more "back to your face angry" in her character. I like Eva Mendes - naturally - and even though she is a big eye candy, she proves too much for herself as an actress. Lewis Gujman was really good, except at the end of the film I did not like the change of character to Samuel Jackson. How does a former police hate disguise the character of the surroundings and then in a split second, the lollipop can become land? Is there any basic ideas left in Hollywood?
