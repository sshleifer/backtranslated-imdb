This review contains spoilers. I did not have any expectations about this movie. I stopped the video store rack with the movie "Video White Noise". <br /> <br /> First of all, it's about 5 minutes in the film's credits. Pence is slooooow from the beginning. The main heroes do not like to wear bra and the director feels frustrated, as Anna Pukin came down from the stairs. If you like movies for boobies, this is a low level buzz factor. <br /> <br /> Second, movie lovers and other awesome genre mechanics rips off the material, but good movies, there are at least some reasonable or consistent illogical behavior. This stinker has tried to establish some ideas of modernity and reality but then you have situations where someone has potentially discovered a braces trove of potential forensic evidence, and another detailed booklet of another old booklet is spelled nicely like Buffy's ceremony. I was waiting to see Miles and how to give advice on how to kill a certain monster. <br /> <br /> This concept is possible to open the dark age where crawling on the roof of the animal can cut your throat or make the skin adhesive effect on you. Hmm To do this, you must have a strong circle and then have seven kids who cut their throats who love them. This dark age is open to the world. At least it's what the whole episode of ancient Guptur books says. Which raises frustrating questions, oh, well, how do people know what the book wrote and, if that happens, you can leave this information in the book that you can find out from the library. From a library that is not covered in Darkness, it has become a simultaneous character who could accomplish this before using the "Oklaht sanctuary to the world to women for dummies for dummy, second edition"? In this story, parents consider father to be 7th child, 40 years ago, he was away from the ceremony; He was released by his father, who was a doctor / grandfather in the movie, who probably wanted to try this event with other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if this world is really opening up in the dark. Dad let the father go because he "did not really love him". Aduh. Written by a stupid director is the stupid stupid movie who thinks that he is some kind of Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the movie where the child appears with big velvet from her mouth and the mother retains her and there is a total lack of reaction. The whole movie is like this. People are going really curious sh * t and do not react in any way in the normal way. There will be bad plots and aspects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Do not disturb the call for backing up the character. You also know, "I can not feel fearful, although I will probably walk in a monstrous evil situation without any knowledge about defense or for help from other people carrying flashlight or fire." Even if you think about the age of darkness, even if you have a fig, even if you have a blood type, these creatures can not attack it if you have a light source, but they appear as a known person and stop the light source. The video game reminds me of "The Alone Alone"; Perhaps this movie is a form of the idea behind that game. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie is the young boy and brought in. They died at both ends. The whole family died. Dark creatures lead to their death, but in reality, the stereotypes of family letters were the main cause of death. Other adults may be interchangeable with sub-films of the Red Juice Diaries series with other actors. <br /> <br /> So the worst thing in this movie is to hide the stupidity of characters in the dark. An obviously unusual situation, really an intriguing plot in the story (which is an old architect in the story, which designs a house with a sturdy altar hidden in it - the architect suspects that the house will be secret but it does not say that because of someone, well, for any real reason, they He could not find, but he was not bothered to tell the secret rooms about the rooms, which he But he likes to walk around the house for 40 years because he is worried about what is happening inside ... darush ... duuuuh), hacker use of scare mechanisms (in the dark about to stand beside children or show only in the picture and blood in the wallpaper ), And arrogant director when you see him as a new and original presentation of DVD features, describing his cones work, you Where lies the real horror film understood. <br /> <br /> Is this entertaining? With a subtitle of a DVD player that is running on a DVD player, it can reach phases, until you can reach the end and realize the movie, otherwise it is DuaaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAa. A fatty flame is equivalent to the movie; Empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Ring" looks like the movie might try to create something like a feeling, in which case, the movie fails badly and so, in this case, in this case, Jaume Balaguer√≥, what are you in my opinion What to suck.
