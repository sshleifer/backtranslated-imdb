This photo is a big bore. It has lots of predictable plots and endless feelings from the beginning. It starts well with an enthusiastic number but seems to be lost in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> The chemistry on the screen of the sun and Jyothika is really good and works well in a good part. Why include Vandivlu? He is completely invisible after a good half-hour! Santam again proves his intelligence again by comedy. <br /> <br /> The tunes of AR are sure to be for a while. But he could do well. If you feel alone or looking for a good time passage, then once it is important to see what errors can be.
