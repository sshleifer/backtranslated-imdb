This film has been much better than that. Christopher Eccleston is a wonderful actor but he could not recover this story of a young girl who discovered the truth of the death of his sister. Spoiler Alert: Actually, the big sister (played by Diaz) is only a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who has taken much more drugs. Do not make a twist a lot and that's not interesting. The film has been overlapped with many flashbacks and voice overs and lack of dramatic passes. All of these all definitely worth noting - will not be recommended.
