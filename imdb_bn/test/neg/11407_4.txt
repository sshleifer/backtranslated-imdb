I did not swear! I sorted out this because I looked back good! This movie was not always scary and was actually very confusing. The giant wind was actually used several times and people were killed off quite impressive. It was a big brilliant spot to see Sherry Bendorf from it's playhouse. However, seeing what happened to him, I made my mind for this little turkey. 3 out of 10!
