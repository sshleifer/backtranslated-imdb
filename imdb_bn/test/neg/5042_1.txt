Acting was flat (at least none of the actors thought that they would get the script in the morning), and the film and sound quality reminded me of the 70th film of the week. The only thing that told me that it was not 70th week of the week was the DNA test reference. But for me, Eastern Orthodox is the most confusing thing about this ... the film ............................... .................................................. .......................... .. Romania 88% Orthodox but you will never know that from this movie: Father Soren Irish. And even if I could not play Irish Pub, I would know it, star track Michael Sullivan: "Fairhaven" episode of Voices Bishop was wearing Roman clothes (and even the Orthodox bishops do not wear their clothes for this record, unless they are calling religious programs, especially if they are in a monastery). Only about the non-romance theorem I saw a cross of 3-bar on the church door, even though I had to suppress it. The first critic said the producers did their research. Well, if this is true, then they are involved in the film's religious perspective.
