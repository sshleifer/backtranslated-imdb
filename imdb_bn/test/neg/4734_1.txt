This is the worst movie I've seen, and it costs the movie's 2007 value (which is made by me), however, the film misses every single element of a good movie, that means I came to the actors. Bad performance, the story is just shit. I really, really frustrated they could do better things, compared to this piece of junk. I just lost my time and my money at this time. I want the production company to return my money. Anyway I want high expectations on this movie, and I got frustrated. I do not recommend anyone watching this. So if you want to waste your money to do something, it does this piece of junk from the other.
