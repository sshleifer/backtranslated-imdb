C. J. As a previous movie, as a fan of the lottery day, I really wanted to like this movie. <br /> <br /> I can say that the most perfect thing is not a terrible movie. There are some good performances, and a few interesting scenes. In particular, Tore spelling has some great scenes where he talks to his drunken former lover. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's quite a week. Scripts are the way of strange coincidences and clich√©d movie moments often come back around. (The main character went to Stanford on Golf Scholarship, and his high school friend even does not know that he is playing the game?) <br /> <br /> Most of the time the film has no idea or what it is trying to say. There are lots of light-minded scenes, but eventually the time is going to be wasted. And if you can easily cut half the characters of the film without losing anything <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a result of all of this, I would say it is one of the best gay movies of recent years. Which is bad for most gay movies <br /> <br /> I hope C. C. The next film will be even better.
