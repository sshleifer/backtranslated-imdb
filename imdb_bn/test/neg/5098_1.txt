By the middle of 1800, the British had been cleansing the outback desert of New Zealand for colonization. A British Army surgeon, Saro (Parallel Morton)'s daughter falls in love with one of the Maori leaders. Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous person to deal with Europeans. During Sarah's child, she called "son", her father died. At the age of six, "the boy" was kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will start searching for him with a man (Kefar Sutralland), who is deeply loved with him. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominated for the Oscars twice, surely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring: Clifford Curtis, Stephen Ray, Tamura Morrison and David Ravie Pane. This film is rated for some sexual content and violent war scenes. I found River Quinn very confusing and titled DVD cover with Sethland and you believe that the leading star should be an offense.
