Camp Blad is the most tortured slash film. We're mixing on Friday with Blair Witch Project and a killer of a shoe mask. <br /> <br /> This movie budget was very low, some actors played more than one. Using parts and cameras, the original night of the Living Dead creates an image similar to the colorful version, if anyone sees that this version is behind me, then it is poor. <br /> <br /> This image was just too bad. There is nothing to watch even the movie. I was very surprised to look at me. Just accept my advice and do not buy or rent this film. It's scary.
