Small city Sheriff, high school student, mix of counterfeit rock music, and some weird individuals, who do not specifically kill for any reason, this film originally rebuilt "The Giant Geeta Monster" - without the Gila monster, <br /> <br / > <br /> Now anyone who has watched "Giant Geeta Monster" knows that this is one of the worst movies of all time, often it is not funny at all. And I can not believe that by 1967 "Giant Gilla Monster" had achieved such a reputation that young directors were only dying to do a signal work, only a restoration day. So anyone explains why this film has been made?! However, the dance sequence is historically attractive, although the date is almost three years; But it is also confiscated, since it's going on ... and ... ... and ....
