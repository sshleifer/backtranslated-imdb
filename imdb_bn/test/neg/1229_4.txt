This is "Loneme Dov" - and Larry McMartry's poor performance. <br /> <br /> I love your books with "Lonnie Dove" among the top three. As I see myself through your career, I have also satisfied myself with irrational honesty, balanced without taking it all seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I see that you have submitted to the screenwriting, but it is different from you, I think it is written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me clustrophobic, a naturally described sentence that wants to break with someone. Some parts of 'Genius' were boring. McArray was unknown - mainly the insane words coming out of his mouth <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The intrinsic vein consists of morality and integrity; Their lack of self delusion Hard men are leading a hard life with a certain inappropriate grace. <br /> <br /> Some defects are linked here and throughout the labor direction. Cast all conversations and conversations are needed for coaching. <br /> <br /> I try to visualize Robert Duval as a macro, this is not going to say the same conversation, it gets better - but not much. It tries to hear shy, slee-greedful words of some words of cowboy, but half of them do not succeed ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> What can be so different from "Lonesov Dove"? Did the writer forget his character? You fool some people, Mr. McMarty - but this is not.
