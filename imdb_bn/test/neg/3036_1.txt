Sorry this movie is bad for the TV movie. Did you see it drug left? I think hair, make-up and character 2 dimensional types were poor. The story is suspicious, especially since the main characters are all dead, or nearly dead. I think it is not a good job ... What were those hairstyles on the main body of the tortoise? It looked badly glued, and sideburns seem to have fallen off at any moment. How the new stories were published in the band's story and how the members did not match with other bands and people. I laughed, Frank Joppa looked stupid, so my mother was like Mama Cass, and also did Beatles. They are stupid and ridiculous out of the look. Also other band people like Jim Morrison, Donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid. Horrible kind, how do you feel about this man It's a bad history lesson in the song, its imagined way of making it.
