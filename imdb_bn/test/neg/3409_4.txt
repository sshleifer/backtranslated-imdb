First of all, I did not get the version that I think - I chose the Italian version on R2, but what actually came out was a UK version since 1998 - claiming a special edition - I never knew WAS UK DVD release - but the promised product was not actually on disk - just a few duff trailers. Anyway - like the movie - just as I was restoring from "Night Train Murders" my second genital separation became the same month in the month - At this time (Italian) UK young schoolgirl was kidnapped and teacher Fabio Tasty - (unexpectedly) married but among her students One - became the main suspect. Joaquim Fuksberger's detective case Saying I was less than entranced. It was observable but was able to miss evenly, and along with the terrible nature mentioned above, the "wonderful" Christian Galbore assassination, which was actually "wasted" by the DVD cover, told me - Grrrrr !!!! And a surprise twist that threw "hunting" in a new light - I had it very routine. It's two "sequels" though shut me down. Keiron (Hannibal Brooks) with Baal and Camille (I spit on your grave) "Keaton.
