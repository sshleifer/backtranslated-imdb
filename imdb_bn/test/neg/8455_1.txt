This movie happened on HBO yesterday, so I saw it. It was a mistake. I think I had to suck and keep watching though it was a lot like a train debris, terrible, horrible, but the way you can not just look away. Shawnfrood I guess! ; ). <br /> <br /> Storytelling for some island models of this Caribbean island. One is the one they killed all. A liquid cleaner drinks, flies on one flashing, one goes up on the steep ... So this is not the accident, but for some insane reasons the police are never called and somebody thinks that they should probably "wrap" and respect for the dead. Go home without saying, but perhaps away from fear for his life. No They're just going to shoot them because it's the most important. Forget about dead models, we have to create a magazine! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is the most explicit suspect and every time a model dies, he surrounds his problem and says, "Well , I can not say that it will not be good for sale ", so it is unreasonable. Another concubine when it was revealed that the Rex model was a model of the baby baby, only when she had taught the child that she tried to bear the obstruction of the girl. He did not do it, but always bothered him to give this suggestion. They try to give you false sources and point to some people called Raul, because it seems that he is the only one with the same pronunciation and "looks obscure" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this movie came many years ago so if you do not see it now ...) A woman faces death in a pool. This was the last stroke !!!! Vanessa Angel, forgot her characters, came to the name of the gun in Rex, they struggled, fireed the gun and now she even dies !!! Even though he is sitting on the floor, his business associate told him that the news will be valuable to the newspaper by all these bad news and it is all its fault. She got him to sign on the magazine. Vilaila at one time! All the dead models come back to life and you find there was a widespread ruse of the whole thing to get back at Rex. <br /> <br /> O! What a ridiculous movie As someone else says; If you want to see something, this April Fool's Day is very good!
