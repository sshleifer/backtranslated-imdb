This will be one of the most awesome script films I've ever seen. It is basically a rebirth of 20,000 fathoms (1953), but it is done with your ideal snake-like puppet-giant instead of the creator of HipHouse. Combine the plot of the classic giant film with the production qualities and the Cropping Stars acting level, and you have no idea what the movie is like. <br /> <br /> The movie is dubbed, though the original actors (I think the film was originally dubbed in Italian for the visitors of those countries, then re-created for the US publication), which just seems strange to the movie. ... the words like a Japanese giant film do not perfectly match the activities on the screen, even the actor's lips are moving correctly, If Mankee <br /> <br /> poor Ray Milland ... he must have come a long way from the Lost Weekend or the number of his or her number of films that were nice in the Dial M or any other for Murder. Add to her other sci-fi travels (Panic in the Year, X-Ray Ix The Man) and you can once again fall into a good actor Boris Karloff Syndrome ... doing really bad films in foreign countries just for work Stuck
