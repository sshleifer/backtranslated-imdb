This movie is awful. At first I thought it could apply to kids, because the crazy madness of the eocles, the little ones of the king. After sitting through this atrocity of the film, I'm sure this film over the age of 4 years will not be interesting. Special effects make good comparisons for the best of this movie and for other 80 TV movies. The script is bad, the actors, especially the Aubry Miller and incredibly bad, and it is expected that I still can not believe that I could not touch the forward button on my VCR. However, I came off this mess switch more than once.
