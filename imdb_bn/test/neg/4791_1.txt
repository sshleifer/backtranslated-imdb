Have you seen all the big events over the last few decades? If you have already seen most of the scenes already, you will not be bothered - and I can guarantee that those scenes were essentially in more good movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I will never forgive the real storytellers) will be angry and stupid (stupid to be angry at the death of playing it in a death). Each character is based on a cliché and ... well, they do nothing without cliché. And yes, again you should be a hero to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland, they advertised it for advertising as a DVD making film. Maybe my player has to sell ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
