One of the most horrific movies I've ever seen is Kerry (the first one!). Now, with other movies, they completely destroyed the Caribbean franchise with The Rage: Kerry 2. From the beginning, the movie pledged like a gyrootics in a beat-up van. There is no fear here, and this film is based on various high school stereotypes (such as football jokes, malicious cheer-nader, follower, and of course, black nickel mixed muffits). Another sad thing about this show is that you know how you see opening credit. Sure, sure, the girl thourghly hum humated and then turned into a mad psycho killer ... Yawn ... <br /> <br /> there was That's the end. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to be forced to make this movie. When Emily Berglake Jack is a scary patch doll in London when going to London ... Just tell me I do not see the law of wood. Along with the actors, flashbacks work for more frustration than linking to the first movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, if you can be able to weigh around things like Carey, then emancipate yourself for God's love. That theater ......
