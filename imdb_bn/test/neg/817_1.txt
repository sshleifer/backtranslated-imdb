I say this. If you want to see the art, you go to an art gallery. If you want to watch a movie, you go to a theater. Crude evidence in the "where is the heart" art and film intertwine tries. An attractive cast is completely wasted in this embarrassment. If you like Dobney Coleman, see "short time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Land". If you like Uma Thurman, see "Bill Bill". After all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "Shut up Partner" because here its character is a terrible embarrassment. Actually this whole production is a bit embarrassing. Make sure that people's artwork is stimulating for a few minutes, so please summarize, but do not fool the audience's strangers, forcing them to entertain as illustrated entertainment. - Mr.
