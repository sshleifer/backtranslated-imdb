Think of Zuma, but with the curse of death. A bunch of surfer dudes is a game that takes those lives for those who are playing it in their hands to get them. Obviously it was made from a witch skin during Spanish exploration and carrying a nasty curse. <br /> <br /> Well, the strange and just sort of story you do not see is nothing like that. Actually it was there and the story happened that hit the right button as it is, the real surprise. Run away from the worst thing that run SyFy but of course it is not good. There is a better choice but if you are the only choice, you will not hate it completely.
