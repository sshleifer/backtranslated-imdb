Why not this movie below 100? Raptor, without a doubt, has seen the worst movie of my fifteen years of life. I have never before seen such a crushing mess before. Everything about it is curious and cheaply done. <br /> <br /> Cast some give some decent performance. The dialogue is completely inconsistent and humorous but something interesting. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can not help cringe when I feel something in her line, "Inside or Out?" You are worse than a Cat! " And "Your lady friend is not a very good oder player." She has just released her hand. <br /> <br /> Rapper is a joke. I even make this film makers brutally More realistic dinosaurs may have been effected than it is, it is not a real violocaraptors, or an insult to any dinosaur, but murder scenes are too horrible for me. I do not think that these animals will scatter their prey and throw them all into pieces on the ground, everything will look fine, and if you see deaths from miles and miles away, then blood and void is all worthless. I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Perhaps the filmmakers are intelligent or intelligent disguised as bad movies. I did not expect the movie to be disappointing with HBO in the previous night, and if I can talk to someone involved in this film, then first I will quote Dr. Allan Grant from Jurassic Park <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Try to show a little respect."
