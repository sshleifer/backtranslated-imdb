The movie is flashing in half light and flashing camera. The rest comprised of predictable letters (science versus science, 'know how' vs. authority etc) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? The car is being thrown in the first five minutes, the word 'cosmic' is the word 'russian', is it a vague character, a weakly top-ranked Top 40 hit, or "America will defend the world" Vitriol? No Despite the "sad" ending - this film has very few mysteries - we basically know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> A good part of this movie: "American ingredients, Russian ingredients: all made in Taiwan!"
