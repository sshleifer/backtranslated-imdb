Okay ... In most parts and all of his glasses, this movie was actually good for FST for MSST3 ... but at the end of 15 minutes before the end, it decided to destroy some goodness. * Spirir Alert * is a very basic movie ... Danny, a rich uncle's son, joins a left, named Bux, and travels to a small town, where a beautiful girl named Bike Carey (who is very much) meets. Now, this film's basic premises seems promising enough. All they had to do was follow the general chemistry of the romance film ... Kerry loves love ... Bikes loves Carrie ... A vague person in town wants a car ... Now, I know what I think. .. Bix Creep decides to fight and finally sit down with the car, and Danny returns home, and they live happily after all ... right? Wrong !! Because the city kills the creep, because Bikes is very gay surrender. (There are many gay sex workers in Danny and Viks.) And then, the whole city decides to cool the Vixen, although the city was a genuine main suspect. After that, the city has accepted the killing of Krypton without much hesitation ... (Of course, poor dipped.) Then, Danny brought Bass with him ... which was "never after the joy" of the film. Sorry, huh? I can say, thanks to God for Joel and Bots. Because they turned my favorite MSST 3 into this horse hockey on episode.
