Although I've already seen it on an Italian TV, I turned it into a surprisingly tolerant Potbill, inspired by an international cast of familiar faces (as a barrage Joseph Cotton Baron) and on the contrary, another movie by the Euro-Cult sub-genre is impressive. An incident-packed plot in place of pensing. <br /> <br /> The animal itself seems a little sticky and the cotton is too old, the enthusiastic scientists are still hesitant to take a livelihood from the dead (someone thought that he himself has now made his army and is still not struggling to perfect his strategy. ) But Mrs. Neyry looks good outside and outside the dress. And reliable Herbert Fox probably comes as well as a lecherous grave-robber / blackmailer.
