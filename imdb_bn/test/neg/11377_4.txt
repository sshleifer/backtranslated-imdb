I hope to like this movie, sit idle in the evening for fun. I like Judy Davies and Juliet Lewis, and the premiere closes enough wall to entertain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I've seen myself again and again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance, but working with was very little. Juliet Lewis was fantastic as expected, but was very little. The plot was filled with "Twists", which was simply intelligent, and it often happens in such movies, did not act in any way that any real man would work. And, personally, I thought that Murcia Gay Harden was completely wrong. <br /> <br /> The film touches black comedy and moves from a black comedy to the midway with the French bay touches. Here is a survey comment that other reviews seem to be somewhat different from this movie, and so its void. I can say that I have set * some * for the movie and sticking with it. There was some rural ideas as a director, but it was not able to drag them all. I give it a 4 out of 10
