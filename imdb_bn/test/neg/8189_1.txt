This person is a so-called entertainer, who is trying to trust others and to use voyage, indecency, and slander. I have often seen every effect using comics at least, but when it comes to what you can say, it is a sign of a drug that is harmful. His wonderful and fried brain will be in misuse for a few seconds, where it is astonishing. Poor people !!! I admit I can not see all of it - too stupid for the word. This amazing part really believes that he is a philosopher! No wonder the self-esteem and modesty are dwindling and distortion is increasing. Could it be that UFC could be a cause of his dead brain?
