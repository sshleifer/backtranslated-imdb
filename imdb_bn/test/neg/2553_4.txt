I must say I was frustrated with this picture. Although it played well and guided, the underlying story plods very slowly. <br /> <br /> Please, I liked it in another mood. I made many chocolates, but very rarely smiled; And there was a sense of mystery to discover who actually won. But unlike my wife who took the same day (some of us have not already heard). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see many movies, see all this - this is definitely better than your average rent. But if you keep a limited time (like me) and want to show only the best and most entertaining, then save it later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
