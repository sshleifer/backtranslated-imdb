Some friends and a friend of mine went with my mother, it seems like this would be a good way to stop the spring break, but the movie became terrible. We all agreed that it should not be PG-13. More like the elements. Lots of sex conversations, cussing and mentioning part of the boy and girl (below waist). Not worth the time or money. Do not strongly request you to go, or rent it when it comes. If you end up eventually, do not take small children. Movie type is not seen with family! View content advisory section on IMDb's superhero movie page, enthusiastic about content. Most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
