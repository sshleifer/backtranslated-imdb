Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, is a dark, deep, and lasting novel that causes futility and irony in Africa. If you are looking for a great book reading over the weekend, this is not the book for you. While describing the 19th century imperialism, Conrad did not return anything, but the novel is meaningless without reflection and consideration. If I read this novel in search of a great adventure story, I would say that I have wasted my time, but from the perspective of explaining the stupidity of the 19th century civilization, I would say that it is one of my most important novels. This novel in my English class is the truth of reading and we analyzed each page, it seems that I would appreciate more than reading books for books. I'm not going to lie, this book was tough and the reader challenged to dig deeper into this novel to find the real meaning. On the other hand, I think the movie is tiring and annoying. The movie, "Heart of the Darkness" does not come near to book books. I exclude a lot of important parts that play this important role in getting this message true. The film may be a great place to understand and visualize the novel, but I would not recommend watching the movie as an alternative to novel or even a different perspective.
