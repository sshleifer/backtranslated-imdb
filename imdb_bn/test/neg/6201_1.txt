I do not know what I can expect when watching this movie, until finally I was pulling my hair. This year's most kind of movie ... In fact, in the last ten years. David Dhawan must quit his career as a director. I have not yet been able to come across a real script by David Dhawan. This one was the whole bit e-bit rip off hit one. I have nothing against such remakes, but this one is so lazy that it even makes you hate one of the original (which was quite decent). I did not understand actors like Salman and Govinda saw this script. I read somewhere, it was about the returning car of Govinda. If that is true, then only God can save his career. Revenge of Salman revenge! I think Govinda was a very high quality actor who was completely destroyed. Katrina Kaif and Lara Dutta are wearing different clothes and smiles for any rhythm or reason. Please make this one form away!
