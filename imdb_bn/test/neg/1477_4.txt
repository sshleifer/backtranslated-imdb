Can I write it? Rather confuse yourself? Yes, but this is not a bad thing because we did not have any dreams, but we're still in the cave and Mark's horror movie is not to be taken as criticism. Since both Sam Raimi (yes one) and Peter Jackson (yes one) both begin to start making low budget horror comedy, it's not a criticism.

Well, Jerry Springer's friends are similar to Mark Mark, so some people think that this is not a real documentary.
