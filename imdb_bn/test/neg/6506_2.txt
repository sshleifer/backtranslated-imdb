Although a well-produced, made-to-television film, Diving to profit reconsider you with low grade melodramatic splendor. <br /> <br /> The picture is open to Roger Pulson (Tim Methason, which I see a lot older than I remember him). After a struggling businessman who his wife Ruthi (who looks suspiciously like Roj√°n Arnold), after leaving his life alone, he will leave him fast. Now all Roger has his cat .... and his advertising newspaper. <br /> <br /> Once he responds to his advertisement, he calls Johnny-Yel-Lisa-Oh, I'm not the one you want me to - Lawrence. Then ... have their phone sex. <br /> <br /> I do not know where you came from or when you were born, but I remember the phone-sex bit played at the end of 80 seconds. I'm sorry, but that was trashy. <br /> <br /> Soon there's a Roger and wide hook-up and a cyclone romance. They fall in love, visiting the zoo to look at Gorilla, and then there is some weird sex with Roger's son of another room. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Allah forbidden women only sleep with a man. Soon, strange phone calls start to happen, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her at high speed, and she bothers her former husband and uses him to kill him. Roger believes it through all these things is interesting. Not unless a frumpy fellow tells him to go snooping through his belongings like a messy housewife. He took his painful advice and saw, he got a suitcase by crossing it with fake ID cards and wigs and guns and a crossover. He immediately took the suitcase to the police and arrested him. Although all these jazz, he still loves the wide range of fools. He's lying so much, it seems like he's holding his tongue on fire, if he's telling the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roger likes her very well. But some of Roger's subconscious accompanies him to Lisa Rohan (if he does not have his real name) and he goes back to meet her. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa "ex-do not go away" she brings herself out of prison free card and looks at Roger's doorstep and her son Matt is trying to become so busy, she poured the juice across the floor. The IL is so stupid, he threw out Lisa and even did not change the lock. Boy, if all the people are stupid, I could not write this review too. The end of this movie is so pure, you do not believe. <br /> <br /> Tim Matson is the TV-movie king for a creation. She looks like this movie is such a dawm mummy. She is a little woody and strong. Excellent Tracy Polar works well with his role and his trampiness ring truth. She is very beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This picture is great for looking at Tip at late night, but then again, you can fall asleep, consider how neutral and happy it is.
