I admit - I was so desirous of this campaign - and I did not stop to consider the formula. "One of the best indie exploits in the year Flickr" (1999), "Threat", and "Must Have To Be Courageous". <br /> <br /> Well - I wasted my money but this movie was not bad at all. At least got the right of a cow, as well as the most unique method of killing for a long time. Even a story (Kinda) and it is also about it. <br /> <br /> The exploitation film is an amazing amount of content - but there is no exploitation. We got gay sex - sorted. We have 3 different ethnic babes - maybe a psychological Vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (okay, that made me fooled) and some female versions of Gene Simmons (I'm not getting that part). We have the honesty of our honesty - the rate among the best actors of this movie - which is not complimentary and finally we have spread a government conspiracy. - I do not know - try to connect with vengeance / random / theme killing by Jimmy Boy for fooling Vietnamese psycho? Line If there is nothing else, then this film is Italian and T is not a lock in American films like this. Latinoos can shit them as well as them as well. Anyone involved in this accomplishment of Kudos overcame it and makes a career for themselves.
