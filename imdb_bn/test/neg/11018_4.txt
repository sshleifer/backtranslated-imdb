This completely unspeakable film is considered to be top and unfortunate and unrealistic that during the entire 90-minute full torture, I was looking at my watch almost 70000 times! Lucy Bell is far more than this nonsense and is quite depressing for her to sink this less. I must admit that the audience I was hearing violently, but mostly Greek or Italian, so I guess that these humor may laugh at them but not me. These movies make you sick by seeing these slackers for 90 minutes by making excuses for their stupid actions. God, and I never got that 90 minutes ago!
