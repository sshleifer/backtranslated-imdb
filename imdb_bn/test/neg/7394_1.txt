To collect a ragatag in western tourists in Africa, it is unlikely to break down on their plane, so they are forced to take refuge in a bus to reach the closest jumping-off point of suspension to travel to the Namibia desert. It is no wonder that the driver's compass does not work, and they are completely deviated, in WWII, there is a stop in a secluded ghost town in the barracks during the war. They have some kerosene (meaningless in their bus tanks), tin cans filled with semi-poisonous filling storage rooms, and a local servant who looks at them with apathy. In terms of survival strategies, there seems to be something in the ball that one of them goes to get help. They will remove the tires from the bus, and if they do not return within five days they will burn them: hopefully anyone can see black smoke. <br /> <br /> What is this word interesting? Well, sure, even if it sounds like a lot of movies in many * phoenix flight * or "secluded islands" style. Why is it surprising that the 'continuous film' "is strictly verboten, because the" number of 95 words ", which seems to me, that I think is the ongoing number 4 (if someone is still counting), continuing in the" Dogma 95 "continuous running" Dogma 95 ". Oops. Well, however, you can say it will be a continuous flick that will try to compensate that truth and be all the arty and stuff. Yes, a group member does not take long, a wonderful old stage actor, to start from memory - from memory! - Various roles from * to King Lear *, well, paper rolls. The idea that the time during the play time will help you away. What is really against the advice of the missing survivors to be optimistic (the old actors sometimes did not do dinner-theater performance * a strange couple * once in their life?), Most activities such as cosmic precious time and energy waste <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I do not know how I can walk. It is so cute stupid, so stupid situation and full of characters that it begged reasonable criticism. It may be a timely moment to offer full disclosure: I despise this so-called Danish film "Movement" as an illogical degree. I think my face even slightly reddened in the direction of Dogma 95. Firstly, if you have the term "dogma" in the title of your movement, you have already lost me; Secondly, in this particular example, the strong key to the movement to reduce individual artistic achievement is when you think that filmmakers are plundering one of the greatest writings of the greatest personal writers living here. (However, there is no doubt that DGMs believe that Shakespeare's works were actually written by a consortium of older adults such as Oxford's Earl, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and Queen Herschel.) <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> I could forgive the whole enterprise if it turns out to be a daunting task (valuable dogma attacks - it will be devastating now!). But the film takes itself very seriously and soon admits the clich√©s minister in that style, in which it is uncertain: people bend against each other; Men's beard growth; The main actors are few inevitable deaths. All with a direct face. "Does this promise end?" Well, not many: we have to tolerate DV's unstable shift. For Dosta 95, another rule of the ward is: Hold the digital video only. Some friendly suggestions to dance: Your "product" problem is when your finished product has poor visual quality compared to the average high school graduation home video. Professionalism is associated with its artist bag, as well as its own personality. Soundtrack "Artisan" and "Artist", Mr. Van Tier: Not every $ 100 jacket in hand can be a movie maker. Pass it And by the way: Allow your Dogma Directors to make credit for their movies, while you're in it. In fact, author of * The King is Aave * has received credits, although the person (or girl) does not actually film it, it is merely a fierce hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 1 star.
