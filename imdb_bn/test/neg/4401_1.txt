<br /> <br /> This movie will not be long. The first half hour was the most annoying one since I first started watching movies. The story was not progressed, nothing about the character was explained. It felt like a non-movie. (Many people have already left the listener at this time). <br /> <br /> Many scenes were completely inaccurate and unclear. <br /> <br /> The director must read the film a bit more each sequence, to know each scene, the story will go ahead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jury 222 in the Kan ... does not think of jury ... perhaps "politically correct effects" <br /> <br /> I liked to love it, disappointment was so big. <br /> <br /> You have to believe it. But wait for the video.
