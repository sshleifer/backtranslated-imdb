My main criticism animation with the movie. I was completely poor agree with everyone else. In the first film, there seems to be some character dark skin tones than what they did, which is very good. Also the background color was spread and looked a bit static. Michael J. Fox was embarrassed not to call Millio, he did such a good thing, and James Arard Taylor was not sure if he wanted to sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have been considering a good story shortage. The third story was called confusing and ugly, and the second story was suffering from poor scripting. To do something bad, I can not remember the first, something other than a fishing village or something like that. However, there were some nice songs and there was a good voice genius from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown, and Tom Wilson, which saved this film from total disaster. All in all, an awkwardly good film is a frustrating sequel. 4/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar.
