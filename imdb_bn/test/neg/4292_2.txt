Great actors, good filming, a potentially attractive plot, and good conversations should happen. There is nothing good about this movie. Perhaps the author or director thought that they could make an incentive film out of the boring characters as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> I love the image of Kim's picture by Carmen Finney in 10 minutes, so that it's a confusion. Although Kim is considered helpless, I'm not sure that I want to do physical violence on him. The first (most) intertwined things are gone for about 3 seconds from Wes (David Straathren) "I'm missing $ 50.00" from "he stole 50 seconds". It was quite impossible, since he (Kim) did not enter his bathroom and he was not a master cockpocket - there was no logical reason to doubt him. Most people have lost / realized and we estimate that ... we lost it. The same goes after for Kim. Looking at the real people (I think) that is supposed to be all too unrealistic behavior Kim's character was suffering from the lowest, a bipolar disorder. Wes had huge insufficiency problems, Nancy was just boring and Matt was confusing (especially about music). I actually turned this off through almost 2/3. However, to write a valid comment, I expected myself to come together in this movie, returning it back. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make a point to miss this one.
