All right, enough. Every time I think I have seen a movie which is so bad, so bad that I think that someone is probably not finding anything for praise, I am just coming to IMDB where I'm greeted with normal frenzy "Masterpiece" "Great movie" - I mean, really, you're watching a movie because it must be seen in the new Fox / MGM / UAE DVD No Almost three funny lines and a plot that gives a new meaning to the contradiction. And then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it just stops and ends the credit is starting. Then there is another scene. The DVD is fairly bad, which is suitable for film. The source material is almost completely faded to a ugly brown. Imagine the picture is hard to imagine. It was just right for critics and the public - it was tall and a box office disaster, and so on. But you keep trying pundits. And I will try to find a movie that has nothing to do with anything about him.
