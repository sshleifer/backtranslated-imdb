Subpissions were set up on Sunday, where the local people came to study with the help of American American student Michelle (Laura Maate Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) local friend Merrar (Irina Mvila). There they rent a hotel room and became curious about the mysterious ruins of the nearby fortress, it proves that a powerful and evil vampire Radar (Anders Hove) has stolen vampires from his father King Vladimir (Angus Scream). . Romu congratulates the three daughters and begins to drink the blood of Marc and Lillian, at that time fell for a man named Michael Stefan (Michael Watson), who was exactly like the brother of Radu. Michael and Stefan decided to be part of the group and to be released from the world of the evil cry ... <br /> <br /> This picture, directed by Tid Nikolae, is consistently considered to be very much among fans fans and I certainly do not want it, It does call very well and I can not really see anything to get excited about. The gulf is a slow-moving film, it does not really happen, and it tries to stay close to some classic vampires, but there is no reason to believe that some of the stones and some little monsters that were born from the tips of the trunk fingers of Radui are due to some absurdity. Subjects can be half-decent, if it is not neutral, I can not remember anything good or bad about it. The character is fine but some conversation is shameless and a scene that fights me at the beginning when the girls are in the ruins and someone says that they are becoming dark, but still it is between mid-day and mid-mid Very bright There is also a scene where American girls find a coffin that is not a hotel attack and it does not really bother with it, I'm not funny, but some blocks, whose house I used to live in my orbital coffin was very, very worried if you know I mean I do not think that I would ever like to see it again, there is no real threat, the plot is weak, which mixes classic vampire themes with stupid subpoints and I was clearly obsolete by it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not much scarcity except to break off a decapitation and some finger tips. For some reason the creator throwing some average stop-motion animated monsters, which really does nothing or is very important to the story. <br /> <br /> Charles Band is the best and most well-liked producer of Bachelor Company in Romania, in Romania. Acting is not great with many castes in the performance below, although there are small cameras at the beginning of the regular Angus scream. Here are some of the notable memories of the original Nasefertu (1922) with some scenes, especially the shade of the shadow standing in the bottom of its long bird watching that football shadows are standing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Followed by Bloodstone: SubSpecies II (1993), Bloodlest: SubSpace III (1994), Subspicci 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and Spinoff Film Vampire Journals (1997).
