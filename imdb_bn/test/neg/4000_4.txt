I know that many people will automatically rate this movie 1, because it does not have a huge budget and top-of-the-line special effects that they can use. I knew how I got myself when I got this Pope in VCR. <br /> <br /> I do not think we got less budget, unless we film family reunion. Light is understandable at times, sound quality, and acting is almost over-bad by being involved. However, it is still interesting enough to have a fun movie and plot. It is surrounded by a co-worker named Tom Russo (Asbestos Filter), who has fate with his job. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to do her work, even putting herself under extra pressure. When he started working more hours, we saw him slowly crossing into crazy and passion and he suspected that his wife cheated on him and brutally murdered several men (the most repaired man) that he felt responsible. <br /> <br /> I would say that Gore's effect is very cheap, but fit the whole voice of the film. Tom Rousseau comes along with the assassination of this man, that we have only one idea of ​​the cruel ways that he is crazy. Panning is very good and rarely a boring moment. Ultimately, the rest of the movie does not follow, because it seems like it's going to go to "Dawn of the Dead" Wangby from a psycho-slasher film, but it's still entertaining and I must certainly give the team an absent-ending end use absence for Ritter's credit. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie, but this is not a good movie, if it is understandable. It's about the budget's main obstacle block and the result is almost too much to abandon. I do not recommend completely damaged by big budget movies and can not keep open minded for super-budget movies. You simply will not enjoy it. For others, and Gore fans - I say give it a shot. You will get rid of it at least some! <br /> <br /> My Grade D.
