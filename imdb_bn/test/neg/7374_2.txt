The worst movie I've seen for a long time. Historical accuracy is completely in existence. For example, James Wolf, who is pictured as his anti-French Canadian, was shown in London in the summer of 1759. Native Indians like Hollywood's 60-year-old Hollywood movie: They dressed in deer and riding on horseback (Montagne's horse was not a horse). This image is being held in Quebec City, but footage is located in Louisburg, it shows the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original scene was supposed to include the battles of Abraham's Plains, but the producers left the idea saying the costs for the uniforms and participants would be $ 4 million! I think they did not listen to the legislation again. <br /> <br /> All movies are planned to be the new Titanic: a historical tragedy (during the fall of New France) impossible love. At the end of the movie there is a song of Sailen Deon (yes, I'm at the end of the film, but I am deeply sorry). But the worst thing is that the movie costs $ 30 million. I do not know how they spend this money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm very annoyed.
