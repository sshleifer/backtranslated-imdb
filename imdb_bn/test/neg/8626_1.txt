I do not believe this movie has 6 stars in IMDB. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen that mystery science is not an episode of Theater 3000. This plot is expected. I could not take care of myself about the characters. The conversation is in Chess. During a few moments of the film, I shouted aloud loudly and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loud Jeff Bridges's utterance fooled - I can not say what country he might be. It should always be one of the least thrilling thrillers ... After the disappearance of Sandra Bullock's character, the story will not be enough to advance for 45 minutes. If I could give this movie a negative amount of it.
