--------- Spillar Alert ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> This was the series Worst, it is not as scary as the political mockery, and it is very scary and very insightful, as a slack hammer. What does Mitchell Moore have to do with this garbage? <br /> <br /> I repeat the really sick and continuous conversation of Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush. The film wants to be dead, but in contrast to that film, the soldiers who came back from the senses intelligently came back from Vietnam, their character returned as a bloody zombie and gradually came back based on this theme: it was also social social commentary, because it's purity, exploitation and propaganda Did not get it. <br /> <br /> I guess Joe Danti seems to be trying to create a horror film that fears Republicans, conservatives and Libertarians, and I think the last of the list is completely ridiculous, manipulute and exploited at the same time. I do not like being exploitative, which you often find in "Drive-in" type movies, I mean most of the drying Aratmaka and brutal way: the death of our soldiers as a serious political statement disguised as a political statement using. <br /> <br /> This picture thinks that all soldiers who died in Iraq will vote against a conservative president if they return to life like Jumbo, which is a defective court, because I remember most of the parts and by the rules of George Romero Going; Zombies could talk to zombie Andy in Deadmother, Dog eating Habits, Operating on authentic impulse and even DeadDream, he was not really able to keep a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. Well, the junkies are stupid animals driven by passion and not intelligent and perhaps they are dead, so why would the dead people be allowed to vote in the first place? My explanation of this movie is that the only liberal democracy can win, the only minded people can vote for him, I think they are more than those who decide to vote for the president, like George Bush, the junky, but the true nondescript zombies, indeed intelligent decisions. Yes anyway Dawn of the Dead has dealt with this idea more well, but users are stupid consumers' idea. This image is not the death of the dead by any stretch of imagination. The film solves this problem, when the soldiers survive that most of them voted like Bush to the President, but after the death they will vote for militants after a militant war against democracy, which are generally considered dead in the brain. And they laughingly destroy them after voting. <br /> <br /> If you are a zombie movie Make Dante and call on the name of George Romero, you like well psychological jumps, which separates people and likes to eat in their gut, not a zombie that voted. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social comments, make this weaker, snatchy piece of pieces and see Deathdream instead. <Br> <br /> The Master of the Horror series is the worst hand down.
