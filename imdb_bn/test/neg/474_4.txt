I enjoy b movie I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how I distribute her line. 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Darkness of the Army' are a great movie. I liked 'Running Time'. However, I will never see this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, after saying, I will look at commentary tracks and special features! This movie has many holes for me which can actually be enjoyed, even as a cheap movie. First off, Ted Raimi was annoying, just boring out flat. There was nothing in his bad acting / written character that was not better than thousand times better than before. Instructions sadly like sub parameters and some shots ... yikes. I do not expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell did not deliver. <br /> <br /> I did not buy the idea that it was going to be an Oscar film like 'Annie Hall', but still I'm frustrated. I was happy with 'Marratas' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got a lot less. At the end of the film, I had no scenes that came to me, and I did not have any dialogue that was heard in me. Even 'hostel' was a classic line for pets! I do not recommend this movie.
