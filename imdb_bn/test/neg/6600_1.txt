I'm stupid, I do not really understand how anyone can accept such a script, direct any person in the film to direct it. I am writing this review that looks like an insult to my finger, instead of being reviewed, it should be thrown into dust. I became frustrated for Flex Alexander, and even played alone roles for thinking about taking such a poker exclusivity for a script. God! I think I just insulted the word "article" ... yes, I did. What do you know, less stupid about this stupid drill, said good. You've been warned, someone warned me that I had to suffer a terrible experience myself. Look at your own risk.
