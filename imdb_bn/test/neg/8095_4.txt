I hired most of the movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. He played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. When Jerry and Connale's friends got married, the film was really nothing to try to stay single after one contract. Other friends keep this money together and who end up getting married, get money from all his friends ($ 10,000). Since the film has tried to follow it somehow and after making it try to make it more fun. I'm glad I only .50 for this movie. It was not really all good at all. I **** out of 10 rating it!
