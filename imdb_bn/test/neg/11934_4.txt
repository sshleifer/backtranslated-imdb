I created one month salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) for TV. Other critics have observed that MSR was a theatrical movie, and I will talk about it for them. The logical answer was originally shot for TV and it was abandoned in theaters after the changing studio-heart. Each actor is primarily a TV actor: Marte Hartley, Michael Kellen, Ralph Woite, Stefani Powers ... all of the TV actors. Lee Van Cliffe split his time between TV and theater screen. Stefani Powers has made the appearance of 3 or 4 "real" films in the last thirty years of a positive television career that has been shot for Cable TV. Small players are small screen actors, who can be seen in "Renewal", "Wild Wild West", "San Francisco Street" in old renewals. <br /> <br /> WHO sets are similar to the Universal Studios Tours set, often viewed on older episodic TVs. And with limited camera movement, positioning, cutting, and lighting, TV one or two takes-betrays hastinessness. Exclusive soundtracks of the original Barstein themes are just seventy-second televisions. Yes, I got the money, it was shot for TV. <br /> <br /> This is an important issue of MSR evaluation. Initially I saw MSR on the wire it was releasing an old theater. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, a amateur effort to make movies. Acting, lighting, writing, setting, action, cinematography, music (excluding Barstein themes), editing, pacing, ... etc. All gradually the classic "Magnificent Seven" is a perfect 60s West, and one of the best action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> But, as a movie of the 70-year-old TV movie, I think the film is actually better than average. Unfortunate to live like a 70-year-old adult, I know what I'm saying. MSR will compete against "Eliash Smith and Jones" and similarly the band network shows. In seventy years, "Gunshot" was a quality show, focusing on character development instead of action, one shot two gunshots in gunfire in one week. The first shooting, usually a murder, sets the intensity of the hour in motion - the second shootout guest finalizes this episode by solving the murder of the star, his generosity, or otherwise the martial lawm of Matt Dillon. There is more than MSR in the whole season of "GonSamok". In this light - this frame of reference - MSR passable entertainment, a cut above the TV rental from that decade.
