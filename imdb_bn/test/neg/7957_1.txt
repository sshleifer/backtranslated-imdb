The cat cat copied the image from the 1974 Hindi movie "Call Girl"! There was a similar story line of "Call Girl". The novel falls in love, then rebellious and in both the sub-continent in the same way! "Call Girl" is better than water, at least from the point of story telling. The water was running slowly as slowly! The opposite water does not progress at all. Perhaps the tribute to Kalyani is sympathetic! Is Indian film makers better than these days just great copier? Well they call "being inspired". In their language it says: "Inspire (without any quotation!)"! :)
