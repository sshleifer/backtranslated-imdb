I rent this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club - you know, that hip, cold places you can late on Saturday night. Well, there is no "cool" one ounce in this ridiculous movie. The score is stupid, the original songs are terrible, the songs of both lead actors are constantly off-key (duplicate) and irrelevant, as always, "It fills the boy's daughter", the act is ridiculous and the only decent cinematic moment is stock footage scenery. Jazz Club scenes feature sophomoric dialogue mad by extra-busy organ music. This should keep Joey de Francesco working on his day (his day is not helped with career movie scores). Is it not possible to get my four dollar money back, but my therapy session has to be paid as well? This movie, interestingly enough, so bad, you might want to see it. Sort of like driving by a bad accident - you just have to look at at least once. Just get ear plugs ready!
