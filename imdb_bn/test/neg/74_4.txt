Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent is sadly trying to do their homework in Los Angeles despite the mother's flightless behavior, a lady can not get any ideas of cooking in this artificial way about her mother and her mature teenage girl. In addition to several good sequences, I did not buy enough of Susan Sarandon as a flake (he was too intrinsically smart and attentive to be expelled as the devil-May-Care lady), and his naturally poor fit for the role of grounded personality is an irresponsible parent . Natalie Portman rents her much better as her child, and yet her work (and some of her scenes, where she tells a boy to be leaked, there is a confusing absurd), wrong and uncomfortable to see. Definitely an unsatisfactory piece, "Anywhere but here" are some moments that work, but this is not a scandalous film, and it has not been proven as an important proof. ** **** to
