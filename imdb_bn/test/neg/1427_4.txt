I saw it as a baby but, not much of Jerry Lewis fan, I totally forgot (it's not memorable anyway). The film revolves around the camouflage (which seems to be in every comic star curriculum!) - In this case a German official - and Leonard Maltin claims it is not bad (it gives a BOMB rating), it is not just the classic content - of course Chaplin League behind the Great Dictator (1940), even if relatively narcissistic! Wickedly, the scenes will be disappointing before the scene, instead of the cost of Nazis, the general offer is more than forced humor! <br /> <br /> This image was actually Louis's last summer time; In fact, it proved to be the last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it is fiercely obvious that here its brutal brand will be absent from Brooklyn and Woody Allen's age).
