This movie was a comedy and was generally a failure as a film. It was a very slow movie that seems to have tried to publish a message, but the message was started with a clich√©, hopeless mess. This movie falls on a ruthless environmental point of view, even creating a self-righteous point of destruction of an SEO and promoting a vibrant planet. I could not help sitting by <br /> <br /> but noticed that Steve Carroll is no longer. Single than the really funny line. It is figuratively the only thing imaginable that is a fascinating effort to give comic relief lines to Bhanga Saiks. His character gets dense, crunchy lines where they do not fit perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bruce is far away from the Almighty's brightness, the Ivan Almighty strikes his specially recorded plot devices on the whole of the impact-broken budget, little plot advance. The first half of the movie spent building the ark for the construction of the ark, but ultimately we learn that the ship was completely meaningless and the whole plot was stupid, and only a pot for Stupaar messages. When we learn that the whole ship, flood and animal collection was the only God's weak political statement, the film ended. Yes, God is trying to influence politics.
