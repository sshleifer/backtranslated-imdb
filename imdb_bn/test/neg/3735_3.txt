Feeling of Minnesota is not really a road movie, but it's still the best classification I can make. A road movie basically does not depend on a great story line, and the film's plot is really sad, but it fills the description. To be interesting, such a movie must be fully dependent on running and playful characters and chemistry between them. Unfortunately, Feyling Minnesota staff has completely failed to produce this tension. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of characters is displeasing and confusing; For example, I do not know if Jezeck (Keanu Reeves) is growing up at her mother and brother's house. It is said, by her mother (Tuesday Wald), she must be with her father, but nothing in the movie suggests that it ever happens. The same letter goes to the rest - I do not know them. They seem irrational, and why they are not giving any real explanation. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that without the feeling of letters, without the feeling of the film, the cameraman Diaz, without a little kick of shame and perhaps a charm.
