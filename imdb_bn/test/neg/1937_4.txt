To read comments from other users, I reviewed the A666333 most of what I was experiencing - predictable stories, Clive versions of lesbians / heteroacosmas (like simple female became gay and her husband is abusive and offensive). <br /> <br /> Also, the score was frustrating. It was soft, soft, sensitive lift music - another general clich√© in the film about lesbians. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The final performance scene. Common "hot and steamy" moments were annoying as too much emotional scores. For example, during pool scenes, women are kissing, and then the camera pans with abandoned wine glass, flowing water, soft crashes of waves, with the sound of heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Elements I liked were expensive and intellectual. They are well-known dancers, and they feel very natural during the development training tour of attraction between two characters. I'm actually sunny with those times, and the last office police officer But they were not enough to raise the negative or enjoy me this movie.
