Lam is really the best way to describe this movie. This is a really poor script, split dialog and letter and it basically lacks everything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many letters and problems that you are not concerned about any of them. What is lacking in movies is a good and clear main character. Instead of now there are a bit of movie, it divers a hero, it has some interest and it has a great villain. I think it was only a few drawbacks, although they are mostly very annoying in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ghauli is considered to be an evil creature, who kills for happiness. What they want to do in this movie is to drink beer and watch girls in nude colleges. On the other hand, there was a 'bright' concept to enable someone to speak at this point. This works really bad and annoying. Gholie-dolls have been upgraded for this movie and they are able to see more detail and do more, but at the same time they are seeing more fraud than previous glozy movies. <br /> <br /> The aim of this movie was more comedy than the horror of this period. The film is a Lam's High School Comedy (though the film was released in 1991). This is the most humorous thing about complete humor and full movie. It's so incredibly annoying and not just funny. <br /> <br /> The story is not going anywhere with his story, and the film is simply a big mess, which never ends. Ghoulies plot line involves the characters of the movie, the movie seems to have nothing to do with everything else in the plot line. This movie is not about terrorists in Ghuli's college, they are trying to find them with people and stop their anger. There is no big surprise in Brent Olson's only written film. He is not only a talent for him and I think he has also discovered it and instead he has returned to college. <br /> <br /> even when compared to previous galley movies; This movie is just terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
