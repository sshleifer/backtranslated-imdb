The first thing is the first - though I believe that Joel Shuva's best intermediary director and more often (such as here) badly, the lion's share of the allegation of a ugly rebellion in a film must definitely go to John Grisham, whose novel is based on it. <br /> <br /> Set up at an indefinite point (50 seconds? 70 seconds? Now?), the film has become open through a child's rape and murder, so that they reassure their racialism through red racism. That "at least we are not that bad" ?? Girls' father, Samuel L. Jackson, the horrors they will close some strategically, before shooting their cold blood guns when bad boys are coming to Katghor. <br /> <br /> The setting was a 'deep south' which was probably not existent - some black letters live in shakes and cotton seems to be chosen, the Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version Klansman) is ridiculous in their villainy. Set piece trial: For defense, "good boys" - A milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey is acting by his assistant Sandra Bullock's breasts, though as a coma (he does not seem to serve any other description) and Donald Sutherland is necessary Drunk-lawyer-who-sobers up-to-fight-as-good-fight For the prosecution, Kevin Spacy goes through the speed of the giant spoon, when the city is bigger, the cross is burned, the witnesses are scared and do not care about the local citizens ?? <br /> <br /> Here some reviews claim that the movie is immoral, because Samuel Jackson must believe in the power of the law instead of closing the weak-moving piece of a murderer and Matthew McConaughey's conversation. . To be honest, even though the offensive message may be "Viaglandant justice is good", everything is frustrating about the film: Characteristics of cruel, acting leadership, direction, screenplay and conversation are almost parody. Peter Menezes is disciplined, 50's Cinematography is beautiful but derivative. <br /> <br /> and it goes about half an hour !! <br /> <br /> What is left to say? It's 141 minutes of someone's life wasted, it's tiring, empty, and hammy, and, like atonement, it's morally insulting.
