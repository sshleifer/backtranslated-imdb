The actors are so happy that it's almost impossible to tell them completely (Paulin Cole says of the movie: "Actors have names, but they're really anonymous"), and special effects are really bad. Recycling the technique that allows them to imitate weightlessness with hanging people on the wire and dance the "Royal Wedding" roof to Fred Astaire (but these people move quite well to see it believing). <br /> <br /> The bottom point of the movie is the character of another "industrial giant" character coming up with him at the Chandra-Rocket Consortium, when an aviator, yet one of his avidly watched cartoons shows how a rocket works at the second grade level. Explains it! (And think Robert Hernan worked on pornography ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is the production design that manages to communicate with "Wonders" sensitivity and even better to the producer's (George Pala) The movie "Kain World's Claude", which played the same bad performance, but it is much more entertaining. However, the best science-movie flick is to be "Time Machine".
