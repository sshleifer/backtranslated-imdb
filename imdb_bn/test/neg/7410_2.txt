Some scientists and an aircraft carrying a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary discovery, fall into the Pacific jungle. The insurance company operates a rescue operation, which is owned by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriensen), a huge corporation owned by prototype and a father of a scientist. There, the group is five miles away from the expected position and finds the remaining part of the machine and residue residue. Furthermore, they realize that Saskatcheck, one of the big legs, is pursuing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I do not know what I'm doing, to spend my time in this trash. Directions are horror, the actors and lines are terrible, 'predators' and even copying part of 'The Blair Witch Project'. In order to summarize this film, Andrea Roth's character Marla Lawson was wounded, and her guide to the operation said that she needed injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea makes her jeans unheard of, and the guide says: 'Nice boot, but the shot should be in your arm.' Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Saskatche, O abominal' (`Sascatch, The abominable ') <br /> <br /> <br />
