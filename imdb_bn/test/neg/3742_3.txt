There were some interesting parts in this picture, but in most cases I want to go ahead and want to change the DVD and see "Malibu", which was in my own collection. At least I knew some fun coming and giving me some viewing. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget film. And I do not judge a movie by its budget. It was just a lack of originality and was very predictable. I do not even rent or even watch this movie, and I'm usually a repetitive criminal on the film. The actor forgot. The story was thought to be half, and it kept me with an insatiable desire to humor me. I look at Jamie Kennedy's White Boy gang gangsta for getting comedy frustrated.
