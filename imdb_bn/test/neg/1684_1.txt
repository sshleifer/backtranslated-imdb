This is probably the most annoying show I've seen in my lifetime. It's the most indulgiblably most annoying and stupid show I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, in the first place, this mess does not mention season. The script is bad, too bad ?? It is usually both impressive and immoral joke that you see in R or NC-17 movies. Especially for the character of young age where he enjoys what he does, which is ridiculous to the family? Casting is very awesome, because what you see is really really a BAD actor, time period. <br /> <br /> Final Ward: This show is actually real torture !! This show provides an illustration of how unlawful parents (mistakenly use power instead of understanding). It's zillion times far away from reality. Kenny will listen to a god to hear this comparison of giants. Looking around the washing machine, your eyes will not hit as much as this show. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 0/10 (Grade: Z) <br /> <br /> Show is so bad even Cast Mao showed his daughter.
