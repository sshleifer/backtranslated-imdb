This movie defines the word "confused". All actors remain true to the script. More kindly, because of the fine acting, but the script is a confusing pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytical random ideas. Pansing slowly, slowly and soft-focus-lens cinematography quickly gets on the nerve. I out of 10 out of it 10
