Sometimes, changes in novels are not necessary just when making movies, but a good thing. However, in the case of Northbourne Abbey, this is a very, very bad thing. The story itself does not shiver itself, but the mockery is completely absent from the movie. It is also a blend of romance and comedy, even Austen does not touch the quoted commentary entered into his work. It fails to be funny or satirical, and instead his fiction turns into the character's attraction in most plays with the world. <br /> <br /> This also affects romance. It's annoying and purposeless. Chemistry and interest are not established. Tilini has been attracted to Catherine because it is not entirely absent from the picture, the audience is amazed by what she sees. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon, if we get a more reliable version of Austen's mockery.
