It was a great movie with many people giving a great performance with Hoffman. I went from halted wrestling, boring discolouration, almost walking out. There is not there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman has all gone. She is committed to performance. But sometimes he sees an affected man as visible actor as visible actor. <br /> <br /> There is not much more than placeholders in a movie other than a Captor - Nell, Jack, Perry, Sean, Sheriff, all one dimensional <br /> <br /> Yes this is a caption of manipulative, prying, betraying parties Shows up It shows them many times why I started thinking - Why do filmmakers think we need to spell everything out? And again? And again? It often refers to Captain's talent but it does not show up. This shows him surrounded by fans and surrounded by flatatrerets, but why do not we believe? <br /> <br /> But my goal is not to cancel the film. I'm sure others will explain it. For me, this is a two-hour movie that felt like five.
