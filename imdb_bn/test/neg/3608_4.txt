Emperor's new Gravi was a great twist for Disney. It was not a musical! It was clean, fresh joke and no political twists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The year-old still loves Emperor's New Grove, but Crank's time fell asleep. There really are no conflicts really (that is, first movie, all lead to endangered adventures). Due to lack of contradiction, it often seems that animators threw the writer and they uploaded the story. <br /> <br /> I was waiting to do something that would make the movie fun. . . And am still.
