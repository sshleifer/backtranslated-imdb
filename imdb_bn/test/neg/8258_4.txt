In "Red Letters", Quote was admitted as a college professor who wrote a prisoner in a female prison and received more than her application. There are two reasons to show this flare ... Kinski is one and the other, although their full speakers are difficult to shine such as a complete instructional disaster. Everything is wrong with "Red Letters" ... slowly, all of the subperts for loopy scrapple, camera, editing, and quote, etc. Potentially taken by a batsman, a story is taken and it is not worth a serious faulty and amateur flash time.
