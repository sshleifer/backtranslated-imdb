What is a waste of a great shield? I'd like to check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with quite well known artists. It was an unmatched collection of annoying intertwining stories about various characters with at least connections with each other. Characters that look like honest people, but not one of them is a favorite or interesting feature. Calling it as a comedy was a busy one ... The only thing that made me shiny was Jack Black's song, which is mainly Tennessius D. I was waiting for something big, but more than 97 minutes of my life was wasted. .
