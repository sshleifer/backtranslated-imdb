Heart of Darkness Movie Review: Which book is a good book to illustrate the deeper meaning of the book, can it be a well-known book for her spoken words and complex ideas? So far, that goal has not been achieved. In 1993, The Heart of Darkness attempted to be made in a movie, but it was a failure of the book. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to create a book in a movie. Always worry that it will not be as descriptive or has the same meaning. So why novels, The Heart of Darkness, have been made in a movie, I'm stupid. There is so much details and hidden meaning throughout the entire book. While reading the words simply, I think that a person would think it would be very annoying and not symbolic. I think what happened in the movie; The film has only torn the story of the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie does not follow the full story of the book, big changes were made that I thought the movie got worse. For example, manager Marlowe and the rest of the crew did not go to the boat with the spies instead. I suppose some large plots have been lifted and lifted the great fraud of the manager of the cartage relationship. Also, when Cartaz died, there was no steamboat, especially the whole journey became more vain, which became boring after a while. And when Marlow was speaking to Curtze's drunk about his final moments and words, it was not as close to as descriptive or important, drunk too could not have been able to make such a mind. <br /> <br /> As long as the acting goes out, someone else did a better job than actor Mafumu acting actor. In my opinion, Cartes was not very bad, and it was an important issue in the book. Also, other characters such as Marlowe, Manzner, and Feyen do not judge the characters that they deserve for the book. Their performance was not very exciting or memorable. After all, I do not think that this book should also be tried in a film. I think it's better to use some of the themes on the line in the Apocalypse now a different story line. But to follow the same exact story line of the book, it just shy.
