In July 1975, I was in the film for Dallas filming. Whatever you are watching today and allowed to create movies, they were applied to this movie. Movie premiere, clothing, special effects, acting. It was all ahead of its time. It opens doors for movies like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now people see it and they say, "This new special effect can not be added to the story ..." It did not have any computer graphics and new movies were not available these days. It was a story, and a wonderful cast, and a director was a hell! It is Dallas's World Trade Center, and the Jail Building, and Ft. The Water Water Gardens were the most modern and future backdrop that was in the movie. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future which was defective by human desires and weaknesses. This was my first movie experience, I was the first of six films. It was created only in Texas, because it is not an excellent part of the filmmaker's industry. See it again and appreciate it again. This film was based on the foundation which sets standards for many great movies which we now enjoy. Well, my hand is burning ... I managed to escape. Santhury is waiting ...
