Well the plot is entertaining but it is foolhardy. To make matters less, a cop / dad wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get a transplant from the criminal (Michael Cutton). <br /> <br /> Even if a good criminal agrees, he escaped to the hospital. The transplant was going on and police and police were not allowed to shoot the culprit to save his son. (Dead criminal - no transplant-dead boy) <br /> <br /> Well, this movie does not have any brain in the movie, unless they hear any Tazer's words to kill the criminals without killing them. The end of the movie, it's as simple as it. <br /> <br /> But when there were some crazy and stupid people, including 2pops and some doctors' death, they were burnt badly.
