Apparently the film has a strong anti-Bush message ... if it does (I did not get it), that's all. It's annoying and vain, period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is the opposite of it Too much to be, and vice versa. I was surprised at how bad I could suck a film. <br /> <br /> I literally saw hundreds of movies, and I am never forced to do the warning in IMDB. To avoid all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "Making Off ..." is a pain. It's just hateful with jokes loaded inside the camera, it's like a home movie. There is also a part where a person takes you to a tour of food set by filmmakers. Still, I think the movie hits ...
