I saw House Part 1-3 and I love them but that was not really funny. Firstly it can not be a party to a party without the Kid Party? This one sucks more and it was more like a black version of Bueller's Day than a House party movie. The second person who hits John-John? This new character can not even compare with the other three movies. Now let's find out why they put them on the live video. It does not have horrible music, weak plot, continuous actor and no funny joke. My suggestion, if you can not sleep, watch this movie at night. After the Haiden Party 3, the series is separated from the Kidane. I hate this one that does not have this movie in my local video store and does not want to buy it or see it in comedy central. Just because Chris Stroke has the talent to manage an up-and-coming R & B group does not mean that I'm genius to produce talent and film, or not? Finally, in most of the films, female letters were equipped with a cheap two-dollar hookah. Due to the failure of this film, this flick was separated after one year of release and nowadays all have forgotten. This movie is simply plain old on the simple terms !!!!
