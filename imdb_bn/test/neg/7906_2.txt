"Soul Plane" is a terrific endeavor in the comedy that can only appeal to people with thick crows, bloody eyes, and animal climbers. <br /> <br /> This plot is not only incompatible but also not existent, most of the acting is fired for a poor measurement with a gang of highly disgusting and terrifying characters with sub-subcontinent, Jokes often march forward and almost even a bit amusing. This movie lacks any structure and looks like a junior generation older than 50%, it's just what some of the beautiful ladies are, but in reality if you want you to "rent something from the adults" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can not see anything here for you to recommend here, because you probably have a lot of good and productive time, behind the rats with a slaghammer or waterproof tibags or whatever you discover. <br /> <br /> 2/10
