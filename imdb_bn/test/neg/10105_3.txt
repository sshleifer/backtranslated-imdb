OK box looks attractive, opening great music and its kinda original, that's all right. But when the movie starts ... well it's not my first videovv movie, I've seen the ghost lake, and it's worse than this, apart from it. At first the story seemed interesting, but the whole film looks like a movie shoot by a bunch of university students, especially that I smile, looks like a red and white mix of blood, it seems like the effect of the fire in the monster face. This is done with a program that I can buy at my local computer shop. All movies are shot on the day (for movies supposed to be horrific for a movie) and there is no gore (1 scene scene and it is not so homemade and trustworthy) and not near any blood (it can be considered a great thing) blood Considering the appearance of the show) and 1 giant for the whole movie. The story is not going anywhere, it gives you an impression that it never starts, creating an inexplicable view to give the average time of the film (when the dog searches for the dog for about 4 minutes) ...) is very slow-mo thing Well just this movie is one of a Z series and a very poor tell. All the cool ideas lost themselves and you get a Chess movie. It's been annoyed for a long time and I'm not the guy who gets bored very easily with scary movies, people like me even dead, and u are alone in the dark from the blues, and perhaps you know the name to be the worst manager but here is the fun Like a few people want to make a movie it looks a lot. Plus the Spanish speaker for us (hard English I like to watch movies in my local language) there bad translations in normal videovill. In ordinary movies, you are not saying actors (you have to check the lips etc.) can see that you just have to hear it and you know it. Very chessy
