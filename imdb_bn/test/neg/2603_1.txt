Everything about this show is terrible. Its proven to set up yourself to get cheaper laughs with even worse writing. An "Inconsistent Family" -theme has already been used many times, especially by the Simpsons, which is a great show with great writings and many laughs. Meanwhile, every episode has a family story about five minutes, most celebrity jokes and random flashbacks have been cast. Now, if it was real or funny, of course, I think it was tricky. But no, it's not all funny. Actually, episodes are the only reason, because this is the easiest way to easily crop it out after the junk episode. This show is mostly unknown, and the original is just lingle. It is curiously unreasonable and overwhelming, it may still be good if it is still intelligent. Animation is not everything, but from an artistic perspective, this show also fails, again proves that the family Guy tries for as much as possible comedy and easy shortcuts. People enjoy this show and I really do not care, because people can enjoy anything of them, how much they look for the minimum general index. But no, I do not recommend it, especially if anyone wants to study one day or want to be a writer. This low goal is that cheap entertainment and this success have been found. This thing is not saying anything bad about America.
