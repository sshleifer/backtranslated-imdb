Beautiful visual and fights do not have much better movies. And that just happened here. <br /> <br /> First off, admit me, I still play FFVII (I wish to order it). However, I did research to make myself familiar with characters and stories. However, not everyone is lavish about such searches and the arrival of children claims that knowledge of FFVII is required. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible scenes I can not say that many new ones We saw it in Final Fantasy: Inside the spirit, and along with some good movements, I can not say they did many super-courageous stuff with this. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene - well, they are a bit of fun. Nevertheless, we could never doubt any result of them. This was one of the annoying classics - there were three fights with bad guys, followed the standard method (hero, cloud, gets destroyed, then he gets almost there and destroyed, and finally won). Because I say it was a boring classic, it used to be a great deal, but in this case weakerly executed. I'll touch that later. <br /> <br /> The English dub looked fine to me, even though I did not see it in Japanese, so I will not judge Japanese, but only English will judge. I'll say it - I've heard a lot better, even in my limited reporter. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot Um ... what the plot? Let me be free, this movie is not an advantage, but an opportunity to see FFVII characters on the big screen with a fan service, beautiful ID candy. As I said earlier, there is no reason to fight. The opening war is never explained, Kadaj has no intention of wanting any real motivation for destroying the world or doing any bad thing. Cloud is sitting around the motions for the whole movie, and most of all get a compulsory movie. <br /> <br /> Really, FFVII was an accessory part. Arrival is anything but children. If they managed to make everyone play some significant stories (Star Trek: first contact proved that it was possible, I could add), it could be better. Naturally, the plot that could change, which makes it honest, is set to be even better than what we have received. <br /> <br /> letters are usually unused or forgotten. Avalanche members (who work on Cloud Cloud FFVII, 2 views for those who do not know) (Vincent can get 3 and fewer in Valentine's case). Hell, bad people get more lines than this boy, and it's too bad. <br /> <br /> Music ... Well, if Nobi Umatasu is not God himself, then the time is bigger than this image. Advant One Wing Angle was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he can not decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with electric guitar). When he switches from one side to the other, it seems like he has taken the sledhammer of your head. <br /> <br /> And at the last moment whether this movie was epic or funny ... it tried to be both, and unfortunately failed. Indeed, all of you please and can not do everything. The film tried to be deep (you can go to epic and deep, or fun and deep, but three more), but failed here too. The last scene, which is a memorable event for a baptism, seems to have been cast there. You just do not have to shake your head and cry there will be a Christian. The scene was not only included in the film (and Arthur did not attend too frequently - he is dead Jim!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A giant frustration is short. Because of the beautiful visuals, I can give it 2 out of 10
