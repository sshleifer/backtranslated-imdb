Did they cast and crew on medicines before filming? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing was filled. When co-star was late for dinner from the first scene, she had no doubt where she was and what she did? There was from the mystery. Now it takes 85 minutes before solving the mystery. I must admit that the biggest hole in this plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how excited the screenplay, director, Christian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rhea could not at least explain that our murderer, who is not a lawyer, or A policeman can go to a locked cell in a prison, kill his second victim, and feel like suicide Can see him surrounded ??? I was amazed that if I could sleep from unhappiness and miss what happened. If someone can explain it to me, please ... and then why, for God, he killed the third victim? Nothing has been interpreted ... and yet some people think that this movie was worthy of official selection in a film festival. Perhaps it was a comedy and I failed to laugh.
