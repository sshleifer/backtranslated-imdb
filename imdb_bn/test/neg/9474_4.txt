First of all, on my chest, I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. It was so frustrating that it was so much more likely and it was a very good opening sequence, unfortunately it posted all the preliminary sequence surplus. First, there was no plot to start with an excuse to say Moore's curiosity. Later there are some sequences that will make bond fan cringes, for example, a bomb could explode in a bomb that could spread the bombs worn as a garment. Villains are very poor, Louis Jordan's Kamal Khan and Bollywood's experienced Kabir Bedi fail to make them as equally as poor as their conception. It is interesting that when people debate over the worst bond movies and octopacies neglects their surveillance while running for their money easily.
