"Death Wish 3" is a shooting gallery equivalent movie. All characters (of course, Brunson's Paul Kirsty) are killed just as "excited" (good boys) or "protest" (villain). The director only turns out to be a victim of ruthless violence (burning and wrecking people alive) even "commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothered to protect himself from enemy ammunition). Supporters of these short stories (and, apparently, many, too) will enjoy it, others .... be careful. (* 1/2)
