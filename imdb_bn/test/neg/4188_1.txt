My hijack is in my pants because the idea of ​​this movie has made me so angry that I have crashed myself. <br /> <br /> Once you see it once, you look at the confusion and fear in the TV set. Then, there is a soft tap on your shoulders and a voice herses, "You will die within seven days." When you turn around, when this movie was offered to your blockbuster, with the perfect hatred for it, there is one of your best friends standing there. <br /> <br /> I will not lie: this is the worst movie facing the world. I saw this with my 5 friends with an 18-year-old son, and it was our reaction: - A person was actually crying and torn apart - a person cried out loud - a man stood up and opened the front door in front Seeing an hour later - a person has become easily black (this was me) - a person is a volunteer and a farmer Both the Ortos syndrome, as one person went to a separatist trans and did not respond to our voice for more than 20 minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really bad. There is a part in which the cameraman is actually traveling (while holding the camera), but the producers decide to release it. Seriously, when you hit him on the ground, you can steal him and swear. There is only one special effect and it is specially a disabled child trying to solve the Rabies cube: The camera is rotated so that the on-screen action (Action, N. some Dammas is lost in a field field for 80). Freaking minutes) Rolling a barrel. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should this look, and the film also warns you about this fact. Do you know what is the tagline behind? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly believe that the public is a sickly practical joke in the part of producers for the release of this film. But it does not have to be said that if you see it in the movie store, it must be passed - look at it to see some other poor dryers. Instead, buy a copy of it, you can get your hands and match people you hate.
