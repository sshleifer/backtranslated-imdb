It has been a long time since I saw one of the worst movies (and I recently saw Starships Trupers 2 !!!) I could find nothing to break this image. Acting, which is probably the best aspect of the movie, it's fair. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character personality Dennis Hopper does not think what he might be. Vinnie Jones's pronunciation is bizarre. A positive thing that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. His performance is quite poor but I doubt that shes there. <br /> <br /> The conversation is really terrifying. It's quite simply garbage. I do not know who signed this, but later they would get professional help again. <br /> <br /> The reason for this picture is that the IMDB ratings system should be able to include zero star among ten. To avoid all costs.
