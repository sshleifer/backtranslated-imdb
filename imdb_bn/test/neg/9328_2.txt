Well, after seeing "Start", I thought why they burned the Scrador version and made the poor. But now, after watching "Dominion" I understand this decision deeply. Even they did not do it better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really shit. Some good moments, but a really annoying story-story and some big plot-holes are killing this movie. <br /> <br /> I've taken a lot of exaggerated stories and in advance you can make it a lot and give viewers want to see the references. But there are so few in the movie. The effect is really bad - even the TV standard is not.
