Okay, I can sit in almost any movie and I can get a real kick from Saa Fi Fi Origins, but this movie had a big flaw that forced me to shut it down in half an hour. <BR> <br /> After being served in the US Army, there is some hope in a movie with a military. If the audience expects to enjoy the real experience, there is little similarity to the military rank, uniform, and terminology. The "Bats: Human Harvest" was a character wearing a character that faced the wrong side of Lapel and later the movie was listed for 11:00 hours, but it was completely dark outside. Although the script is fully completed, and the conversation is spectacular and acting Oscar-worthy, if filmmakers do not care enough about the film, then the military must also be bothered to find the right way to show time, why does anyone try to see it?
