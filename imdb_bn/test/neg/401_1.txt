My wife and I saw this after dvring this double last action off of last week. It will be the worst horror blow we have ever seen. The predictable dialogue (my wife and I was guessing the lines before them), the special effects of hockey, a screenplay that went away in all places. I think the most annoying part was the stereotyping of characters of plot, not to mention unwelcome sexual scenes between the two young heroes of the movie, there was no real purpose other than a specific part. Their anatomy for the camera This movie should be classified as a comedy, not horrible because the film's villains (spider) animation is at a stop and not least believable. I can not say that I did a good job to make myself a film, but it was very amateur and even "B" was not in the movie, it is possible near the "D" film, or "F" is possible. I think science fiction 3000 will even pass this one!
