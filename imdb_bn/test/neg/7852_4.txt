Paul Munie and Bate Davis have been supernaturally aborted, when the inexhaustible studio hack Arkee Mayo feels confused and unconscious in this ethnic provocative film, who achieves his "outgoing end" by following the separatist attitude. Heavy handover and weakly-produced film falls within his own weight within the first fifteen minutes of his control of the control room, which it never recover, like Mr. মুন্নি প্রায়শই অজস্র ফ্যাশনে দৃশ্যত চিত্তাকর্ষক চিত্কার করে চিত্কার করতে শুরু করে <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> জনি রামিরেজ ট্র্যাকের অন্য পাশের মেক্সিকান আমেরিকান যিনি স্ট্রেট ফ্রন্ট নাইট স্কুল থেকে আইন ডিগ্রি অর্জন করেন। In his first major case involving the automatic accident, he only showed disqualification and quickly advised by his good heel opponents and stupid judges, who recommended that he would be dissatisfied. Angered by the hazard is a rage that takes a job in a gambling joint where he likes his style of friendship, which he is owned by the owner, Starlight Roark (Eugene Pallet). The owner left him in the place but woke up problems with Mrs. Roker (Davis), who wanted a piece of Johnny. তিনি চার্লিকে হত্যা করেন, জনিকে সংকীর্ণ করেন এবং ধীরে ধীরে পাগল হয়ে ওঠেন এবং উচ্চ সমাজের সাথে থাকতে মুক্ত হন, যিনি ঠাণ্ডাভাবে তাকে "বিভিন্ন উপজাতিদের" নির্দোষ বলে মনে করেন এবং এটি কখনও কাজ করবে না। When he escapes from his anger, he drives and dies in the car. Ramirez makes casinos justified by selling casinos back to their own poor neighborhoods to stay with themselves. <br /> <br /> There is a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugly story of Bordertown as well as this disrespectful emotion. Like his minors, Munir Ramirez becomes so despicable and arrogant, that it is difficult to show sympathy for a bull head to sleep. Davis is no better than a faithful wife who matches the same adolescence with the movie. His Lady Macbeth crazy scene does not indicate that he is going to be the best actress of his era. Margaret Lindsay is cool, remotely and flat as Munir American Dream. <br /> <br /> bardartauna as bad (and it's too) is an interesting indicator of the attitude of the bar and remains acceptable. The rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired aspects.
