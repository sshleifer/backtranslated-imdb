There are good movies and bad movies, and then there's Moscow Zero, it's a movie so badly that it costs a month for an entertainment dealer with a single entertainment entertainment option. <br /> <br /> About the entrances of hell in a tunnel under the tunnel under Moscow, the film is undergoing a repetitive and nonsensical shot, tunnels, red lights, and scary shades of a little girl, which is a threat Can not mount. Or pull, but instead elicits feedback from the audience "they go back with the girl (or the lights)". <br /> <br /> Directed by Maria Lidon, because of the reason that I could only end up as a shame, as Luna was an American cleric named Star Wins Galoie Owen who traveled to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rad Sarvezzyza), who is a friend And colleague, who was absent in the tunnel. He mentions the help of a series of locals who, with the exception of Osaka Akinsin, Spanish actors portrayed the limited success in confusing the Russian language. <br /> <br /> They cross the road by way of the way underground leather-coated religious mafia, which is headed by a portal wall killer, whose carrier seems to be an open collapse that seems to be such a drake and Henchman Sage Stallone (Sly The son of his son), who seems to have been cast, only the name of the stallion can be included in the film's marque. <br /> <br /> As well as watching the trump, trying to find their way through the tunnel through a fun drawn map and following their repetitive shots or facing a pale eluded young girl, does not go too much. Conversations switch between English and Russian regularly, actors often turn back in every language, and the whole conversation is thought to be half of half the half and it feels like the only visible reason, adding depressing levels to the audience. <br /> <br /> Only Moscow Zero is right, but its title, which can provide a more accurate description of this movie, if the word SCO has been omitted.
