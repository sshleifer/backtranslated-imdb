This is a direct-video, but the story is not as bad as one of the critics. I mostly like Hero doing the wrong thing. <br /> <br /> The reaction of the hero and the reaction of the rebels is only human. Hooper's character is actually worshiping God. This may be the right thing, but no one likes it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the God player is killed in the death penalty, and the hero, who lived his life, can live. Great morale :-) <br /> <br /> I have seen that the most unreal thing, the earth is doing so well that no moon determines its rotation.
