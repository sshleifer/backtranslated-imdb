This was made for the fame of gods in 2004, what is the state of special effects on our industry? What is our rough near the edge but still good actor? The actors of this movie were incredibly terrible, one or two were not bad, but the rest, thumbs down the biggg I could not stand to hear badly written dialogue, that is, who wrote this article? Please do not write again! Special effects? Do not even start about special effects. Eyes in the eye socket are completely fake by seeing the green balls of light, but they can definitely get better. It looks so old and telling the truth! The easiest thing to look at even simple ... teeth, they looked so fake and stupid I would often wipe out a tear from my eyes. Let's not believe that it was shown to even the people!
