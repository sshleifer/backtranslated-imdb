Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged critics, I was surprised to see that almost all of the initial reviews, 38, rated this movie 10 ratings. After comparing with other great movies, these critics think that Quick and Cindy is a 6th session (8.2), Savings Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) And Don of the Dead (7.8). I hope these rocks use their next discounted lasik method, which they hear, because it is completely clear that these reviews are false. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film consistently combines a unique concept in creating a Zombie Movie. On the sad and fast-tracked review, it is clear that these reviews were produced by people who were both engaged in production, or were interested in the marketing / financial success of the movie. I do not think I'm more than listening to a part of this movie that was shot in Texas, eventually, the complimentary posting was approved for the film. The zombie film / horror b is a forgiving group, but the film is sadly out of release. Characters are recycled, and the plot is poor. The labeling of the film quality camcorder was not bad enough, and at least they used a film quality camera. The starring actress, Clint Eastwood, who wants to clone, is trying to fail. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the main actor's name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only similarity to Clint Eastwood is that the leadership uses Eastwood's name "Wood" in the acting style. Zumbo makeup was above the quality of the Halloween party, but fully disclosed cast members are not fully implemented. Zombies are not made in their hands to allocate. The plot was so big that it waited for me for a power offsite, a DVD disc, or these zombies would pay attention to the managers. Maybe the image is valuable to some viewers, but not for my hard work. Thankfully I use this free checkout coupon to check out this DVD. Perhaps this movie will be preserved by note entertainment, the special collector will release the DVD, which will stop loose errors and supply the promised product ??? How do some, I do not think !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Let's hope their next release, The Flesh Caper, is actually a "protector" of a movie. The 5th generation Recycled version of the Censo genocide in Texas is not. Folks went here ... but only if you care about
