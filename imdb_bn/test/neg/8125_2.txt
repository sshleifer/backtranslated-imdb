I tried. I really tried to think of something that would achieve higher ratings than these two. I do not "get it" it is not - I'm a big fan of Asian movies. The truth is, children in film making, long-term, and painfully disconnected. <br /> <br /> I think if you think of Alfred Hitchcock's school, "do not tell them, show them". Then you can try to praise this movie, but you will still press. <br /> <br /> First, the terrorists attempt to try the consciousness in the style of the gene-loqua garde and fail in it. Edward Young understands the basics of the technique, but he is very illiterate. (Perhaps he got better with age; I still do not know that I have not tried yet another young movie.) The point is, he will not say "do not show," that the story really helps to stop the procession. Sure, he got some visual arrest images, but they do not draw the story together, and they do not help to make it even better. In addition, the main idea behind the flow, consciousness and "not show," is not to say that the audience will be able to create their own insights with correct images, correct plays, repetition, and strong relationships; These are not the right numbers, but stories can be corrected as the progress of each story and every director should strive for mutual activity. Meanwhile, Edward Young is strictly disappointed. Visitors are constantly on the perimeter. There is no reason to consider letters or objectives, there is no reason to be emotionally involved, and there is no reason to be really careful. Finally, the young man lost the story he wanted to tell, the film itself is not telling the story. His art goes from one direction, but like a big dog he can not control, he is constantly moving towards the border, trying to return to the way he wants, it is not naturally followed. This is the most annoying example of the end. The end should really have happened at the moment of husband's revelation. Finishing the book focusing on the movie, (and recently, the possible completion of the movie) has already been told to us. If Yang wants to end in that moment, he would do more powerful pieces, leave the viewer mysteriously - what the story is or what the story plays, or does Yang's "real world" play differently? Viewers are asked to think about this, interacting with the audience that Young is painfully needed. Instead, what is he continuing to tell what he is saying? Regardless of the main character, we do not have to know more about his parent, and Yang will not need to tell us that if he does not bother him, instead of disturbing him, he will start with a more engaging and deep character. <br /> <br /> Why does Yang prolong and torture her movie? Get them some more "visible shipping images." Movies are really suffering for it. It wants to end, it's a conclusion that feels normal and leaves the viewers uncomfortable, but instead, yong shocks. Instead, Yang creates a complex ending that leads to the audience and constantly asks him "So what?" At first end, that one ignored Young, that was good. Second end, well, I thought "So what, who care?", Because it is not something that has already been published in the story ... but the end? That was really a waste of time. The "true" end not only scratched me, but I also felt that the story was objectionable. Young Babelgum-Mellanololi-Nying-Tied presented a possible good story for the conclusion that he always insisted. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the movie is nothing to do with the film, but its production is next. Sabbing (see if you subbed it) is horrible. Long sentences stay up for a couple or two, while having smaller ones up until long. Also, Yang moved the subtitles from the screen, changing the quick image. This is one of the rare incidents, that subtitles should be able to remain on the screen since the image has changed, since no dialogue is running.
