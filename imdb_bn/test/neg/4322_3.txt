Spinner Ahmed! Mamie (Lone Chaney Jr.), a college student of New England College (Ramses Ames), has opened up to explore, who raised her beloved Princess Anaka. Slow, slow (even in the 65th minute - it moves slower than Mommy!), Played indifferently, but is worth waiting for the end. Mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and as she dives into a swimming swift both slowly. This is (I believe) the giant girl found the only time in the universal giant movie! That aside, this is strictly amateur night. Probably the worst mummy sequels - and that's saying something!
