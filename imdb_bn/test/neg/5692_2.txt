You see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you going to think? Battle the spaces with cooling as the hack explosions and shooting each on each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you can get some good wrestling in space, but most of the time, fools can not just walk around doing anything. No one at all !!!! What is this dirty?! We get a ton of narrators, and british computers, but it's about it. The main drama I've ever seen is the worst, because he has no conversation, and the scene (silly!), Though the sleeping clock. Some things are just stupid, as they use a rocket (want to move) on the basic transport plan, why not use one of the nifty spacecraft? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with some annoying disinterested solitary samples, but what you will notice mainly uses the ships of atari sound effects ... you have to have fun with me. I can say that the budget was low because everything looks fake, which is not what you expect from a movie, especially a super cool space war movie. I seriously think the budget is so bad that it will be in two digits, it forces you to laugh much more than avoiding it. I started thinking that they paid money based on how much dialogue they've made, because they are very few here (if you can not already say it on my main screen, like I've said three times earlier).
