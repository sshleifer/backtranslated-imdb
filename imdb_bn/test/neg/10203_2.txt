Hock Hogan and Zeus terrible wrestler and awesome actors. For some reason Hogan was popular enough to get a movie deal, I do not know why. This stupid movie would never have been created if Vince McMahon was not meant for money. Maybe someone will do a good movie about pro wrestling. Not Holly Barred is not that movie.
