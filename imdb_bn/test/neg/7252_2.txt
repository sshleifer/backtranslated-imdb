I do not think these military and military militant numbers of Turkey can be beaten. This mess is made on everything cheaper and the soldiers made really look stupid. For example: At the beginning, the 2-Star General Lieutenant gave strategic advice and took it for granted. Leigh The map used by the map shows the enemy position, but apparently there is only one single narrow valley (though the map has shown dozens more) for the battalion's progress. The back guard takes the position from which they are clearly visible and open to the enemy. They make our heroes pound from the high ground but this higher fire power makes a difference. A single enemy tanks move towards the end (at the beginning of the name of the armored division) in the end, it is driven by a single infantry point (!) Which gradually moves slowly without the scout of the area, then when it goes ahead, it saves It thinks the tank exceeds - one of the most bizarre views. The soldiers entered the cave. There is snow and deep snow around them, but a yard from the entrance to the cave is not like a deep lotus, which they often travel around - the stability of their feet stays just a few minutes before. The survivors then slowly got on the chest with the river to return to their unit. It is deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yes okay <br /> <br /> and over it. They order positions in the highlands, they keep mines near their positions and do not warn each other (!) At the beginning, some soldiers are credited with the Congressional Medal of Honor. Was he blind, or did the director just ignore him? I've never really seen the most perfect soldier. <br /> <br /> One of them roams his bayonet with a bayonet and finally breaks his chin into pieces. He has announced that he should qualify as a surgeon. Now that's funny.
