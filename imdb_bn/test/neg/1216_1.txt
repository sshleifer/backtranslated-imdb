I want to think myself as a bad movie connoisseur. I think most people can spread films for the longest time, I can easily tolerate. <br /> <br /> But there are exceptions. I can only remember three movies which I was unfortunately seeing that I repeatedly used the Fast-forward button for large parts of the story. Those films are the glorious Gaga, Siggs Knight, and this little shit, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of Joues Ripoffe, it falls on the scale. There is no real-life story of the real crocodile of Deep Blood, not even the incredible impact of the sea serpent, there is no commentary on the three tornado. No, instead we treat people with a random failure of the '80's Citizenship war crimes tribunal and local sheriffs with young people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This celluloid waste dump does not have a minute of original shark footage. <br /> <br /> Usually, I, or someone like me, will read such a neutral review and say "cool, I have to find a copy!" It was the same idea during my review of other viewers on this same site. How Much I Was Wrong <br /> <br /> Collect the dust from one bad film to another ... collecting dust on this sand ... instead of catching the Great Maligator, water is hidden for some evil purposes.
