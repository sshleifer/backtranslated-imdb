Do you know yes Family Girl started as something fresh, funny and more original. Random humor used to be fun. I actually thought it was the best animated sitcom beside Simpson. After watching new episodes for the past few weeks; I grew up being irritated with the hugely popular show on random humor from funny. The South Park was right about the deaths of FG during the time when the manzuts and concept balls were raised. <br /> <br /> And seeing the program itself, I do not understand why my parents like so much; There is nothing great about it. "Intelligent" humor is fun and if the show does not reliably, it was fun.
