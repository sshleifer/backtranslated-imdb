This movie got the difference between the worst movie I ever seen, and so far I have not given 1 out of 10 in IDDB. I'm stupid to rent it because of the cold HR giger cover art in the box. This covering industry is just about a bit better thing about these steamy pillars ... <br /> <br /> It was the cat boys fighting "freaks" in a strange but almost exotic amusing mysterious world where not in the city ruins / chaos, but apparently The suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young people to be embarrassed in other men's braindead frat organization. Most irrelevant performance with annoying characters, special effects, dreary, un-original scenery, and in all the production aspects, usually the poor quality of this Limon is always lost in my list. <br /> <br /> the last rating: 1/10 I can give it a blank if I wish. <br /> <br /> Noab Alex
