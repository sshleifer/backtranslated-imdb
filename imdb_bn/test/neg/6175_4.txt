There are many distinct problems with the movie "KillShot". For one, there are many coincidences in the way. Husband is a hunter and anyone can be hunted on the same day before the assassination. OK I'll take that one. The child calls the real estate agency, the woman who works and earns money when she comes to get money. All right, I'll take that too. Before getting cash, he decided to loot the killer, who did not kill him but decided to take his job. It is starting to get real weak. Then they show, that the husband is that an interview with his wife boss that day. There is no one but the wife and husband who have chosen to go to the vacant office. They make their way to the office and professional killers just guess that they are talking to the right people. It is only in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this movie so I want to talk. Why the killer did not kill the real estate agency only, I do not know. Why do not she shoot women in her verandah, I do not know. Why do not she keep letting that stupid kid walk all stupid moves and spit out a whole lot, I do not know. Why did the girlfriend movie even though, I do not know. He decided not to have gun pockets and to leave it in the counter, I do not know. Why did they even go to the witness protection program, I do not know. What I know is that the casting director has done a great job, the photography director did a great job, the location scout took a great position and the production designer valued every single meaning. So, for the good work done by the crew, my suggestion for the script being chosen, ensure that every attempt to kill someone by Hit Man is not wasted by a peak through an open window.
