A great cast, a fantastic CGI giant and a brilliant script. If this picture is one of these, it was not one of my worst movies I spent almost a year and a half. Unlimited chimpanzees with unlimited typewriters have not yet written full text of Shakespeare, but their waste paper has appeared in this way and it has become a movie. You can say that the actors reprimand those contracts with every word mutter in their cameras directly. CGI is amateur in extreme and could have made more excitement to cast with the Sinclair Spectrum they have been made. I wanted to like this picture, it was a nice camomo appearance by Gil Girard and Walter Koenig, so I hope a fun horror movie that does not take very seriously. It actually tried to take itself seriously but as much as fun as a trip to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this movie, you simply encourage them to encourage them more.
