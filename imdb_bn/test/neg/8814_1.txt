I'm a big horror film buff, especially of the subgenres of the 1980's. Name one I've probably seen it. Last year, a new horror film that was slipping under the mainstream radar, the "So" theaters were supposed to hit the theater. I was excited at the middle. Without hearing anything about it, I think it looks at a fair trial by preview and posters (well, except for the back and the legs, behind and without shadows ... who just looked terrible!) I saw the movie the very first night. It was the worst experience of my life. This movie was literally painful to see mentally and mentally. Because it was scary? No! Because it was one of the most horrific movies, which I was ever dissatisfied with! First of all, screenplay and editing were completely violent by the horror movie standards. Hunter (Shane Smith) recently showed a flashback of what he survived after closing a sequence in an interrogation room with surviving a serial killer? Do not scary! It was impossible to feel any kind of tension, which was known that the above mentioned victims were perfectly right. Sure, the reverse-bear-trap thing was weird ... but why did I feel frightened at least bit, when clearly you showed me that the pain was saved? Unfortunately, the whole image was created this way. It starts with two boys in a cellar. Then, they show flashback how they are kidnapped ... not scary! Why? Because we already know what will happen to them, how we believe the outcome of this attack. They are good! Take the story! Even more unfortunately, the real story was best. I did not care less for this annoying, cruel excuse for "characters" and the act did not help. Kerry Elves was mostly difficult, and then suddenly she started crying like a lost child and imposed her American expression to keep her strong (did not work? I saw the audience that it was sewing). It will not even make him try a hard-minded and stupid decision-making even the most easy-to-do. He had other options. Good ones Memorandum Oens Even giving her intense emotional status (horribly through horrible acting), it was still illogical. I do not buy it. BD written letter! Furthermore, even when certain sequences played straight-through and flashback-free, they were painfully expected. I have not found my top-of-the-topping waiting for the continuous stupid sequence to wait. This happened for the whole film. I saw every single "turn" coming. Twenty minutes into the film, I have already called the assassin's identity, as if his connection to his "associate" is seen as such, he has not been linked to it. May have been able to overshadow terrible scripts well performing. Instead, actors may also eat "red-hare" or "decorations" flip across their foreheads. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was completely angry, even broke a part of me. The life of this movie, and the whole theater fiercely fiercely laughing at the fierce end. Really, you think they are watching a Monty Python movie. I used to laugh, I was not so angry at the film and I failed to do anything to do that. When we left, to talk to the theater manager (there was no joke) to get their money back (not to happen). I was absolutely positive that the film was going to be a box-office bomb. The next week, you could not have imagined to hit my shock in the "So" box box and everyone was talking about it (most people who found "Napoleonic Dynamite" thought to be an inspirational epic story and thought of some kind of "satire" rubber Was). I am so sick to hear that people appreciate this movie that I often feel that I am going to get reversed. This is the most weak and easy-minded recreation of mankind. Who is threatening a trickle by finding a weird garment and dolls (this is a doll?) How so terrible?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I "Friday 13th" Everyone owned, loved my Splatter movies, I thought "Napoleonic Dynamite" was ridiculous, not enough of Freddie, Michael, Pinhade or LeatherFace available, unknown horror gems and font size for the rank There dhi "slipaoye Camp II: Unhappy kyamparsa" in my top 10 favorite slyasaradera. However, I realize that these movies can not offer the most sophisticated American movies ?? What am I thankful for them ?? Fast, easy fun "Saw" is a cinematic garbage. The film tries to make a smart and semi-sophisticated, slightly elusive journey, and compromises time, money, energy and celluloid with annoying, annoying waste. All accounts are tortured. Each single copy should be incinerated, along with its weakly devoted fans. <br/> <br /> <br /> What do I look like? Before taking out my own eyes and before using my white hair and kebab brochet in my ear and colon, I can take a double shot of liquid splash. My rating: 0/10. To avoid all costs.
