This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell the truth. So incredible and worst plot. The acting was bad as well. I am acting in this movie because Bollywood actress and actress is not so popular. The script has a bit of a joke. The visual effects of this movie were excruciating painful to see. I believe a kindergarten child can do a good work of visual impact and a monkey can do a good job of coming up with a plot. <br /> <br /> This plot has numerous attempts to copy major Hollywood movies. Like the terminator but it fails unfortunately. I laughed my head off watching this movie. Total disaster in Indian movie history!
