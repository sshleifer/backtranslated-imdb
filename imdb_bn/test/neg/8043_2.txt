Disgust This movie has so many incredible plot characters that they can create a great movie in a great movie. Half of the story is decent, but the execution of the hole in the plot literally make it ridiculous. We actually believe that the Secret Service will go against all common sense and allow the US President to put an incredible risk. If the president's presidency indicates the right to pass judgment, we all are in trouble. Roy Skida played well as president, but unfortunately Patrick Muldoon's real cruel performance (which is based on Holi's good looks in any way, is working on HoliWei and whether it is a smart phone call for a smirk on every opportunity. Perhaps someone can see it and be inspired to create a good movie from the premises - or, perhaps someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can get the movie, then I can make it even worse!"
