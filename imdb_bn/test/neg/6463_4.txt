On Thursday evening, at 10pm, the ABC campaigned the pilot episode of the "North Exposure" taken on my local West Coast. ABC network usually used to "wind the trees" in the slot, but the program was exempted for live sporting events. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Being, reminds me of how frustrated the "men of the trees" have with fractured hybrid contractions. <br /> <br /> Hey Hey can be a good actress with the right stuff. Unfortunately as a writer who plays the grates on my nerves in a small town in Alaska. Perhaps I think that Hey is wrong, I do not believe in his "fish-out-water" character. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that supporting cast matches with the usual stereotype. Hot, relatively local, duplicate bar owner, Bush pilot, local police officer, slow but well-established radio DJ etc <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only stereootype that broke down is teddy bear and old " ER "actor Abraham Benjamin with the love of two different women as local Bartender. One of the executive producers is filmmaker James Mangold (his main characters in "Heavy" and "Cop Land" were big men), but I'm not surprised that Benruobi was thrown into a non-common land. <Br /> <br /> However, I can see why there are many dedicated visitors who love "man of the trees". It fits the curiosity niche for television viewers. I wish I could find out the best way to show his own voice instead of borrowing from the show.
