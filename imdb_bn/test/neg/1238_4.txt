I'm sure this review has spoilers, but I'm playing it safe indicating I can. However, it is unlikely that anyone will see this movie who is not familiar with this book. <br /> <br /> There is an old ad about bringing a tremendous manpower and a mouse. A mouse like "Commons moon". <br /> <br /> The novels pay more attention to Indians than Americans. Adhering to television, Maxmarty and Osana correctly said that the audience would be more interested in white than the red. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the novel that we do not already know about Gus, Udro and their friends. So the movie gives us a significant farce of what will happen to most of us in "Lonomov Dove". Indians who share their own story - they come into the background - so many people who do not think so well about the novel, why it is called the "Kamchand Chand" title. <br /> <br /> There are no complete story lines in the novel, or a lot of a "dot". This film can be corrected, Indians disappoint Americans to defeat their land and life, which draws disparities among Americans to bring "civilization". This opportunity was missed. <br /> <br /> Contrary to "Lonesome Dove", there are several enhanced views of "Kamchancha Chand" that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. Extended scenes with Indians were originally removed or shortened. And for a (net) four-hour film, it's noteworthy episodic and sticky. The script is essentially included in the clich√©d dialog, aphorisms, and platitudes. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show", it's a surprisingly bad script. Macmarty and Osanna had the opportunity to solve the story and character of the problem, but it did not. <br /> <br /> The best conversation in the novel is absent or changed, for no obvious reason. For example, Clara (Casey) shows the gross hate of Woodrow (Jack) for always closing with his "pad" by denouncing Goss (Ennis). Clarar's sexuality has gone a little disgusting. Then the scene where Ur-dire Woodrow warns Maggie that Jake does not allow Spike to "compromise". The novel exchange is short and harsh; The film tends to down-tone it, and Woodrot is not socially portrayed as a stupid, emotionally frozen stone. (When I read that scene in the novel, I wanted to stomach Woodrow in the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of them can be understood. Inish Skal's eyebrows are not cut; So expensive CGI would need to be. But there is no ice in Buffalo! (Perhaps it was unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to relax around this huge expanse.) And the character of Buffalo Hump is "candle and gentleman". He is not often violently violent in the novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing around this turkey is Steve Johan's extraordinary performance - not like Gus McKay, but Robert Duval's game Gass McKay. It is dishonored that he completely duplicates the dual method and speech system until he is fully "deliberate" or self-aware. As Duvall, he "characterized" the character completely. And he actually sees us that Gus is becoming "more guru" in the third part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great western, but a great American film. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who were at the top of Rachel Griffiths - in this way she was in the book.
