There is a specific irony in the Gothic style parody that has become a collision by filmmakers, whose story was not intended nor was there any concern. All of your average family movies are present- unfortunate young siblings, a scary teen who does not want to be removed, helpless parents who are unable to see the kidnappings, and of course a romantic sub-group. This movie is very common with Wild's original story, which was originally written to make melodramatic gothic novels, when all the rage was there. If the wald sees this version, he probably laughs - and of course, write a parody. It is only hoped that the child produced by this bland eventually hopes to discover the original version's intelligence and spark.
