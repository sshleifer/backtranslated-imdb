Nearly words fail me to describe the extent of this Irish Vanity project (both paid by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan payments). <br /> <br /> The real life Alberta was a star athlete, a wonderful Canadian woman (Kathy Runhem), for any other reason to ensure Canadian content. Credits give instructions for certain Calgary Payments. <br /> <br /> Everything here is badly illustrated and at least third hand (poorly digested trainings, lock stocks, snapshots and reservoir dogs are the most obvious stolen). Avoid like plugs until you play that camp, "so bad it's almost funny" in front of your telephone.
