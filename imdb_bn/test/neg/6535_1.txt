IMDB lists this photo as a comedy. I have no idea how the film falls, but it is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would not say it's a good movie or not. I know it's not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and there was some attachment to some ugly chairs I had found. <br /> <br /> This movie is not advertised. It is a film school trip that I can only guess to "think about people" purposes. I do not recommend this picture to anyone I know, even I do not know. This ridiculous drill does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> This makes me feel right. It seems to me, "If I were to come back in 90 minutes of my life." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who will create a generous desire for their global scene. This movie is valuable to them. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
