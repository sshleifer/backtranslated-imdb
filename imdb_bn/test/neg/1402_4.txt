I ended up watching this scary sad drama and realized that in the light of recent plays, those people who are least considered as abnormal are at least aware that life is tragic. How do I despair in this conclusion and offer to produce this conclusion, even if the presentation and outlook like presentation presented in this movie are implemented until some degree. But, instead, I realized that these movies have become very convincing "tragedy" when the same annoyance, the same family and friendships are gone, but they have some kind of reversal of previous family life (before 1950 and before that a lot Personality and character became increasingly fine with the increase) Instead, instead of how it actually supplied it with "reality". In fact, what we see is not effective, but rather a normal existence and situation that actually existed, but which we previously were unknown and thus ignored or at least <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only problem is that many films are trying to create this issue. And almost doing the same form so. When I read the movie's summary, I immediately thought about 'Ice Storm'. The family of Travis saw depressing secretions, which repeatedly endured mental semen, I immediately remembered 'American Beauty'. And, in some cases, the interaction between the parents and the middle child, the team, I met 'Egby Gods Down'. The 'fantasy heroes' might be the novel experience, perhaps an impressive person who is considered for the good imagery of the character, as has been said earlier, family films are often not allowed to exist (which we consider to be stupid) already in the 1980's In the beginning, 'General People' are seeing such relationships in the film and returning more than that Come). However, to the well-known spectators, these movies can not offer anything new. They became rather tired witnesses rather than many filmmakers, who can try to go out of the other family and they can pack in a family (and here it is extended to neighbors and friends). In fact, 'the fantasy heroes' is the latest of this genre (I think it has adequate movies to properly declare a 'genre'), in a family, so much disaster and sequence of surprises, that they will get reward for the prize day during the talk show host . This is the story of a family, tested by the older boy's suicide, a gifted and equipped swimmers who hated sports with passion. The little boy knew that Dad was shocked by the collision of his star boy's competition. And it is not clear that there was a lot of relationship between the mother and sister with the young man. <br /> <br /> This is not a little entertaining (some, those who find this element sadly after a while), and performance is quite good, especially Cigarie Weaver and Jeff Daniels. However, I am sure future filmmakers want to offer new ideas through commentary and insights into the struggles of family relationships (which do not seem to be conflicting or always high middle-class white suburbs). I would see no other difference (and consequently, no purpose).
