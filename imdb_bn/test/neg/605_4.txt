"When a killer calls" an unusual nasty slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences. This decision was clearly tried and conversations in most cases of "a stranger call" - often the word of sound - the phone call sequence from that movie. They seem to be very forcibly. <br /> <br /> Also, the filmmaker Cadillac (but all the most common) friends of the heroine is guilty of a brawling quarrel. So at the beginning of the film, we really like and encourage the bbiter (Rebecca Cochin's a wonderful credible work), but then she joins the Staash-Flick teenage friends and the mood gets ruined. <br /> <br /> Flick sort of works, but it's probably much more unpleasant than you expected, so be pre-cautious.
