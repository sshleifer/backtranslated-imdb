This is a terrible police story, because for some reason it is for a college college stud and for its partners. After reporting him to his supervisor, who postpones his emotional assessment, suspends him, he gets a chance to torture psychology, when he wages, he hacks the security of the department store and unlocks the door. Just, they shop with the weird, locked. Beard and Mahmud are fast, and the kids are still trying to survive till the morning when they may be able to escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous game' is likely to be a successful cat and mouse psycho thriller. If it is set in a different location. The psychologist police around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store did not just work on counter thinking. Especially when he encounters his flychin hunting quite frequently, and still, in most cases is not serious. There was no real clash that would be enough for such stories, and if it is said that can work well, for example, teenagers walk around and leave to save themselves against this strangeity (especially if it takes some days when they are increasingly paranoid Makes ... though approved, even clipped). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Characters. Despite Villain's madness, even a light hearty adventure can spread through the photo, it can also create a more satisfying picture. Instead, it starts fresh, and there are lots of confirmation actions, but wound up verging over ridiculous.
