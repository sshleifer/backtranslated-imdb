At the beginning of this film, I suspected that it would be a bit more common than B-Science-Flickr. However, as it progressed I started to get interested and I saw the whole thing. Courtyard is interesting, original, and has a classic making makings. Alas, instead it ends a middle film, which, by normal reasons, turns a bad movie into bad movies (bad acting, low budget, etc.). If I was remade with good actors and a big Hollywood budget, it would be interesting to see how it would turn out.
