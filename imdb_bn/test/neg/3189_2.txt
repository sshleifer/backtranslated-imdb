One night on MacCull, you want to think of it as a hip and cute black comedy. It's a crack dealer overtime like viewers push its "quirky" character and "shocking" situations. A gold digger named Jewel, a man who stole a man and sometimes gave birth to men to kill, so he can do so strictly for those faithful possibilities. You know, it will not be a bad strategy, if he follows rich people. The film really wants anyone who believes that spending time with a dirty con artist, Bartender and Andrew "Dies" Klei. Please The main errors of Jewel's schemes really get this stinker (and that strangers) the only entertainment. Seeing it, it's not hard to believe that there might be a good movie in it. McCullough could not decide which one could not decide at one night, so a dead man sat in the middle of the road like Arandilou. It tries to be sexy, but no clothes are removed in the camera, and some scenes of body head are terrible pedestrians. There is a repetitive scene where a Hitman is asking how progressive (played Matt Dillon) with sexuality, Jewel. It seems that Matt does not know, the audience is not. Why is he dating her? Makul's one night wants to be funny. Sorry, malicious coincidences and misunderstandings do not work on the company. The worse thing is that this movie is actually going for the dark atmosphere with the comedians. Kind of like a sophomoric coen brother film but his shallow script could not play subtlety, and sledgehammer his lazy drawings into any shock. What the viewers left behind is a movie that seems too busy to please everyone and loses no appeal along the way.
