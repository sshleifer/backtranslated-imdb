Above all, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst manager ever, Plan 9 is not disturbed by outer space. Coleman Francis deserve that title. I present the exhibition B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film has an amazingly thoughtful search, especially in the year 1953. The last 15 minutes of the film is not bad as well <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no problems with this picture. Bella Lugosi was completely exotic, intoning strange lines. During the poor times also, it was not sure what was happening at that time. The performance was firmly wooded, though there was nothing worse than Universal B movie time. The long dream sequence in the film was completely weird; More like an unexpected menacing kid than a dream sequence. Allan / Ann Kahini, the original focus of the film emphasized the quality of it. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst manager ever. He was able to at least make a social statement, at least being able to portray this movie. When Coleman Francis tried to do it in the Night Train to Mundo Fine (Occidental Red Zone Cuba), it just ended in disarray. Glenn or Glenda are at least watchable without the help of robots.
