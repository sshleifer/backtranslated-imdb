Other lowest rating critics feel a bit to add so perfectly to have this summed-up summit up. I think that only during my visit to my children, Kony Fith was fitted on me, who emphasized on Sunday the public observers. My God, it's boring! Like all soaps, it seems unlikely that the characters are completely unpleasant, unlike it's ten times worse than the next tenth worst. Critics who were spouted by critics' laugh at 'true life' critics were on the spot. If someone lived in such a social environment, they would slash their wrist during the day. And I can not assure someone who is truly familiar with the end of the past, rather than 'nationally rich' rather than you can ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this Nadir of the British TV industry. It is EVIL
