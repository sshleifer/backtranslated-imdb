I would recommend it anyway. It was stuck in the midline row of a theater, so I could not go away and see a part of the porn screen (except they did not close their clothes - it was physical language and of course language). I said I feel embarrassed. Filing was very low budget, no good dialogue Ish Actors have played with the exception of the two best characters? (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hooper. Kill Bill and the old movie memorize them with their sons who congratulated their confectionery. You know what I mean. blablabla The filming was vase and just a very low quality. There was no one in a theater that liked this movie and people around me were small and tattooed.
