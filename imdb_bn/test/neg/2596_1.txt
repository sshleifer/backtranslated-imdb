There is so much shame that so many people sing "love" family, because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV, there are many points here. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks: Now, in season 1 and 2, I think there was an exception, flashbacks were quite frequent, and in fact there was some plot and even fun. Now on season 4 and above, flashbacks are happening more and nothing is done with the plot, not funny and really long, annoying and meaningless. The Family Guy thinks that the long drag scene which goes nowhere is funny, when it's really poor writing. Steve: Wow, British, the child that sounds. That might be fun? It's incredible that its character is so incredible. In the first season, Stevey remembers the worldwide domination and killing of Loy. Well, now that scene is strange with Bryan. <br /> <br /> References: How can they continue to make poor references to 80 TV shows or events? Well they reuse the same old garbage. You know, in 20 years, hopefully the family Guy will be canceled, if they are still strengthening the show from the 80's show, it will be more irrelevant than before. Because it will be forgotten. It still makes me wonder why they can not just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> voice acting: My God, the voices are so poor. Seth McFarlin should only focus on writing his crappy episodes and voices should be stopped. Already all the extra words of Family Guy episode of bad family. Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to make all the voices. Some of them sounding 15-20 characters ... everyone is very different. But the family does not do that? Oh well, this is a painful show. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Get a cheaper laugh I can not believe that the family Guy can not tell ordinary people to laugh at their "joke" Objectionable: Okay, small and easy, the family man is able to break the barrier and cut the edge, but really they fall flat every time. Take a tour of South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible plot: Plots and story lines just disappear and trash. Simpsons has started to have their 20th seasons still better plot than family pie. Flashbacks and drag scenes for a total of 8 or 9 minutes, which do not have any relevance. <br /> <br /> Popularity: Children of many children have stevy shirts and feel so funny when they really do not get too scary sex jokes. They just say, "Oh, haha, stew!" When they do not get it. The Family Guy has been rejected twice, and brought back by DVD sales, how sad that. I was rejected for the first time after the second or third season, and I honestly believe that it should be done. Then those episodes were fantastic back, they should lefta on a high note. <br /> <br /> The drain scenes and collapse have a very visible way. This past Sunday a person Peter went to an executive bathroom, about two minutes spent by imitating the role of Jurassic Park, and the plot of that episode was stolen from Safefield episode. Also Chris is working in a store and a scene while talking to a worker for about 5 minutes about a movie, which also features stuttering features. Chicken wars are so powerful, 3 of them, each end and last In vain, unreasonable writing, people think that people enjoy long scenes of chicken wars, in a chicken, yes a chicken. Now, every time someone falls down, and any family friend, however, can enjoy this, that every time they fall down, under a split second, and they always having their hands on their hands on their handsome look. Guess, it has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Everybody thinks old Pandville is funny, when it's just a very bad moving gog. They have gone singing scenes (which are very poor) and even the length of the whole episode around them, they did the same with other characters like doctors, I know there is an episode held around them <br /> <br /> <br /> This Simpsons Well, there is no need to explain here. There is so much evidence of family members stolen Simpson's jokes. How family members are just a poor people Simpsons <br /> <br /> I'm sure I forgot some key points somewhere, but I'm sure this family is really a terrific horror written TV show which is enough to prove. Everyone seems to love, when they really see the Simpsons, SafeFields and Fraser watches.
