The director spent most of his time trying to show original scenes from all the historical photographs and all the words of the old Western blast. Producer and writer / director, Michele Simono was very bad, who had spent zero time in what historic events of Johnson County's war actually were. There was a lot of wars on how public land should be used for beef. The cattle do not want to cultivate the land of poor vendors for this cold, air-borne plateau. The whole epic does not refer to pasture sheep, which was one of the main reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scenario is the war between farmer and tenant killers. A lot of Indians are shown circling gunmen like a bunch before the Hollywood movie. The true story is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, a man of 200 to 300 men, captured gunmen and kept him trapped in a barn in the farm of T.A. I suspect that any woman has blocked the blockade. <br /> <br /> Allen (also known as Algal Kate) was hanged by a litchi mob nearly three years before Johnson and his second husband, James Aberrel, were attacked by Johnson County. Ella was never a prostitute. It was a canard to distort it by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSAGA). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no events in events, time lines, or character backgrounds. More than that, actual names of people related to the county's war of war (and the events going forward) will be used by Michael Simino. <br /> <br /> If this is the case then the movie could be more attractive. The political objection to the intervention of the federal government between the state government's intervention and how the WSGA gunmen were saved through the cover. Some attempts were made to prosecute fishermen responsible for Johnson County Attorney. But Johnson County can not afford court costs and Woming's governor, Amos WW Barber, WSGA supported, these allegations were eventually dropped. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the movie was an excuse for only listening to the Isabella Hupert DVD version three and 3/4 hours naked for the running period.
