"Electra Glide In Blue" is a slow-moving B-Flick who murders Black Desert Motorcycle Police, who wants to be a genocide detective and is involved in the murder case. The best is a medieval film, "Easy In B" band, some members of the band, an intensity of action, some philosophical, and lots and lots of annoying dramatic fillers. Not worth the time
