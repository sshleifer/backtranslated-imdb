Incredibly frustrated The speed was slow. The characters are incredible and completely feel totally annoying and unfulfilled just across the whole film. There was no real plot that moves you around the movie and is interested in you. The Hijst itself does not reveal any tension and although it does not seem very good. <br /> <br /> No character had enough depth or background, and I was eagerly waiting for the character of Lawrence Fishburn, unfortunately, Lawrence does not have an impressive barbarian game of ideas and a lot of choice as a favorite character. Columbus threw me out of one of my favorite actors, with his performance, his character was dark, and you can rarely see what his argument happened. <br /> <br /> The only character I think is Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petelli of Heroes). Although his character is very small and incomplete, I think his touch has been added to almost all soft pictures. <br /> <br /> If you want to find new ways to waste your time, buy DVDs at the conclusion.
