I know this type of movie sells tickets and gets the film makers, but it will not work as a movie about Vietnam. In the days of Vietnam, those who were alive every day were scared. <br /> <br /> This picture has made Gin Hackman bigger, which is the Korean War Vector, for which the anger-tagged Vietnam Vets group has been allocated for training. Returning to the country to rescue a group of American paws held in a camp there. These men died of a former tunnel rats, a crazy acid dripping sailor, a blonde-laden surfer from California and some inexperienced baby (Patrick Swayze) who just happened to have died a little bit. They train first in some camps in Texas and once they find out and lose all their arms. They are able to find weapons to replace and continue their way to free the captive men. Most people are found and saved, but anger-tagged groups are mostly removed. <br /> <br /> This movie played like a video game which you can determine next to what is going to happen, and who will pop down what the basket is, and who is going to die, and who is going to live. Vietnam I guess is not like the video game ....
