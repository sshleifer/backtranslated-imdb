After reading the reviews I decided to hire the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical songs and want to know more about batches. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated. I think I do not know enough about love and I do not understand the importance of playing any music. <br /> <br /> It may be appropriate with the guidance of a music teacher who explains the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk.
