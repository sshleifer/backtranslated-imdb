I can not actually think of this picture a good point. The story is absolutely terrible. This is played whale as a carrot, and the script is so bad it is you want to kill yourself. Snowboarding is okay if you love (and you love to understand it) but you can enjoy the microscopy, because it has big mountains and some cool steps, but it's also terrible. It has some stupid ideas and it is racist with rival insults of both black and white people. The only time you smile laughing while you are stupid or you are feeling embarrassed for the film. I have seen many movies and I would say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie then I will bring you back wherever you bought it and give it back to you.
