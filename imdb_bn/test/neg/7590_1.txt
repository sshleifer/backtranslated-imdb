This has got to be the worst movie I ever seen. Where did the girl go? What is leaked with the potatoist's cakes? Just pushs it on the edge with stupidity. I saw it in Showtime so it still had soft core screen view. I have to say it has to smile off my ass. The 80's of 3D effects were very much from the place. An Invisible Cat and a Cutting Vertuquer are included. Wow I wonder who made this life really feel fulfilled. Wife acting actress feels familiar but sucks anyway His screams can be used as a torture machine in hell for more than retired Nazis. However thanks to the Showtime for super fog horror movies. I am always enjoying the time and the biggest waist of money I have seen.
