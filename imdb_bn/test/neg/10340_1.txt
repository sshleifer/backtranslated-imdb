I'm 22 years old now, and think of this movie in the theater seems to be the mind when it comes out first. You heard right, I was 5 years old, and I still remember that afternoon I still saw that many years ago. Was it a mysterious tour through the amazing world of creativity by Mark Twain? No, on the other hand, it was an obscure film about Dark Twain's dark, depressed, and actually suicidal side. A scene that still bothers me, was a particularly strange scene, where Mark Twain plays his organs in his funeral. <br /> <br /> Enjoy an adult movie? Well, there are some interesting opinions in this movie which can be enjoyed by Mark Twain's writing work knowledge; But trust me on this, "Adventures" is not a movie that you want your baby to use to introduce Mark Twain.
