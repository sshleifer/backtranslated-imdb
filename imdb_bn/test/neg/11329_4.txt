I saw this film once I was 14 years old, but I was thrilled by making a movie about the 45th Division. Oklahoma and especially now that 45th member of my two sons, I would like to see it released from a DVD. I can be a little favorable but the 45th section is sometimes not recognized as it is today's merit. Talks about WW2 and Korea History History always talks about other infantry divisions but you rarely mention 45th. When really stood up to me, the Indian code was one of the confrontational faces on the Tacchers and German soldiers when they did not understand the language. I'm glad that all the recognition of the local American code clerk they deserve.
