Diane Lane, Mickey Roque, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ... Although my opinion is not bad, they were completely destroyed in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, no unusual turned out, actually the whole movie was very predictable from the beginning. Mickey Roure was very boring sidemic, who did not bother you from the beginning. Rogerio Dawson was completely destroyed and his character was rarely in the film. <br /> <br /> I really believe that it is the only one in DVD movies, everyone who forgets very quickly, as shame as a film can be so good.
