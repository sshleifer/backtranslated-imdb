Well, I'm a huge fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkeley. I bought this off eBay's DVD for my boyfriend's birthday. We were sitting to see it and it was so annoying. I do not remember to smile once. It took about one and a half hours and it ended forever. Elizabeth though this is great though. Maybe it's because I'm just the big Elizabeth Berkley fan however. If he did not have it, I would have seen it but every time he came to my face. Unfortunately Elizabeth could not save this image. Only the whole story and horror comedy makes it a film that will miss you one hour and one and a half years of your life. This is a very forgotten film.
