Although Caspar Van Deeven and Michael Rumar have generally starred in B-movies, they are also on this film. It also fails to express the slightest perception of tension, fear or fear - until you are scared sitting in the rest of this trunk. The side is amateur with annoying cuts and flashing movements that hide the attack that there is no attack near killer hunting. And what he is a killer: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I love him when he is fighting Hen man. This is one of the most lazy jobs I've ever seen character design. I mean, the schoolboy! And he's on a horse! Is this something supposed to be a terrific, supernatural creature? How are we supposed to take this seriously? What we found is that the scene of this scene of roaming around the forest on the horse - which he could just live - is visible in the scene of the soldiers visible in the forest scene, they can shoot ghosts. Occasionally, if the skeleton strikes someone with an arrow or hurts someone, it will reveal exactly what effect it will be. I usually enjoy renting Sci Fi channels on a basic cheese layer, but this film is very inactive for any level of enjoyment. Where do the dolph Lundgren need ???
