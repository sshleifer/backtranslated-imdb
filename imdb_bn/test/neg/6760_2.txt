This movie has been standard standard for Mufti-Fi fare since the 50's. On his side, the plot actually led to launch an alien attack without creating the aliens. But now, if aliens need energy and can absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? Why would they just suck it out to star?!? The only credible reason for the presence of the Croatian is direct attack on the world society, not merely the collection of energy. It is not even said that; The Cronos may be built by a higher race but the earth is the most primitive of its activities. Ultimately, the plan for the scientist-hero Cronos is nothing but pseudo-scientific arrogance. It has become a joke in itself itself in the amount of "bad reverse" gambit which has been used so much in Bad Scifi. Lower and see, because this is our unwanted visitor to release his collected power. No power of light is concerned about the effect of this energy release (which is the end of the film, among other things, the entire yield of the hydrogen bombs). And unfortunately, at the end of the movie, the suburbs of Los Angeles in the neighborhood. Oops!
