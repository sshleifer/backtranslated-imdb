I must admit it, I love horror films ... especially the 80s slash film. Hell, I even like cheese like slipway camps and Demons of Night. But, I did not think much of this movie. Death scenes were not very good, CGI was terrible, and Huh-Hum was acting. The worst is the story which does not actually make sense. I'll ask to save your money but there is a possibility, if you want to watch this movie ... you're going anyway. I do not hate it ... it's just not very good. Overall, this is another great, useless horror movie that lacks life (it was not in the shelf of the Dimension for more than a year after it was completed.
