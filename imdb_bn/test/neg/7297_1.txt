Looking for a movie for your Turkey Film Festival? Roller Blood Seven is on the list of the ten worst films of all time. The plot of post-apocalyptic roller bliding samurai fighters, a narrow hajj-pajam of movie references from everything from Star Wars to Seven Samuari. Acting played blanduates from disrespect. The scene where villain mocks the old master, the tongue is embarrassed at the laughter point. Frank Stallone's Black Knight Mony Python and Holly Grill's John Clayes remind the Black Knight much more. (Advice Ward, Frank: When you do such a movie, your career ends.) I shouted at this little sting-bomb on the lower-level cable channel and I could not stop showing it. It's like watching a train debris, you just can not look away.
