To create a film about the second seat and third provision, one should have the right to expect from one another that they read the other two, or at least know the final decision about them and more about the day of trial. There is absolutely no relevance to the audience interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy in this picture - it is only associated with British subtle and obsolete characters in British British social realities and pubs. <br/> <br/> In fact, a true third rule for good candidates has been published many times - such as "Miracles in a Course" or "Conversation with God". They are all worried about new enthusiasm and angles for Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information on IMDB's rating is its number, but how many people are annoyed to vote. In just four years, only 387 people are annoyed to vote for this film. As usual, enthusiasts are most interested. To compare, keep an eye on "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - from the original version 1973.
