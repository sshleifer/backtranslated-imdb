I hired this movie from my local movie store, I really do not expect any flash or fancy. Since it was a "B" grade movie, it was made in a very tough budget. The film's opening scenes were original and that was the plot and which gave me the movie rent. But the movie became very boring and frustrating point. There was a lot of holes in the story and its frustrating part was also fair and at the end of the movie I was praying that a high power was going to reduce me, where I was very disturbed but more importantly frustrated. With how the story turned out I still can not understand what happened and I'm not particularly careful. In conclusion, Satan wanted to know that Hell (its domain) was used as a basis for such pornographic images.
