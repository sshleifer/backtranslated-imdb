I saw this movie six years ago and I did it again recently. If I remember correctly, for the first time I did not like it and I praised it for a second time. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably in a big budget. The effect is mostly top notch (except one or two "effects") and the cast impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, anyone should decide who should work as a crazy Russian astronaut in Peter Stormer. Being a fan of Sweden and Peter, I'm sure he can play the Russian character well. But in this case his performance is simply shameless, with respect to both line and acting. So ... something wrong with the script. I'd rather see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> The action scene performed on the page is so intense that it is often frequent. It is a total chaos that can breathe more than thirty minutes in a very short time. In addition to this, unlocking events are not simply believable. I would like to see a much more intelligent and fragmented version of this part of the film. Finally <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Finally, the action involving space shuttle is very action-oriented. Shutles are like muwevering, if they stop some car-shaped ice blocks like ping-pong balls, in some MiG, zero-distance distance. The director came to see Apollo 13 to learn the limitations of the spacecraft. <br /> <br /> I like music scores because it is very sensitive to dramatized degrees. The overall performance of the actor is great. Apart from the above mentioned things on the story is interesting and easy to follow. <br /> <br /> It was an 8/10 movie with some minor changes. I'm sorry it's not!
