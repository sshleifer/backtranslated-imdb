I'm a huge fan of the first four-zee-on projects. I own them, and watch them every few months. I lend to their colleagues and friends so that they can get good fear of making quality Japanese movies. I think Takshi Shimizu has created a great story, and it effectively implemented these four installments. <br /> <br /> I was a bit upset about opening The Grouge 2 in the theater. I saw the first American fault before seeing four origins. The blame was actually quite good. Of course, the values ​​are good, but from the 2004 American Grudge, I was afraid of good Halloween. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The thing that's amazing about Shimizu's Ju-On is the story. True, it is usually called a split style which you think about connecting its components, but it's still a great story. There was no story at The Gruz 2. It was a series of void deaths from letters that you never had time to take care of. <br /> <br /> The edit was tortuous. Controversial (as the Japanese capital) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the sequence sequence was tedious. I was just thinking, "It's so stupid," no, "no - did not he really sell so much?" It allows me to walk from the theater, to run the house and to see the original work, only assures itself that Shimizu always made this fool, generic, annoying, non-sensic, thrown triangle together. <BR> <br /> If you really set your heart to see this movie, I wait 2 months waiting for you to rent. Really Two of the five people went with me in the theater for about 45 minutes. I dispute about what that is myself. It's like a better way to spend my time cleaning the house while going home. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised how bad I was in this movie. Let's not give more cash to blame Sam Raimi. No more value now Sigh
