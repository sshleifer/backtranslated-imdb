It's a place to flick, or at least I think it is. To get infected with humanity through a sexy attack, you got a semi-nude female prisoner in a space prison and a demon prisoner at a space station. Her Friggin is ridiculous. The performance is so bad that the place Brown's Emmy Award looks like a winning movie. The story is simple. Axes prisoner got the opportunity to reduce the sentence by investigating a space station after losing contact with humanity. She "examines" with the doctor and finds a doctor of alien anger. He is so against them, and so forth. It's just a movie watching your pants wet with a humor. If you love the real science fic flickr, it's a non-nonsense, but it's a great mood for amateur filmmakers because I think their film is better than that.
