I saw this at a local independent station in the New York City area. The actor showed the promise, but when I saw director George Cosmos, I became suspicious. And sure enough, it was every bit as bad, every bits as dots and stupid as every George Cosmotos movie I've ever seen. He is like a fool of Michael Bee - with all the horrors of congratulating the promises. <br /> <br /> There is no directive for conspiracy, there is no burning problem calling for conspirators. Later on we left the rest of us to connect the dots to a bit graffiti of different walls in the film. So, the current budget crisis, Iraq war, Islamic extremism, social security fate, 47 million Americans without health care, postponement of wages and the death of middle class have all been reduced by the horrific terror of Graffiti. <Br> <br /> A really, stunning foolish movie.
