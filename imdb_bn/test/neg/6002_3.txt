Forecast, secondary, over-gimmicky, medieval. Do not waste your time - there are many good movies. <br /> <br /> Resurrection is okay but the plot is repeated quickly. The levels of my interest are constantly closed. At the end of the movie I was surprised and finally ended. Characters do not fully improve. The painting is a soft and fast-changed Pov rotections - although impressive in 1999, it currently only delivers the film as an attempt to replace the GI viej flash for the plot and character material. Film shooting serves some purpose of gymnics (expresses tension and anxiety) but persists overused and eventually becomes counterproductive. Overall shame - movies / stories were probably possible and the producers / directors and actors probably have technical expertise. A disappointment.
