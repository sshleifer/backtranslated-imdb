Where do I start? First, list the best things about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Michael Perebrand is as great as gangster Thomas. You'll be really careful about this single character and he's a bad guy! (Allthogh is not bad at all, and generally a nice choice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. He down here a bit, but he is still quite funny 3. The movie looked quite good by the Swedish standard, good use of the depth of field and lamp. <br /> <br /> Now bad. This is the biggest script to make it big on screen. Everyone else played was quite bad and at the top. The direction was horrible. A complete silly story, completely unrealistic characters and incidents and 1.5 hours long. Most of the time in the theater during the scenes are the sunny People start walking during the screening course. <br /> <br /> There is no way to actually make the story a bit, so I will not even try. Every clich√© has ever imagined there, and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry that this is one of the worst movies of my life. See it for a beautiful smile <br /> <br /> Try not to pay any money for it; <br /> <br />
