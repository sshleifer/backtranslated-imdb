Sometimes what you expect is OK. A film is not produced and is expected to promote high rank among artistic merit, for a rock band in the middle of the return and as a car- and in this case it certainly is not. Indeed, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film, which tries to illustrate 70's rock and roll lifestyle, it is characterized by excess, medicines and the highest top antics, but unfortunately, almost as much fun. Curl Dupre is a scripts desperate enough for the writer to scrape, and it is terribly terrible to destroy Edward Farling's talent, the only glare in this rock and roll piece piece is the most inaccurate, notably the widespread repetition of the 1978 KISS concert.
