Ocean 12 starts off annoying and gets worse from there. Like a celebrity prize presentation, every major actor / actress is presented in a brief 60-second situation, which seems to be briefly closed by inserting the "shining" sign for a short time. The first 60 minutes of the movie are incredibly isolated, badly edited, and sometimes completely unrelated to story and confusion. To tell the story, ... one, Kinda, ... but it's visible to all "look at me" for the shot and Camios. Only Matt Damon started "acting" during this movie ... The rest cast was present for participating only in a mouse-pack-winner-session. Hest, Action, Drama .... It was kept in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and it was kind and anticlimatic. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
