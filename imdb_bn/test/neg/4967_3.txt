All the boys seem to be sexually excited by Mandy Lane. All girls seem jealous in Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to be, and why are these spectators wondering? Mandy is very beautiful and every boy he meets is a magnet, but we do not know any of Mandy or the character of the film. Mandy accepts an invite from her student friends, an isolated farm. Three boys and three girls drink medicine. In the film, thirteen drinks torch like water and takes medicines to experience cycling trips. And, there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, one of the teenagers became invisible. However, others are all drunk and high. Someone, including movie observers, is not worried or anxious. Someone with the audience, seems to give an enemy. Emmett, a fellow student, enthusiastic about the whole incident. There is a security guard, Gart (played bold and nicely with Asass Mount), who protects and protects the guard. In the middle of the film, the killer was released, the taut was suddenly released like a wind that came out of the balloon. The event is completely hypothetical, and the film just completely fizzles out. Mandy fills his match, but we never know why - and, at the end of the film, there is still no sex. Mandy does not hypnotize the boys, or is she merely bore for their boys and girls for their death? This totally confused spectator can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of women and men's competition - killing malevolent girls and nasty boys. <br /> <br /> Mandy is worth all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levin) thinks, but these viewers do not think so. Potential painter (Darren Genet) has provided some stunning images, but in reality, its focus seems to be the focus, which is the most studied. All boys do not love Mandy, right? If you want to be quite indifferent to discovering how this film goes, my advice would be to sleep in the middle of the film, until you see Mandy and Gert's warm crutches. But, do not wait for anything. Yes, you guess it. Mandy remained a virgin, and still has no gender. I got this picture out of 3, but not Mandy. Why? Because the girls all love the gorat, and all the visible eyes seem to be on top of a compromise position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this film does not seem to get beyond a frustrating and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a lonely ranch, and sex does not happen anything. The audience is headed horror over a farm - and could not help, but why wonder?
