Matt Kvtik is a trusted communist of Pittsburgh Steel Mill who works for the appointment of staff in the party, although he isolate himself from his son, family and neighbors. It makes it even more difficult that the group is actually committed as an FBI agent communist to obtain information about party activities. The group is trying to create a strike, which will lead the strike movement to the workers' campaign of propaganda. Volunteer has had to confront with Eve Eerick, a party party teacher and teacher at his party school, which is a double agent of Covtik. When Eve learns the ugly truth about the actual purpose of the party, the red decides that she must end her life and help him in endangering Cobaltik himself. The film should have plenty of mystery and dual crossing, but this movie is rare but (according to today's standards) very impressive promotion and little steps or thrills. The main role of Lovejoy is very good, but he and the rest of the cast seem to be even shameless. Here are some surprising and how did this picture get the Oscar node for the best documentary?
