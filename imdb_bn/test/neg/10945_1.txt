Now, I like Bollywood movies and I am very happy to achieve the success of the UK recently. However, there is a deep flawed movie that started from the beginning of the last attempt of Sunil philosophy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Looked at the scene so that they never touched a part of the manuscript in their life. Appen Patel is very good looking people, and the film plays his narcissistic sensitivity, but he is sometimes not credible as a modern Mozart. In acting, he can do whatever he can and jute. His expression, hair and clothes all look the same, where he is visually 'dying', where there is nothing except his little sniffle. Belly Deol plays the role of Saliri, trying her best to enjoy what her small wooden script was, though, she seems to be jealous just a little mad. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bollywood movies are widely known for their stunning set pieces and color schemes, but Shakkaka BBC's great drama seems like a reproduction. In fact, the closest thing to the dawn comes to Holiakax, because it hides a very bad script behind the beautifully beautiful, beautiful, beautiful backgrounds. "He still does not have to reach the mediator" - Similarly can be said for completely forgotten songs. <br /> <br /> In childhood, there is no glimpse of the latest offering of philosophy, lips, walls or blurred. Instead it plods along its head held in the hope of holding your attention with a soft knot on the shoulders. And that's not good enough at all.
