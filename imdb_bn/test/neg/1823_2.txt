Only Lan Turner-Ezio Pinoza is unfortunate. Pinger was a beautiful voice but he rarely used it in a photo that reminds me of the adults of "The Student Prince". Pinjas are no leading people. He feels like an old man prepared to collect social security and prepare for fishing. <br /> <br /> This plot is extremely slim and the cast supporting Barry Sullivan, Margie Maine and Debbie Reinalds has been so small. Sir Cadric Hardwick announced at the end that our King Ezio would return to his people. As far as I'm concerned, the faster the better. Is Lanana Turner really singing piano? It's not bad if it's him. The film reminds me of Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivieran through the 1960 movie "The Prince and the Shogara".
