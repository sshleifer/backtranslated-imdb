Junk pieces, if I could do it, 0 it Animation is good, but not good enough. The story is absolutely ridiculous I've ever come across, and that's a lot! This 'movie' has tried very hard to be attractive, but unfortunately failed. It almost as author started a story, then got another idea, and tried to fake two together. Do not waste your time on this; Believe me, I will stay with you as I was. James Woods was the only actor of any such note, and his part was best known as Peripheral. I'm all for working stuff, that pushes the envelope, but this simply does not cut it.
