Sharing the money and the time wasted! I thought Govinda in this movie? Govinda ... Dude ... Your big fan, you have to make the right decision now to choose a movie? I wonder if he had any role in this film. Govinda's role can be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar stole here! Akshay ... you rock! Has made the world a heart! Lara Dutta, Tanshuhri .... Your sons are good. His sunny lalesh Rawal! Overall there were a few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise I was thinking, "Prioradosan made such a stupid movie?" However, let's wait for upcoming movies and watch them.
