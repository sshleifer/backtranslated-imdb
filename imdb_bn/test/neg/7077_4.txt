Star rating: ***** Unsupportable **** Very good *** OK ** You can go out for a meal instead * Avoid all costs <br /> <br /> Title Adam (Mark O'Halouran) And Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in Dublin's slums, are searching for their daily living standards of daily living, which will make their day. The way they try together with close family and friends, they try to get together and they are destroyed for years. <br /> <br /> I like to drink a lot of Irish people, but it looks like some of them have a problem with heroin while watching the beauty of their film. I know there are drugs problems in many parts of the world, so another ridiculous thing about the subject is not entirely unexpected. <br /> <br /> I did not see the last Irish film (It seems that this film was shot in a style that I saw from any film!) and judging from it, I probably would not be as illusive as their humor. The picture is rather fun, but it is definitely another comedy that is not afraid to raise near-fake smiles. The mentally disabled boy looted behind the cheek was sure that what the junkies could do to feed their habits, but then it is absolutely hateful and I'm not sure whether it was like dark humor but in no way did I smile on my face! This is very contrary to their previous actions, where they show their softening diminished child. In this light some people may find the last sorrow, others can see it as a dessert only. <br /> <br /> Overall, I failed to see this movie. I did not see any motivation in the story. It just seems really elegant along with the audience involved in any way. Like the trainings (which deal with the same theme!) It's been an unsuccessful attempt for most part of my life despite having a very low 83-minute running time. Two real life for one day is not really enjoyable than following junky. **
