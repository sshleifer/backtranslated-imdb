I was ready for a crawling Tiger Style film and all the years I've seen the worst movie I've seen. Baron von Muchhausen was almost as bad as Dead letter Dead acting. Everything is dead <br /> <br /> There were some good battle scenes but the positive side was over. If this movie comes to your home, run scramming on the phone and dial 911 and say, "Please have a movie in my house so that people are forced to commit suicide"
