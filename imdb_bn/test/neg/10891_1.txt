There are movies that are so bad, they're good. Then there is a film like Streat Stop that should never be made simply because it's simply awesome. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, unlikely characters, anticipated plot and the supposed supernatural twist that does not add anything to the story failure. Some half decent special effects are worth mentioning about the item. <br /> <br /> I can not even write out the plot outline because what I really want to do here does not warn you to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother with this film. It's 1.5 hours in your life that you will not get back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
