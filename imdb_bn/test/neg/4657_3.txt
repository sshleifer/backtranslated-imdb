I agree with Jessica, this movie is quite bad. I wonder how anyone took it seriously. One-dimensional of characters, even good guys and especially bad guys. The only qualification here is so much hair that it is fun. Actually for me, there is additional benefits that have been shot from where I do not live in a state park, so it is hard to see some local visitors on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The main character is the off duty policeman, and a good person makes a big point of speech that the trial is not just a bad idea, it is against the law. <br /> <br /> Most of the films of North California are dry-cheese cheese balls, it looks like they were never in the war. The story line is completely expected. This film is ripe for lampooning a MST-3K. CAMP value only I am generally sorry for movies, but I had to talk to see older positive reviews. It's a dog I got it out of 10 out, and then only for laughs.
