Frederick Forrest's books are always very complicated with tweets and turns, and usually finish a great surprise. This adaptation did not have any of these. <br /> <br /> In the book (the history of gravitational history and traitors agents, plot to influence the outcome of the Russian elections), what was so large was completely absent. Adaptation. Instead, there was a young man who has a whole new plot of Bio Arms Surgery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The joy of his book has always been machinations to convey their missions. This image resigned early in the gunfight and in the car. <br /> <br /> Sayez's beggars violated a sign around his neck that "I am a secret agent". And with all that attention, it was amazing to take that time while taking him to bad times. <br /> <br /> Some power is allowed in this film, so I will give it a "1" instead of a "3". It was great to see some unused people like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope that some people will again judge in the film adaptation of Forsieth. Jackal's ".
