This scary story of crowd revenge is not only very interesting, even Ed McMahon played a strong role as the main bully. Gymoria Hendry has been effectively effective, Gloria Hendry again proves that she can bring life to even the most important role and Brock Peters is honest as a copy of the book's cop. It is still shameless and poorly constructed, and even printed on cable now estimates its original James Brown score.
