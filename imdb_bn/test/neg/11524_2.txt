I hired this movie because I'm a huge Doodieff fan. I evaluate it may be bad The boy was wrong! In the 15 minute mark, I started to tear the DVD to others and bring them back to the rented shop, but they refused. They swore that it would be better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This movie was lacking in everything. The actors distribute the line with many emotional as their soft rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was disappointed that Hollywood thought that people were fools enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice is one of the worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After seeing the footage of the wrong plane, the bad guy was waiting to get a shot, and the clips were empty and everything was missing, I wanted to scream. Head over concrete. The film hit the ignorance plate when people in the space station used to travel the elevator. Space suites are not needed and the astronauts are in space regardless of what they can say. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie and I hate it. I do not want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I could plan to take revenge on my cerebral cortex I through it.
