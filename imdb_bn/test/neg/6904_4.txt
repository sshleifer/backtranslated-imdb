Let's see ... a few dozen Gary Larson Gaga, as well as its illustration style, potentially hardly harming the character of an Armman character, more than the indifference of the industrial direction of Pixar films, how much of the form of the country in the elephant graveyard in the middle of the Lion King-Esquier Villen , Oh, and after ten years after any possible relevance, Joke The kids (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a shield for parents. Another weak effort from Nikkeodian Films to look at animation blasts. I really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, on a rendering, really a character, a script.
