A very small view of Debauw has a bathtub in the film. She looks absolutely stunning for a lady of age 56, but this movie only presents grace. Otherwise, this is a silly, unsupported script and there is no appeal by Chief Actress Deniu. The director apparently watched many Peter Greenway films and Pola X came across a student of Greenway Style, without his inspiration.
