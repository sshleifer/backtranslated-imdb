This movie is a world-wide window of Britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, fag and birds. When I was at Pontinx, it was portrayed, so I found out where one goat's holiday was run, and what we left behind. For example, 'Plot', Stan and Jack's vacation camp (25 weeks a week!) Expresses concern over the pursuit of a job, thereby chasing young women and surrounding Blacky. They join the rest of Stan's family and some of the smiles are Arthur (Michael Robins) and Olive (Anna Karen), as well as the strange curiosities of Blackie, but the idea is that younger women can see anything brilliantly Stan (reggae varni) or impressive jack (Bob Grant) is only spectacular. His time is ruthless enough, now it's just a curio from an old age.
