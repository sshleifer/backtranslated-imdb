I went out after the movie began (because I saw Juliet Levis on the screen). This script initially seemed to be very complicated but the movie continued, but it became clear. I paid attention to it but the result was frustrating. Because the content of sex is unnecessarily used very much and I think that the Director is the opposite sex. I can not make the script well-formed by my opinion, ignoring the people who have this opinion. We look at Caste, some of the promises of the movie or something I was expecting at the beginning ... and finally ended ... the middle is so middle that I could not expect. The main character wants to give a message about the birth of Kadradra's baby and how a baby changes a life, in my opinion that the scene is a real disaster for the film. All the characters are all funny and beautiful acting. But can not only save a movie thrown.
