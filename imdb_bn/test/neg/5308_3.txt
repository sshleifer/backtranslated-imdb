If the legendary fiction and shortness is not available, it can be a perfect film. When I say this, I can say that none of this movie is its own unless it is a great conversation or a cliche full view. All the lines like this I would say, 'To get the rule of this harmful continuity, do not say anything more than me, all the jokes like Steven Tyler have worked very horriblely and do not need to and for Christina Millian, man, do not start me. Some great actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman think that they are trying to get down with the kids and the hip, and because of this film they have lost their reputation and I think the best role is to rock my favorite actor Vince Von Alongside acting. This guy tries to make fun of him with a raptor conversation quickly with the funny person. The Credik Entertainment and Andrey 3000 play another horrible dual role {I personally think that background actors were good. Cedric one over and Cedric's only fun part, Andrey and the rest of the gangs are the way to kneel there so that you can definitely see the boxer there and the only reason I can see this is because many people really do it. So in conclusion, this film tries to be fun and unfortunately fails, there is no new element, comedy or coolness that it copies all the other movies, and finally you see that the only reason it wants to compare how bad it is for relatively predictive . Get short. Oh yes I finally forgot to mention a big clich√© mention.
