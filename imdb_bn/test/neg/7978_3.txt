Yes, I never thought I would write the four words above. But, actually, he's the height of this little flick. <br /> <br /> When I was paid the movie was packaged, it seems that the girl is abducted, but she has no medicine, it is a comedy. Keeps her stable. It sounded like an intelligent idea. For a few years, we have never seen spelling in 90210, Donna Martin and endless parade of shameless, ruthless TV movie. It seemed like an opportunity to expand its little, and considering its TV success and its wealthy grandfather, this movie can not have any financial reason, I think it took part because it must be a low-budget gem. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, the story is a short story, and a few stories about the story of a mentally unbalanced abductor. When she is not on screen, the movie crawls so badly, I could swear that it was more than 85 minutes listed on the tape. If Spellings' story dominates, it works better, and it changes as the romantic comedy of her and Phil, which is at least excited hijackers.
