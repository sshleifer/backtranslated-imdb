This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is supposed to be a rebuilt or updated "One Armed Terror" by Chamber Che. Ham-fished direction and crude warfare mean war footage is not too valuable. The script tries hard to think critically, but is full of cliche, "And I knew that it would never be the same ..." or "If only I know that I have to pay a heavy price." Esse! And who is the girl singing? Nobody found him and his cleansing !! She is awful If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you will be well off with Lau Gar Leung. These stinks.
