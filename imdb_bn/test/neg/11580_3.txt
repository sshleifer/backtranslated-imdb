A group of amateur journalists and planters hold a secret government project on the remote South Pacific Island, the project carnival winds. Scientists are producing giant-sized maize, but genes have spread among other species, unusually making the big comodo dragon and a cobra (bullet-proof and under swimming water). Can they run away from the island with the help of a scientist girl and tell the world? Even if I did not see this movie on the Si-Fi Channel (which I did sadly), it would scream "Sci-Fi Channel" with low production value, poor performance and the worst special effects of history. The effects here are comparable to that of other animal films, although "Rapter Island" is not nearly as bad. I suspect that some people who work in at least some movies must be, but I'm not bothered to make sure and annoy them. It will be a sad day when I see them again in a movie. <br /> <br /> It's not enjoyable anymore. I saw this in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can not speak for him, but I think it's a good time to use. The bad thing is that it is a funny photo and interesting enough to carry the cinema girl daughter (I'm the name of the actress Michel Berth) to make fun of movies. Michael Peree also appeared as the captain of the ship, and here the bad choices of his roles actually resented his work in "Fernes" (even if that film is poorly vulnerable). <br /> <br /> I can not be too strong for this movie because I think it was less or less. Bad effects? Short budget? Any name actor? I had no high expectations. Yet, this does not mean that it is cool. There is nothing proud of being in par and this will gradually fade away in the remote memory section. For a fan that likes this movie (and it is called "KVC"), keep your copy as you have a hack during the transition.
