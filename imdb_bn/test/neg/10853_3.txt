A very bad film, clich√©s and historical error errors. Some examples: Initially the Soviet infantry attacked Germans; Rather than shooting them on their enemies, they proceeded to fight against them on open ground, in contrast to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is supposedly covered with Russian daughter and her Russian, yet she does not speak Russian; A German aviator invades an aircraft-crashed gun- but the gun does not fire the shellell shells but directly hits it on its 'plane', which can not be seen as WWII's German plane. With justification, when they can escape from extravagant plots and consequently stupidity are some really powerful moments - people are hungry, and the persistent picture of death is shown slowly, but they show only the rest of it. A film will be avoided.
