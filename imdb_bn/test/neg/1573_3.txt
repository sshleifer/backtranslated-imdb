Bate Middle is the best thing about this movie. It's a poor second as a gypsy with Natley Wood since 1962. The song was originally done very well and the dress was good. Bate's voice was fantastic and she looked better in most of the clothes than Cynthia Gibbs. Only someone who does not see the original will think of a good movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful girl did not have enough changes in ugly dcling. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy, Borlees went to the dress with her gloves for the first time in the show, and she seemed to be beautiful. When her hair is down and then magically it is done beautifully and she looks very elegant, it is an important aspect of the movie because it is the first time Jampi thinks of herself as special and she can be a star, not only her sister is a poor alternative. And apparently where he gradually became more famous. It was an important part of the movie and they stole it. It is important for her to be more comfortable with her future as a stripper and to showcase the dresses amazingly in these scenes. It was a huge let down to see this film release. I was totally disappointed and it was not for Bate Miller, I could have closed the movie.
