It is tragic that anyone thinks of the movie as valuable. I'm Russian, and I'm hated. There is nothing in this movie worthy of praise without cinematography. However, I'm one of those who find the beauty of death or distortion. I think this film is weak design and directed. There is nothing more annoying and even excited than the shameless speck in the industry (if you can call this trash industry). Balabanov wanted to make the visitors frustrated by the widespread evil, and he was successful to create a frustrating dark film. But primitive management of the biggest shock Balabanov. I will not advise my friends to visit it. Great disappointment!
