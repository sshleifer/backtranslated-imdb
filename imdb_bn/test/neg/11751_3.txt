Well, I want to agree with these critics who all said, "Leave it." Why did they rebuild this 1960's "Psycho", I do not know. My guess was that they wanted to reach the new audience and thought was the answer to the color and modern day actors, since it was the main change. Dialogs were the same and stories were the same <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, if they were going to keep things alike, why would not you like to improve Tony Parkinson, Gentle Leg and original cast? Bothered? <br /> <br /> Did they really tell Vince Vaughan? Would be better or better than Parkinson? Are you kidding Anne Heich, with his little mannequin-hair, is going to be better than a leeye? I do not think so! Yes, the colors were pretty cool here, but it was black and white, which made the 1960s version so vague in the beginning. This is not perfect for storytelling, greens and pins! Again, I think filmmakers are banking on viewers who never saw them. <br /> <br /> It was simply a stupid project that was never gotten from the ground.
