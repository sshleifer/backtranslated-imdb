I felt that this movie ran, and the acting hole was full. Arnold was good, but the original girl was stupid, and the devil that acted in Satan was terrible. The story was confusing and stupid. There was no point in the film, and was incredible. Movies is not the worst movie, but it is not far from it. Overall, I was very disappointed, it was a lot better. My score is 10 out of 3
