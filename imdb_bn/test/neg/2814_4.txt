After a son of American Indian Indians Scalp number Hu-Hugh-Hauh, Frontier Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Buane) thinks, at first he even wants to get; However, he really wants to make friends with the netizens. When the Indian main lone Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also loses a number of boys in sad eyes, it becomes more difficult to eliminate misunderstandings. Obviously, it was successfully completed with Daniel Studios's "King of the Wild Frontier King Dave Cucket," (1955) for the Republican photo "Daniel Buwen, Trill Blazer". <br /> <br /> The song "Danle Boone", whistled by a group of children of a wagon and sung, did not follow Fit Parker's "Davey Crockett" to hit the parade. The singer does not carry the title song (perhaps more intelligent) than the forenoon (like Faran Calaway); He sang "Long Green Valley" and gave a good impression as a blonde boyfriend for sister's daughter. But Spanish actor Freddie Fernández is the most valuable player in the film. In a beautiful scene, Mr. Fernandez Mr. Young's character ("Susanah") reminds me that he was associated with love. <br /> <br /> Daniel Boven, Trill Blazer (10/5/56) Ishmael Rodriguez ~ Bruce Benite, Lon Chaney Junior, Fern Young, Freddie Fernández
