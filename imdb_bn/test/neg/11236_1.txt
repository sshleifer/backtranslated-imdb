I used to watch this movie for a film class, I enjoyed it all the time. I'm not Asian, but this picture was still very bad. The film is based on ethnicity, the entire minority (Rex Harrison Even Not Asian!) In the narrow mind. The ban on film in Thailand depicts the degree and personality of Asian Degrees. Apart from this, Anna's biography has been carefully given attention. Many critics argue that Anna has added many fictitious events in her story to present herself well. Some critics of film and living even say that Anna has made the whole story. Better to discuss biopics as a horror film but metaphysical novel than a work of non-fiction.
