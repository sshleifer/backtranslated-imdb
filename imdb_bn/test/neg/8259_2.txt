What a great cast and a film is a kind effort. The script is full of holes from the beginning to the end. Intrinsic, not integrated ... absolutely ridiculous. One of the world's most gifted / beautiful actors (and I'm talking about Nastassa Kinsky) is here without a single memorable line. Worse, she dyes her hair dyes through the movie with permission, but it's clear she's wearing a cheap black wig bought from a track queen costume store. At the best moment, a character from the apartment building is greeted by the actor and his dog, which is included in actor Peter Quet. Fareja boy is taking pictures badly to boot the image. She looks like an overweight freshman who pigged out at the very-eat-eat-student-cafeteria-buffets. I was looking forward to this photo. I wanted to like it, but I think I would like to read Nostasana phone book with her own hair.
