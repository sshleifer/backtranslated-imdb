Wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good one to come out of this kind of uninterrupted drill, Indie Horn filmmakers like me, seeing such films, will ensure that my upcoming feature is also cut. I mean, if it represents the market for indy awful, I could do a fortuneaping of the video taking up the garbage for myself for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> It will take a long time to write a complete list of the lack of this movie. But, highlights: no stories, terrible acting, terrible cinematography, and virtually no edits. That last one bothered me. As an editor myself, this movie made me completely mad because it was almost no edited. Each scene is shot in a master. They had absolutely no coverage. Anyone who does not know ... "Coverage" is shooting a scene from multiple corners for cutting options while editing to create a preferred viewing experience. Yes, there was no one in this movie. I'm talking about the scene even easier. Example: A common conversation scene between two people sitting in the table will usually start with a master who is in the scene and where to be. Then, as the conversation continues, you will spend behind the shoulder shots as the conversation continues. You can even drop a cutaway shot or two at the table or with someone else. Something Say this "film 101" stuff. Looks like these people did not have any idea how these movies work. Each shot was locked in a camera. No movement, no cuts, nothing. If I learn a course for film making, then it will be a visual aid for my "do not do" lesson. <br /> <br /> While closing, do not waste people in your time. The only amazing thing about this picture is that it has always been distributed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
