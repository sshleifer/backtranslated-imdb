The fourth installment of Sluran Party genocide series was about the genocide of Cheerleader; If they were doing what they were doing (which is considered to be an actress from real income from a small kimo role), they have unfortunately failed and have done the worst damage to 'quadrilateral'. Cheerleader genocide combined with ruthlessly bad acting, a horrific plot, a fool's killer, absolute and boring death, a bizarre visual scene and camera work, which is one of the worst films produced. How bad was I already mentioned? Do not make me wrong: The unexpected excuse for this sticky and horrible movie is not as bad as the Napoleonic Dynamite, but it is definitely a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Cheerleader genocide is the right pole opposite main slam party genocide. Stay away from all the ways! This movie is trash junk!
