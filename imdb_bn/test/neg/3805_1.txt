Stuck in the bed with the flu and finding a remote is very rough, I actually saw this hatred finish from the beginning (how many people can say it? And anyone can - what is your excuse?). My God, have ever been, ever released by a major studio, has been total mess? A supposed "thriller" genuine tension is not one second; The script is disabling and ridiculous; The set seems like they were left out of a low budget TV movie; And cast ... what do they think? Sally Field gives the history of any Academy Award winner the worst and most embarrassing performance without any doubt. His annoying nervous humor and stupid painful behavior that can be threatened is a genuine sitter. It is astonishing that he did not use his future earnings to buy and destroy every print of this turkey. Michael Caine, who is now endless pontificates on the screen acting industry - even running the master classes for Thespians - should be taking and shot (especially by one of the tele savalas' hechchmen). Angela Carteit, I usually played (and whose name is not the first credit, not the poor soul) for her role ten years old, and her horrible mother tongue, the yellow dress dresses will disappoint her nightmare today. Carl Malden and Sheryl Knight are slimming - It is expected that they have collected a large belt packet for their involvement. The whole film is a series of bad scenes, but especially in my mind the stick is an explosion that breaks down "ceiling" (if this can be said in the deck of the upstairs) and just slipping through a load of emptyboardboard boxes! Oh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
