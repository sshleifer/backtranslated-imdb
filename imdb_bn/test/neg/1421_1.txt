It's one of the most sad, anticipated and poorly played films I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I have never seen anyone with less faith in the screen. I was smiling through the whole way through him. Then there are some things in this romance between him and the fantastic Rousseau, which is in the entropy. Concerty and Mrs. Peter were more pained than Jeeta-Jones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An IMDB user asked: Does not this picture want to like? I'm asking: What about it? And the answer is: John Malkovich. She is an absolute talent and probably the best movie villain (she even knows you know the wind preserved). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is called a fire line, but 'Bodyguard 2: The Rip Off' seems to be more appropriate title. See if you are a die hard John Malkovich fan only. Otherwise, avoid all costs. * 1/2 (five out)
