Other commentators described the film as "classic 1950s caiyaphai" as a stock footage and shining use of documentary footage and interactive interaction. <br /> <br /> Nothing can be more from the truth. Yes <br/> Yes, this is the classic 1950's cave ... but the 1950's Saifai is in its darkest dark times. <br /> <br /> Remember that the first victim of the game is Radar Station, then first on the ground. .. But the station (from the air) portrayed as a mountain, snow on one side and semi-clear dark ground on the other side, but when (on the ground) investigators visited the site, it was suddenly a plain, plain plain plain, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Consider also a more recommended specialist sunny pseudo-scientific strap, which is brought to check for a huge bird. He said, "Well, we know one thing ... it can not come from any animal, because every known species of animals has a skeleton skeleton, even reptiles and birds have bones." Then he said that some animals ... shellfish, shellfish, insects ... sister scilitans. Excuuuuuse me? Let's define "animal" here. Even in the 1950s, even a person of more than six years of age can not accept this person as an expert in biology, because he does not know for sure that any "animal" is not a creature, and that it is not possible to name a few of its broad animals, Skeleton (shark, ray, jellyfish, pest, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arcandids, echidadmas ... you get the idea.) Characters are cards Board, 2D stock type ... scientist, lateral girlfriend, big bad monster. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. No pulse, no signs of life <br /> <br /> There is no malicious dialogue, special effects are stupid for their time even, and the stock footage is employed with a relentless disregard for continuation. This is the most serious incident of the B-movie production, it is a production worker who can not be annoyed for apparently trying for half a try. <br /> <br /> Use little, punished for sleeping drugs or children who are easily offended by bad science.
