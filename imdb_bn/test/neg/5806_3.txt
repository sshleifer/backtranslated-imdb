Can be expected from Adam Sandler-produced comedy, Grandmother's Boy predictable and so stupid it is sick. Alex-like star in the Allen Covert Film, 35-year-old Pothead, who worked as a video game tester and had to live with his grandmother, two roommates after losing his apartment. Some natural plots happen: There is a problem with adjusting to the conditions of his new life, which makes him a problem at work, especially because he is trying to nail one of the office's new advisers. A wicked boss, almost malicious company star, is trying to end up with the silly best friend, the terracotta pot seller's place, a few scenes in a really big party scene, and a real video game Alex himself, by mixing himself in Grandma's own son. Alan Covert has led a little better, Linda Cardellini is just enough for her role as one-of-the-de-the-de-de-the-the-officer consultant Samantha, and some scenes make chocolate or two flutter out, but none of them Grandma's son does not have much time value. Most fun "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them is nothing but "humorous" which will be embarrassing to watch someone in the national lamps, Joel Moore's role as a video game mastermind JP is incredibly vague, and the whole The film is actually fun or not managed to be boring above the top. Well, at least grandfather did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to check out his out-of-work friends David Spade, Kevin Nilan and Rob Schneider in a few patch.
