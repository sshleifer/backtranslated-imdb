I got to see this one without commercial barriers, and even for a TV movie you say, it was quite predictable. The actors acted like a worker with their work, and Caste was perfect - Barry Bostwick, Jane Simmur, Frances Fischer, etc. However, the script is not only visible (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was treacly and sounded as it was raised from a third-rate romance novel. Jane Simu's psychological harmony was ridiculous. I'm sorry, but it's hard to believe that anyone who is curious will revoke any doubts. Theresa Russell was as bad as "black widow" - and she definitely torn it out - she could at least play her pseudo-characters for a short time. Seymour is not much better actress but the material here has not been overcome. <br /> <br /> In the end, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. It's almost like a Connie G. Maldon, a mockery of his style. A movie with such a lazy and derivative script should really have gone for some edgier.
