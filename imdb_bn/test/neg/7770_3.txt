From being, I liked this show and regularly looked at it, but now (thanks to God!) I do not understand why I saw it. One of the most vain and insulting TV shows in sex and city I've ever seen. I really do not get this show point, despite trying. People are saying, sex and city are fun Which way? All the time talking about cursing, vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the plot: we have four girls who are trying to find the perfect people, who are sleeping with every dark, who come near. And this show is four bad girls, who are sleeping with every person in the city, but ultimately they recognize that penis vibrators get the best pleasure. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us, that relationship is the most important thing in every relationship. If you could have a good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It does not matter if you want to be loyal and want a good heart. The size is matter. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is bad performance. Four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catterler, Cynthia Nixon and Christian Davis) are so bad and incredible, that it makes me sick by seeing this show. Parker is just screaming and complaining that Katrl is watching her old boobs and always says "F - word", Davis gives her smile (and nothing else) and she feels annoyed all the time as Nixon works. And yes ... men's sex - this show is hungry dry. However, judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is humiliated for men and women. Women have shown so primitive and passionate, as they have no heart, only hunger for sex This is humiliating for everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and city is one of the worst TV shows and I am glad that the show has ended, because it provides bad acting and pointless stories. Not all about the whole world sex and vibrators.
