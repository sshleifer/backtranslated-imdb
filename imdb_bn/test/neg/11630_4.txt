At the moment Mickey Roberts is enjoying a revival ... and a game that is suitable for him. I always liked the ability to act like her pictures and hire like Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know you're going to get Rourke - money, moody, dirty. But this image gives you a lot more - and you do not want much at it. <br /> <br /> First and foremost - this whole thing is not just meaningless. A hard-working IRA assassin in Rourke, who escaped to London in London after a bus load of schoolgirls was killed. He runs from the comrades of police and his own army. He also sworn to kill again. It seems, the kids did the bus for the bus. However, when he went to London he was tracked by a local mobster (Bates - showing his eyebrows and hair straight away Burton's dummy) for 50,000 pounds and to kill his main rival for boat trips in the United States. Rau willingly agrees to do so but is seen by the priest (Hossein) and admits confession of confession to keep the priest face closed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Why choose Rourke off your competition? As illustrated by a scene through which an employee is given an ant by a heavy heavy heavy wall like lazy - these London boys are hard enough to kill themselves. <br /> <br /> 2. Not only that, Moberter was able to follow Rauk√© and find the evidence of murder by his own eyes. Why did not he just kill the rival and did not save all the hassle to face Raukake? <br /> <br /> 3. See the murder of Hawkins and the police release him - out of security, I can add - to accept? There is no way <br /> <br /> 4. After committing the crime, crime was immediately commuted following hanging around the church (next to the crime where he murdered). Why is not police checked out? <br /> <br /> 5. Walking around the church in Rourke and especially Hoskins's blind nephew, after a while he did not bother. What? Does he run and leave it where he killed another? Fool <br /> <br /> 6. Police actually meet Rour in the "fixing" church and he has no idea. Do not they know that he is running a school bus bomb attack? Do they not test him? <br /> <br /> 7. Why do Rouge have to kill you, and then tell him to wait a few days to go to the boat? You would think you want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /> <br /> 8. Why did Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape a blind brother by waiting? He could not save himself for a few days? Until at least Rouke is not closed to the United States safely? <br /> <br /> 9 Suddenly, after killing Roukake on dark ghosts and winning, there is internal inconvenience - even he knows that he is a killer, yet he loves him? Again - completely ridiculous. And in addition - he read "love" with him during the record - a few days !!!! <br /> <br /> 10. Ultimately the bomb explosion is only available from the point of view of BITS. <br /> <br /> 11. Parts of this movie may be something that is not only intelligent, but is only there to help in the story (and I just say). Route shows moral highlands to honor the prostitute while staying in the house while the house is ready to enter the boat until it is ready to enter the boat and - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Root asks a henchman in the boat of Bates - and Henman actually touches the entire movement of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the man said much more than telling Rouke. <br /> <br /> 13. Hoskin's priest is a former army man and we saw him kill three hechenches behind a pub. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, sometimes not very bad but can be heard at other times), its clothes, walks, shows in the sky etc. No, I'll mention music and sticky editing styles. <br /> <br /> Oops ps - I <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10.
