In another film of horror films, I feel very attracted to the brain, that a group of friends stuck in a dark room gradually killed one after another, which is a group of gammy that increases yellow blood and has very poor dental problems. In the first 45 minutes, all the talk, and young Thespians, can not come out of paper paper bags and they are given the most prevalent conversation to read shamelessly, it is particularly painful. If you are awake by that stupid thing, things will not be better. Bad make-up is abundant and chessy, door basement (not special) effect. For the conclusion .. Well, the old timer who warned them against going to the wonderful palace in the first place, would bet that and the last two survivors (boys and girls, of course, would live for days) with its mysterious power? Please .. Life is very short for such movies. While helping this trip, you give time to spend otherwise, do a few switches in a soup kitchen or something. You really think that you have done some fruitful work with your life and you did not put money in the studio pockets, such as wasting such illogical junk. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's already late for me .. Now, where did I keep that 'Pumpkinhead' copy? 1/10
