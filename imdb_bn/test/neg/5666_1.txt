This show is just plain horror. I like to see Drake and Josh, which was great, and before Amanda shows, funny, but it's just amazing. My opinion felt like this observer --- Movies from Selberg, painful and catechism. This is about 3 fools @ $$ kids who make a painful web-show (while stealing the hole), then their annoying brother sculptures (he has no life). Cast Crane, Scraps from Dreck and Josh Carly (Ahhhhhh!) Is an ugly B! Teach Sam and fred some fred drama they pulled in the street. What I saw from this (ugg) is a random "joke" that produces a brother's film made of clay, he played an arcade game called Pac-Rat (Genius), stuck to Sam and Curly on their web show and Fred was being a dork. The only part of the episode (the title can not be remembered) where Fred gets bad luck without predicting an email. I look up YouTube fun videos from this junk. And why they get YouTube jac @ $$ fred, get AVGN to cancel the show with its ribbon. Just skip this show.
