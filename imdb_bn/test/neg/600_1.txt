This picture is basically a poor move on the poor old urban legend, who is asking for a child to get a crank call, finds out the calls and calls the police looking to get inside the house. When a murderer calls a story so straightforward it can be written to a small child. There is not much doubt, it becomes clear that this killer is half of the film. Initially, when the first victim is killed it seems like a pornographic site or something from a slavery fetish scene. What's up with that? The film is usually the usual slasher rental with a real plot like a Beatles concert. Its tasty by even lower budget slasher value Do not waste your time with this. Naph said
