A fantastic horror movie, I'm surprised to agree with Derek Jacobberry and Vincea Redgrave, it's like a very big episode of a poor TV spy series. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is to be Winnie Jones, he can not work easily, who keeps a bright sense of throwing him as a leader, not checking his head until he puts his money on this project ? She should play the lips, looking menacing and not talking! <br /> <br /> The Dickens Bar had central temperature because there were three big radiators behind its table? <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave it free of charge with a newspaper because nobody would pay the money to see it.
