Anyone who sees this movie will notice that the producers have made a lot of money in this movie. It's interesting "title" title they are! Production quality is good for a small film. The hole shows big budget and tries in some way but it prevents the video format that was shot. I guess if I was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would propose a bit more content. Many Hollywood films look good and it's enough for listeners regardless of stories and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion of 10 out of my efforts. Perhaps the next image of Ismimoto will be given.
