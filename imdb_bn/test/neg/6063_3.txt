After her father's suicide, Charlie Kid 'Davis (Roy' Boom Bom 'Mancini) received invitations and advice from his friend Tini (Michael Chalice) and traveled to Las Vegas and tried to make him a boxer. On the street, they meet Zinna (Jennifer Beals) with Hitachining, they give him a lift and become a Charlie girlfriend. Johnny Ticotine (Rod Steiger) is determined to be Tony Charlie's couch, and after powerful agent Alex Dumus (Joe Mentenna) showed him the war, became his manager, promoting Charlie's career. This movie is so annoying that it is not really worth spending it while writing about it. I do not like boxing, but sometimes I see some appropriate movies about this theme. But this one is awesome! Forecasting, full of clich√©s, a terrible lead actor, a pure waste during the time. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Corpus e alma' ('body and soul')
