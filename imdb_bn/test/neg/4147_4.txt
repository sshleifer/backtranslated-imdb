I really wanted to love this movie, because I love tromba and like trailer and love one of Ferin's film "Ghaus". It was a few good moments, such as the elderly chose the song playing on the car crash scene and at the end a scene where the hero is closed. But all of it, it was just boring and gently unpleasant. <br /> <br /> "Impossible" shock that came with Fareen was really anticipated and tired. Hijacking, prostitution, barbarous killings Still good, but could be done badly. Make sure that it was humiliated, amuse, or both. Not to the end. At the conclusion, we watch trauma movies because we love movies with heart. The heart of this film did not seem consistently. There were some good scenes, but eventually it was dull and unpleasant.
