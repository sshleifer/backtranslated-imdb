I swear, I've never seen such bad films like Half Cast. Not only does this mean that it is not in any sense but absolutely stubbornness and self-confidence which makes me fool. <br /> <br /> Shebastian Appocada (pronounced "Appocado" similar to the Spanish AppCord, meaning "Outcod" life and happiness) creates an army film here that he is the son of Sam Rime or Blair Witch project. Blair Kit project with low budget. <br /> <br /> The story is about some American filmmakers who are a half-cast documentary The only thing that is going to be made is to do something that is not known to the cast (or the color of the hair), or the hair's performance. ?) American, they all look at me as a European. <br /> <br /> To finish this, tell the filmmakers about knowing about the famous medal Sepa the movie. They are a fake prize (as most of the original film) and a beautiful cover (Spain kabharatite negative half-caste image), so I'm feeling unhappy, because I did not want to return to 14 euros.
