If you like the initial version of "Time Machine" -60, do not waste your time; As of last year's "Apps Planet", it has been "rebuilt", and not good. And, like "Planet ...", its main actor is sadly mistreated and lead; Guy Pierce, a great actor in a great range, providing one-note performance that shows all the wrong, zero sympathy for this role; He is so shocked and serious, and he lacks the lack of fear of (amazing) amazing things that he does not believe for a moment that he faces them. Even worse, whose idea was similar to that of David Spade and Kelisa Flockhart's love child? A handsome actor, here he is sadly gaunt, which is, believe or not, a major distraction. Frankly, the man is seriously ill and pictured cruelly. He does not share any chemistry with anyone on screen, a direct result of a performance that does not sync out to anyone else. Sadly, even with a competent leader, this film can not stand in any way that it is seriously misunderstood to both the unarmed directors - the whole scene goes out and is poorly understood - and a screenplay that is merely inferior, scattered and occasionally incompatible - for a moment You are not worried about anyone in this movie, because of the character development There is nothing in the way! Basically, you will know Eloi, so you felt for them, and Morelocks felt their terror; Here, the film is forced several times, they are nothing but sheep and work accordingly. If you are not a member of the wreath, the awesome sheep entertainment elements are strictly! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is possible with his film debut, but it is like everyone in this zombie, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of Moralex [who is "Mummy Returns" like "Rejection"], why is he Edgar Winter Seeing like a long lost brother?) Fully suffocated. Also, the meaning spent on meaningless nonsense 'special' effects, which is believed to cost $ 70m in this movie They are uniformly lackluster, clear and unconvincing, and then the film's appearance is: Bad picture, its art direction, and set is simply "there" and its dresses are generally designed, not a basic idea or idea expressed on the back or screen. Not even fun! (Filmmakers currently use universal Orlando Jones as "Comic Relief" but naturally Onsa is annoying and character-driven power ilekatrikyali live, regardless of how a country?) <br /> <br /> Above all, it is an empty, lifeless, neutral, brutal and confusing thing: they "apps Planet" did not recover? (At least that was some strong performance luck!) <br /> <br /> * Speaker! * The final insult (not to mention a head shakingly horrible, convenient, end)? They not only show the modified dress-store statistics, they even make time-machine itself an antiretrovist, a toy-glass-n-chrome bore! (If "The Spronsource" was a time machine, it would look just like that.) Kindly ...
