A city on Halloween is terrorized by a madman with a big pumpkin for a head. Bad acting compromises with most local talent and ridiculous special effects. B-movie Queen Linna Quigley was embarrassed to be part of such a part and even most of her films helped her to help the film, it could not help it. If you are looking for a great Hollywood horror film and rented "Night of the Demon" which plays Miss Cuigli, please pass this chessy flick.
