I had to see it as a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lone Chaney Jr. The only thing about this is the clips of Logosi, Karloff and Chaney Junkyal, which are not jailed with all alcohol clips. With new black and white footage. Not even near Steve Martin, the dead men do not wear the plaque, it's going very well. Why is it good now with all of our technology? If you want to shell out 5 shells and change something, this will be really bad warning. But if you like Luigi Karloff and Chaney Joona, then see their movies instead. Even Ed Wood did better than that. The new actress Redfield is just as good as a simulation. The clips used are: Ape, Mr. Wang, the most dangerous game, the world, lost the worthless people. And the devil bat This is a notorious Lagosi classic. I believe this product was very low budget, and it was 1 out of 10.
