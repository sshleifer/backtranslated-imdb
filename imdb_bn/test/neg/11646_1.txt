Stay away from this movie! It's terrible all the way. Bad acting, a thin recycled plot and the worst end of film history. Seldom I see a movie that produces from my adrenaline pump irritation, on the other hand, "an aircraft man immediately" film (airside) is another movie that can remember immediately. Please, please do not see this once because it is completely and completely merciful from beginning to end. Haley's Eyewear
