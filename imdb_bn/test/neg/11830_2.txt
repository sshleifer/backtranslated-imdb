"My blue heaven" is annoying. The plot is unclear; Characterizations and dialogue stink; Musical numbers, sometimes staged in interesting ways, are not only very often illusory, but ironically trite, painfully brighter, and hose emotionally hollow. Leeds, Betty Grable and Dan Daily, are attractive professionals; However, despite their talented efforts to propagate their talented and incomplete elements, they failed. David Wayne and Jane Wight, for all their talent displayed in other projects, have low or low ciphers here. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to view "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... One star: Mikey Genner, his film debut. Its total screen time probably less than ten minutes, but what is it? Her impressive and promising screen personality, her girlfriend's beauty and her exceptional career, brightly illuminated and made this minute the most spectacular, memorable and exciting moment of the whole film. If you are worth an opportunity to see a great young talent on the enthusiasm, then see Miss Miji Gennor in "My Blue Heaven". <br /> <br /> In fact, I hate (and will request you to avoid) Kaspersky's Manic, unwanted-compelling DVD commentary for this movie. While playing across Wardi, Degrassi, what is going on in screen, and often with bad times, while running across nervous energy, his comments are absolutely absurd.
