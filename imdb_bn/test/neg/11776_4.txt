The subject of drug addiction is often given below bone, but it can be a rather depressed film. But depressing does not necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it's actually quite bad. There are some good things for the film, especially the central role of Irene, the performance of sheep farmgirl's quality, the mother of a mother fighting with cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good for doing something bad here. Film failures mainly lie with the story, which fails to move and never seem to be going. Irene came into rehab and brought an unselfish husband to the house, who had no idea of ​​supporting her efforts to stop her practice. Irene boosts the recovery of a male nurse from her rehabilitation center. Complexity ensue But the story does not really sparks life. It does not seem that the movie is actually going anywhere. You can say it is a real, realistic look of an addiction daily struggle. Maybe so but in this case it's not for an interesting movie. The whole thing is a very "blah" to remember it. The minimum painter does not help the subject, incredibly adding another layer to the rebel proceeding. And measurements of someone else in Farmiga's measurement. Hugh Dylan is OK as male host of Irene's male friend but cast someone else adds some of the proceeding standards. All of these films are a dark, depressing and rather dull ride.
