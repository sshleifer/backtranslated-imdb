In my opinion, finishing is completely destroyed in the whole thing. Someone suddenly realized that they were God's son and the second coming was a little tricky. People began to believe in him and his friends became new disciples. People went to muscles, demons were all kinds of fun, people were fun. Of course then everything went wrong. It was impossible to find an impossible task to find a large number of text to find "third agreement" within five days, but eventually it became a ridiculous human imagination. I will not loot it, but I say it has been closed so that it was written by the teenager, which was with very limited knowledge. I have heard that they are making an American feature version of this story, I hope they will change the eye rolling.
