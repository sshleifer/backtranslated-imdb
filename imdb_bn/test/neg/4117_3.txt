Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script a little leakage. <br /> <br /> I understand the concept that by changing only a variable, you can probably change the way of publishing the history. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the way to change time. We are under the "TimeWives" series, which responds to the increasingly logical evolution. Although it is a convenient plot device, it gives our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it does not make any sense. Of course, if you change a variable, and that variable is significantly, even completely, the evolution of the asteroid has changed, then you "come back in the future", the evolution process has already been established and there is no need of wave? Lastly, the change that took place 65 million years ago, why do we have to wait until it is implemented? It can be credible even if the moth is predicted over time, but the moth life has changed significantly 65 million years ago, the evolution, any change in the history of evolution began then and our current time was not dependent on returning. <br /> <br /> To fix the problem, the team will go back to prevent variable changes happening sometimes. By successfully doing this, we see that evolution has never happened, and no one remembers events! Of course, what should work for the solution to work for the real change? I like a good rolling science fi adventure, but at least some of the grounds have to be entertained for it to entertain at least some entertainment until it is set to "a galactic remote". <br /> <br /> Good prizes, bad intrigue, reasonable acting and justification, just a packet on Jurassic Park <br /> <br /> is not my "watch again" list.
