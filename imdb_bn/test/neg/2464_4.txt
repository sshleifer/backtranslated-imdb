Jack Black and Kyle Gass play their fantastic versions of this comic showcase for their side band Tenissius D, an art-rock team with cartoonist, barbaric songs. Heavy metal and a beach-living, pot-smoker enslaved who meets a rock god and constitutes a band (forming the motherland of the motherland of both the former bearded cheeks). "The Pick of Destiny" from the '80s is a tweeted sister video that is open with a fun suggestion that is a fairly well-produced movie targeted at older kids; It is sometimes not more than the middle age of "Owens World", a climatic byte with the Jokee-Stoner Interlude and Belzbub, ​​but Black and Gus have a very comfortable relationship (they also worked as producers, co-authors scripts And all music). The obvious audience will definitely go for it, though the motivation is a little less, especially in the second half (hijacking our heroes by robbing police in a student-driven car). The music sequences are much more successful than the movie's satire efforts, and for the first thirty minutes, Jack Black's mental stimulus is contagious. * **** to 1/2
