<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The pleasure is not just good. I can not say I have a good hope from Will Smith, but I must have come from Kevin James of "Queen's King" - but, hey, I'm using it to say a lot. This image tries to make his mark as a strange romantic comedy, but it never hits bull's eye. Actually, it does not hit * anywhere * in the target. Allergic visuals are annoying; Kevin James is not something that can not be danced to anyone, and so is not funny (in a movie like this). This movie always tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong accusations at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm searching for my brain for example), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
