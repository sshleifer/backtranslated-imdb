This movie was awesome. The Bible is very wrong. When Moses came out of Egypt when he was 80 years old, the movie took him to forty. Moses was almost forty years old when he fled from Egypt, went for 40 years and stayed with him for forty years. When Moses died, he was 120 years old and denied the privilege of crossing the Promised Land. I understand that movies use a lot of "poetic licenses" because the Bible account is not long, but when making biblical films, they also reflect the information that is known to the information and keep the smell of the original Bible character, this film fails in this perspective and in many other cases. . Although the 1956 version was also better in its theoretics than theater.
