Since I need to write the minimum 10 lines, and this waste is not just one, I will start with the following: 1. I voted for this horrible so-called "film" AWFUL vote. <br /> <br /> 2. Why should I explain why this Turkish m David Warrod is mainly in my beautiful home country of Bulgaria (not only in BTW, for the illiterate people - this country is located in Europe), north of Greece and there is absolutely nothing to do in Mexico. Uruguay) Some years ago, NU images attacked our country and created video releases from most of the live video. Why here Because here they pay a low fee for the Bulgarian crew and Bulgarian actors (most of them among prominent people), which in most cases are better than their American colleagues. Personally I am ashamed of the fact that I am. Because, of course, America's greed is involved and their desire for the greatest benefit, if not all profits. Indeed the production would not be so bad if it was not so dirty and pale. A good picture has been shot here for years. Currently, suicides are being filed against the NU photo on the very questionable purchase of our National Film Production Center named BAYANA Films. There is no doubt that corruption has occurred, there has been fraud, there is a lie in this recent purchase. Bulgarian movie dead Long live the Bulgarian movie!
