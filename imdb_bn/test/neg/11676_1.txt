OK. I really tried to make this film set out in that (so-called) stupid and surreal humor. I said that the Japanese version of this film is much smaller than that sent to America (see the picture!), And has less political references. In addition, I think this sexual / political agony is just as annoying and meaningless as ordinary porn. Central female lead is easy on eyes, and can actually work. I want to see him in a non-pink film where he can actually flex his acting muscles (and not, you do not think). It is clear that Japan (and can) produce as bad as other countries can produce. I can not recommend this to anyone, with the remote possibility of someone who has Jones for the Asian Council. To see a real Japanese film go.
