I actually went with some expectations in this movie, because I do not think that this movie looks particularly good, but I have grabbed it with a Cast on Italian Flickr Fan and Oliver Twist as well as acting alongside Franco Nero and Telly Savalas. Must be at least interesting. Well ... Redneck has one or two positive things, but in most cases; It's a dull, ruthless film which is ridiculous as it is stupid. The plot only kidnaps a small child (Oliver) who keeps an eye on two offenders (Nero and Sivalas). In the story, the twist is that the child realizes that if he is taken in the gang, he will be more fun. Tele Savalas and Franco Nero have proved that two actors have proved that they can carry a movie of their own in many respects, and they have some memorable moments in this picture - though really, for all the wrong reasons. Savalas is a silly illustration, especially 'bad' criminal. The plot is not flowing badly, but since something interesting does not happen, it is not really a positive point and is not stored from the film to be medium. Overall, I can not recommend this photo; It could apply something for its religious value but it did not do anything for me.
