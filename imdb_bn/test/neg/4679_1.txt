The use of the word 'comedy' with this document is an insult to the comedy industry, and the pain caused by the audience of this production is still bad. Almost nothing was fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of stand-up 'comics' on the streets while traveling from town to city to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to keep in mind that their conversations and behaviors are at a close stage and at a different level, but sadly, evenly unclear. <br /> <br /> Grameenphone's spontaneity is understandable as 'comedians' but the sounds of laughter are hard to understand from their audience. For the same audiences for the sake of those who have been lam sitcoms on TV. <br /> <br /> This is my worst movie to watch 50+ years of film.
