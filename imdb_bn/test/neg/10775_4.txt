We are well aware that movies are not set to be directly involved in history, but it is disrespectful when the film is slightly less in relation to it. I hope the director and / or screen writer have done research on this topic. This movie creates a forum for people to hate, which should create an intensity that should not be there. This movie portrays Sikh and Muslim among the very negative people, while the third party (Hindu) is seeing that they were uninterrupted in the brutal killings of the people of both the countries. Errors in the unexpected perspective of the person's personality depicted by 'Gyan Singh' were disrespectful in the highest form. Although more positive notes, the actors did a great job acting in their role. Christian K and Nev C both played exceptionally well in their rolls. I hope those who see this movie do not see or use it as a template for real historical events.
