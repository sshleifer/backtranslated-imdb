I thought the film was a poor effort of the British Film Council - Hey suddenly flattened, Tim Robbins is an old man and this beautiful girl here is right for her. It is really difficult to suspend unbelief in this context, like lost in the translation. This is a good looking film but lack of punch. When Team Robins pretends to be psychoanalyst, it seems he has a small migraine. She shows uncomfortable and low life. He is the scary part of screening sphinx suspicious workers. If an investigator comes to my factory, then the last thing I tell him about my Fleet Fitti It's probably intellectual. Clumsy It is a convenient retreat city as well. They obviously chose the most selectable cities as a retreat (Shanhai), but the city never went out, and as the character of the character influenced the characters for example, where the letters of the cities often intersect the story. Slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic high points, so plot.
