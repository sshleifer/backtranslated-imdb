Beautiful pictures as toys, promotions and history. This photo element, well, interesting but with many shadows. Political shadow Jefferson is more than a legendary American hero. He is an aspect of life and society, Silhouette, a great thinker, teacher of greater part of North America. The film is only Superman. The idea is fine fine contour. Essential truth is forgotten in fine dates. And Jefferson is the fundamental instrument for creating a good image of American reality. The last, the winner and the fake, romance and heroic gun guns in a story that can be taller with more knowledge. And fight against "incarnate" other gray spots. The movie is a good starting point for listening to Jefferson. For others - confusion. It's like a valuable silk on a door. But silk is interesting about silk and clothes are just plain clothes. So, a sad experience. Beauty and boring lake, patriotism lessons and prospecting pounding. Impressive course is a film. And a story that can be great in Ash.
