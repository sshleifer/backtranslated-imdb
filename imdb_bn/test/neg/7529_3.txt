... but I'll lie. A relative was a crew member and we were going to monitor the production of the film for a few days (and I was extra) in this movie. I have to die and have a second on screen, I plan to move to anytime in Hollywood. I just saw the movie and was pretty impressed to be a part of it. Plus, finally got a copy of the movie after the release. While making this film, they did not have studio backing, so it was really free. Writing and acting is so awful why me outdoors, but the main character "Cherry" is the sister acting, so it can be part of it. But cinematography was good. :)
