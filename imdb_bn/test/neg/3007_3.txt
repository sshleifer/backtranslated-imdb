This is one of the best films of the past few years. It makes it even more impressive: it's a virtual showaging ($ 1.8 million or later they say in the DVD: they ended up with less money). Not just photography, but designs and especially locations (East Montana) which are once American and one of the most trusted <br /> <br /> Very consistent movie does not have to go with it. Prior to being flooded for a dam in 1955, a very committed establishment was washed out with a damaged mambo jambo, cursing the angel and the deceased child for 48 hours to clean a city town. And the "real world" is presented as frustrating arch. Note to the Polish Brothers: Coen Brothers are funny - you are not. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many systems of "NorthForco" are marked with a lot of symbolism and ambiguity, with the modern night of night woven with cuffhouses when the branded people can see "Charlie Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist ... <br /> <br /> It was already recommended for filmmakers as a research section for its unreasonable technical credits and photographic beauty.
