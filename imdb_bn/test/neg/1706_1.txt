This is a film that surrounds two mysteries (which I have now lost). First, did filmmakers understand the concept of 'parody' before using it to make viewers bomb throughout the whole picture? Parody is an attempt to drunk, comment, or pay homage to self-abusive humor when a reproduction is done. In other words, parodies have reasons to act as such, and they must be tricky. I did not see anyone on this photo. I've seen some horrible 10-second jokes that are flat in delivery 2 seconds. Brian Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night, living and this brain was crazy for direct release of this DVD. I want you to read the script on the board ... because I live this picture without the direct one! "<br /> <br /> And here's the second mystery lies: Eric Robert's career. I thought I was Eric Roberts's carrier because he was unfortunate. Now I understand because he was stupid (and so was his career worthiness). After watching this movie, it is visible that he went to adult films of mainstream, high budget, more ... intense ... scene and role, good acting and direction, more broad and compact plot lines, and much more than this B-movie rejection Audience (C-movie?)
