It is a satirical story of self-perfect relations between two improbable people, someone is married to somebody. It has been ranked high on the list of the most annoying films of all time and I am very shocked. My husband selected three hours after the first hour, by which something transpired. The view of the desert is spectacular, with continuous sand and sunset in the golden hair of Katrine. However, cinematography does not create a brilliant film, unless it is a national geographic journey. This sickly fantastic title is placed on the perfume on a pig in the nice Saharan scene. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a poorly-burned pilot, Count Lasalso de Almasi, who is under the care of the Canadian. Army nurse, Hannah, during World War II. He thinks his life is a bit memorable, but through his own book, his story is published in a very slow way with the help of a person named Karvagiyo, who is mysteriously attended to his death. Almasi was a Hungarian painter employed by the Royal Geographical Society for writing Sahara Desert. He entered into a relationship with a fellow explorer Catherine, who proved as a British spy. Meanwhile, he has a personal relationship with a Sikh named Liegelow with a Sikh named Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of unarmed mines. <br /> <br /> My quarrel with this movie has many lengths and tadium at the beginning. I do not blame especially, it's not simply a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, its connection to Almasy Sketch He provides torture scenes but does not seem to serve any necessary purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two sides of this matter, Almasi and Katharine, are unfortunate and neutral characters, overwhelming character. They are simply not very beautiful, so nobody is happy for this. Alamasi is cold, arrogant, arrogant, and finally hate the other man's wife. Catherine does not even mention the inadequate and ugly, inadequate lack of anger for her imperfect but loving husband ... as well as managing a tiny tear in the corner of her death. <br /> <br /> This is a story rather than love, 'I still know you'. Almasi laughingly ordered the co-worker to concentrate on the voice of the voice of her boyfriend with the indentation on her lover's voice. The victim of this unexpected fornication, Husband Jeffrey, who is treated a little more than unpleasant concerns. The impressive feeling of Katrine is so illusive and disgusting that these lovers can cherish their terrible uninterrupted emotions, Silent Night can sing in the background. I'm not sure whether their purpose was against the purity of Carole with selfish temptations, but I was not clearly impressed by the Holy Scriptures. We have full frontal nudity with Catherine, but their sexual scenes come as cold, selfish, passionate, and sometimes cruel hateful ... warm, loving, not even even lively. If any of these two emotions are felt for others, it is not entirely selfish and explicitly love, as I defined the word. <br /> <br /> Returning to the cave for the recovery of Almasi's body, her boyfriend came across changing instead of moving. Catherine will expire shortly before she is exposed because she looks a nice color and is only present in great detail, not all dead bodies. Of course, for all these dramatic effects, such as romantic people will not appreciate the story of a harmful, muddy body (usually I'll be one of them). To rescue the body of his adulterous boyfriend, he gave his colleagues and allies a betrayal of the Nazi people by betraying them, and English was truncated into pieces. Despite whether he has made Catherine his final commitment, his deceptive work is not something I love so much. <br /> <br /> Cape feels that a friend and friend are usually favorite, but their romance is not least compelling, with little groups fighting for a little injury to the party, during the war. Moving between the two settings (the Sahara desert in the past and present Italy) proved confusing and unpleasant, but in reality, both stories were soft like a dishwatcher. The only spark of interest in the whole film was in the copper mining scene. <br /> <br /> Being completely innocent, I had some sympathy for the dead and the dead of the current Almasi. However, perhaps my main complaint to this film is that it is happy at the end when Hannah forces her patient to give additional morphine. We think that it is fair and morally acceptable because he has obviously affectionate to Almasi, when she is crying while making serious syringe, and her playful Herodotas books alightly shouting aloud loudly. <br /> <br /> Should not insult the superior director David Lin's superiority than this merciful, immoral story. Yes, Arab Lawrence is also in a desert, but sympathetic character to those involved in Lean films (Doctor Jhibago, Brief Enquirer) show some respect for sympathetic restraint, crime, and treacherous spouse, opposing total self-absorption. In Ryan's girl, the cousin husband shows clear loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is an intelligent intellectual, extremely annoying and annoying drill bit Unfortunately it exceeds itself as a good love story. Oscar's best picture does not sound good for the Oscars. Why wonder why this movie is so difficult, the answer is simple, the answer is simple. It's boring
