I hope to learn something from this movie, but I was frustrated. It's all about Rommel and he is praised as a great general, but we did not get an idea of ​​this in the whole film any time we had ever been great. What made him so successful? Was it his drive, losing his deliberate, his rule with his men? I was really looking for a pattern-like imitation that really falls in character, but it is flat. Most of the dialogue is narrow and stimulating, and seems dirty and artificial. Here and there are some good actions, but not many. The story's tail ends up being involved in plotting to kill Hitler, the most informative part, and perhaps the most interesting. But as a lesson in the history of Germany's greatest general, it was a failure.
