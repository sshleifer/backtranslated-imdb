The Palestinian situation is fertile and even mostly fallow soil for film making. The 'Divine Intervention' works hard and gives us insight into spiritual life, stuck in pain, but the film becomes increasingly vague among them as the progress of a relatively small (gentlely) film compared to the visible jocoseps appearing for celluloid. There is a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very tentative issue.
