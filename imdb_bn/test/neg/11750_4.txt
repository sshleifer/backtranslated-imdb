The most disposable movie in the movie history? This is a powerful rival! Why waste so much money to do so vainly worthless work? Hitcake classic and the only difference between this poor imitation is color, wide screen and Laila's Wakman !! A movie which is supposed to create thrills and fear is completely indifferent to me. <br /> <br /> I'm going to tell you, "This Psycho 1998" is a giant explosive! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> S Betates, a fat man. They content themselves with a poisonous rehash! This is a Pox! And long life Alfred Hitchcock!
