Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. In the initial context, I ticked myself - finally, if you were getting older in the regeneration age, a trip below the memory lane was worth a smile or three. Pop Rocks, Atony and Rock M Shock MM Robot? Love, not * * Even though they were fools, but * because * they were fools and stupid and funny. But VH1 decided to create the series "I love the past Tuesday", I knew enough was enough. What is the sloppy slinkys to have something better than reading from any telepremeter in Hell Sparks? (Wait, check me ... hmm, no, no, it does not seem like that.) Snarky, snotty uber-hip posturing is in its place, but already enough!
