I really wanted to like this image. The second film in the series was stupid, it seems that the drive was fun in the movie (of course, I was drunk too). I saw this movie with the highest expectations of the same experience of High Cinematic Hillary, A-La-Mix Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!!!! This film is a devastating film devastating waste, and I like the second one! From the dreadful curiosity of David Bowe, Wilell, with the throat of a disgusting female villain, could shut the garage door with a smile, the whole thing was just a sad mess. I actually felt bad for the price tag, because the element was under its comedy actress (which is mostly called it all). A terrible, terrible film (that is not a recommendation).
