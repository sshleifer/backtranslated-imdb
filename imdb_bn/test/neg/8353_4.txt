I did not see any episode of real avengers with Blackman, Rig, or Thorsen, but I would have appreciated this series more. Though Castro made every effort to keep Christie's actions and interests, I was only caught with the original series compared to the episodes. Studd's expectations were more in the fight scene, and the continuity seemed to be that writers struggled to stay with actors. To be honest, I can not blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series, but it just did not work, it proved to be in a season. Regarding staid labor through this series, General McCarthy reminded me, 'Old soldiers will never die, they will just be pale!'
