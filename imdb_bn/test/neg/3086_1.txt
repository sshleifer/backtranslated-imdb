One of the worst movies I've ever seen is one. Yes, I know I'm not a target audience. The target audience is female, either college age or middle age or I guess no adult. I'm not one of them, so if I do not like it, manufacturers do not remember. But that would not be the excuse that dialogue and plot are terrifying. The main character, Phoebus, went to Europe to know what had happened to his sister Fayth, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an effortless character that I hope marks with someone. A character with faith very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems a bit reasonable. I said as the conversation annoying and reluctant. Plagiarism is not a complete stupid thing at times. Absolutely bad that the father of Foe and Faith is an artist but his paintings are totally horrific. There is no new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If you are a guy, you will pray for the last. Your chick may be able to sit through it if you do but you will be unimpressed.
