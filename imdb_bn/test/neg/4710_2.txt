I hired this movie because Elisa Wood did some good work and I thought it could be a neglected asset. It was not a treasure. I did not know whether this video was straight, but it should have been directly dumped. <br /> <br /> Elijah Woods fans would like this issue that they are shirtless in very short shower scenes. However, no intelligent person wants this script. Imagine the tunes played by teen actors, but ten times more confusing and hundred times less ample. Case In Point: Xenon Garfalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently 'keeping alive living chains'). <br /> <br /> If false memories syndrome and mind-medication medicines are not enough, the film also hinges one of the unexplained psychological twin bonds that are moving the plot and disturb the audience. This same twin bond has produced some exaggerated love scenes between Wood's character and She's All That's, who plays an intelligent sister of Wood's angry cancer-hunter friend. <br /> <br /> Adding Quarterly Quarterplay, Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidneys, a black black boy with a mysterious kidney disease. Dr. The desire for kidney death is true if Garfalo gave his own walkman. The hackneyed function of this character in the story matches its walking path. Usually tied with a wheelchair, Kidney has several invisible scenes that are pushing others around him. <br /> <br /> The character of Kindi can be a small story, but it indicates other errors in this movie. Bumblebee Flies is definitely bumbling anyway, but it never flies.
