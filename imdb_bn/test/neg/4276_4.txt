The whole exercise is meaningless. Why make the film at all? The light is terrible, but the word is just a joke. Like a high school production. Those who have budgeted together for this movie should be drawn and quartered so that it can be made without proper budget for the soundman, with appropriate tools for recording. <br /> <br /> Because of the loss of ecole, many conversations are the closest lack of unknown Mike. The economy should have been made in any other area. The whole production is ruthless and just lame with amateur semi-arsed production. It lacks warmth, transparency, and it has no design.
