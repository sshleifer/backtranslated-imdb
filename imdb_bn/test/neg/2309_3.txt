In order to publish my comments to the film, I know that this is horrible and the words can not express enough compassion that any nuclear person must be with the right people to deal with the severity of their near-nuclear bombs. <br /> <br /> However, this film does not really face horribly within the first 10 minutes. There are some pictures scary, and it should be a reminder that producers of destructive nuclear weapons can produce. Burned people roam freely or cut hair and hair is coming out, etc. Not a beautiful scene. <br /> <br /> But after the first dozen minutes, this Japanese film is concerned about tackling Hiroshima from the latter to late '40s. I actually found the story of developing rapidly in an annoying soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost all the stories happen after five years of bombs and essentially dealing with problems in a family. Due to this, it has become more than a melody than a few cataclysmic stories of nuclear disaster. It was only a story about how people gave their lives in the 1950s, whether a woman was permanently damaged, and if so, would she marry? <br /> <br /> This could be a real impact film, but it did not go that way
