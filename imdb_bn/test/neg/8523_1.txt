Spieler explains the plot: A poor family is being thrown in the middle of the war between the bad guys (who does not stay anywhere, no questions have been asked) ... and Caspar's friendly ghosts are trying to retaliate his death. Each frame gets more and more predictable with the movie, a big disappointment. Seams are totally stupid, it does not have to do anything disrespectful to the film, I think some people can reach ** or this way without thinking, or it may end up being a fool. Waste time, resources and money. The actor is very poor in the game. If you think about the dialogue, you can identify that family conflict is artificially imitated by bad communication between letters. Some Scenes Random Seam Summary: boring, anticipated, poor, merciful. Time, waste and waste.
