After watching this movie, I thought to myself that they really made the life of Iral Flein amazing! The movie is really beautiful candy candy In the 1930s, they got the atmosphere of Hollywood in the 1940s. The dress was great. All women looked glamorous and all men looked handsome and debonair. <br /> <br /> Is it a serious film about the life of Errol Flynn? Nah! This is a funny movie based on all the terrible things in her life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this picture? It was a film that had many promises but failed to deliver. Duncan Reghara was really good like Irèl Flin. He was not as good as the original, but he believed that Flin was not just a lovely playboy who did not take it seriously, but a person who was gifted with great talent was very disturbed and dissatisfied. The life of Flin's love has failed so much that he had so many failures. He lost many good friends during his life. She suffered from unknowable love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene of the film shows the beggary begging for him with the beggar and instead he goes away. She is shown in her tux, really looking empty and slowly walking around the pool as she pours her drink into the pool. It was a sad way to finish the film, but it was perfect because everyone now knows how he finally got separated from his alcoholics and his unnecessary lifestyle. <br /> <br /> There may be more depth in this picture, it is well written. Sure they showed all the scandals but they do not show the human center of Errol Flein. Wonderfully, Duncan Rehary was able to keep some emotional depth in the character of Irèl Flynn, though there is no depth to writing the film. <br /> <br /> I probably will not see this movie again, but I can still remember after seeing this picture, "Lord, it can be too much .....!" I give this picture a D +.
