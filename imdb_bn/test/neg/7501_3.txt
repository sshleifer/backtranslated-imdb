Imagine each woman in the context of this movie: A vagina that kills and eats people. Well, at least this is the imagination of a woman who fought against a man. Is that 99.99% women? But do not worry, it's not a man's eating and drinking. It's like a drain plug, more like a ridiculous slurping among them. There is no blood or part left behind. So for the blood, hat and Gore fans, forget this movie, there is not much to be found here. <br /> <br /> Two main characters in the picture are somewhat unreal. Helen is a good girl who is a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis Helen is a wonderful man to bring. <br /> <br /> This story is already a little stupid at the moment, but then they throw in two more equally ridiculous stories which send the film to a bad condition. B movie area. The first new sub-story Dennis has found new love in pairs; And then eventually killing one of them, and becoming a harmful bank robber. The second new subcontinent has found a new love for Helen's good policeman, who had saved her from the bad date of prostitution and decided that she wanted to marry him. Dennis and Helen finally meet again at the end of the film in incredible situations, and the cunning witch Helen's killer vagina is cured!
