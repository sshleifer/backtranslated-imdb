Horror movies are a strange thing, sometimes they fall in a form that works very well, sometimes they try bravely to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they are very bad, but they are actually fun. And sometimes they "The Cave". <br /> <br /> There should be abnormality in a good awakening / suspense film that guides you, allowing you to be interested in letters and their motivations so that they actually die when some kind of reaction. However, instead of introducing Caveans instead of introducing the elements that work in the first place, it can only be denied by the conversation of its shortest story. <br /> <br /> All characters are completely forgotten and a real back story that can do anything between them. Remote striking is divided into 30 seconds of unity, it is impossible to do anything more than frustration because the characters are almost random and at least feasible, many programs are closed in a dangerous way. <br /> <br /> To defeat a scene a bit, a victim is taken during a complete blackout, which can be a bit frightening to miss the effect of the word used to strike his assassination, it is not very memorable to push a pitcher of very thick macaroni and cheese. ). The camera that works on me thinks that the director has watched multiple inch nails video and a lasting effort that does not work for almost any purpose, but disturbs the viewers and misleads you and almost completely obsolete horror <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> I said, enjoy the movie.
