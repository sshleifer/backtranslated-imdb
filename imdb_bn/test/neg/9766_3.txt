I do not know what anyone says, this movie is ridiculous! It combines the chaos of threads with the ancients of the alternative comedy, and the results are a deadly dark, but unexpected funny satire on the policies of diplomacy of both the West and East at that time. You can give credit to the filmmakers to try the real-life dinner for "Duck and Cover" or "Protected and Survive!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apocalypse. Add Top Form Rick Mayal as the unfinished OTT SAS Commander and you just got it right. Dr. Strangelove is a worthy companion piece, and that's saying something.
