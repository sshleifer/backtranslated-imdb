Wow, what racist, the sacrilegious piece of celluloid rubbish, and the insignificance of the Western style. <br /> <br /> Explicit? Massive scenes of mass scenes, atrocities, violence, and intense amounts ... Modern movies give a good name, especially all those who love classic-age films. It is against old films today ammunition of old people. <br /> <br /> I can not see nude male bath scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Array films. Or will I hear the picture "Maffe-ER!" Exclaimed here and there. I sincerely doubt that the word was about 100 years ago. Still, the F-word is so common that you are thinking that you are seeing a story centered around today's urban areas, not in the old west of 1800. <br /> <br /> Presidency? Well, if all the white characters were good boys and every black person would have been nasty, cruel villains? Can you complain about a racist film? While coming home, we can not hear any condolences - as shown in this movie - Hundreds of theaters are being shown throughout the country? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember that name. Apparently, he is today's film makers "Ed Wood". Even Spike Lee did not have to be racist. You can not get much worse than this movie.
