Unfortunately, it is not as good as any other film that Jim Carey (producer and acting) and Brian Granger have worked together, but its bit is certainly laughing. Originally Dick Harper (Carre) thinks he is being promoted for a good job. That's until Dynocorpe drowned the company and closed. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Tia Leoni), and of course their son is having trouble with money. Whatever they try, they really can not raise the kind of money they want. So they started robbing in a few places. And then they decided to loot the guy set up in Dick, his ex-boss Jacques McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ridiculous bits when Carry Lift is singing "I believe I can fly" and when he uploads someone with robbery, he talks to a voice changer. OK!
