"Ultimate Comedown" wants to "tell something" about racism and inner city violence; Unfortunately, the message is illegal by the spell of nonsensical scripts, amateur art, and heavy elephants. How heavy the hand, you ask? To give you just an example, a black doctor came out of his secret place, unarmed, ready to surrender to the police with his hand in the air: One (all white) police say, "Do not shoot him, he is a doctor", which is another police Answers: "So what? He is still ****", and shot him in cold blood. Police have been portrayed as unknown, racist killers, although in the end there are many dead people among them, who are among the black people during the riots. And this whole event was meant to "sensitize" the white people for the disrespectful behavior of black people, when actually such things could only create hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones briefly features the screen with her smile and body as a Williams girlfriend, especially in low sex scenes, and the rating of this movie increases from 1 to 1 in 10.
