I saw this movie as part of the competition on Berlin night. It was billed by the host as a "world premiere" movie (though it seems that people here saw it before). I say, I still do not know what to do in the movie. I was a stranger to the book, just bought tickets two hours ago and had limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, I have trouble getting into the film. The movie is sometimes described by Jones's character but that perspective is not suitable for me in any way. And I can not really say that some photos have been counted lightly or not. The cuts were sudden and crushing, the scenes remained silent and the story was not always directly understood (even with the exception of the occult parts) - the actor was really good but could not really save the film in any way. It was entertaining but sometimes I just thought about the technical details of film making at this moment and what went wrong with it. I still do not know how the movie was made for the movie. It was a strange blend of light, dark, supernatural. It did not sadly paint me all and I saw it with a technical eye rather. But considering what is wrong in a film, seeing how a film has failed is the best sign. I would certainly expect some other things involved in this actor ... very bad!
