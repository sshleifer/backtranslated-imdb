I just gave this movie 2 instead of 1 because I am a humble person. This movie opened me 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful or just useful for me. <br /> <br /> The dialog is poor, the actors are never afraid! Even if it is supposed to be a horror movie. For example, Kurt collects her bone of her former colleague. She must be scared, but she looks pretty normal. The movie chick is such a clich√©. The thing I like about is the ultimate scene costume that he wore. And, by the way, the last box was very predictable with pink celestial cocoons. Actually, I was thinking more about sleeping around the back seat. But it still did not surprise me.
