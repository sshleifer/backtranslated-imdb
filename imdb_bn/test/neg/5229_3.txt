This film is based on the novel Stephen King, where the mysterious new shopkeeper Leland Gant (Max von Sedo) offers the Castle Rock Castle for its desire - but this transaction is too expensive to pay. Local Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) was soon forced to face a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious situations. <br /> <br /> Stephen King down the average for the movie: I can see why some people would feel annoying. It really plods along with the offer of fear and forces the visitors to spend time (again and again) with a bunch of annoying harmful, which is awe of each other. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the novel and do not believe this helpless movie can be judged. There are many unfortunate changes from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Von creates a gido on the condo. We are not amused by it, supposed to be the guitar's sketch at the right time. I also hate that the Sheriff's primary deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and such an annoying, Barney Fife-type moron. Star Ed Harris seems to be seeing that his agent was forced to do this, but the professional he is, he really drowned his teeth in his dialogue. Bani Bedelliya (as Pangban's love interest syndrome) and amanda plummer (one of his mentally unsupported roles) came in favor of creating the most desired character. <br /> <br /> This is also evil and meaningful. <br /> <br /> Although I see a bunch of unlikely movie characters, it looks a bit annoying. Claymax has some good explosions. <br /> <br /> I give films a better rating than movies I usually give, but in this case I think I really want to be honest and say: 3/10.
