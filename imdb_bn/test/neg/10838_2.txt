It stars Sandra Bulkak in one of the worst films. Ben Affile must continue behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his fart and is not played. I actually stayed for 54 minutes in this movie, before that I was so annoyed that I was forced to leave the theater. It's a boom from the start, anyway in 54 minutes of the film. In the context of "Guess what happened in my way ..." over death has been overshadowed. Somehow it just does not seem to be romantic about something funny, or cheating on one another. Parents should be aware that it may not be a suitable film for your children, especially a printed monk that can see Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where the author / producer / director thinks it is "acceptable" to smoke it jointly .... while running it .... and then there is no result when caught. I'm not a pride, and when I was younger I used to smoke in my fate but I guarantee you, I will not see my teenager-teenager and they are tough A & B students If you want to watch the Sandra Bulk movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Float" which I believe is the best of two works.
