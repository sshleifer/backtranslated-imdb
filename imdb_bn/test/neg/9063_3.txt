As a serious marathon, I was extremely disappointed in this movie. His target audience has definitely run a marathon, or the bride marathoners who are not. For the first time at the time of preparation for the Chicago Marathon, following the story of one of the marathons, a senior, a wounded runner and two Elite, this movie is due to lack of a good education, whose story focuses most on a female teacher. Annoying The brief history of the Boston Marathon and the generalization of marathoning in Dewan Kastar's training sessions, I've been short-lived, let me emphasize: this was short !! Talking about some joe runners watching their water bottles and watching the marathon on Saturday is not inspirational, and nonstop clich√©s will appreciate you for the achievement and feeling, which is almost an hour for you. If you're a marathon for the first time, this movie might give you a sense of "I can do it". For somebody else, run away.
