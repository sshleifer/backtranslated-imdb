John Travolta reiterated his role as Hollywood gangster Chile Palmer, who now focuses on the music industry. Using her "conversation skills", she tried to play an independent record label with the friend of a murdered friend, directed by Uma Thurman, and her young singer (Christina Million) tried to get a hit record. <br /> <br /> Before watching this sign, I heard it was a terrible movie. However, the cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. Instead of movie art, the movie often focuses on the music industry. The film industry is very poorly depicted and they use a bunch of gender stereotypes. I got a great job of spoofing the film industry, because I could not tell about this motive. The same thing can not be said for a seagull and the effort comes as lazy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Vince Vaughan gave a fun performance though he became boring before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I had more hope from him. John Travolta comes back as Chile and he works well. Its performance is kind of dust though. Christina Million gives a terrific performance and she is not good for a singer. Cedric The Entertainer gives a good performance though she is not filming for too long. There is a bunch of cayos with Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary indicates Gray and he does a poor job. She just does not manage the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. The product was a ton of placement and it got boring after a while. Also in 118 minutes, the film has a lot of long and slow motion. The film needs to be badly edited and it was not clearly. Fortunately for movies, the actors were able to rise above the weak points and scripts and they provided some interesting scenes. Sometimes, the film tries very hard when it was actually quite funny. Compared to the original, Siegel does not measure well. However, be cool, a fairly harmless and forgotten comedy. In the end, be cool, and it's worth a rental. Rating 6/10
