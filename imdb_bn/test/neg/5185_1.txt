What makes this movie so bad is bad? This is the humorous comedy in the sub-park? Could it be awesome "trendy" suck ass music? Perhaps the uninspired story to go somewhere? Or even Trouser Lords gives her worst performing performance and insults the wounds even that this sting keeps all her clothes across the length of the Turkish sandwich's fact. Whatever happens because this film sucks, however it really does really. I never wanted to see a movie with Dean Cameron instead of seeing what I was seeing in my life, but "Ski School" is a compelling composition by Comic Genius compared to this progress. <br /> <br /> Grade: F. <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Nicole Nesbitt, Biffy Tyler and Susan Stokes all publish their toppare tits <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Star on demand
