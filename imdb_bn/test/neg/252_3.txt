The reputation of "RVAM" I first heard of one of the first Medvedev Style movie books, "The 50 Western Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards". Every review of the movie basically said that the film was so bad that it would make you bloody out of sight to see it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally came closer to show it, I was looking forward to a cathartic experience that could only provide a truly cinematic stanker. <br /> <br /> However, "robots" were not really bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, it is certainly a "Z" film through and through. Some of the voice dubbing (such as A. Gordon Murray is generally in the importation case) are very cheesy and the film seems structurally something like Frankenstein, because a large part of it is described in the previous "AJCT" Mummy "movie, a voice-over by leading people. A dead giveaway: Any time the question is asked "what happened then?" The conversation is doubly asked, you will consolidate the plot Watching the re-associated footage, combined with little respect for the speed, in RVM, "What happened then?" Or "What happened?" The first hour is spoken at least four times. <br /> <br /> Apart from even structural problems, plots and The dialog does not translate well to older American audiences. For example, the hero explains the background (and explains and explains). Parke have included a comment, "a doctor who had suddenly become an evil master criminal," and began to search for the asset, which guards ajateka mummy. No background, no explanation, he just "suddenly become evil." Obviously, it was a beautiful undiscriminating audience target. <br /> <br /> <br /> The author of "Showcase" of this movie, "Robot" This robot is the worst impact from the "Undersea Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus vs the Martianos". Compared to Junk's shortcomings, Tin Man Terminator looks like the "Wizard of Oz" like chassis, which in pursuit of Linda Connor by the foundry in T2. Ajtek Mummy himself has been designed and executed manually; She is well known, unwanted, known enough like a Mummy, and is known to be mostly independent of the American audience known as "Boris Karloff" bandage collection. But the idea of ​​anyone who designed robots in this follow-up was not ... or there was no budget. They can at least give some knees for heaven. In addition to <br /> <br />, Tytler's war was executed extensively and lasted for less than 60 seconds. (I saw the match shoving over the junior high playground that is more convincing.) Then the movie basically just stops. While considering the time of increasing the time of war itself, the film itself seems to be in the minds. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not as horrible or inaccessible as a penman. Francis was film or Larry Buchanan film. Compared to "slow e-go-go" or "invasion of eye make-up", "RVTM" is like the movie of Coppola. It's just dust and boring and silly. Actor capable (a mannered B movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Especially Dr. About the Crop, his cap and the "Phantom of the Opera" case I have often found him, even after being his villain. <br /> <br /> However, I see a lot, too bad. File it under "Samson Vase the Vampire Women" under "Interesting Mexican Teenage Inequality".
