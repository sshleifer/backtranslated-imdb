After watching this movie and listening to the comment, it is clear that Michael Rodford does not understand the point of this game. He did not fully understand the first formula that he suffered pain in the seventeenth century Venice's film. That sounds really strange, yes, the misunderstanding of the film will try to correct its position as the right position. But anyone who is studying Shakespeare knows that while setting most of his plays in foreign locals, culture and values ​​are always in contemporary England. It does not hurt the film, but it lacks the necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Rodford kills this image, it's deadly deadly. He manages to suck out every joke from the script, leaving the whole manufacturing plane. Emotions are banged out of each ounce letter. Even Shailak's 'we do not waste the blood' speech is a soft, strange tactic that seems to work only because it is supposed to be done. Lovers are serious and more restrained (Joseph Feenz offers the most romantic lines in this year's movie in a rarely heard comedy), Gretiyano (who promises to behave at one time) collected more than Bashiono and more. Who promises to treat him), Jessica is reluctant to leave his father and lives with Lorenzo Pouting. <br /> <br /> In the words of Blood and Wetred Down Court scene, the director said in his shock that an audience smiled at Portia's 'meat a pound, more, or less' sentence; Finally it was the release of laughter. 'The Merchant of Venice' is a comedy and the most fun and violent part of this concept, which is something other than the boldest erotic drama. However <br /> <br /> some of the most entertaining scenes cut. Characters are forced into high dramatic curtains, so they come out of the word Ibsen character Victorian poetry. And the ending of the comedy, where all the good people sleep happily, sinks in a disgraceful despair, seems to be finding hard-hearted lip peace with the near death rather than being restrained with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio came out of the film holding their hats like illiterate people. <br /> <br /> The movie is poorly executed because creative power can not understand the script. It is weird where it is strict. It should be tender where it is stored. It's Michael Radford where it should be William Shakespeare.
