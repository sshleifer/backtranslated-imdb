This is the worst movie I've ever seen, if, one has to be. After seeing this piece of Sh * t, I wanted to write Madonna and claim compensation for my time, but now I think I want to write Madonna and claim a great 80 albums (she can record a good album It does not seem to live in this life for the disaster.) <br /> <br /> Your opinion can be given in the movie <br /> <br /> <br /> This actor who plays "lawyer" in this movie The actor is trying to influence this absolute race. But, the best was over. I stuck with my eyes on television and wandered with my jaw because I was thinking about my own thinking, "Is that the end?" If Madonna does not have any pop icons during this movie, then the movie will destroy her career alone and the most interesting thing Was that I just saw this picture in the movie "Who the Girl" to watch the movie. Imagine where they kept ............................ ....... the end!
