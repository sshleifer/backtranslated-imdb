I saw the movie * Star * in The Daily Show, and I can remember that I can stay safe (the movie went on to comedy Central premiered, then the theater). Oh way! <br /> <br /> "Citizens buy" like this "Shakes the Clown"! To avoid, avoid, avoid all costs. Not a smile, even a sunny shine This film will release your face in the pumpkins and your eyes will burst like the last reminder of "riders". I can not even think of a bad movie, it's "Manos" or "Esther". Kill Python, run away, run away! Why is this green light without anyone using their own money? There is not a good line of horror, not a good joke, and the only bad thing ... to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I think if it is made properly, it will be too much sunny. Whereas, I need a new pancreatia for retching so loudly. Anyone involved in this travesty.
