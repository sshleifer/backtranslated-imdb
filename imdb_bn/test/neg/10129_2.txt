I do not know why people are so crazy about the show. It's very annoying. The joke is not around what we usually say funny. It's good, Alex said something that's not funny or interesting and then suddenly has a ridiculous background background. My friend and I look at each other looking empty-handed as if we asked each other, "so funny? !!" Seriously, the show we saw, you will not hear any laughter or cough. Just a blank look. So we stopped watching it. I personally have a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But show us such frustration. This show can sometimes be the worst comedy sitcom ...
