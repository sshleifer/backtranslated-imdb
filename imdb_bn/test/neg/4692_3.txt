Esther Williams plays romanticly integrated water skiing secretary who wants to stop walking on the water and be wife of some people; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are her potential choices for a husband. Despite the fine watersque sequence filmed in the Cyprus Gardens of Florida, this romantic comedy is wildly wild. As directed by the boarding director Charles Walters, here everything is thought to be deliberately innocent, which does not lend a lot of stable power to the picture. Even the big moments of Esther's water are not gently fading from their swimmers, although they are more preferred than men with acids, both of which are colorless. Carlin baker, Martin Luther is the most vivid of the bunch in his first film as an ungrateful ex-girlfriend. Flimsy stuff, indeed. * **** to 1/2
