I hope a comedy about NVA, but it's a parody. It shows the Eastern German National Army in light which is not accurate, and is certainly not true. <br /> <br /> No one can make comedy about everything until the underlying events change. Even a Kommedy about German KJD is possible, such as Roberto Bengei with "Life Best". <br /> <br /> NVA will be a "OK" comedy, because it's okay with Jokes overall. Not something special - not sunny, but enough to live with it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Western Europe is preparing to attack a dead instrument with his friends Lal army. Everything that is used to get the maximum from its troops. In 1968 an army force attacked the CSPR and was ready in March to destroy SolidornoC in Poland. You can not make a movie without showing the smallest variety, or you make a parody about a kg, Guantanamo or 9/11? Osama bin Laden as a funny drunk guy? In the Afghan Taliban camp, about 90 minutes of funny Osama, where he jokes and provides training, compared to what the film is doing about NVA!
