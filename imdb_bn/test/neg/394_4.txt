Actually, when you see it, my only word comes up. <br /> <br /> The role of an average (slightly more than average), the use of the camera was average (actually below the average, the image was so shiny and color was cereal and smoking). The plot was a good one but it was so slow and Is not used well. It can be a lot more if it did not go to a graduate pace and we saw more of the characters in the background. <br /> <br /> We saw Alice here and there flashbacks and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is trying to make a mood woman last for her and her daughter.) She saw her flashback when she was in high school And his friend tells him, "Tell your mom to make some good food" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yes that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. <br /> <br /> I would have been convinced that his mother was drunk or someone abused him, but there was nothing wrong with her house, she was embarrassed. How wonderful! <br /> <br /> We did not even notice what a couple's life was like (they were prostitute for a while only and forgot their name, given their child at the age of 9) month old.) This really much more may be. Alice has been abused by her drunken mother could go down to Florida with her friend but could have become a prostitute then. Or something else, which is the main plot of this movie (which is) Elise's original plot, probably a 90% of the population living in the Homeschool family, who escapes from Florida but then turns prostitute <br /> <br /> I I do not see why it won a prize for Sun's (it has won a prize against a great competition that won a prize.) <br /> <br /> To me, Alice's Boston / Ni England accent seemed forced. It does not seem genuine. (I knew I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia's home.) <br /> 4/10 I think your time is not really valuable.
