Get smart titles to get stupid. There is not a funny line or joke in the whole movie. This picture is so bad that it shows the Austin Powers film Shakespeare. A few more movies like this and Steve Carroll can kiss goodbye in his career. As Anna Hathaway, what is she doing in this film? She is a good actress but just plain terrible. <br /> <br /> Writing Lettmet. There is no fun, cute, or evil line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> depends on the comedy timing. Anyone that would tell the director. The line that was supposed to be funny (and not), I've ever seen was distributed with the worst feeling of comic timing. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
