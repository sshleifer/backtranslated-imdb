The brightness reports of this film seem to be overwhelmingly overwhelming and other reviewers are not seeing any different movies, but I fail to see how I can find something other than helpless, helpless, vague, excessive, and sometimes helplessly annoying. . I'm some schalky horrible fanatic. I like the worst fears and anti-American love against American fears, but I need to warn about any potential audience before investing this movie two hours of life. <br /> <br /> It could have been so great. A reporter is investigating a series of bizarre incidents and incidents that seem apparently incomplete, but a series of immune tropes connect them - dead kabutara, cold words, curiously tied knit presence ... people from our reporter, Interviews, filming them and then passing them. The three important characters of this quarrel among people, a young man, a bizarre mental girl, a very annoying, mad psychiatrist, and a crazy old woman and her son, whose importance is not later expressed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, it disables two hours of running time. It's even distant horror or surprise. Like horrific scenes, scary shots of incredible looks are seen incredibly bad, twice or worse, when we are told they are about to happen. Other strategies, such as telling us that a family not only cared about me in interviews "died five days later", shuddering just a little straightforward. <br /> <br /> This image will grow a little later, our reporter, cameraman, psychic and curse women go to the village to 'remove' the curse associated with these deaths. However, at that time, I had a condition of catatonic irritability, and could not care less, so all the fairly unclear camera-work and shocks were destroyed on me. "Final Tape" is pretty good, but again, I used to care and wanted to finish this movie. <br /> <br /> Not boring and dull, scary and unclear, I would advise you away from Nero. It's a promising moment, but it's a movie that has been created weakly and is not worth your time.
