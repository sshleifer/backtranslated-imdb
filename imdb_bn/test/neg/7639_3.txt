Lack of character development proved fatal for this movie. Valeria Golino's character Grazia starts to look like a hesitant personality but quickly degenerates into a trick and seems unreal. Other characters are thin, perhaps the author's fault is not the actors' do. The only exception is Philippe Pucillo's younger son Filippo: his strengths and barbarians are fun and treacherous. <br /> <br /> I think children's cruel cruelty should contribute to the atmosphere in the atmosphere and strengthen the wide-ranging spirits in the city, but for me, free ruthlessness is unnecessary and contributes to overall irritability of the film. Some scenes were fun but not necessarily for that purpose, for example, when the abused dogs begin to be fat and healthy and they are ready to show. Beautiful cast and setting can not be made for an interesting trailer but carry the whole movie.
