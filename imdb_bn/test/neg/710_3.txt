Oh, why would it end? "Nice mess" / "I could not help it" to stop Laurel and Hardie's last film, Crowdley Cranked-up Kaku Theme (with Halal Roquec wrong credits), both of them had an extraordinary parody about themselves. In it, their relationship is now fully acting uncertain, asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick are created. People kill the King of New York, but Chaplin's final specimen is not as close to such a stranger. <br /> <br /> The look of two comedians is really a hit to someone who loves Laurel and Hardy. The video cover that I hold, shows the head, the elderly smile and the burning skin, with a blobber on the back, "This Slieve photograph is for illustration purposes only and it does not reflect the content of the film." Not necessarily? It does not even close. The actual film looks at them as compared to at least fifteen years old photographs, which fits the sleeve, with the weight of the weighty weight. It's not ridiculous, or ridiculously, not fat, it usually appears, but on the side of the sick look and obesity. After the continuation of the stroke, the film died seven years after it was created. Stan, in the meantime, suffer from a prostrate problem and dysentery, looks terrible as its weight has greatly reduced. Every time something bad happens to him, such as lifeboat and squash into a table, you are afraid of his life. Even Oli is giving him a traditional slap, he is afraid that he will die. After completing this film, he will last for fifteen years, eventually leaving away from a heart attack in 1965. Such indifferent actors are annoyed with the growing ideas of old and death of painful death. And it's troubling the health, and performance, both screens, watching their deviations. When I, and, I'm sure, almost everyone likes to think about Laurel and Hardy, I think Way West, Barry organization or our relationship. Seeing them with their physical illness and performing rigorous routines at the end of their career dogs are a deadly incident on their memorable memories. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < So if Monty Collins wrote "Gaga", what were four texts? And in that case, Monty Collins was given why there was no evidence of a single "dispersion" in the whole bucket? More than 40% of the movies are spent traveling to non-minibus islands, during which time we saw the most painful visual scenes among boys. When I saw the bat scene and wanted to kill me, I wanted to die, so it was bigger than the child's unconsciousness. Still the film is dubbed to throw all the support that is killing the death of stone, unable to speak English. This does not only disconnect film, but it seriously reduces the reaction of Stan and Wylie to their co-stars. Directly with incredible film stock and absolutely shocking performances, it is completely distorted by $ 2 million dollars. To be honest, it looks terrible and when a DVD release cleans up the picture, the sound and image quality are much lower than their raw work. <br /> <br /> "Friend" of Stan and Oly, Giovanni and Antonino Charisma-free Boros who are standing widely against Lorl and Hardee's old report. This is another big problem with the movie, any supporter characters are funny, or boys lead to innocent mentality. Dlld hardness showing L & H ("you - lean") has stood as an isolated social offensive instead of their boyfriend sub-anarchists. There is evidence of some bold political satire - although the Duck Soup is not it - and this is a fun thing without any island rules. Perhaps it's more relevant than ever before, a movie that shows the problems of immigration and American constitution has suddenly become the most popular in 2003. Unfortunately, outside of a fun scene for selecting Stan "public", this is not really the case. And this is the hard end of some of the black humorous - whether Laurel and Hardie, where rape is directly visible, and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, just a chance to accidentally face someone, your good idea? Even after Stan and Olly after sharing a bed, we also get a specific reference, kisses him with Stan - kisses in kisses with oily kisses. It is also worrisome that Stan and Oli's illegal immigrant friend, Antonin, ends up eating his life lion. It seems, I never thought that Laurel and Hardy could see the film where they were due to execution. The need for uninterrupted and weird description is about how bad the whole thing is, with America's liberation (the same version is available on the video), the attempt of hacking failure of 16 minutes, more pointer with hacking. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unexpected, this horrifically created, uninterrupted unfunny movie only makes the reputation of Stan and Ollie ruin - to avoid all costs.
