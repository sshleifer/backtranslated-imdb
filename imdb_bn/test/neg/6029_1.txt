This is the worst battle movie I've ever seen, perhaps most likely made the worst. I'm incredible that some people actually rated it as 10. It has a stunning lack of practical traces even in reality. Almost every war film is shown in this film and it is done badly. On the other hand, if I did not make it unusually bad, then I would not see it at all.
