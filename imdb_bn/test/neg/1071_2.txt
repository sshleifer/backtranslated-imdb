I do not understand what hit hard about this movie! I do not understand why high school kids should see this! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, did I scream him alone? Clive classical music, long tracking shots, at that stage the strange emotions of the movie were being intended for me. He was only happy when he entered the house and the whole cast was there with his tortoise to keep the wrist there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, cliches. I'm looking forward to a young person waiting to write a movie that I'm able to connect and I got this stereotype driven piece of emo rubbish instead. It was like a dark version of the heartbreak high that needed a precise finish. <br /> <br /> Why have all the Tharams in the Australian drama become frustrated or have it really been a strange problem? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it became 'faded'. And I need a good smile.
