During the channel-surfing, I've added the film and it looks like another weak-headed Christian film for the last time (which I think is rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only watched the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part of the UFO and Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to classify it as an embarrassing and scary representation of Christian faith and as a rather sad film in an artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the script was terrible, the acting was moderate, and the pens were poor. Cinematography and direction sub-par: There is no attractive scene, no layered plot line, no creativity. Do not blame it in the budget - movies can still be interesting without special effects. It was not. Christian movies can not excuse their mediation and irrationality only due to their message in artistic circles. And the message here was very rarely "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** The rest of the comments have been targeted to Christians <br /> <br /> Firstly, it screams and swings your customers immoral in a business I can not win a single free iPod only, I just want to spend $ 300 at the participating store. Nonchristians do not seem to see a sci-fi film and then bomb attacks with Christian propaganda that there is a sledgehammer all subtlety. No friend to secret agendas, much less conversion. <br /> <br /> Do not threaten people to believe your beliefs are true. While dealing with the suspect "unbeliever", the actors representing Christians were curious, like a screamer - even they could go so far on the stage of romance for fear of faith. Representative Dialogue: "Return to Jesus - Or Be Good!" "Well, do not trust me - but you'll be sorry!" "The day you die, I will definitely guarantee that you want to pay more attention to this Jesus' things - when you are so much affectionate!" OK, I could be too much, but it certainly came off in the same way. If you think it's a "clear message for Christ", you're wrong. I do not recall Jesus using threats and stresses. And I do not think people can make a real decision to believe in their fears. So Christians, do not use it as "certification tools" for your "unsaved" friends. It is heavy, aggressive, and wrong to film a real Christian message. Third, theology was bad. It did not have any place to identify Jesus as the insurer of Hell, as well as to debate or discuss, and did not try to discuss whether there might be a UFO or alien life. Instead, it gives a pat answer: "When generosity occurs, enemies planning to deceive people UFOs" which are not biblical and are not widely accepted by most Christians. Just as the Bible does not refer to UFO or Alien, so you can not use it as a source to draw one or the other conclusion. Miracles are not necessarily even a widely accepted, word-Bible concept, although today's evangelical Christians seem to believe because of the popular book series. If you do your research (as many supporters are suggesting), the concept of two events of Christ (the first as hello) is relatively new phenomena of church tradition, which is popular by some travel propagators in the 20th century. Most religious Christians will probably find a huge expanse of this film's message, which depends on many unsupported predictions. <br /> <br /> Originally, this film marks an appropriate part of the music and is an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I will not recommend it.
