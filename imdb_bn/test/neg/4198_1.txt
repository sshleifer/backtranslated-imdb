I hired Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a Chess giant-on-three-thrill rides. Scarecrows also makes me weird. The film had an effective title sequence, but what followed was quite long (flat, bad light, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently, I noticed that DH2: Mother had a pretty wide advertisement campaign. I thought that the first one was a little successful, so they took it a bit forward, probably the fear of some big budget and FX by the killer fear. Well, there is no fear in the video ... there is no problem. Problems begin with a title sequence which looks like an incomplete concept, strange shapes and bars are removed by title and pest control. As long as the actual photography ... the sun will shine every time the sun rises, so you have these bright white whites, make sure that you see some mini-budget mini-DV project which is something Midwestern has painted in his circles. Acting did not have all the acting. Cheap rip off of the girls in the flush below the standards of newborn film students. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was jarring and choppy. (For example- the editor will cut new shots every time, you want a word change viewer with it here). It is as if somebody collects their friends and family, a video camera in a vocal group for three days, it gives light on night sequences (no rage - this is what they actually did), tapes footage on their computer , Spend some (too) rough versions, drop into some songs, do some fantastic sound work or mix, burn them directly into the DVD and watch And put them in the store shelf. A horrible fan should be insulted by such direct video actions that invalidate any skill or style. Since a person is able to get a portion of an image of a video camera owner and a tape, it should not be disclosed to the public. If I can give it less rating than one, I would like.
