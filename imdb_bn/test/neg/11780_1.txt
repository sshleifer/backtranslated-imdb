When I first appeared in 1986, I saw this movie. At that time I was young and enjoyed all the common comedy available, for example; Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheich and Chong, so I believe that my judgment represents most "anonymous" people. <br /> <br /> The full trailer of this movie was started by the trailer, with the film coming out for the new "My Little Tony" movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was so violent that it was mostly yanked from the theater before the end of the primary week. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that anyone who tries to duplicate this steam pile of man's waste will lose corporate money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
