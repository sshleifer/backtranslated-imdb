In short, this film declares artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any other live manager has more style and content in the current European movies. Has taken shape. So it is not easy to say that in his latest efforts, there is not only another disappointment after two relentless films, but a complete and total disaster ensures that he has finished the concepts, out of laughter and the worst, he created sympathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. The summary of all Almodovar film is almost impossible. This time, actually, if you are familiar with his previous work, it is easy. "Broken Ambrisses" rebuilding a "genre of law", at this moment the director directs and corrupted jolored lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> I'm doing a summary of those who are not familiar with that movie. If you do not want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind film director, who was a famous film director, after a chance to face the road, she seduces a sexy stupid woman while reading a paper. (Yes, really, how it started). Then he gets a visit to his agent and best friend. He mentions that he learned from the paper that millions of people have died, which took the story 14 years ago. He can still see and continue to manage the next picture. As he led millions of millionaire's inexperienced ownership, he was immediately bigger as he smitten with her. Millionaire discovered their relationship with the video being silenced by her lesbian son, which she lip-synced by an interpreter (some great scenes: Sicilya Roth). After violent quarrels, Maldivian escaped from an underwater resort along with the director, where he learned that millions of people of the film's production produced the worst edit and destroyed the director's reputation. The couple decided to return, but there is an accident in which the director becomes blind and the actress dies. At present, he learns that his agent has saved the film's negativity and started reconstruction. <br /> <br /> As a "bad education", this thin story has various sub-plots for the cow and as a "bad education", the result is more confusing than the satisfaction. For example, the agent's son, who works as DJ, has too much of a sudden drug - which is totally unnecessary and more poorly explained for the plot. <br /> <br /> Actors blame in most cases, but the way their letters are written. As an agent, Blanca Portila has many skelets in her closet, even a brilliant performance can not protect the character from the mockery. Louise Homer is living in a visionary, artificial world of an old man's dream where English alias and some sweet words may tempt some super model. And Penelope Cruz is the organ organs of this old man's sexual imagination. Her character is completely lifeless. It is thoroughly surprised why he will be away from an old man, who helped the youngest person in his family, who is not very interesting enough to please the romantic hero or passion fuse. <br /> <br /> But these flaws will not make this picture so terrible. However, Almadovar's director (or any kind of storytell) has done the worst thing to do without the idea: he quotes himself, has made some progress and has done very little. Film-in-the-film, which uses "Broken Ambience" as a plot-driving device, is actually called "women on the edge of women's nervous system" (1988), this time only called "Chicks and Sweets". This overwhelming title gives you an indication of how to treat it with the classic of this choice: When the "Broken Ambrisses" made the dialogue in the final ten minutes, the scullball was a great contributor to the original film, here it faces a rigorous, colorless, pesky business. . <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this DOA has been the brain behind brainwashing of the past wondrous, as the last Indiana Jones feature is quite frightening and frustrating. Perhaps many people will not agree, because Aldaudova was so gifted. I rather humbly pay my attention to the reader "all about my mother", or to "bind me", or "High Heels" or "Matador", which is the unique and unfinished talent of all the Almodors. Some more pictures like this, and his legacy could well be destroyed for good.
