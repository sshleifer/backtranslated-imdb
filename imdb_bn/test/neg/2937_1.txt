I think this photo is very spontaneous ... the main character does not know that until he is gay he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a wrist on his shoulder !!! I was so annoyed that after screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I went and talked to a screen writer to complain about this movie. These types of films that need to work on banned Glad.
