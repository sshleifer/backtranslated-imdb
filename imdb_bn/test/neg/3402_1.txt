Originally, it was probably designed as a promotional material for movies produced by the same horror director, which can be even worse than this documentary and the worst movie, so avoid it always. <Br /> <br /> For this documentary, it is entertaining; Recreational and blatantly confusing! Most "historical" visible footage is probably the most likely, sometimes historical events that are not entirely related to events that have been sadly cut in this documentary and can be sometimes more dramatic than ever. There is no doubt that Weaverli is a striking place with its striking history, but to create a documentary to sell locale and related products to the market, lack of good words, unexpectedly useless <br /> <br /> Yes, I lived in Kentucky throughout my life, and I visited the place many times. Waverly Hills deserve respect; And there is nothing respectable about this punk documentary.
