The most annoying thing about this movie is that it was not Hogwash's load (there was no intelligence threat to create a CPSSS movie). The problem is that it whitewashes the entire Unfair Strategy of the FBI and the Anonymous Activity Committee. Secret Information, Gossip Complaint, has become an endless search - Such things have been secreted like a secret police Thug KGB, and perhaps, patriotic Americans are fighting. Yet the FBI did not do them and did not bat a single eye. This is the only realistic part of the film and they do not present it with any shame. By amending the constitution, the communists only issued the bill. The movie is a movement of black civil rights, the Communist-inspired, another pack of lies that creates thinly covered complaints. It is extremely difficult to apologize for such dishonorable propaganda today, even when it comes to understanding the badness of the time, when one can understand how harmful the real people are.
