I Shakespeare lover from childhood I am a Jew. Venice's commercials are anti-semitic without any issues and without them, and a hard scholars and literary lovers try to explain it again. <br /> <br /> In this game, Shylak has been portrayed as a demon and a cold heart and there is no forgiveness, no love, no warmth, and no love for cruel retribution, but Christians are kind, moral people. His intentions in the game revolve around money (he takes revenge for his business as well as revenge for blind racial harm), not ideal ideology or racial pride, because this movie wants to believe you. And this character is given to him by Shakespeare, not by other characters. As a final evidence, the happy ending loses its meaning to the Jews and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I accept this and go ahead. This is part of history and I enjoy Shakespeare despite this fact. So I hope to play it directly in a movie based on this game. I would rather not see the adaptive work to say about her rich language and story. <br /> <br /> But most of the armor in the film has lost the atrocities and playful characters. For example, in the last scene, men discovered a secret work in Portia, like a person who snatched her ring, instead of the real expression and misunderstanding, it has become an important game where two bitchy women <br /> <br /> Instead, we have set aside just the detailed set of things, the drawback of rich languages, the poor cast, the intense court scene, Bong is a debate. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I Despite the fact that the makers of this movie dragged them out of their hats, many haters are left, only now people can create excuses and do not think the Jewish script is so bad. <br /> Finally, one of the actors is wrong in most cases. Passino has come out of his league and does not mention too uncomfortable, horrible fake pronunciation with language. Bassanio is as ruthless and awkward with Fiennes's language. Irons are always as reliable but do not do much with its role. Portia is okay but unlike, and is covering up with bad makeup, just like the movie.
