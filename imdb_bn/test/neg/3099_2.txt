What is this story on the screen? At first I would say, do not touch this movie, it's your best (it sucks). And really what the story looks like at the beginning, but after ten minutes it all gets worse. And not all that, you can see it very rarely on the screen all the time dark. <br /> <br /> Do not touch.
