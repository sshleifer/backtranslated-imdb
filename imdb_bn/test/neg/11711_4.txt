I was lucky enough to read the book before and I knew a little about the tournament in England. <br /> <br /> The direction and editing of most TV movies was really awesome. I felt like I was watching a really bad drama about the film's duration. <br /> <br /> There were many cuts in the first important parts. And with the exception of the important events of that time, Henry with Rome, with the desire to divorce Catherine of aggression with Rome, divorced from Rome and established her own church. They just stuck in the book. I am creative for freedom but for the limitations, especially when you are dealing with a well-written book as your starter point. In the book Mary Daughter was born the first Catherine, and then she was born Henry. Both of their parents are Henry's eight They show Harry's first catherine in the movie. And Catherine's father William Carey advised. <br /> <br /> Because Boolean sister was probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you do not read this book and Henry does not know about 8 courts, I would recommend staying away from this movie. And for those who read this book, the film will bother you for lack of details and important plots.
