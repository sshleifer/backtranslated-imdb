Strictly long dreary cinematic waffle. I could not believe how bad this picture was. I saw it as innumerable people who gushed about it on this site. Am I watching the same movie? The whole episode is one dimensional. What Garcos did in the past did not affect his (or anyone else's) future, and nobody was influenced by their past. I think Socrates told about the plays that if a scene is removed from a scene without a scene, then it should not be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule, and so, after a terrible scene, he did his 'work' stuff. Even the crashed plane in the house was unexpected, it was not surprising, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> While writing it (1 December 2002), although many people say that it does not bother adding any one of their favorite movies, a memorable quote. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
