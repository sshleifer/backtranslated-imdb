Although not as bad as some movies ("horrible" nuclear twister ")" Mulludown "still relies on common misconceptions and mistakes about the wrong progression of the nuclear power industry, I am currently studying nuclear engineering for graduate degrees, and associated with the industry It was easy for a person to clearly identify flaws. <br /> <br /> Churnonblue Style Churning Riding in fear may occur in an American plant, the film says that any slow (even partly, one of the guest commentators in the film) means disaster for the area. In fact, when an American plant destroys a partially slow core, it will burn at no risk to neighboring areas No. Partially Maldown has landed on a three-mile island and no radioactive substance was released in the environment, in this country Because of the normal stability of used fuel and original design, large amounts of infection are generated. <br /> <br /> The security step shown in the film is probably part of the film away from the truth, an important strategic location - power plant, chemical plant, military base, some Regardless of how you respond to conversations through dialogue as a disobedient drill Do not ever react to them. The sound of the alarm where it is especially true of a nuclear plant, the responses will be immediately scratched, close them off. By pushing a button in the Scramming Control Room (you do not have to keep the "Shutdown Mode" core as pictured in the movie) and nuclear radiation chemistry prevents you from backing up a core. Power within a scram around 9 hours. So if this scenario is played in real life, attackers will not be able to create a significant malown. According to the theory, if they open the core immediately, partly due to the remaining temperature may be partial, but it can be almost impossible in the numerous backup systems available in plants - they are much more than the backup backup that they use. <br /> <br /> <br /> For expensive fuel pond, it can be possible to make a dirty bomb by blowing the pools, but only one truck is b Sporchers are much more difficult than full parking. Near the pool. Under the fuel (approximately) 18 feet high pure water around the fuel. Water can not become radioactive (they do not speak in movies like radioactive vapors). Water dissipation particles, but water itself can not; This is the reason for very thorough refinement. So the only way to turn the fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get fuel from the water. This simple job as water is very heavy, and the pool is below the ground with very thick concrete walls. The explosive fuel will be below the pool (which is safely fastened). And a lot of explosives must be a hack, because it is very difficult to go through a blast * water Even after this incident, expensive fuel is not very radioactive, and due to the explosion, the number of deaths mentioned in the film will not be as high, especially small amounts of radioactive material will spread. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of a basic film, I was a bit tired of the style used. Continuous fading and out, snowy black and white use, and fast tracking and panning amateur artist looked. The letters were one dimensional, especially those in the US government. There are some problems throwing in the movie, but it will not be discussed because it will be a big explosive. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3/10
