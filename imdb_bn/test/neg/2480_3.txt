I have seen every episode, and all the same self-absorbed skinned little bra in the character, there is no character development in 5 years (pregnancy is not your development event if you still have the same daddyies girl, only now whines to Dili Danny because parents are almost ) Sam never changes or grows, which makes its annoying, repetitive, and very annoying in season 3. Afterwards, Danny is a common soft character that receives orders from everyone in his life (he has no prescription, his own morality), especially Mary and Delinda. Old boring clich√© they really get very annoying will not stop and close. <br /> <br /> James Cain can work and his character is okay, he is just another hack writer's wet dream, a former CIA man with huge communication and training so that he can tell a thief or deception to the man, Although the camera does not have some fun for a few minutes, even though the author for 5 years worked very foolish, why? Because they have these expensive and advanced technologies, but a simple walkie talkie (quick and easy to communicate) you never see the security you face in a situation, only when the situation is there, and all of them are there suddenly. <br /> <br /> Plot quickly moves away from cheating and casinos are suffering from one or the other side, on the horror of the terrible general American girl relationship, the elements of death shown around the world are the same, they have sex, but I hate you. I always love you, I think, but I love him instead, but what will happen, maybe one day Bla Bla Bah <br /> <br /> I would suggest "Hotel Babylon" which is like Las Vegas, there has been much more to it because only the letters are interesting and not compelled for six months a year. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be British ?? I see the same actor continuously worse than 5 different sounds in 5 years.
