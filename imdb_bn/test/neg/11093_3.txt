With all the possibilities of a good movie in his superb setting, cast and cinematography, the poorly scripted, lead motion, and wooden performances of this film have only made a big disappointment. Rather than the nasty version of Ron Howard's 'Splash', with the appropriate instruction, editing and music scores, it is probably a good film, probably a dark version of Black Edward's '10'.
