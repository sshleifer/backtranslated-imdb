Synopsis: The Lambs of Acclaimed Silence, Hannibal is a big budget producer who fails to fully deliver; It's not just as tricky as the previous, it was not even a break or a mystery or horror movie, just a complete annoying time wasted. Media campaign will not be fooled and especially due to the story of throwing people into stories and brain-eating habits, they are mentally suffering from their lifetimes: it comes as a ridiculously bad SFX in the film. Why are so many people claiming that H "is not bad at all" and "big screen" etc., in this forum is beyond me; And it's not "good at it's bad", it's simply annoying. I generally respect the opinions of other people, but in this case I must say that they can not say clearly **** from Shine-Ola. Perhaps they have been victims of the media propaganda, perhaps they have never seen Ridley Scott's film, and they are influenced by the excessive use of light, smoke and universal AC fans. H completely mystery is vain; Instead, we swim in lecture with finesse in English, a completely vague and continuous plot with more holes than the fishing net. (I'm really awake at night, trying to find out all the holes in the plot), and when I wrote them I used to fill 6 pages quickly, before I forced myself to stop). Instead of spoiling your time and money while watching it on the big screen, I'll ask you to wait for TV in a few years; And then go to bed early <br /> <br /> <br /> - H_is_ Despite the claims of some people in this forum, STLL's Sickel And even though SOLL was a difficult task to follow, there was a sign of Michael Man's "Manhattar" itself, based on Thomas Harrison's "Red Dragon", and although the first episode was a very enjoyable movie, the _are_ en parallels (SOTL itself) Was, SOTL was even better; Another example of the Allian series, started by H.H. Director Ridley Scott - decreasing growing theory Much more for the outdoors). In any case, a signal is not an excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> - This movie is a famous director, based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, Cast is strictly in-list, great cinematography, big budget, first-class script writer, jad, jad , Jad, and the end result is simply a madness in the church. So what's wrong? I think many defective film producers Dino Delurentis have to go. Here is my explanation: DDL produced "Manhattan", in spite of all its qualities, there was a commercial flop. Frustrated, he gave Arion the right to the character of Hanib lecture - free, Jonathan Damm has allowed SOTL, and the rest of the movie history. Thomas Harris finally waited ten more years (now she is 81) until she came up with the Siegel novel. I think DDL has lost all interest in making a good movie at the moment and finally the cake was frustrated to get a piece of cake before popping its cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I feel totally annoying is that this flick is being circulated so illogical to the media; I mean, it's a boring, yet one of the highest earning productions, so there's no need to give it a free promotion. And how many critics see the scenes at Dante's Fayer and why Jodie Foster does not take part, this film is a perfect truth, the UTTER Flow becomes incomplete. But there are some more: Haniab is not flown through the rooftop, it is being used as serial killers as a "documentary" (usually similar to SOTL from left-over) as a media agenda setter. , cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H assume to be realistic; Lector can also be a serial killer (he is now just killed outside of necessity or to help Claris Sterling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is no cancer treatment: lecture Dutch Paul delivers his brain food to Kendaler, so that it (erm) made an unknown vivo - auto-cannibalism Ray. <br/> <br /> - There is a lot to say about acting: Mainly praised Julian Four for JD Foster and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the Main Honeyball Lecture). I think that all these discussions are discussed. There are a number of my favorite actors in this movie (such as Leota, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply does not give anything to work with them. Similar to Hopkins: There is no improvement in his character, and he is not challenged by any means. And, however, she plays almost identical characters in all her movies, only need to make a big bit of murder in H. and it is worth 11 million dollars.
