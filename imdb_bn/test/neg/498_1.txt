Critics love this movie. I personally found it stupid and transparent. It has fallen into "billions of people", "Critics love it" trapped and someone wanted to throw hot water for my test because it was less painful than watching movies. There are many scenes that are totally unnecessary. A warning to animal lovers: If you do not want to see this image, you do not want to kill the sheep and see the oppressed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie then see Africa. If you want to see a movie about the criminals who escape, see Gene Weber / Richard Priory Classic Steady Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
