I found this to be a watchable that could be a very watchable one. Some good stunts are the work which gives a fair degree of excitement and mystery in the story. But for the plot, one had to suspend credibility in multiple events. For example, in spite of the withdrawal of the undercarrier, the pilot himself found an extra plane on the entire plane with the Caribbean, despite losing their wire, connection and harness. According to plot drilling, the cylinder of the vault on the hole vault will disable the alarm system when the system was reactivated (I can not think why), according to the daltry battery powered drill will not be able to drill through the velch although they are completed with full hydraulic drill with holes and fittings. The plane above the vault is equal to the hydraulic system Tarala suited to take advantage of. The plane has a closed hydraulic system as it is difficult to see how it affects the control system or at least minimized the hydraulic pressure accomplished without alarm setting. Taking it for the plot, it takes a few minutes to open a small hole in the upper part of the vault. (They will be able to go there before FED to test FED's false alarm), however the door was closed from the vault and the second security went into the door to the second few seconds of the Fed, they were spinning a square hole on the vault, which was large enough for them. . One can take all practices and other incompatibilities to get a good twist, but what has damaged the movie for me is that when the attempt by the script writers was rejected, there seems to be a fairly anticipated end. The two heroes were killed (if someone could mention the cross as a hero) Katam and Brooks were shot and killed and they were thrown at 7,700 feet in 747 and in the other two airplanes, the villain Daltry standing beside the ceiling in the other two wires Ahuk sits a hundred and a half hours per hour in his cable pressure by pressing the weight of a full grown man and pushing him to death. II. And yet, according to the next sequence, these two are completely survived from 10.000 feet without any explanation (but shameless or impossible) and have time to set up a wide scam to get money. The only surviving comment was that Sophie was a bad shot to his brother. Do not expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
