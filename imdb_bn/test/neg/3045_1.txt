While trying to stay ahead of one-step student Jill Johnson (Camila Bolel) at high school school, received a threatened phone call from a fanatical stalker, why was there a routine babysitting knot in the house of a secluded lane, why? <<br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie were quite good, but it had flowing from it. Remake takes their first 20 minutes and extends them to 80 minute feature film. This is a good idea because it omits everything that has ruined the original. However, if they wanted to make the film work more effectively, then they should have appointed good leadership actresses, good directors, writers etc. There is no doubt that it can be portrayed much before everything can happen and it is very slow film which does not happen much. Not sitting for less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premises is done, then the main actress will have to give realistic performance. I saw any bad performance of Camila Bell, and he began reading his line throughout the movie. You will be seen by millions of people who get a lead role in a Hollywood film and you have no effort! Why do they hire this girl? Sure, he is beautiful but he still can not act, but I think that these goals will not be important to the audience, who will probably be able to eat this movie. The rest of the custom blood and forgot, especially the woman, who plays a maid, is fasting. Even the unfamiliar person was lam and his lines were not effective on phones. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the threatening movie Boogeyman last year. That movie had a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger called the call is quite the same. Jill entered a room because she heard a sound but it was a false alarm like a cat or a slave. Eventually about 50 minutes later this scenario is happening, appears unfamiliar. He will be one of the lamest killers ever. He does not seem to carry any weapon and pose a lot of threats. The end is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it is not really important. The film is directed by Simon West and she is really bad to develop suspense. He used every cliche which he could think of and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I would give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house, so it was wonderful, but it is the only good thing to offer this movie. In the end, if you are not a teen, then you have to skip the movie. Ratings 2/10
