As a kid, this movie made me fear green As an adult, I could not laugh. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy seeing this movie through MSST 3. At noon on Saturday, when there was absolutely nothing in the theater, I grabbed it, there was nothing left to go out but some of the autumn leaves were eaten. I figured, this would be better than h I was wrong <br /> <br /> There are some good elements in the movie; A water-divided mysterious, a beatnik painter, a stupid ranch hand couple, buff an old history, and an "evil wind." Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head, as soon as each and every present system will be completed regular hypnotism, looking for its evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on an evil "farm" which is not apparently raises the crop, nor raises the evil animals. <br /> <br /> All the mysterious mysteries are declared "evil", so you turn your eyes horribly or divide your sides depending on your mood. Me? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But some kids are scared of Santa Claus, do not you? However ... if you're in the 50's awesome camp, it's definitely a movie that you will not miss. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good story line, this is the movie that has. It's top dramatic and time-honored innocence which makes it so awesome. The acting was just BAD, but it still had some good elements. Perhaps it's a remake rate ...? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
