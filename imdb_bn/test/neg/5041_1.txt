The only way to describe this movie is <br /> <br /> <br /> The guy trying to use guns is so ridiculous that you thought That he is trying to copy a toy action image, I know it sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can not help but agree. <Br /> <br /> The giant looks like a CPI guy who you are trying to resurrect the monsters of the old Sinbad films. <br /> <br /> This picture is good for the only thing, but how bad can you get the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see bad acting bad script and special effect is wrong <br /> <br /> This movie is for you
