This story begins to end! So the opening credits of the film give us advice. Unfortunately, it is not true that we were treated for about 70 minutes in the 1950s in the General B science fiction film. The story's great plot is very weak and clearly illustrated in low budget, as it often was for those events. <br /> <br /> The story may be covered in a situation where people are taking an isolated house and a refuge to threaten someone outside. It can only fit a science-fiction story. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are made of rock, bushes, and smoke. - Oh yes there was a pool of water. Wearing a rubber mask with someone who had a face like a face and saw what was like rubber. <br /> <br /> He wrote about several scientific tales, the Se Sector and Converged the World. One of the days was completed, the actors did not allow their characters to grow in better way. This movie also prevents it from achieving its potential under low budget control. <br /> <br /> Michael Connors and Richard Denning came up with some life in this movie, but they could not put it in the section where you can say. - 'I've enjoyed that movie' Richard Denning's acting career started in 1937. He played with Gregory Peck and Deborah Care in Affair for Remembrance and later became more familiar with Television in the series of Hawaii Five and Flying Doctor series. </ br> <br /> Directed by Roger Corman there are many movies of his credits as director and producer. He has made some good films and is still making them. He is often well-known for his film direction from the stories of Vincent Price actor Edgar Allan Bo. She made other low budget films; Some were good and entertaining for one or the other, and mostly were much better than this. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this picture to anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br>
