I went to see this movie mostly because it was very good in trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should equal glory. Instead it recently continued bad bad streak of Williams's movie. What's wrong with the movie? What's more exactly like: The crew crew is a fantastic job near Robin, and like usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That said, this movie was not just plain good. If John Stuart hopes to run for president, then I would recommend only to see if he wins. He said that it is not a trailer because it was in the trailer. Concepts and ideas are really amusing, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are recycled from its old comedy bits and are very laughing very loud and mostly fools. Most comedians roam around to suck, put fun bits in all trolls. There really is no surprise, but come! Some of the movies are similar to those of Tom Clancy or Vince Flin! The public had the prospect of returning to the glory of Robin. Instead, it's more a Flubber.
