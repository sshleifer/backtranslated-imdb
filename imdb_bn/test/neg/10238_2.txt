Sammy Cheng and Andy Lau meet again in his third film - Yesterye Wonso More - The action of John's to-be directed by H.K.'s action ... fans of Action's film will be disappointed that the single gun was not used in the film. Also, earlier films of Chen and Lau Fan, love your needs and a DIET, be disappointed that Yestardday is not as funny or revered ... <br /> <br /> Mr. And Mrs. Tau (Lau and Cheng) is a divorced couple ... Both rich HIV citizens ... both are incredibly naughty ... both are professional thieves - "two birds of the same feathers" ... a few years ago they looted Divorce failed to find middle ground in separation ... now she is being restored ... to the rich heir son - through the mother of the mother (Karl ng) and through him ... soon Julie (Jenny Woo) suspects Mrs's past and thinks that she is only marrying her son for wedding jewelry - this heir is' invaluable ruby ​​necklace ... <br /> <br /> Necklace is stolen ... is it Mrs. Is the material eye which gets the best of him? ... or is it the way to marry his ex-husband, Mr. Jewel stolen for himself? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This love is not a movie about falling in love or a revival of love ... it is about two breasts that are always loving but it can understand foolishness in some way ... They let pride and greed suppress them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: Yesterdi is a part of Copper / Highest Film and Classical Hollywood Glamor that has come from its golden years - that is, Kerry G. A thrift to catch the rants and grace kelly ... their earlier films from the chemistry of Johnny / Lau ... hopefully the tremendous popularity of Cheng / Lau and fan base will be the perfect creator for this third movie .... I think Sammy Change is one of the most favorite / entertaining entertainers. . And Lau is definitely Tom Cruise in Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed their first two films and are contemplating with the comparison of Chen / Lau's classic Hollywood couples ... but Yesterdi hopes for the prospect Very few ... terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements gallery, and all mistress and supporting characters were unnecessary ... let's remember ... this movie It was not necessary ... if you love watching celebrities ...
