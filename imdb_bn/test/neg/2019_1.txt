Due to the huge horror film fan, one of the most difficult things to consider is the lack of abundant film success, and I have seen hundreds of years of my life, I have to say that I was unhappy to see that the most incomplete 3000 in Dracula, hair and trash of the trash. Stay away from this movie! It's not too ridiculous or ridiculous. Special effects (what I said "special"?) Could probably cost the couple, the act was terrible and decided to make this tragic decision that after the first reading of the studio the script should end in trash bine. The whole movie was literally pictured in a warehouse. Also, for people who love nudity in your movie, do not fool by rating R. You think if you get a chance to see even Irina Elinich even half-naked, you're wrong. She is fully dressed throughout the whole movie. And cover art is completely confusing! There is no view in any part of the movie that they are vaguely similar to the amazing cover art put into the box for attracting terrible fans. <br /> <br /> The worst rating is only 1 to 10. This movie is a -10 Caution Do not waste your money or your time on this money.
