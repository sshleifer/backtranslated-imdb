There is a reason the world has forgotten these animals: they are silent. This means a hummer production meaning that the film should be shot with a hammer, if possible, several times - and where it hurts most. Most people think more about taking a dump than these mushriks to create this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now ?? The film starts with some cavalry, which hunts an antelope. Now, antelopes have developed much more than those pre-historic bars, because they actually attack people here and kill them. Then, it is time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models and even some old, gray-haired granny and grandfather. These old gijaras have probably never heard about the cave 30 year old people; They refused to look at the reasons for both logic and pre-historic records, so they lived. The cave is not one beard; She is clean-shave. Tarzan is quite clean-as-crown, humanoid clean-shaven people without the Lord's childhood and a razor, roaming the jungle. But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Growing is the reason why our very hairy friends fill their debris. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake fashion models show their breasts even more. After that, they got shy or something because they covered their chest for a while (maybe they were covered, so I mistakenly thought that they were covered). More action follows the form of sand in the form of wrestling of two fashion models; Next thing next to the female mud-wrestling, I think. The desert has crossed a good deal, our black-haired tribe meets - how it can be - a blond tribe. Yawn <br /> <br /> Follow more spelling things. There is a redhead fashion model that bothers to kill a cave-a-hedgehog. There is a woman who has died during birth: The cave-fashion-models are so weak. Finally we even meet a darkened hard-working and tribal tribe, such an evil tribe. After being one of the WWF champions, he was really (!) A huge beer-stuff in a wrestling boat. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: losing bear. We also testify to a hideous cave as a miraculous recovery from two major injuries: first he rode with a big spear in the jungle, yet he started from scratch as it was. Then he threw it from a arch - onto a big rock - by blonde cuff-two shoe cave, yet he is throwing onto a giant sofa, as it walked away. Finally it is not clear whether it ends in a vague mountain collapse or that the Voodoo doll is bruised. Oh yes, in the pre-historic times Bhutto was used by white tribes, who lived in the desert and whose women were fashion models. Learning from movies is always important. The film message is educationally as insightful: the cave likes to fight for local energy and they like their fashion models. Since no surrendered cave will fight for such a bitter leader.
