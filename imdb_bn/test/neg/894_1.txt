(Earlier than the splinter!) This same right plot from this movie has been done before. It was closed on the day of the Felis Bulletar! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays ill. Her helpless parents trust her. His sister knows that she's sleeping, but she still has to go to school! he is mad. When his parents are away, he has a group with his friends. When his parents come home, he gets sick again and his parents never find out about the party. They like strangers at House Party 3 and are still unfamiliar!
