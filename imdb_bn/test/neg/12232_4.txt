When I first saw the trailer for the combox, it looked terrible and I was not interested to see it, but when it came out of the DVD I thought that there was nothing else for my interest, I rent it and let it be a Shot. I saw it Tonite and it was not really bad. I think it was occasionally strangely and stupid, but a few fun moments that made me laugh. I do not really see a lot of sports movies, so if I look at more then maybe I'm thinking, this movie will be more intuitive to me, but it's good, I still do not think too much to see the cumboxes. I admit, this "stupid explosion" is a movie, but what is the loss of a fool's joke in a while? Comebacks are not really bad if you give it a fair chance. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields fails both in life, family and careers, but when they are given the opportunity to bring their carrier back if they can bring a looser football team to the championship. But the team is really awesome, really awesome. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give them all, even though it may become some more sad. <br /> <br /> The bad movies I saw do not come at all. It seems like a couple laughing laughing laughing. I know this was stupid, but when the coach came in the locker room in the middle of the war, I could not laugh and hit the head against the locker, only he and the common people were fun together. . If you have an open mind and do not take this film seriously then I think you will find it interesting time to watch it, if you expect it to be an Oscar worthy element, it is not a movie for you. <BR> <br /> 4/10
