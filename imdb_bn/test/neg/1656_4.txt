I was waiting to see this picture that I do not understand how I got the impression I would enjoy. I'm afraid it's a really exciting festival - every single patronage of the movie I often wakes up throughout the movie. It's a shame because it's a fantastic story - I think it's a good read. It is not helped by showing its teeth only once by the original character - and it was the result of the camera angle. As the story is published, it becomes easy to understand the main character's dilemma. However, this is an incredibly impressive film that can be created by obscurity and drama completely destroyed. Half-baked documentary as dull!
