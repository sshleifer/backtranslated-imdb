Maximum formula No title reflects the actual content of the serial, "Nazis fighting in Morocco", (in fact, the Iverson farm). The plots are filled with lulls just in fistfights. The packages claim more than 40 'fictitious encokers' in 15 chapters. That's a section of at least three! In addition to being thrown as the Danish Accento French accent Frenchman, apart from showing how many furniture flip, broken, thrown, burnt or burnt, this is really related to the serial. When the dramas start the war, you can bite that everything in the room will be there. So, the war dancer, who is the real star of this serial! Two positive notes: Sometimes the characters lose their hat during the war, and above all, with our daughters (often a journalist, as she is here) are actually participating in Miami, mostly by shooting and killing of bad guys. . Yet, Linda Starling killed the villain of "Manhattan of Mint Island" (1945). On the negative side, many jumps from the road - before the slab, before the car moves on the hill, before the explosion of the explosion, before the explosion of the building, the truck hits you, etc., etc. It is claimed that this series is partly inspired by 'inspired' George Lucas to create the first Indiana Jones film, but it is the concept of more concept than the development of real stories or serials. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, he played all his films in a role. There is nothing other than showing all furniture broken, which compares to less fights, more stories, good actors and more advanced characters. <br /> <br /> I give 3 for everyone, furniture ruins.
