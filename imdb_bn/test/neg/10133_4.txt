Describing this picture is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is a top leading vampire, Spookfest, completely cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion, and of course a cork with a creaky lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this Edward D. Wood, Junior is one of the silist scripts. It is produced by those who are "bloody vampires", "invading vampires", and the predecessor of this movie, the humble-titled "The Vampire," is closer to the lack of reasoning that marks the film's other films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, this film is a series of "The Vampire" which I have not seen. But no matter ... it's easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, Hubble is run by "The Breiyanik" Salazar, when disciplined but confusing Dr. Marion has brought back the stacked body of De Loved by his vampial enemy Count (I think there is a rule that all vampires must be counted in some sort). Dr. Marion complained that all the important doctors of history had to take refuge in some serious robbery for the advancement of their medical studies, and he hoped to use Vampire's body to study such incidents as the vampire's body lacked a general reflection, at which point he kept a mirror up to the vampire and no one Revenge Instead, we see the vampire skeleton. ???) <br /> <br /> The Enrique is not satisfied, and determined to shut down the events, the first film as mere imagination and prejudice. "This guy was not a vampire ... I would admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's it!" He is in the US Also confusing things are confusing, a part-time nurse and Part Time Shogger (!) Who may be Enrique's fondness. Martha escaped from the clutches of Day Lewood in the first film, and apparently Enrique had spent a lot of time to overcome his "heart condition" and he felt that what he saw was not real. <br /> <br /> If so, if you were a script writer for this movie, then you need a way to make a fool to smash the pump out of the palm? Well, who helped Marin steal coffins about greedy consonants? After showing a glimpse of Dave Loughdon's body, he showed expensive outlooks on his outlook, which is counted, and when he is not looking for it, he comes back to steal easily. But, tear it off ... because he is not risking the brooch, so ... you guess it. De Lovewood has been loosened again, this time with his human genius like the Hanmann. <br /> <br /> Well, the vampire is back after Martha, and in the meantime doctors actually believe what they believe. At first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then they will see the police "All the dead dead but alive" <br /> <br /> <br /> You probably can imagine the rest of the plot here, but the film The producers throw some joyful twists on. One of the film sets is a wonderful wax museum (other types of such movies?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... complete with real torture and execution equipment. The film has a very deep feeling of style, not just the camps. While lighting up the scene like the German pollution nightmare, following unforeseen buildings without any door and following their progress, Deobwad street and Eliovene pursued a seemingly endless continuous prey. An effect). <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture is a teenager, especially on the last mountain of the film. Special effects were pretty weird, even for the year it was created, and claymatic wars with Day Loud are laughable in the form of the bat ... but the manager urges us to believe that Martha will be frustrated and will fall directly on the top of the guillotine, so that her head Was in perfect position so that the blade could be torn off, which is at risk of reducing the conservative rope suddenly It's okay! What a tragic event! To make things even worse, he tried to smuggle a visible rubber bat from the frying rope to Enrique, who was standing up and keeping his arms around. It is definitely an Ed Wood moment, if ever it was, especially when Martha was resurrected on her own and her legs gradually came slowly slowly and slowly. In the room! What a tranquility! In the context of the groin, "The Vampires Coffin" does not have a Luanysey Factor of "Bloody Vampire" or "Vampires Attack", but fans of such old horror films would appreciate atmospheric photography and the director would have some practical cool wring handling ("haw" ) There are "count" for.
