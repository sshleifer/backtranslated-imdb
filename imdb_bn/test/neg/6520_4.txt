This movie does not mean anything about the soul or the evil. It's very awesome. Duplicate photography --- The film stock is old and fade and washed out. It may even be 16 mm up to 35 mm, Donkey. Dulle script, which is tiring and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-Ish. That is, the Bose-Nova cocktail party, like the 1960s, was cool. Our beatnik grandparents may be spoken like if they are really trying to present directly. The 'slice of life' character was mostly boring. Indeed, they were real in life, but hey, if really genuine people really want to see simple and common things, I would like to see myself. I would not be able to trap all the cinematic paths and I could not sleep for five, anyone else saw it in the evening. <br /> <br /> I hope a fun, bright rom-less. What I found was more, such as the 19 or 20 year old meritorious, two intelligent and medium-talented students could create their first day with a new video camera. <br /> <br /> I've given it a 4 out of 10 because it appears that anyone, at least try.
