I hate this film with hate, trivial, and a passion which looks cooler than Hell's red hot door. It's an unreasonable time under a campie, terrible, and completely unstable memory lane, in the 70's, I was happy for a decade that I did not offer this section! > <br /> Animation is unfortunately dated, at least with its lowest, missing frame and characters with huge, bulbhead heads, this movie is a sight of the eyes. From intelligent, curious ocean horse to my parents, and this is the camp hand motation and the voice of Kenneth Williams-Eski, very overwhelmingly drunked song, near High Coakoram, I am sorry that this movie is forced upon me as a child and I completely hate that terror It is not completely recovered from .... <br /> <br /> This terrible display is at full rivalry No certificate is rated to carry, so it's boring content!
