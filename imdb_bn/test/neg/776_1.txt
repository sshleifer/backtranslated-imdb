I'm Mike Sedlak I wrote the score of this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some have not left enough. <br /> <br /> This image was a premiere in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with friends and family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie can be more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We can start with a shot where Gideon Blake can throw toilet pluggages, so that a radio transmitter protects the bid deck, and can mislead an evil pregnant. House <br /> <br /> or how the gridons spread the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> did not help. It's still a bomb attack <br /> <br /> <br />
