At the moment of creating rare and good movies, Mahima is standing as a definitive memory for measuring ourselves for other industries and for us to be immersed in that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories overtake their time and the high reach of a classic and mythological element. Those players at the very top of their game throw in the sophisticated skills of a ensemble cast. <br /> <br /> "Where has all the basicity gone?" Here's the story, and it's a plot and story-writing that is not only educated, but also the most mother-tongue language of Shakespeare / Action / Love story. <br /> <br /> I can not begin to imagine where the author dreams up this extraordinary story. Where's the kind of talent to get inspiration? I hope for mankind now, knowing that such talents are still existent, I hope that we will make it grow at the door of heaven. <br /> <br /> I like other people before me, dreamed of glory. Although I did not write this movie but I saw it and because of the great magnificence of this movie, I think that I have reached higher level higher level, high level spiritual fullness. <br /> <br /> This is no greatness eludes most of us to such glory. What would be our world if we could all get this glory? We will swallow in a white fire of the greatest glory, because we are created by the Almighty God transformed into a transformed spiritual person. <br /> <br /> Very summary of your heart and your life, that "Tomcots" is nothing like what I'm saying. "Tomcats" are all antithesis I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. Some critics are going to rate a movie on such a star system, i.e. 1 to 5 stars, even the bare zero, I'm going to rate a black hole "Tomcats". <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I'm willing to donate money that would create obstruction of such torture, which seems to be delayed, seems to be stuck at the box office. I'm not even hostile to using nuclear weapons. It must be closed. How much more will we take it from outside outer space to the aliens and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, ugly, obscene, and frustrating movies from Hewollywood? I am not going to congratulate the movie that it has played it by mentioning any person's name. While describing the story I am not going to waste my time, as we saw it a B-2,000 times, and all versions of the past were at least a GAN-JILEAN times. <br /> <br /> My movie was almost inspired almost during this movie, but with the most stringent effort and lots of luck I am alive to warn the people. You have been warned.
