Although I could add this kind of episode of the Night Gallery to the Night Gallery, but the two words "horse all day long", I was compelled to write the lowest ten lines. It is not worth the sun circulation standard, but the ineffable effort of a slightly ironical black trick The inhabitants of the Moon are the foundation of the huge giant sheets, sure to survive an useless fork, completely ridiculous, such as building a giant mesetrope. I think we are making the moon green cheese and are guessing how these useless creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode may be presented as a filler for the other two episodes broadcast on the first day. Above all, movies, actors and air is a waste of time.
