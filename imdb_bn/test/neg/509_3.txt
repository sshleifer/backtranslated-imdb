I saw the 219-minute version and want to say dollars for dollars, perhaps it's probably one of the worst movies. Now I'm not saying this is the worst movie - but you see the ratio on how much you want to enjoy the average person, but it's a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this is the single largest element of making a bad movie, writer / director, Michael Simino. Can rarely be placed on a single person. If he was not so ungrateful, just like it can be made in about 90 minutes - saving millions in the studio! <br /> <br /> This image starts with completely unnecessary recommendations that should be set in Harvard. The scene is huge but completely without context. You do not know why students are acting so badly and you do not know. I started to imagine an early fantasy started in 1870 - and it shows a lot more like the 1970s. It's a half hour where you have no idea what's going on, letters or their motivation. <br /> <br /> Next scene after 20 years. Curiously, two Harvard Grads (Heart and Chris Christopherson) are at Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is a law enforcer in the middle and the other is ... well, what's the hartal in this movie?! He just came here and thinks he is not a rogue or proposed silent drunk hanging with the killers - though he is clearly against them! His whole character is made in no sense. Why was he not in Britain, why he was living in the middle (his pronunciation was impossible to hide), why is he annoyed with the mercenary army, if he is not so against his evil plan and why he risks his life? That is why he did not believe. As Kristofferson, his excellent acting and well-defined character made his character more credible, even though he did not have any knowledge at all in the risk of going to Wyoming and risking his life for prostitution. Although it brings the worst view. Heaven's gate. The scenes are too long and when pruning, the worst part of the film is the letters like the cardboard. John Hart (a wonderful actor who does not have anything to do with the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names but you have no idea. In fact, except for the christoferson, Isabelle Houpert (as a hooker with a gold heart - mostly clich√©) and probably Christopher Walken, everyone is completely one-dimensional. This movie is very hard to imagine, where you do not know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Most movies seem to be racist. Who would have thought there would be a giant roller rink built in the middle of 1890? I am sure that the basic supply of this region was very difficult in the West - and yet we believe that roller scale and wooden filling trains came in place of food rather than food. Perhaps if they do not build the billions of dollars in the building and the roller rink is not frequent, then farmers can buy food and avoid this war on the cattle! And what is the man on the scale of the Bell? What will this land do with war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem with you is that it is a movie where very small, until the film is delayed by late. There are a lot of dirty and flat-skepticism scenes. There was so much turmoil till the war that many listeners would have become so hostile to the left or film that it could not do any harm to the film. <br /> <br /> For the final battle, it has been reasonably well done but the problem was. First of all, this minor clash of prime was longer than the D-Day invasion! Second, when details of the actual events of the so-called "Johnson County War" is a tad sketch, we know that the characters used by Huppert and Christopherson were not really there because they were both hungry before the war. Thirdly, I can not believe that Simino actually killed animals in the whole movie - especially during the final war. Although I am far away from the bloody mind about animal rights, then it is necessary to use the animals and actually make some horses, a lesser point in cinematic history. To find Simini's "vision" for the film, it is very sad to see and know that some horses were killed. Finally, after the big war we have a myth. Although it is short on the blessing, it looked completely unnecessary and vague. We look at Christopher's fancy, so we can assume that he has finally kept some of Harvard's education to work for himself. We also see a woman who saw Chris several times at the time of Pravilo. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final result is. I read it on my own and saw that this movie has often gone wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Well, I'm very much looking bad, but if you consider the cost of production, I really think that this might be just one of the worst movies in history. Finally, when there is a movie this very clear nudity I warned parents. However, no child can sit through this film (even with sexual pledges), warning is not necessary.
