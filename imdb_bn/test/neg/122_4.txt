Until this name changed, I would expect such a high until they changed the name of the movie 'Shepherd: Border Patrol', what was wrong with 'Shepherd' only. It is a number of action actions by many that its classic tips for the classic Van Damme films. There is a nice bit in a bar that reminds me of a tough target and universal soldier but no intensity or mood that is indicated with shame. There's a great line about 'PSS getting screwed up and carrying a rabbit' and some just work scenes have reduced by its cheapest. Many times the conversation does not match the face of the characters and stunt men fall even before a split second died before being shot. The last war is one of the reasons for the good Van Dam battle, John Wao fails to try a bit more than the director and fails to present flashbacks, which is actually only a van dam <br /> <br /> <br /> Not good, Not bad, just the average generic system.
