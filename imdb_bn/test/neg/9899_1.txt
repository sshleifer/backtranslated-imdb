In the past there have been some great television movies. Coming to mind the epic such as "Roots" and "Lonemore Dove". Section 6: The reasons for the destruction of the films of the ruins will not be remembered for the progress. A ridiculously bad story, beyond just the amazing screenplay, Cat6DD, I want to call it, it encourages more sympathy for the actors involved in terrorism which should be taken out of the film. The word you hear during the film is considered to be wind, but instead it is faster than Randy Quayed, Brian Denhe and Thomas Gibson (Greg of Religion and Greg Doe), more frequently than trucks and cows. We can fly to one of the 15 tornadoes in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was advertised as "Amok of Nature," instead, we planned to produce 15 different weather systems in Chicago for 150 degrees a day, the next day was a shameful story about the storm day after the storm from a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. With a storm system from Canada but in fact it is a jet stream originally modified by global warming .... Full !! The story did not matter, the act was terrible, the actors said the things they said, and 13 scientists from all over the world were in the coronador after listening to the dried out of the film. I did not care what happened to any characters, special effects were sub-par, even for TV quality, and story lines were vain. Above all, I really really like this "tv event."
