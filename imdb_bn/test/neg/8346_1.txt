Hahahah probably the most interesting movie I've ever seen. Of course this is not deliberate though. In order to understand that the middle of the city is surrounded by a red mountain, the main character takes almost half the film and the other half uses fire trucks to separate the flow of the flow through the city. It certainly made me laugh. The acting Army looks like RSC Thespian. It is extraordinary that these types of movies get commissioned. Another interesting version is that someone is going around active volcano and it will be drawing, and probably cost Â£ 20. ($ 40) I see some people peeling on a movie company, "This is a big hole and it's going to float in a city ... very radical hey." If you find it at the dollar point of view, perhaps most of the other It's good to see the movie.
