This show is terrible. I could not get on this waste of great talent to have full show on this show. It is not entertaining reformative, it is just a cheap endeavor to throw a famous comedian in phases, and it is a poorly developed scene. I've actually worked as an actor, and this event is not Improv. <br /> <br /> In fact, the audience is smiling (if they are actually laughing at this show, it seems quite fake), like a deer of headlight, the shame of the star, the star. They are stupid, totally unrelated, they bring people what they laugh. And if it is not part of the scene then the actor will tell them that it is wrong! I see this program disrespect the industry and make me cry for hearing like the Hajj line, however, on many talents, great Imprro games and everything else, I did not allow me to change the channel.
