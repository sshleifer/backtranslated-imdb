For their achievements, it is one of the more appropriate pieces of trash, and because of this, it is a good step to stop the good and stop "snakes on the plane". However, if there is an example of inconsistency with the new rip off of Asylum, then these two letters are illegal immigrants at the beginning and no one can speak in English without a person who knows the border across Texas, even when they meet a train and a friend, they start to understand By doing and speaking in perfect English. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very bad illustration of a Hollywood formula, "snake anane train" is completely annoying. At least, with the "snake on a plane" we were given the opportunity to see the actor wax comedic and try to be remote interesting. The Mallachi Brothers Trust is an electric engineer in most of the annoying characters I've seen (Guy, I wonder how he comes later), some Stone Surfer, trying to fight our two main characters <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> can be a fun small film, and instead just takes itself very seriously, and at any moment it camps. Instead of taking their small budgets and creating original movies, it can set an example, instead they force their small budget to work against them. Although the Mallakki brothers seem to be trying, the train looks incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It looks like an incompatible, and extremely loose set piece, like a set piece, that tries to look like real train cars. It decreases every time, the background of the windows gradually moves and the sound effects stop now and then we can tell that they are actually on a train; It is not mentioned that just ten passengers out of such a huge train are like this. And the train is out of war, and outside of a stretched sex scene, we are forced to force under a plot which creates a zero sense. Even the executives can not even work around the "deadly" snakes in this train that are away from poisonous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture spreads just one minute after the snake killing. And a former drug agent tried a molest in a bad subplot of a passenger. This ruthless exposition ends with a ridiculous climax, which creates a bad computer-made snake (I've seen better animation in Super Nintendo), completely consolidate the train, and then it is distributed in a method that should start at a very low level. Asylum scores again. <br /> <br /> Asylum scores are again hackneyed, lazy, horribly directed, and boring rop off of another good movie. "A snake snake" takes itself very seriously, and why it is never entertaining or memorable.
