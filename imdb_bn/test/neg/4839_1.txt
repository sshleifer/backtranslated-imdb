Dead Man's Bouti (American title of the film) has a classic Italian western look and feel. Cinematography, dresses, and sets look great. Cast is a pretty face, nasty among them. At the beginning I was preparing for a beautiful cool movie, but what I saw in the end was a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was completely awkward. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The coffin of its coffin was a wide spectrum of exaggeration that grabbed most of the pictures, which seriously pays attention to the character of Burma, which is featured in very rogue sex scenes. At the end his speech was quite annoying! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
