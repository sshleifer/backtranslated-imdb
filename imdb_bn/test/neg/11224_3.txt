What is this doing of forest whitaker and clifton collins junior? Light brick is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on low income income school. Although the subject matter needs to be resolved, the film uses every clich√© in style and a textbook comes as popcorn flick. Characters are cutouts to the breakfast club or even the inner city version of the Faculty. See it with your children at the age of 13 or 14. This can be an outlet for them with a lesson for current social problems. For anyone age, it will not be anything to see anything at 4 in the morning, as I did recently in Bravo. Actually, what is Bravo doing?
