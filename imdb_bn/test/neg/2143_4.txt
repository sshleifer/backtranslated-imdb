Ahmad .. I think I would be the only person to say this but yes, I was indifferent during the film. This is not a bad movie, indeed it is a very good effort to draw intimate images of pregnancy, sadness, love .., it's director's debut (reading from somewhere, it's true?). I felt that something is not right, maybe it's mine, I'm not dragging enough letters in my world to immerse them. This is a common story, about ordinary people, general life. Through simple and short dialogue, the director tries to relate the life of a common man and the news of his illness how he smiles every time he laughs. Oh yes his smile was very nice at first but slowly it came to me, such a deep heartfelt roar for a gentle man! I must say that I did not feel the effect that most readers felt, in fact I was attracted to the trivial situations like planting watermelon seeds, which clearly show that they were comfortable with each other, the old woman came back for another shot - this kinda The melancholic, the thoughtful gesture of writing down the method for her father - but this is predictable. Do not misunderstand that I am a action lover, self The blasted film is my cup tea! After seeing a lot of deep images in the strong images there is probably a high expectation I really have. Some Asian movies of watch: <br /> <br /> Wonder cloud (only 1 dialog) Wide cloud (only 1 dialog) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (Along with loneliness) 15 (Gangsta stays in local settings) Sunrise Before and before sunset (although these are not Asian movies but I want to mention them. Fans understand!)
