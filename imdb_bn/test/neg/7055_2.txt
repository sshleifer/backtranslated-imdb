The film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, a government official sent from a southern town to a small town to identify and arrest the hot summer moon centers in Bayfront County. An elderly woman coming from Chandpur with three beautiful girls coming from the farm. Almost anyone can guess what might happen, but oddly, the film is very low. It rarely qualifies for a PG rating. What's more, most of the budgets are obvious and played sooooo amateur in every shot. This picture was probably intended to run in the crowd but in 1974 it was not even likely to be satisfied with them.
