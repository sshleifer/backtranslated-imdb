I think the problem with some reactions in this movie is that - with some exceptions - they do not disconnect the main connection, so the main split among viewers. <br /> <br /> On one hand, those who are visual, beautiful costume, and going on film are accepted by a variety of elements. Some children love color and animation, and all the unreasonable 'witch' effects, animated animals, etc. Some cultures like complicated culture, such as swellings, levels of different titles, and they can see Jhang Zia singing and in two different languages, which are actually considered to be a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, those who say that a child film should still be at a point, that the mix of locals is not a story, and when it is easy to believe in magic with enough thought and care, it went in the technical direction to think real. <br /> <br /> In other words, ideas can be lovely; But when you keep their stage they will have to pay. Here, they are not. <br /> <br /> A good folk tale - from a country - a clear story, a point and a character that communicates with each other firmly. This lack them all. Some ultra-modern gestures in Western and Japanese are not replacement for a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy fan, I must say that I am sitting through some Turkish and love some, but this one really tries to do many things - cheaply. Putting in Zhang Ziyi trying to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is that there is no plot; There are half of the plots, which means you drag it, and then stop the dance number of another very fast execution. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that they are acting in a movie. If you really do not like watching other people's amateur videos, this is not good. I want to test this for real children; I think they will leave it for 20 minutes after the heavens.
