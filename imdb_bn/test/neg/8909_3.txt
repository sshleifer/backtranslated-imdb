The film gets a major Chase scene with a rapid destruction of the film. The first really bad thing is that the person was beaten by the driving of the hijacking Steven Sighal by Sigal's car, but the whole episode of this movie probably ended. Looks like they all have different changes in the film's plot, so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn on the logic you might have, it will reduce the chances of headache. <br /> <br /> I hope some Steven Seagull is trying to return to his narrative character. More Popular Movies
