I have included two well-known actors in this movie which I have seen before. The action is great and the heart of each action is felt. But it reminds me that these 2 were first cast for the first time in the lecture / drama class and one was asked to hate and narrow each other without letting others enter the house and the woman was really innocent and behaved enough to send audiences to tears for her release With mind and heart. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> That But all this can be done in my opinion in 15 minutes, so it was only proper punishment for those who saw it for an hour. <br /> <br />
