This movie ... awesome and wonderful at the same time. I first saw it 13 or 14 years old, so this is a great thing about nostalgic pricing for me. In this film, Caesar Romero actually played the character of Octavier, who invented "Santa". Two more actors, Monte Markham (Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing pawn), who have large photographers, and these are the only performances that are just fine. The acting and the rest of the movie are all the qualities of B-film which many of us are concerned about. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to achieve a copy of this movie, and it is almost incomplete. I think it was closed soon after it was released. But I finally found a copy and gave it a nice penny to earn it. If you come to Judgment Day in a video store (a cover with a green "Devil" on the cover), consider yourself a happy living near a few video stores that still have an effective copy. One would see for you who would certainly want to smile at a scary movie cheesy attempts.
