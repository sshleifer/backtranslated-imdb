Irwin Allen, the past master of the cinematic scalp, pulled all the stops in the boat of the SEA's boat. A bad old Walter Piszon, who actually died playing this role, is the captain of a nuclear submarine, which may be the size of the Empire State Building. Every room is displayed in the demon and some even has no ceiling. You can bold and hold the official ball together in these cells. The bay known as the Savaii run its first, when all the hell breaks: Van Allen radiation belt is set on fire and the service must launch a ballistic missile in a belt by a period of time, or the world will come down in global warming fire! Alongside this journey, the real horror character is borrowed from actors, borrowed from many TVs. This makes their TV Hack-Towers. The worst is probably the poor people's Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden as the Navy Secretary, wearing very high roles, playing high-heels playing and acting, as he was present at the beach party flickr. Maybe Frankie Avalon was also on the go for this trip. A young man, Joan Fontaine, is almost unreasonable, a visitor with a big bad secret, playing a doctor, but who really is careful? VOYAGE is a real bad movie made for a small film, but how is a child still sitting to move from right to left across the screen of the studio tank permanently for the continuation of the small CV model? There is no such scenario in a scene where we believe that these people are actually in the sub-continent. When Seaview shakes, the actors fling themselves about, sometimes the opposite directions of each other. Old Star Tray is like a TV series, when the bridge is reduced. If I think correctly, a fish or sea animal is not shown - except for an octopus that rushes towards the Gulf Gulf region, it takes 20,000 under the SEA. Octopus, it was real, probably about a foot long and it shows. Worse, when folks are standing at the Savvy Glass nose, they are apparently an intimate air hose bubble which is a close-up view of the ocean scene, probably pictured in a fish tank. You have not seen big bubbles in your life. You would think that this bubble alone will destroy the pieces of the debris bay. Sad, along with a bad old Peter Lorre ride. At the end, when the missile enters the burning belt, Loren enthusiasts congratulate Pidon and everyone else is still waiting to push their couches and talk to each other to win. I once saw if one took one view scene. What a stinker It's not even good for a smile. Sticks with silent running.
