I found this movie for $ 1 in VHS in a XXX store. The interesting thing about this is that the Camp Video purchased its rights and in 1986 a date of copyright was filed on the date of writing. However, weird events are enough. <br /> <br /> This picture is not really scary. Even this horror or a "thriller" call is ridiculous. In this 80+ minute movie you added the horror story in just 5 minutes, and it was included in the act, because it was frustrating! All puns together, writing for this film was completely rubbish as well as special effects and makeup was ridiculous. No strange movie is such a vague picture, perhaps the director has crushed the country for all existing copies in the last 35 years and burned it in a big wave so that no one else might be under it.
