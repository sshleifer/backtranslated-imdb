Jacqueline Susan wrote all the novels related to Sex and Meldrama, and some of them were actually created in this film with the effort, and all of them have the distinction between the worst movies ever made. Here's the story that came to the top of the story about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and counting to everyone around him. She threw her bed on every bed with a playwright of the worst sort and then the president of the IBC Network president. <br /> <br /> ***** Spillar Alert ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the television network IBC, and when his little wife Judith Robin visits a glance, it gets lost while going to bed No Greg became ill and had to spend some time and thus Robin took steps and tried to run the network, but at this time, a model named Amanda (Jodie Wexler) himself killed himself. When Greg came back to his job, he tried to free Roberine using the Morality Section in his treaty, as rumors about his relationship with James Nelson (David Hemming) started when he was a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> Jack is directed by Heli Jr, who was a very successful producer in both television and movie, but his second film as director and the element he was forced to deal with, seems to be on his head! This script comes from Susan's novel, and perhaps it may be like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of the Dols" and I think because his books can never translate well because the filmmakers have made a terrible mistake. Instead of taking her story seriously. With this, the smiles from this are unknowable, especially at the end of that movie during the ridiculous war, when Canon refuses to return the slaves of homosexuals to slaves! Hemes was a very good actor, but his role here was completely topped, and he used to wear the worst beard in history and use the word "chic" in each sentence. The law was not the main choice of leadership, but the other actor who was fired was a serious accident and the law stepped up and Miles O'Keef provided further wood performance on this side. The film script suffers in two different areas that it is totally stupid and terribly lazy and it will test the patience of the audience if they prefer to watch it. If a director decides to make a film in Susan's novels and does not take it seriously, then it will have to think about what will be the result, because it is popular and ridiculous here.
