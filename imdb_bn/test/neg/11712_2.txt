I am not a fan of the original book, but hope to see better adaptation than the Portman movie, which I have received. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, this script has very little in Gregory's book. The complete sub-plot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eradicated and this version George is only a flunky shuttling between his duties and his duties to the king of the Boleyn family. I think Maryam is considered to be less familiar with the title of this book, but it is used to refer to ANY here. <br /> <br /> Second, the script sometimes addresses the audience. If confession It is apparently intended to give some stories behind it and explain its objectives, but it is implemented in the amateurs. <br /> <br /> The top of the bad script is wildly bad. There are many shots that are completed with circular cameras that are best and perfect, at least inconvenient. The lecture is distributed several experimental, such as a first rehearsal Minimum production standards for Henry's flamboyant courts. Clothing changes: Copies of some historical portraits and others have some imaginary designs from some designer designers. And the king, all energy and party sources, is often shown alone. No fawning courtiers, no servants of the background - Where are all the people ?? I used to be in the imagination of Hollywood turning history, but I hope good from producing a BBC. Even this production is based on a faulty book.
