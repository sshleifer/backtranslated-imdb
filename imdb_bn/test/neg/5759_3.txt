My companion and I chose to see this clear piece of junk based on this tagline ?? After almost 30 years exaggeration and basic teen slashers, I can not believe that now only some nerdy scary brainiac comes with brilliantly wicked slogan "They Exclose It for"! Still, the "massacre of the monarch" just as there are random, annoying and forgotten ones left there? Perhaps more! The script contains all the usual clich√©s and all the awesome stereotypic characters that you want a terrible and painful death. The effects of Gore are entirely computer engineers and so sad and compulsory "big stars" (Karen Black, John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely destroyed even after their top billing. Exploited mine and abandoned Sutra City form an ideal horror setting ?? The makers of "my bloody Valentine" have already found it in the early 80's ?? But his dull film simply did not offer any innovative ideas or even a distant miracle material. The fate of greedy malicious people, which refers to themselves as friends, although they can not stand on each other clearly, nevertheless obscure an ancient mine in the search of hidden gold. Of course, they forcibly rebuild the zombie mine and thus only 150 years left to prepare for a huge tissue genocide. Yes! Throwing this one is particularly annoying. Girls have all the impressive racks but refuse to show anything. Instead, they all liked taking all the endless whining and inappropriate risks. Slowly intelligent blocks definitely serve as just screen fillers. Within just five minutes of her playtime, Karen Black is still managed to make her fools fool by screenplay of most prototypic and violent local nuts. Zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he shows the remote shadow of the moon's light when he is swinging around his peak fog and looks reasonably menacing. Since the best thing about "killer killings" is concerned with the tagline mentioned above and you can read it in the video store box but there is nothing left to suggest here. Director John Carl Buechler scored some decent hits in the eighteenth century, especially the original "troll" and a fair "Friday 13th" sequence, but probably now time to retire.
