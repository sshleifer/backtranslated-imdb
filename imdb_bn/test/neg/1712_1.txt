First of all, I want to apologize for the rating of "1" ... the only reason I give this movie a high rating is that I can not reach negative integers. All of these "a mockery" musings aside, and I have certainly tried to try it for consideration, kept me with a specific idea, namely; "This is probably the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any possible amount of qualitative measurements ... I have sincerely tried, as the next article, like an indie-for-slam-video-distributed movie next, but seriously, call this movie a gine ... <br /> <br /> True, if I had guided this "film", then I saw it as a legitimate reason for suicide.
