I have come from Australia and are respected for the extraordinary culture surrounding the Rugby Union of New Zealand. I can fully appreciate Quive's comments related to this movie. It was a total insult of a nation and their favorite sports. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was involved in making this tyrannical movie should be officially apologizing to those who were unfortunate to see it. Note: Do not kneel and cry while slowly hugging people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What a wonderful extraordinary character (nothing to do in order to free his hateful personality with child hospital travel). <br /> <br /> And why are Americans making a movie about Americans playing rugby? They do not just feature in sports around the world, even to try to create a movie about it even (even, a 'world' game of rugby), against gridermone and baseball).
