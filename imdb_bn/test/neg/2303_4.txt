Dubbed out of understanding, Lumbumba's H-BO version is a disastrous rendering of what a decent film looks like. Some scenes do not only make sense in English and the actors bring zero strength to read their voice. Add CIA operators Frank Curlussie to Sia-Censorship, and you have a movie taken from both a play and a power. Here the subtitle version hopes to receive American television screens sometime.
