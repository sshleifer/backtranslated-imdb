I highlight cool winter and long lines to see that many of these people have seen this one of the year's best movies. However, after leaving the credit I went sadly in many ways. But to be fair, there were salable attributes (though very few). Let's start with what works. First, Lycans: every way points ?? Their cruel ferocity from their terrible physicality Action: Supernatural visceral ?? When it happened. Nissi / Victor and Shin / Lucian: Perfect. Now, do not (and there are plenty). It was also a collage of fewer films and sequences (and did not expect any supporter characters from other films except Raj and Tannis). There was a deeply missing story and brought together these pieces together of the original substance. The story started right in the middle ?? At the cusp where Lucian had made up his mind to become rebellious. Therefore, there was no context; Do not worry; Any ideas of betrayal ?? All other devices needed to work. Moreover, it ends where climax should start (which took place for a little while). Oh and it was a very small way. Will crime be found in some of the first two movies of the poets, in certain freedoms? But judge for yourself. Finally, the film was prolonged over the short "background" scenes (such as the views of various councils) and as a result, we could not learn or care about the main players ... or the movie (ouch). -D
