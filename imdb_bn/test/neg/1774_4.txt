Caspar Van Diane ... What Can I Say? I enjoy the man! His films bring them a certain mood that is not actually brought by the director or producer, but by him! Recycled plots ... check. Well Rip off the movie ... Check it out. Wooden acting ... Check. Van Deane is not a bad actor (she's been influenced by Hollywood shiny as Stripship Truppers and Sleepy Holloo). It really does not deserve a worthy script for hers. And yes, he has another acting talent without eye candy. This movie gives a slight indication of what Van Deean could offer, but it was closed by all its production. The script may improve (see Oliver Stone's U-turn). The instruction can be used more effectively (see Robert Rodriguez's Dus Teal Doon). DP can make the desert more exotic (see Rica Girl's quickest Pussycat kill faster!). This script is poor because it is something that we've seen so long ago so double / triple crosses are expected. The aspect is weak because it's new and telegraphs do not offer many of the weak scripting moments. At the time of cinemagraphy paints a beautiful autumn desert taste, but at other times it does not take advantage of dazzling light and the start sequence is terrible in Cornflower blue. <br /> <br /> now acting. .. Van Deane shows some grace and charisma in his jake. He is not very methodical in his role nor very camp. Especially since the rest looks very bad about the acting of this film (bad script or bad aspects ... give your opinion). Brian Brown is the only one of Brian Brown's fame to provide the only real credit for acting in this movie ... Do not forget to learn how the aspiring actors are working on the green screen, try to learn how to work in a terrific script and take notes. Brian Brown on the film. He added extra depth to his role and is a nice counterpart of Van Dien's character. Whether Jack always seems to be one step ahead or a situation control is beyond his control. Femme fatale is weak (after all this silent in a desert) and a nail in this film's coffin (you decide ... scripts or direction). Rozitalita should move forward in the movie instead of pushing her back to the main head of the character's head. So watch the film for Van Deeven and Brown; And to have fun, try to leave a rock across the hole in the film stuck in the film.
