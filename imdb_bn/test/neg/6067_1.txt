From Craigson: <br /> <br /> The dialog is terrible, horror, drowning. Poor performance Many plot errors I do not recommend all this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Article licensing scores are the manuscripts of two copyists, [1] both were male, not pictured in the film. <br /> <br /> Copyistists neither score nor change scores. Indeed, they were surrounded by Beethoven for any deviation from the basic score. <br /> <br /> The film was set in 1842 in the writings of Bithovan's ninth symphony. Beethoven's movies are hard to hear, but it is quite efficient enough to understand loud aloud. In fact, seven years ago (1817), Bethoveen had lost most of his hearing. Beethoven does not experience permanent deafness; His status is objectionable in total silence and terrible tinnitus. Ninth Symphony was compiled when Beethoven's hearing severely worsened. During this time of his life, most of Beethoven's conversations were easier by using notebooks. But it can be reasoned that he was able to read the people's lips, it was proven by the force that when people talked to him, they were confronted. <br /> <br /> In this picture, Beethoven launches a light in the moon. Instrumental music Sonata No. 14 "Kossi Yuna Fantasia" was not named after "moon light" after a few years of her death.
