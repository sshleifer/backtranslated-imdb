It's often my favorite section because of horror because I often give two stars for a horror movie. A movie BAD may be that it is not a great composition but may be enjoyable on the basis of strange humor, malicious character. The early story of the early 1940s was a big event in the horror / fantasy films. . They are enjoyable for those who are destructive - because their "evil" is entertaining. However, this movie does not have any comedic or functional Gauri scenes from the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I think it was political purity in 1995, so there was at least at least on television. Now with the CSI in the mid-2000s. Show, TV is an Absolute Blood Festival! (Good for the horrible fans of us!) <br /> <br /> William Catt and Alexander Paul are no Bradford Dealman and Heather Menezes (original 1978 star.) This is not the error of cats and Paul, but the author and director who created this hat Turkey The main characters interact with the main errors of this movie. I will not say why it is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> The movie on this TV was probably a bigger budget than the original but flopped in a horrible form, as can be seen from user votes. With the original 1978 you have a mood for a killer-fish movie!
