When it only tours a band, and there is only one original member. It's not the same as the classic line-up. All actors playing rug, skate, etc. have played with Ashby as the only returning face of the first movie. And he was the only small note on the first Flick, he worked as the only incarnation group of three boys, which Scotty was trying to help fill the woman. The film is poorly written, in which there is the Dumbel dialogue on this side of Armageddon. For even a T & A movie, it's a Turkey. Even in low budget, 80 film fans want to sit through this movie, there is no plot and there are very bad roles. The release of this film has never been better. Just plain bad.
