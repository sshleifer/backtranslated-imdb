<br /> <br /> I understand that the people of low budget, Arthouse movies have different expectations. I also know that John Sayes is one of those brightness, the world, the intellectual opposition - Hollywood Vibie, a La Tim Robins, the Coen brothers and Atam Aguan, which makes him darling with the critics. <</ br> <br /> But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it's not just that. <br /> <br /> This is Mandarin. It has many characters. Her tone is disrespectful, her point of view is broken, acting on the board, from nature to top. It lingers for long moments with small chars we do not care about and just when the things are getting better just torn away from the scene. <br /> <br /> miss this symbol <br /> <br /> The worst movie error is the closest thing to a playwright; Adi Falco Marley and Angela Basset are in the jacket in characters that do not have any drives. Marley is a cruel drunk, her life steeped in her womb. Desiree is trapped in a woman's own suppression pain. When your two main characters are "I'm not careful" and "I want to go here" can be summarized with phrases, why should the audience give rats? <br /> <br /> I'll be flat: Cylles has written funny conversations. She is very elated to open a scene. The problem is, this scene does not go anywhere. There is no spine in the movie. No drive The film does not create a routing interest in any character. In my opinion, she is gobbling up a little man of very preacher about the worst corporate America. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a quality "small" movie, see David Lynch's "Straight Story". Pass this one.
