After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moved to a new removable North Dakota Firmhouse, but when the new girls started seeing Jesen (Christian Stewart) and his 3-year-old sister Ben, their attempts to live a weird farming were hampered. And those who are being attacked by supernatural people will not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> The humble beginnings of the messengers, although eventually it becomes a generic horror movie which is far more ridiculous than the fear. After reading the premiere, I thought it could be a decent movie because it was vague and it was possible. Unfortunately, the film was not alive until its feasibility though I should have expected that the trailer was awful. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was full of stupid sequences and bland dialogs. Characters did not develop at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots, so it was hard to feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> Directors did a terrible job to develop suspense. They mainly relies on cheap scares like high noise and random jumps. The music was really on top and the audience made it easy to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I did not like how they are using just one position for the whole movie. The room was the center of the story and wherever the majority of filming took place, the same area became somewhat annoying to see. Also, I do not like the closure of the actor. During a conversation, the camera blurred in the other from five consecutive characters in five seconds and it got really annoying. The directors created a decent atmosphere and they got some points to make their movie stylish. However, we've come a long way in terms of style and effect, so it's not really hard to see your movie beautiful, especially if you're working in a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The act was violent and if the film was released in December, I am sure that it has received nomination for several Razis. Christian Stewart showed some talent in the panic room but you can not retain his talent by watching the messenger's performance. She was just frightened and that's it. During the rest of the time he was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anna Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like its line was reading and was something of the worst facial expression I have ever seen. Dylan McDermat was just too wood and he showed almost any emotion. John Carbert has given the best performance and he has shown some good scenes. The duets acting in Ben were also suitable and many of the adult actors were inspired to act. Overall, this link is not worth the horror film due to its flexibility and lazy film creation. Ratings 4/10
