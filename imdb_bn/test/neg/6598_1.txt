The authors and producers of this photo should actually file a lawsuit ... to make the earth contaminate with this shit! "Man in the Mirror" is really awesome! Way, way, way beyond! <br /> <br /> People, I'm just not saying because I'm Michael Jackson-fan! Or I have sometimes encountered real obstacles in real life! <br /> <br /> I'm saying this because it's time, money and celluloid! I feel ashamed to see myself! It's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life I will never return! I am telling you; Watching the grass grow more literally than this film! <br /> <br /> Warn yourself!
