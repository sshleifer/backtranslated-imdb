Nothing interesting about this movie is fun, funny or not relevant. Besides being two characters together, nothing is ever solved, and there is no plot. And the way, what is the deal with DVD cover? Daisy Duke Shorts is a female ass ... Where was the movie? Nobody ever dazzled Daisy in this movie! Wonderfully enough, almost all good acting in this movie, and Jack Black can be a complete song (a strong D track ... although do not know ...) although those are only broken standards, though. Overall, it's just a waste of time.
