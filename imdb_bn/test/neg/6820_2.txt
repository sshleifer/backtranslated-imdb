Dowie and his dog partner, Jerry Lee, again this second sign (again?)?) I sincerely created a single source that they did two in a single penny. And for a movie that was a little better than "Turner and Hoop"? This time after Doli retired, he must match his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee. Real classy stuff. I mean, come on now. The original was at least a few good smiles. This one has a nary one. Jim Belushi is just old and worn out. Belushi brothers were both great at the age of 80. If John does not die, will he be so bad like his brother today? That concern makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: United States network
