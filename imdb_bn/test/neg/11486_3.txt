In the history of the movie, there are several films that cheat the audience, such as "the stage of the stage" of Hitakoos, "Abray los ozos" of Alangundro Amenbar, "game" of David Fuancher, and this "auspicious" ("missing"). At the beginning, I do not like this kind of movie, I think someone trying to drag my legs. <br /> <br /> Moreover, no one knows what happened after watching this movie, so confusing film. Kubrick's "shining" might be a good or bad movie, but this is definitely more honest than these loads of provocative and suspicious situations. <br /> <br /> Technically fine - blue photography, fair performance and so on, but the script is so poor, I wonder how the producers watched how to keep the whip and fire. <br /> <br /> And this movie wrote that 3 people have written this script (Calporos, Lauriga and Quirog) trying to create a masterpiece lost in the movie - trying to do something to fill their stomach, for more personal projects Are waiting.
