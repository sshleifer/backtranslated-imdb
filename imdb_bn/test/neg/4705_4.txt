There is no doubt about this movie's stupid and unreasonable joke, but tell the truth it's a great idea on all movies, but it's pretty entertaining (if you're the first time a visitor and try not to do some analysis) all have a good idea on the film. <br /> <br /> The story of two people is awake, they can not remember what happened to them the previous day. Only later wanted to know that after the angry Twin Girlfriend, Alien, Transsexual Stripper, Alliance Nadar and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Is not it like a Borne Identity? Yeah, I know - how can I compare two movies, but what? They both have no memories; The people were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is stupid and just like stupid movies for viewers. The reason for care is: · Loads of young talented actors; · Very stupid (after you know it's a stupid film, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> If you want to analyze , But forget it, talented young actors become bad; good yields are really bad. <br /> Ratings: 4/10 (grade: E +) <br /> <br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- ---- - --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude is my car' - White, from Aston Kutcher movie What do you expect. I think almost everyone has got the same answer for this man - 'a really stupid movie' In addition to '70's' Shows' this guy does not actually have the opportunity to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his fame). 'Where is my car', its trademark is a 'folly'. His film is even worse than Adam Sandler's movies, (you can imagine). The movie is really non-sensuous, no story lines, and nothing happens. Marc Sokolf, Jennifer Garner, Allison Swine and S. Sokoto used to ruin their genius in this trash. They even came up with 'Sirius, Dude Where's My Car'. It shows how movie companies can earn money rather than quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommend: borrow it from your friends or forget it
