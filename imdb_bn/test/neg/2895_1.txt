I'm a science fiction fan, I've always been interested in this movie. So I was excited to see the journey to the sun far away and finally got rid of an affordable DVD (the previous print was collecting $ 100 in eBay - I'm sure people want their money back - but more than a second). However, the firmness of this movie (just like "parallel" of the twilight zone) is a planet that is similar to the planet "on the other side of the sun" of the sun. This planet is exactly the opposite of us. This is basically their letters are flip and people drive on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> The impressive sound? Well that's basically all this film has. The first hour or this is dedicated to preparing for the journey of these other planets. This is just a boring scene of pressure presses, banner dialogs etc. This is not a point. Gary Anderson found the most annoying British actor in the history of cinema to play most of the role. I mean, they are very slow, I'm surprised that crew can stay awake to finish the film. However, once the crew finally landed on the planet (after the isolated sequence of astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinus behind this track is behind the colonel and comes back to another ship, which he discovered To tell people about it. He does not die like land accident and does not die. Last! Oh wait, one of the cosmonauts hanging in a wheel in his wheelchair in a bonus scene. I think he wanted this movie also. <br /> <br /> I was able to create a movie at the age of 60, which is really surprised. If you must hire Do not buy
