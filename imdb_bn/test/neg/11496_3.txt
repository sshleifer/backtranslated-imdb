I recently hired this promising mini series, even they did not know that they were adapted for television. I was really optimistic about the best spy thriller I ever read in the book. Was it a disappointment? This plot is just like the book, the letters are fully customized and have some great acting. Really a shame The story behind the icon is perfect for silver screen, but I think television budgets are not big enough for a suitable adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Foresight is much better than that. Avoid and book sticks, which must be read in a course.
