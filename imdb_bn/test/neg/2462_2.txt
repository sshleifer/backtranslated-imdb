"JB" (Jack Black) went away from home after the explosion by his father (Mt Laugh). A few years later, he finally made it in Hollywood and came across the greatest guitar player of all time, "KG" (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> <br /> When a little bit, the two decide to join and perform less than the popular times, think of an open mic night. Their shocks, they do that well. <br /> <br /> Return them less than spectacular apartments, both stone legends are trying to find out what they are not looking for in the old magazine. It is only realized that cover guitars have the same guitar picture. <br /> <br /> While trying to do the same picture, a music store employee (Ben Stiller, who is also the film's executive producer) tells the story of "Destiny Pick", which they want. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also says that pecta made from shaft teeth is in the history of the rock museum. <br /> <br /> Now smoking of two smokers has been lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, you must avoid this one. I did not congratulate these two people, and only saw it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> In most cases, jokes create more silence than anything else. I could laugh at three jokes, and shine some. Tennesses D is only for a specific audience, which I am not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tell me, when blacks and glasses do not close each other, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are performed and performed by Tennessee D. The story follows the story by describing many of their songs during the film's film. However, I felt that the songs seem to be completely separate. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this picture is that the language will close many people. This picture contains many words of four letters. There are some drug references. I do not recommend it for children. <br /> <br /> The part of Tenissius D'sici is in black in your mouth, and in most shades of glass it is in your mouth. How they are in this movie, and it really does not work. Now, this may be part of the law, but I felt that the glass did not want to stay there. At one stage, he performed his songs in a party and he could not work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenissius D. Actually rock fans, and maybe two rock legends in the real life, I lost count because I was very annoyed with this picture. Personally, I saw more rock legends and icons of the film. However, we do not get it. <br /> <br /> What we get is completely link jokes, lots of dirty language, a lazy script. You played terrible, and got an unoriginal story. However, you will get some pretty beautiful songs which are mostly similar to words. <br /> <br /> The story may be committed, but most of the scenes in the scene have been added to the movie in the last second. It was similar to the Blues Brothers film many years ago, but there were a lot of followings from the Blues Brothers - and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tennesses D only have a small following, with a few HBO specials under their belt. And, unlike the Blues Brothers, comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you are a hard-core fan of Tennessius D, then I suggest you test it. However, when the movie is released in theaters, most of the movie is like viewers, I will avoid it. This one, save your money.
