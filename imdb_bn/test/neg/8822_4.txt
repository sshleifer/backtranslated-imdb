The strange, often effective hippie Jamby Flick, featuring Alan and Ana Arzby's unforgettable husband / wife, is not the worst, but still higher than the cheese-factor. Several door-basement zombies, indiscriminately campi dialogue, Allan Armsby have a visual-chewing performance, various gay / strange burial-robbers and a string soundtrack. Wonderful that the wife Anya puts an enormous performance, so weird, she has wondered if she is really acting. There are many bad pictures of this era (look for an Al Adamson Flick), but it's Night of Living Dead. Director / author "Benjamin" Clarke, who really created Bobby Clark, who had initially experienced the misery of teenage misery, "Purki". She has now been resurrected after 1 great movie ("A Christmas Story") to return to her terrible way with "Baby Geniuses". Weatheror Alan Armsby then composed the weird Nastassy Kinsky / Malcolm McDowell version of "Cat Man". Moocow fun, zombie frolics, and check out this Hippy horror movie for Shibir's dialogue: = 8)
