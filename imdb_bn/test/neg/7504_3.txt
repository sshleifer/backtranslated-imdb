Set in a near future to walk in some South American cities hit by a dark unfamiliar zombies. Friendly face sitting in a group of residents learn the harsh reality of city life in our unfamiliar city. There are two groups of people; The upper classes safely living behind the concrete walls of the cities provide state police at the appropriate cost. Then there are residents of our friendly face. These lower class folks live alongside zombies. Survival means selling only the goods, which they earn for the day, in exchange for food, the police with the police. Why is our strange discovery kicking in his world? There was a new dietary pill foundation for suppressing appetite for carbohydrate. We want to spread the fats of mankind as a cause of society's fall. These medicines increase the intake of proteins such as meat and even pet-peters. However, a more serious side effect occurs, after death people are rejuvenated with stronger thirst for human protein. <br /> <br /> What I think is a fantastic role, I think this movie can be understood by many innovative elements. Is it a better way to explain the reasons for the zombie race than contemporary concept, rather than the desire to sacrifice a sacrifice for any sacrifice other than hard work in the gym? However, the imagination of this movie will soon be closed after this exposition. This image has been trapped in old age, "I can not imagine what the world would be like when society was falling." When you watch this movie, when you see the apps of apps (original), aliens, mad max or texas chain sour (original), you do not run into a different world. The alternative society in this film is defined by hair color orange and green people. Face paint and charity store leather jacket. In this alternative society there is no strictness in the life of the healthy face and jambi made. Films do not allow you to run away, which will make you clean your clothes and take your old clothes to charity stores. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image fails because it is very smooth, very friendly and very predictable. I have seen such films from the beginning of Asia. If you are going to create a movie of this nature, I will see the feelings of frustration in a rebellious society and see the movies again like Don of the Dead (original and remake), Thread or Phulasi's zombie for experience.
