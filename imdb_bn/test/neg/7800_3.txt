Almost certainly the lines of women (very briefly) in front of an anonymous (and unknown) panel, including producer Charles Band, are not read (very briefly) and being nude (very briefly). Many of Syndander's films are cast in random scenes (initially lesbian scenes). Most women "horses in the horse" (hmmm); There is a Polish woman who does not show interest in acting even after being auditioned; A secret; The pictures of the camera are filthy behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Sexy' If you enjoy label scenes then Femianian Lovell and Vanessa Taylor are included, and perhaps probably the best-known gay couple 'couples'). A strange excuse for a movie from a clear draw of nude women, a utterly shameless and unfamiliar experience.
