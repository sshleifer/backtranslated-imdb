I'm musicals, all of them happy from Oklahoma, Paginant porby and base, a sensitive romantic "Daman Yankee." And I know most of the songs, sometimes with their crowd or spontaneously singing. <br /> <br /> With this "real" musical instrument, this is different from the Vaudilleville show, each song is made to work hard. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or ambition - a normal extension where only the word fails. So, in Guy and Dosy, "My Time of the Day" describes the life of Sky Masters's adventure, because it is being compromised by the most promising woman. In this brilliant example of the song, each song creates a mood, or develops a character, it creates a phantasagoraria, expresses the development of the song, and is fully convinced by its own believer. <br /> <br /> For this boyfriend of Broadway musical, and their adaptations on the screen in the second half of the 20th century, Mama Mia satire and a cruel fun house are somewhere in distortion. There, the songs of these musical instruments often improve, often delightful, plot lines improve. Here, the songs were selected from only one collection, it only interfixed with the brightness of the film. Perhaps most of this audience is making this movie a successful success, they have no exposure to the 20th century musical art industry. They have no idea about the magic directed by the author and the lyricist, which can become a floozy as we know and love as we know and love to achieve "sweet charity" <br /> <br /> <br /> I would apologize for this review Pride. Probably, another day, another mood, I found it, and this review was not so critical. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine but Richard Roger, Oscar Harmstein, Cole Porter, Evening Berlin and many others could work on this coyote premises. I am thinking about it, the memories of this picture are fresh, and I can not help but grieve for the big loss.
