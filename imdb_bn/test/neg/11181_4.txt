Father Brown's thesis is a good level of Roman Catholicism to solve all the problems of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has acted and made everything by himself, but there is no great demand for future Father Brown movies. <br /> <br /> I think that if you are a committed Roman Catholic, then it is a good idea. It is more important than to catch the thief and convert it towards your religion. <br /> <br /> But it was said to take it here. Actually, there is an elementary story before the movie's main activity. His parishioners were trying to try to return the article to steal the Guinness into fraud that he had heisted during a robbery in Sydney James <br /> <br /> This story he gave to the local police and certainly admitted that James has confessed to him so that he broke the confession Can not <br /> <br /> Now big game Master Thief Flambeau, directed by Peter Finch, stole a cross given to Father Brown and said that relation with St. Augustine. But Father Brown is interested in bringing Flambeck back to his faith rather than bringing him back to justice. So he confused the police, so he could perform his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this whole thing was too much for me to swallow. Father Brown I'm guilty of annoyance and should be arrested. He was not responsible for not disclosing what he knew about Flambee, the man did not come to him as a culprit for absence and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G. Who Chesterton, who was a very famous Catholic figure in his day, is very reasonable. In its logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with the army of priests. <br /> <br /> <br /> Guinness has its own Reverend Exxon d'Acconi from Barry Fitzgerald from its Common Hearts and Coronets and Making Going My Way Father Brown at Although Brown is far more impressive than the other two. This script contains a bit of Colonel Nicholson. Guinness was also playing a character on the banks of the Kei River, who had a strange interpretation of the rule, because of the conditions of Nicholson that would lose sight of what was important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We enjoyed Brother Cadfle in medieval settings and American audiences liked Father Daling acting by Tom Bosley several years ago. <br /> <br /> This image should be stuck for entertainment.
