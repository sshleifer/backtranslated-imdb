Every comic book movie created without any doubt Duration !! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren (1989) Porsche. Yap .. then bad 1979 and 1991 Captain America movie. Oh yeah, it's even Worst then Christopher Reid script's Superman Fourth: Quest for Peace Cinema. Shashhe ... the movie that was so bad that the man played at the nuclear man only played in another film and this is simply TV = OPP <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is rated "D" quality. In 1997, I had the opportunity to watch it in the Saifai Channel. I heard it was very bad, but there was nothing more to do that night, so I thought I'd check it out. What an hour and a half waste. I have been good off restoring different strokes. In addition to the greatest influence and bad performance of all time, I have ever seen that the whole script was just terrible and was not fully operated. Thankfully, a new superb four movie is being completed and hopefully the hero of this version will do justice. I was waiting for a new Spanish movie in the future, but it still has not been implemented. <br /> <br /> Do not hire this movie. If you see it on TV only on television, check it out. Be careful, you will be most likely flipping the channel after the first 15 minutes.
