Like many other people, I've heard about "more" and I want to see it due to music music by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really frustrated because of the song, not the song. It's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this frustration come from? In my opinion, from different things. Above all, the film is related to the inert sunshine atmosphere of the movie, the film is badly linked to the drug. It should have taken place in the abusive areas of Paris and for example, there would be a dark and helpless climate. Moreover, it speaks of a clan in hell, but this line has become soft and rarely has been sketched. Barbara Schroeder does not emphasize enough on the dramatic side of the story. You might want to cut, crazy a little more. On the other hand, Shroder did not succeed in achieving the passion and loyalty of the audience in front of the plight of two main characters. You unnecessarily watch them judge with drugs. Although the two main actors, they are quite extraordinary and rarely develop between movie time, especially the Mimi Farmer. Finally, you only maintain sunshine dotted mediterraneans landscape properties. After the film was released in 1969, it created a huge sensation. Nowadays, it looks like <br /> <br />. Hippie culture is nothing less than a remote memory.
