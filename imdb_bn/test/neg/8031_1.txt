Perhaps I am just a common man, but I like movies that in any way can take care of people about them. I can not care less about anyone in this movie. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Maybe laugh was too fine for me (all the way down the nano level). The thing about it is, it misses many things. It was funny that the character was, but they were not. There were letters that you might like, but you do not. For example, the man who thought Beatles had robbed his song. There were many possibilities, but what he did was to talk like beetle and how they complained of trapping him. Haha And the previous poster spoke like 'I WALARS' scene, it was special. What? He plays an old piano 'I Wall Walls' and sang from the melody. Is there a joke inside? It sure stank the price in the face. This movie seems to me to think that they like the movie because it seems to mean 'intellectual' or 'hip', so that you publish the complete spiritual art / rubbish message to the artist. If you want to entertain, stay away.
