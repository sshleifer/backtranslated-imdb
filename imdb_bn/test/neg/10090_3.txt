Imagine each stereootic, acupuncture, from every movie and TV show on Brooklyn Street from 1930 to 1980. Make it with a cast of interchangeable characters instead of actual characters. Throw a mix of "Duration" music and electric guitar tide during "Rogue" scene. Then (or care) pass the time trying to find out (opposition) which is going to be killed in the climatic final rumble. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie the point not only for another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, Kiddie musical, or Oscar nomination vehicle. But it is nice to bring something new or interesting to the street gang tragedy style.
