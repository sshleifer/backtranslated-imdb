I'm a vampire movie (usually) mischievous. Even if the movie is not good at all, I like it because it has its vampire. But these stinks. It really gives a bad name to the vampire movie. <br /> <br /> At the outset, cheapest really looks. I'm not generally bothered for low budget movies - one of my favorite al-tim movies is El Mariachi who only costs $ 7,000 - but I hate it. The work is absolutely impressive, a 'stylish' washing camera that gives you a headache. <br /> <br /> It does not say anything other than to see it. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 because it was pre-rental and I feel cheated even for my low price.
