The good thing about this flash is that they used to use lots of things deprived of attacking Pearl Harbor. The park of my favorite P40 is upset in the row of P-40 parked, but it is drawn from above hangers or copicals. Unfortunately it gets worse from it. <br /> <br /> There are also two black boys and two white boys as well as some Filipino POWs and Japanese guards as well as American POS. American ranking POW is a white navy lieutenant, of course an O-3 navy. At any rate, he needs to cut hair, badly, misleadingly bad. Hockey hair does not belong to a WWII movie. Oh, and he is a racist She does not want to share quarters with 'negros'. Of course in the real life, he does not want to share the quarter with the white listed person. I think there is a section about Geneva Convention Officers quartered and registered, but this is not the case here. Oh well, I think this plot of plot is secondary to other things. He went into his place and watched most of the movies and carried air pumps for different types of air. <br /> <br /> But once you're going, it's not a bad story line. Japs Corrigador wants divers to raise silver sown by the Americans before falling. Filipino defenders want to take them out of their time. And POWs do their best to help. There is a potentially good story and that's not the way I guess. Using POWs camps every night to re-relax swimming in the POW camp and the Filipino villages when a bit incredible. Maybe I'm not that picky when I know that it's not a blockbuster film. I guess why this comes for five takers for the 20 pack DVD War movie collection. <br /> <br /> The music of 70 was not in this movie or the WWII film. It's confusing to say the least. Acting that was not bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, I could pay 25 cents for this movie. <br /> <br /> To see TCM or worth the fourth payment. <br /> <br /> One star to be war criminal, another for World War II, because I feel liberal.
