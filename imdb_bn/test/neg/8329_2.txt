You might think of a movie about inexperienced sisters who do not eventually kill their employer, but they may be frustrated, but then you'll be wrong. <br /> <br /> There are no plots. There is no character development. There is no visual beauty of any freedom fighter. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. It can not be investigated how the relationship between sisters develop, their sexuality is never different, it is focused on class relations and the employer is a silly act. <br /> <br /> Glossy silence and time dress does not equal the depth of money.
