It was assumed by the previous poster that the army in the disaster described in the film will not subdue the police. In fact, if the military role is initiated, the civil authorities will be requested to supply it. Citizen authorities will maintain dominance The army will need 48 hours or more to organize themselves in practice, especially with the present foreign commitments, the army was not in London. Even then they are dependent on calling in TA. <br /> <br /> As the Cobra, we thought it was a full government emergency emergency department - even a police copier of the Cobra Division. Actually the COBRA Cabinet Office stands for "A" in the briefing room. This is just the room where the Prime Minister or the DPM will meet with their advisors in the current urgent discussion!
