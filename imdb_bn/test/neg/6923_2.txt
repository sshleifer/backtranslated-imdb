Writer / director Brian Barnes has apparently seen some romantic comedy and he thinks that he has discovered the source of success: a lot of position in New York (especially in winter), old Hollywood films (especially musical instruments), enjoyable musical soundtracks. Alas, all of this is compensated for the lack of Barnes talent as a writer. (Why are many writers-directors not able to accompany the main studio why they can not go to the main studio, but they can get a backup for their movies.) <br /> <br /> Our interest in romantic comedy is inspired by the lead character, but Couple in this movie only has no appeal. David Cramholtz or Mila Jovavich is not the fault; Their letters are just weakly written. When we are reacting to classics such as old films like Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or his Girl Friday, the main character's personality conflicts and flaws are there. By reducing the ability to create a person, Barnes gives us a next school inspired by men from Tuesday, the woman came from Friday. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see the wife that Woody Allen's successor is next to me. I once smile at this time of the movie, and the screen-playing image of Echo Chamber ("I want to red paint in town." "Do you want to red paint in the city?"), Which signifies most stories are written in a business for a living In the early scenes, we film an improvised TV sitcom of Kromholo's actress girlfriend. The only moment the whole movie thinks is right; Perhaps that indicates that the genius of Burns is really suitable for it.
