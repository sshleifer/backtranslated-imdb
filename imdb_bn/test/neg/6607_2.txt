There are three main problems with the film. Or there are three reasons that it does not deserve any more serious consideration for a competitor. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's always going to be true, it's not nearly as good books. However, we may at least be expected to reflect some of Sapkowski's intellect or depth. <br /> <br /> Secondly we have to produce. Fantasy movie, in my opinion, is hard to produce good. Everything from props to clothing, scenery, stunts, and especially CGI is low-quality. Finally, and many of these are very intelligent, I can not take acting seriously. I have not been brought to Poland so I can not really judge - this is the lack of familiarity with Polish movies to me. All the same lines seem very distant delivery ... the welding may be good. <br /> <br /> In short, the only possible freedom fighter of this movie is the remainder of the plot, which flares through it: unlike a diamond ring on a rolling cadaver. <br /> <br /> On a different note I heard that book coming out of English. I have not seen them yet, but I can not even imagine that someone would begin to translate them ... When I judge the book, I will ask an English-speaking reader to remember it.
