Lazy director made by a lazy director. Characters are awesome Despite the suffering of this war, there is no emotion in the film. Symbolism is artificial and incompetent (and old Bosnian woman will "concrete" her wish to give Arbar a picture of his son, the super-mother inside her will wake up, the body will be awake by the insects to show the horrors of genocide ... Most are not enough but bad ). <br /> <br /> This movie is just an advertisement, a woman's hero is an empty girl. He worked for the United Nations. Remember the UN failed to protect citizens in Srebrena. Who is the real hero of this war? The Canadian judge mainly led the case in post for persecution due to its failure to avoid its organization? Where is the criticism in this movie?
