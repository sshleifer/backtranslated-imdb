I think that Noah's Ark is going to be an ideal, and again, another "Bible" film should be shown to Hollywood. Regardless of the horror, completely custom-rich, (regardless of which Voyette and Steinberg agree to act in this movie), the timeline has been completely rearranged. I miss the genesis of the cruise ship on the ship's deck or the visitor to his paddle boat. Hello Someone was dead except Noah and his family, according to the scriptures. How did God ask Noah when he added plans to build tall structures and ships? Noah's wife is not nearly 40 days old, Naho wanders around the eyes of the drug and always gets drunk. Script writer had obviously little knowledge about Genesis Book, or just a story that did not care that its hatred completely mocked it.
