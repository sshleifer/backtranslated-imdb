I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Shanti's horror film and when I see them new then I like less and less, and when I see the end of watching the movie is not really wonderful. Satan's Brotherhood! Despite its low ratings in IMDB, I was surprised to hear some good things about this film and my expectations increased. This can be a big mistake because it justifies the rating of the picture: that is very bad! This plot is your basic group of devils causing problems and we pay attention to a small town where people are murdered and abducted and why it is not really clear. Naturally, the satans are behind it and this bad news is for the mother, father and daughter in the streets trapped in this mysterious town. I thought that this film can be similar to the same simple devilish flick, 'The Devils Run', and it's not as stupid as Robert Fuest's next film, but it's not even better. The plot seems to fall down roughly on the earth, but it is rather annoying and I can not say that I enjoyed myself during this movie. Satan's Brotherhood is probably his fan, but I'm not one of them; This is a movie which I do not see any reason to recommend ...
