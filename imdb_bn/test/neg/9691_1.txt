This is the most misleading and disrespectful biblical movie that could ever be lucky for me. I want to know why anyone on earth can enjoy watching this. I am so surprised that a great name like John Voight will agree to the garbage work in this insulting piece. Many people who can not read the Bible will get distracted by believing this film is right and its thoughts bother me. I have a lot of answers for the creators. The worst thing is, I believe that anyone can not make such a mistake with Bible films, because they can study the Bible for the truth, so I believe that the creators intentionally blows what the Bible says and it is something that I Find offensive. There is no sound strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about this.
