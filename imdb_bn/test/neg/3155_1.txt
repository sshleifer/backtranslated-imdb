Bernie and Friends ... Daro 1990 Explorer <br /> OK, I'll accept it. As a kid, Barney was my absolute hero I was my Barky Plush toy and I used to see the same Berne episode over on the video tape. Maybe it was so sugar-coated and non-monotonous. <br /> <br /> However, when I was 7 years old, I began to hate Barney. Everyone in the school will be a disc burner, and I went along (mainly because it was fun) and it's what small boys do. But a few years later, I discovered something else about Barney that I would never forget. <br /> <br /> A person known at IMDB has written a book on Angels_Emira as a school, explaining the risks of seeing Barney, and he or she posted it on the message board. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> She said, inferred educational, or so Sheryl Leach (Barney's creator), but really, I can remember to teach him, that magic can solve something, which is not true. <br /> <br /> Comments Off, I want to tell you a little story. Once there was a small boy, who had seen a special episode of Bern. One day, he was alone, when a stranger took him in his car and went with him. I do not know the result (but it is safe for the baby to die), but why did he kidnap in the first place? Because he saw Barney and Friends' episode titles "An unknown friend who has not met you yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
