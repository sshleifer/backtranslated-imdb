To take this picture I took more time to write more about this review. It's just plain bad. The plot is terrible than the TV show. It's flat, weird and annoying. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the logo has exceeded many ideas before the film is green. It should be read as an example to know when visitors will stop. <br /> <br /> Bad edit, bad music, bad acting. Zero Mobility, Zilch Chemistry. <br /> <br /> a movie that is made without any love with a mysterious end, which makes you sad and feels the feeling of anger so much money is wasted. <<br /> <br /> LEGA apparently created an offer that they could not refuse, or perhaps their ego would have been better than them. It was better to push a hazardous marketing which was probably more intense when iron was more inspirational. <br /> <br /> When I asked, when to stop and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please! Someone tried to convince me of this film's delicate point!
