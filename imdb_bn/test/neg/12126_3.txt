The plot of "open grave" is very simple: it is about a board game called mba, where players die in similar manner in the same way, they die in the same way. Smiley death scenes include computer creation and murder of snakes. Characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and even a little suspense. I like Elisa Doskoo in "Wrong Turn", but she's completely upset and disgusting here. The CGI-WEEK from the Sea is completely ridiculous and the only reason to see the fool "open grave" is some interesting camera angle and sexy Elijah Dosque. If these movies are a horror of horror, I will leave it seriously. My latest piece of budget is less than 70 or 80 budgets. 10 out of 10 generous
