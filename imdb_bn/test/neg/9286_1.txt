This is one of the continuous things I have ever seen. It is unfortunate that he tries so hard to bring a good joke and curses what he does and thinks his hateful obscenity is fun. He has ever seen the most nasty person She is trying to show her how much she does not care, and only through this, critics and she gets angry with people of any taste and humor, who are more tortured. "Show". There are good comedians, there are bad ones and there are terrific ones. But this guy is a league of his own. I'm sorry for him and much more for those who think he's funny.
