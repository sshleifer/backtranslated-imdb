After reading the first novel, I do not think, for the purpose of filming, it is scripted, as long as it follows or contains at least one. For reasons known to Hollywood, the important parts of the story are completely ignored, and a different story line has been added. The reason that this novel has passed the examination of the time, there is no doubt that due to the complete interference of both the characters and the plot. To interfere in this structure, to destroy the complex balance of the story line, and hence the purpose of the story's holder. Though the opinion, this film cast leaves a lot to be desired. Characters are described as very fat, at least, of course, should be portable, let the character be credited. Slavery days can not end, or, of course, these powerful actors could have rebelled in such rebellion. Marion Halqam's face is described as a manic appearance, ... its very feminine appearance of Fitzgerald is not true. Laura has been described fairly 'fair', unless it is 'spiritual', so with the dark hair, the novel does not fit the music completely. .... badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
