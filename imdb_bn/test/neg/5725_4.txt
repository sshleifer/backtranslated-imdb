This film was released soon after the Cannes films, one of the women played by Canaan, Red Sonja, Sylvester Stallone's former wife Brigitte Nilssen. Unfortunately he is not a very good actress as proved in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie seems to be cheap, but weirdly Arnold Swazingerer appears in this movie but not as a Canaan, although he works in Canaan from two Canaan films and struggles, I do not know what he is about. However he appears only about every twenty minutes and does not hold around for long. Perhaps Arnold Conan the Destroyer or some time off from filming? However, the film is slow and annoying for an action film, avoid it and instead see Barbarian in Canaan.
