I was surprised to see this picture, why did Universal spread such movie? They had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films. The beginning of the nuclear era attacked the huge monster film. Spider, ants, prayer mantis' With the Deadly Muntis, there is a monster praying Monty flying around the Arctic, terrifying Eskimos, and terrified by the Armed Forces. The bug reached a tunnel in New York, where soldiers eventually destroyed it. Of course, this has seen much more attention in the MST. Who was a good idea to start the film by showing a great map?
