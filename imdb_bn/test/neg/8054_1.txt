Horror really needs to know all. First of all think about all the things that can be bad about a movie. And then try to make a movie that is bad in this way. You will create "Vacationland". The state of the mine should be disgraced: it is such a beautiful place that acts as a backdrop for quarterly, intelligent, annoying verse. I'm romantic, and I always like movies to find each other to succeed in both, and I tried hard to make it good. It was difficult; Very strong I did not find any emotional connection between a character in neutrality in this exercise. Except one or two bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine is a good landlady; This is not the movie.
