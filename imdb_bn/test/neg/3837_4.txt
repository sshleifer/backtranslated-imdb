Hyupper was never bad because he thinks this film is only suitable for a grade-B performance, and it's rather a good distribution. Outside of Madison and the hopper, acting is horrible; You've seen your local high school well. Words and sometimes editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies. Pipsing Tom's view is the biggest unwanted nudity scene in movies I've ever seen (it does not even fit around in film). The script was probably a great outline of the 10-page, but it came to a full-length movie when the corpse went behind the brain when it had more holes. Humor has to tell Hooper, who is dressed in a nice suit to laugh at me laughing, but I do not think that his intention was. Yes there is a little style, and Hopper can always draw my interest. But the concept of an interesting plot never stops and you are surprised that you have lost the time of viewing it.
