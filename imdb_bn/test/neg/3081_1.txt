I remember this movie, it was not good. I always say that if a movie is good and you can keep an eye on difficult moments (for example: a Tylenle Cold and Sinus War), it's a movie that has done its job. The fact that I was asleep in most of this movie only proves that it can not keep my attention, and did not complete its work. Why did I have a picture on my surgery Tylenol cold and sinus, hunting? <br /> <br /> To get started, there is no promise in any sense. The acting was poor and the overall story opened more doors just that can not be closed. I swear, when I swear, I kissed Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this picture). Do not have any ideas. Then there was a scene with the affix and his roommates indicating that he was asleep with one of them, breaking almost the perfect lesbian couple. I think that Graham is not most committed to a relationship like this, but for me it was not much more than just Filler. I have a suspicious feeling that this movie director was sleeping with Aphelek. His performance in this movie was tortured. I mean, I did not see him playing a "good", but it was very bad. Oh, I had another moment during the war, and I am sure with IMDb.com ... what is John Stuart doing in this film? At this moment I was once again open to my eyes, it seems that one war was open for just one moment. <br /> <br /> And, frankly, it's Heather Graham - we can take a little less care about him later. He's just not funny - he's just soft, annoying and after a while he stopped playing. In order to revive the film, they start throwing wildly characters, but it does not work, and instead of just calling a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix, so now it's weird, tedious, annoying and really, really long. Slow acting style of Luke Wilson slowed down a crawling movie - why were these two married? A truly terrible movie committed - "Hip Comedy" which kind of lets you leave staggering out of depressing and indifferent. <br /> <br /> Grade: * ***** Out
