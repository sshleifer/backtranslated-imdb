I saw this screen on a big screen today and I can not really believe here that some people have commented here. I'm really hoping to touch this image, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I am this Australian army and patriotic towards this great country, but I think this film does not do justice for us and those soldiers who fought in this war. <br /> <br /> Films are poorly illustrated. I thought acting was terrible, they were not trustworthy and they did not give me any reason to take care of me. People say the film was graphic, there were some graphic scenes, but I think most of the parts are very weak. The war scene was very small and just a few minutes passed. <br /> <br /> Overall, a weak film that does not judge any of these soldiers.
