The story was clear and brief, but the film did not catch my interest overall - the scenes seemed flat and vague. Ganges Khan was historically a very interesting / epic life, but the film failed to capture - instead focusing on minor clashes. The story of a young man and a love that I have seen in many other films is incognito. I never felt sympathy or sympathy for leadership - yes slavery was to be defeated, but then there was a simple journey in the way of being happy, killed and topped up. One of the release was the quality photography - apparently helped the dark atmosphere of the scene, unfortunately, in the fiction of the story - I was disgraced, and frustrated.
