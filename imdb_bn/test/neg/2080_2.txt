Tempest is based on the work of the classic Shakespeare of the same name, but it is not compatible with its source material. <br /> <br /> It is considered as cerebral as the name of the brain, but instead it is a chilly, gradual and exercise in the Hackneynid Tedium. The original has proved that there is an evil side of man, which will be destructive if it is undefined. Here you only get an unintended mid-life crisis (yawn) stupid ball that makes everything his personal and professional life is doing wrong. He is donated with a supernatural power to try to control his environment; In other words: get your way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If something else goes wrong in her unfortunate life every few minutes, find her in an isolated place and start "Show me magic!" During the waving around his hand and making a "serious density" expression. From shooting in this scene, it looks like he is trying to make bugs into other kinds of bugs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> He met some relation with the girl, one of the films ever committed cruel romance. The story just bogs down and moving at a slow and slow pace. You never give any reason to like or dislike someone. <br /> <br /> I did this last or not to give this beautiful 2 Greek position shot and semi-optimistic conclusion due to the fact that it would give a 2 (although it is not clear if it is not clear). Shakespeare's work has been better captured in other movies; One notable example is "Forbidden Planet", which believes how it goes beyond power control. <br /> <br /> As this "Tempest", it only cures wizard insomnia.
