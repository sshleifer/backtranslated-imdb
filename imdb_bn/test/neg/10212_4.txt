Being wrestling fan, films about wrestling are usually sucked (stories of backcount dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura) but this is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, its bad but I've mentioned others better than that. <br /> <br /> Hogan Hogan is basically like himself and for some reason his rival network wants to beat him because he does not want to be a network. Let me explain it so that everyone can understand ... the image is being ripped to the US ... and TNT will go towards any length to get him. <br /> <br /> Did it understand ... no? Do not feel good because it is not understandable. At the end of a movie there is no real fight for a true war with Rip. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the finest of the film, but compared to other wrestling movies and later it is not so much better than Hogan films. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
