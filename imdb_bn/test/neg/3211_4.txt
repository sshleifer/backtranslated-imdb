Sexting agent / James Bond's warmth is mixed with Sax Roham's female Phu Manchu fame in some form of fatty ideas and stir up some frustrated revisionism by director Franco - your male's gay homosexuals or "7 hidden mysteries" "-" The Girl in Rio Rice " Known as "Free Rio", "Rio the Man of Rio," with which it has no relation. As we are told, as Sumuru, or Sumitra, like a bad version of "Modesty Blaise", acted here with some of the familiar laughter known to actress Eton, which is the first of us with "Goldfinger" There are many close shots to close her camera, her mouth is slowly opening up, perhaps seeing something unexpected (however, she has her original lesbian scene. Twice the amount). He controls an entire army of female fighters, dresses in colorful clothing, and manages a city named Femina or something (outside Rio de Janeiro?). These ideas, which were previously shown in "Sumo Million Eyes" Horrible, however, despite some stimulating set designs and visuals, it follows the same camping atmosphere, for example, "dates" Eyedera "which came almost at the same time and which featured a female army. At first glance, these armed women, usually lined in a row, hold their interest, but after 15 minutes or so, you realize that there is nothing after setting up the scene only. <br /> <br /> The plot looks like a secret agent, a man who is coming to Brazil with $ 10 million. He focused on the Local Criminal Lord (Sanders, hamming it as an elderly bond-type villain), who called him boldly to send a bold-fitting thug to bowl capers. It sets everything for agents, crime master and mysterious (the criminal lord wants secret things) between 3-way conflict. Sumura also keeps prisoners in a glass cage - perhaps it's one of the secret things. It seems to be exciting but the problems only go out of a slow motion; There are many shots that can be used very harsh: for example, a shot from an incoming aircraft, as it settles at the nearby stop, as well as in the cast, as it has never been captured in the movie before. There is a similar procedure for a normal sunset, as there is something unusual about it. The war scenes were very low-quality, as the filmmaker first seemed to have used. To add some production values, there is a view of the Real Rio carnival about the mid-road. I guess there were various budget problems, especially in the climatic warfare, where there is a lot of fake word impact and smoke, such as the lack of real-gunning guns - remember when kids seem to be using plastic guns and the dramatic bullet fired , unconvincingly falling down on There are similar impressions such as torturing a character for getting answers and female nudity, after some restrictions, they have been presented with a primary screenplay. But, mostly, you will be rolling in your eyes. Hero: 3 Villains: Fleas at 5pm: 5 Hechenchen: 4 Fights: 3 Stunts / Chase: 3 Gadgets: 4 Auto: 4 Position: 6 Pace: 3 Overall: 4
