When a friend and I have seen this in the recent publication, we decided to accept it despite the fact that none of us heard it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it was James Coburn so we could not be bad at it. We were wrong. It was there. It was really bad. No actor or actress can make this image valuable. It was Titanic, The Pocidon Adventure, and some atomic bomb films and tried to cut and paste it all. <br /> <br /> I must admit that there were some chocolates. The head cabin's son asked Allan (Costas Mandilar) if he is a "pussy marine". Others have received this picture though there is nothing to do with writing. I love how people of this film can think that you can stand up on the cruise lineer and it can stay fixed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for Costas Mandilar, then proceed to James Coburn or any other cast. Find something that they are good at.
