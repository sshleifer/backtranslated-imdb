The strange Disney movie about a college student, which, incidentally, inventes objects that disappear. Not a bad idea and some of the special effects are quite good. Still, the script is very bad ... all joke flows and shy acting. Everyone is trying to be funny and they do not. A real annoying, stupid Disney movie. But Kuru Russell was so young.
