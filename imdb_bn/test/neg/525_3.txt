Some aspects of this product are good, such as Angela Lansbury, George Henon, Chris Gronendandal and Sal Mistretta Performance. But is I the only one because of the awesome performances of Johanine Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters songs with her screechy voice and overacts on a role she definitely does not understand. I think the chorus is not damaged. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this product is OK, but if done correctly, the Sleepy Todd can be too much. This production layer does not come close to demand for this material. Music version with George Henon and Patty Loopon is even better.
