I recently had a stage version of this game. And, on the last day of the runner, I saw that it was going to play on TV. I was stuck in a late night and I saw the next day. I would say I was very frustrated. Filmmakers discovered some of the discoveries in the script. Which may be interpreted as a different repetition process, but it was uncomfortable to see. The original script for the movie has changed a lot and has been able to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure whether it helped the movie in any way. I gave these 4 stars because I know this script and the writing image is much better than the figure.
