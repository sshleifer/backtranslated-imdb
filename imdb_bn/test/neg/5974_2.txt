I'm sorry to say it, but it's actually one of the worst documented movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "Darwin's nightmare" because of his name I hope a documentary on blue nail-related problems Victoria Lake <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this "documentary" is a short compilation of different stories, most of which do not have any relation to fish or lake. And for a bigger part you can just tell their story - it's like some compilation scenes that lack a meaningful connection ... <br /> Why is this movie a waste of time: - Showing relevant information to us The family of Russian pilots (wives and daughters, for example, their personalized digicam snapshots) are destroyed by a crocodile. Expressing mourning for African baby's death (like Nail does not come nail) - About 100 times our planes start at the airport and how it is started - showing our strange religious events for a few minutes - discussing a whore at the airport in detail - Talking about their mothers with children, parents - what they do and / or how they die (well, non Numan: Someone who died on HIV - who assumed it?) These are just some examples, I can go to different pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is completely focused, and everything that wants to tell the scene Does not know er If you have never heard of Africa and this continent does not have social / health / HIV / violence / war problems, then this movie may be right for you. If you have not closed your eyes for the last decade, then 90% of the movie will not be new to you - and the way presented here will make you the best effort to fall asleep. Perhaps my expectations of this movie were high, but I did not really like it, though it is an issue that I usually find interesting. If this movie is intended to be related to poverty blue nails, it should probably take some time to discuss the issue ...
