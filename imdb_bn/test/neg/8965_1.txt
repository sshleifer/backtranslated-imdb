This movie is really incredible, per sensation of sound. I could not believe what I saw and hear, and I did not believe in anything. Hepburn was probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. As a mountain bed myself, I know it should be sound like it, and it's not Kate's Back Bay Act The only thing I thought was funny was that the man who played Charlie Chan, played Sydney Tollar many times, as one of the mountains on the pronunciation of the match. Maybe it was a real joke, it seems to come in. I can not think of any other reason for such strange casting. Well, maybe this is I noticed that Latin Howell, Natalie Schaefer, was present at Broadway in the play on the island of Giligan. What part can he imagine he can play?
