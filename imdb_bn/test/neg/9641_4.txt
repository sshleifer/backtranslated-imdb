It was my mistake to think it was a serious war-hell movie before watching it. When the "MTV" logo appears, it is the end of seconds in all the movies. It may be known as "National Lampon's Sexy-n-Low". And it did not play the "MTV" crowd; 40 minutes before the movie that followed the first few seconds of the comedy acting like music videos to play. At least Disney was smart enough to run her Rated R staff in Touchton and allowed us to take it seriously. All right, I'm being harsh; This is a film that was not bad. However, it is definitely part of its overacting and the film is highly favorable / unilateral. Of course, I'm a fight movie buff. I can not see 'platoon,' 'flower metal jacket' or 'savings private private' more than once. Of course they were good movies, but I would not be able to make a difference from the next where they do not make me fair and they seem to be mixed after a while. After the visit to Iraq, Philipp has planned life after the war, but his contract has returned according to a clause. Or, at least, it does not go to AWOL until military planning and the characters are not surprisingly caught in cross-country speeds at a few bucks. No, I was not in any war, I was not even in Iraq, I do not agree with that. I do not have all the knowledge when signing or signing the contract. I can say this: Although I'm sorry, they are coming back to this conflict, I can not feel too much for anyone so that they can not read fine print. It is on some of their death sentences to read the surgeon's warnings in the cigarette box and say to them, "Oh, what's wrong? I'll file a case against them!"
