I think it was a mistake that I had a second movie with the same title, and realized that I paid a little earlier. <br /> <br /> Quick plot line. An artist and photographer couple Joe Estevez from Los Angeles to rent a studio apartment, cursing his son Martin Shane could actually ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted from the 1930's and its last victim by a sticky looking serial killer. Their ghosts live in a couple, firstly their sex life increases, but eventually becomes more deadly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
