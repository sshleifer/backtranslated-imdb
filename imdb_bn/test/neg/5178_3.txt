This movie can be great. It's not in my opinion. The story has been disseminated, the editor will not be able to choose Guy Ritchie-style conversation style and one that's easier to choose. There is a great emphasis on excessive violence including torture. If you ask me too much If the letters are too shallow and stereo type, I would love to see more depth there. It is difficult to detect with the main character. As a result, the film is completely shallow. <br /> <br /> The movie says that it gives viewers the underlying view of the British Criminal Undersaccess, in particular the Sx Sex Inclusion. Soccer-huligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, large-scale violence. Fear of violence and general fear Some people are not seeing their brain (or their) brain, we are seeing a bunch of cloth animals. As I said, there is not much of a plot and the story is very much liked. <br /> <br /> If you are a 30-year-old man, such as Gore and hardcore violence and it sounds entertaining, it's a movie for you. If you portray real people with a better story, mystery and depth for a movie but better ... you can skip this.
