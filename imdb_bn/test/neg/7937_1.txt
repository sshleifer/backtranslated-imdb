Is it just me, or is it an amazing movie? I'm going with an unprecedented movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, credibility Some small degrees I can not believe strongly, the film will not work. So, we come to the problem with the "attack on the previous 13". <br /> <br /> One for spoiler, I do not have detailed details of the plot. However, I have to make an exception here, because the plot is SO inane. Bad guy has been jailed on Pretinct 13 The friend of the bad guy wants to get him out. Surprise Bad guys' friends are actually corrupt police. Annoying, annoyed, but the brave warrior girl saved that day while romancing the girl. Disgust Yes, it's really easy, and that's stupid. <br /> <br /> "Detroit attacked" 13. Not bad settings for crime and corruption (I've spent 3 months at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm saying). Even so, it's violently violent and humiliating police and Detroit citizens. I spent most of the time in Detroit City, but I can not imagine how the suburbs in the suburbs would be the final retreat in the Detroit Forest. I must miss it ... <br /> <br /> There is no return for watching bad movies. Save your money. In 2005 there were many good films for blockbuster waste and even US $ 3.00. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just because I saw bad movies
