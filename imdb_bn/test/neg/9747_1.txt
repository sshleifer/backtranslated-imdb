Would it be very annoying for me to create a review just like saying "stupid" again? Perhaps <br /> <br /> <br /> I've never seen this controversial scene. Seriously There are more than 3,000 movies in mystery science theater. I saw this movie for the first time in a friend's birthday party when it was in the theater. Although it was actually * with friends * and one of their * birthday parties, I had to leave. I actually had to go away. I just excused myself and went outside. Thankfully, some parents were doing the same thing, so I did not see total shake ... however, this picture is terrible. There's nothing like it. It is painful (actually causing physical pain) slow, and sickly (induced literally inverted) illiterate. You are almost sorry for Tom Arnold, but then you do not think he was actually in the film. It really hurts even thinking about me. <br /> <br /> It was on TV a few months ago, and I decided to see me once. I thought, why I went to the first place, even an observer was found guilty of raising his rating. Gags are not funny, characters arn't interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rent it. But if you have any dignity to avoid this whole stupid mess. SCORE: 0/10 ... Probably a negative 1, in fact.
