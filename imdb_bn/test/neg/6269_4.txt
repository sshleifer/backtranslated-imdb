The two films of the same story released in 2005 were unbelievable. It was published a day before Tom Cruise. Did not they do with Truman Capeto the same year, and last year's Russian assassin? <br /> <br /> <br /> The author / director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget and c. Thomas Hawl is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of Blockbuster which has earned $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we treated Rath Guillsey with a scream, who congratulated a priest <br /> <br /> <br /> Gary Bushy was afraid of the army's LT .
