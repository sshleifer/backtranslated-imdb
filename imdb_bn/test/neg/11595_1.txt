As a total movie gaek with the lucky work of the video store manager, I like to see all types of movies, very good to very bad. There was a movie with this crown-ball lines, Chess CGI effects and predictive plot points that I ended up laughing heavily before switching it after 30-40 minutes. The "Animal Characteristics" section of the film has featured some fantastic horror elements in recent years (someone who has Guadilla 2000?), But this film reminds me that the makers are not even trying. It may be valuable to check "possible" (to count guns), but I could not recommend this movie to a good conscience.
