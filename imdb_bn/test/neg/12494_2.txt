This movie was probably made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it clear? It seems they have not made any effort to look at "future" in the future at least. For example, the first scene occurred in the 80's office building and all cars in the late 70's (I think they do not want to drive more than $ 500). Furthermore, it is quite clear that Don "Dragon" is driving his personal car during filming (lastly, he partially funded the film). Finally, they point to the beginning of the film that all new drugs in this new "cyberpunk" society are now legal. This is not important in this movie, but when it comes to surgery without anesthesia later, why not go out and drink some legitimate heroin or morphine? If Dawn easily fires the "unstable" cyber tracker for 25 minutes in the film then the whole film is such and completely anticlockmatic. However, if you think this movie is cheap or free, I would like to see it, the last scene is almost worthwhile to attach to this whole film.
