This image is BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, and BORING !!! It's not that bad movie that I saw, but on the contrary, ....... how can I keep it ....... It's playing! There are some very nice scenery and some cute dry wit but it's about it. If it is notified as a itinerary, I will rate it 7 but it is supposed to be a plot, some plays and a point for God or a movie with a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read something about this board's comments about the movie and I was surprised that they saw the same movie. See this movie at your own risk (see). Sure - it's really rated correctly = G rating! (Which stood the greatest for Allah!)
