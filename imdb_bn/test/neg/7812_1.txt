To be perfect, I could not see this movie everywhere, so suddenly it went through halfway through the film if I do not have any idea. But the first 30 minutes or more I have seen the worst. Children under twelve may come out from bad writing, acting and directed slopstick humor, but adult stomachers should be cleaned in full control of all their faculties.
