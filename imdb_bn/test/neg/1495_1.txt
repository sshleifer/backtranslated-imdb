Several teenagers have gathered together to discuss their fears, but a non-profit guest showed up and killed everyone. Perhaps the worst movie in the 90s is Camp Blood (1999), the only movie that can challenge it for the title, there are a number of cruel characters and situations that sometimes please the television screen. The so-called surprises ended, as the rest of this film is awful. Grooming it gently on a sooo bad is the best level. My rating: 10 out 2
