Hu Where do I start? I usually ignore what I am looking for when watching a movie of IMDB because I think I like it or whatever and I can at least give it a chance, but this time I want to focus on that. <br /> <br /> I know some people like it, and I do not mean they should not. It was semi-funny in some parts. But if you're like me and you do not want to see underwater cats for 20 minutes, random fast cloud scenes, dogs set cats for 'creeps' for 20 minutes and sets them off in the 'thriller' music and face when people are talking , Then you might want to avoid this movie. Actors were either positive wood or upper side, and the quality of the film was awkward, vague, and great and flexible, and these were not artistic. And I know that we thought that Carol was not just a crazy dog ​​with a gunshot shooting of innocent human psychologist, but ... Well, he does not really satisfy me otherwise. In fact, I really end up disliking her crazy character. And what was with the soul in space? I understand it's a fantasy movie, but let's go. <br /> <br /> I would say, finally the angels were surprised. It was the biggest thing of the whole film, Darth Maul Luv-Face is more vague than the monster. I give them their props for that scene, it was good. But actually the movie is not good enough to see. And the opening credit was great, but not fooled! I used to use whatever credit I was going to do to make the movie even better. <br /> <br /> Wow. I want to buy that I have paid 2 dollars for it, I'd buy a candy bar instead. : /
