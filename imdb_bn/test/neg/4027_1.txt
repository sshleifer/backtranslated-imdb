My friends and I have been asking each other about this whole flick. We could not believe how foolish it is! I think someone shot at Camcoder in this house and stuck in the movie store and saw that it would keep it as a joke to see if anyone would love it. Well, I think the joke is over us. <br /> <br /> I think I will come to this website and read the reviews it has received, everyone says this movie is cool, stupid, and over and over. And boy they're okay! Although it was quite ridiculous (my friends and my friends were drunk) because it is so stupid. We can not believe that someone is stupid enough to make such a silly movie! I swear to 70 before that there was good technology for their movies and stuff, because each view really looks vague, but when I saw it was made in 2001? What? Surely it will not be like a movie that will be made today, but I think when you use Camcoder and shoot home movies using Strawberry Lights and actually fake looking lasers, and actually use realistic people from your residence, actors even even aspiring actors . BTW-Some kids (or they were dragging on the races, we could not say!) Were so fatal, even my drunk horny college friends would not touch them with 50 feet of Paul. <br /> <br /> So there is absolutely no appeal in this movie, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time or money during this time, you will be completely disappointed!
