Others have already commented that there is not much to add, the film should not be difficult, it does not fail, and there is no depth in the plot of the plot and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me think, though the rest of the gang is working hard to remove the pins from the armed truck's door, because it does not seem to be open to any other way, the person inside the truck can easily remove the truck floor. There is a hole in which it can be out, and then it can come back again, not to see anyone, because no one else can think that he could be better or better. , That they might have gotten from there <br /> <br /> is committed but not enough.
