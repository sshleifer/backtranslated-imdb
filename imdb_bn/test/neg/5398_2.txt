This *** could be SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> <br /> Where to start this special empty land? Well it was nice if they were actually a plot. Acting talent, modest conversation, mystery, humor, and even irrational sex have helped this flick. Unfortunately there was a lot of gore, even (it is also not good), automatic weapon shooting and missing. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to add a fundamental foundation that will protect the body of the assassinated group, with the Federal Special Oops team who is wearing CVVIS (?). Most of the time, in violation of the basic rules of behavior in horror movies, different from the group so that you can choose one after the other. You think this group will know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappeared without trace. When they eventually realized that they were making selection they made multiple scales and their weapons only set fire to hit the trees. <br /> <br /> When the trees do not shoot the trees, the tree shots repeat the scene continuously. <br /> <br /> When they do not shoot the trees, they are following this spirit who does not leave any way, (who knows how they are tracking it), and spouting a lot of Macho BS. However, I have mentioned that most of these groups are women? Attractive listening to them is hard to hear. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> To all, you can find good movies in Dargah Bint at Kmart.
