I like this movie! It is today the best parody of the Russian movie. Nobody can kiss Tamkovsky better than anyone except Sokurov. Did you think "STK" was slow? Increased to good plate. "Matt I Scene" creates "Stuck", looks like "Lost Ark Riders". Do not miss this picture in any way! There is no quiz - even if you are busy living, you can still enjoy this movie full-length by holding fast-forward buttons in your VCR. Sokurov gave our first feature length film that could be appreciated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the next great form of the form will come when someone will be able to look and feel for a movie. There is no sound or image - 45 minutes on the black, silent screen (it has not already been searched on "In the Soup"?) <br /> <br /> The apparently the filmmaker (and fans) forgot that "motion" Motion picture "'s first word. <br /> <br /> !!! Chief Spider Aayad !!! <br /> <br /> Want to reach the talented heights of achieving this picture? Here is a step by step: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some topics and a suitable photo landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, see some luxury car or perfume commercial. <br /> <br /> 3 Shoot 3 pieces of the photo. <br /> <br /> 4. Play around with photoshop saturation, bluetooth and vision ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now just get your movie camera out, 40 photos of the best pictures and your "actors" have their lines off-screen in Mumbai. Do not worry about writing it over time - Tell the actors whatever they want (for example, "Do you want to drink?" And "Let's eat something" actually you have to fill 8 minutes or more)). You can not think enough conversations - no problem! Just tell them a few times what's there to repeat. That's not enough yet, just run the camera whatever. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another great composition! As a bonus, you want to distribute it on the Internet, no problem! Static images will not shrink anything with standard MPEG encoding - a 73-minute movie may be about 2-3 megabytes in the highest quality possible.
