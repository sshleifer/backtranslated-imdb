This is the worst and most stupid show ever seen on TV. It is often painful to be physically painful (in its twentieth century), there is nothing to do to torture and ridicule his parents, who are always forced to bear with their brains and the same foolish stupidity, friends of their friends Of course I know his parents are on him, but they are really surprised how they work, they are completely surprised by the fact. It seems fake through and through. And I really hate the context of this event, in which an air asks "Left Margarines, what will they think later? !!" (I think how it is, anyway), and the left by itself answers: "I want to do f ^ * k whatever!" - How nice! The left is really a hell raiser - living at home with mom and dad! - Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced with a tasteful beak, but we get the message. The left is the real deal rebel - at least in your own eyes Of course the left and his graduation sculs aims an audience of fur teen boys, and of course it is an MTV show, but please raise the bar a bit. It's painful, predictable and stupid, and nothing so annoying.
