The 1998 edition of "Psycho" needs to be set to 60 instead of the current day. Has done a good job with title setting. There were two scenes that were stuck just like a thorn thumb. The first was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anna Hiech) was sitting in his desk. His boss took his client to his office because "air conditioner was there." I imagine most of the Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lily Crane (Julian Moore) and Sam Lumis (Viggo Montensen). Walkman's game seemed to be exaggerated to update Lilla's movie. The movie has not spook a number of viewers in the theater.
