"The opposition party [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelov" and it was not as good as the "river bridge". Hack, it was not as good as "GI Zen", which is very sad. <br /> <br /> The movie is moving around a fundamental moral issue: a simulated prisoner-war situation, how far do you go before breaking the law? In this situation, the law is right? How can you imitate someone torture someone without torture? Can you deliberately inflict pain? How about breaking the bones? Mack execution? Sexual harassment? Serious blood loss? Real gun with bullets? Death? In this case, any obscure line is divided from "harmful" to "acceptable". <br /> <br /> Now if you find yourself in such training programs and the line between simulation and reality disappears, what can you do? ? What can you do? This film is trying to illustrate this contradiction. <br /> <br /> I think it's interesting to see the types of strategies used in "Resistance training". I have a brother who went through USAF's POW training program. According to him, it was very close to technically marked. <br /> <br /> The film has a fairly good foundation, but it does not have a particularly good story. I was surprised if some might be based on real events, but it became fantastic that it does not begin to explode. They must change between three quarters of the script writers, because it changes a real extreme and with some confusing explosions some uninterrupted shoot-ups are done. <br /> <br /> I found it rather endangered; Again, stupid kind. I was surprised that the whole thing was - I suspect that there was not just one. It might have been better with a few more stories to go with fireworks.
