I agree with other user comments. It is difficult to believe that this film actually came in 1994 because it screams in the mid 80's. I think it has been dubbed because the words and pictures do not always match. If someone really says this is a good movie, they need to be locked. It is so tragic that the people have so much money so much that they will do something to get it. I've lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have little respect for Chuck Norris before I saw this but now I just feel bad. I bought it for $ 9.99 as part of a 3 movie pack, and I can honestly say that I wanted to literally throw money. Forgive me Jesus.
