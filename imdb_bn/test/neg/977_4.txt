I threw this car for the first time with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy and Morphie. But once again, I can see that it has some fun bits. <br /> <br /> It is not always meaningless to say the greatest comedy of all time, but what can you already do to the last concert? What director, Tom Day, tried to try it is a mockery of comedies and media clich√©s. At the beginning of the film a cable network executive asked: "How is it different from the police?", When Chase Range de Niro's character describes the concept of a reality show related to Mitch Preston (a funnyly annoying name by the way). When I saw it in a new light that I did not notice earlier. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all elements of friend comedies and put a wrapping on them. De Niro's reluctance to listen to star and starring with Marie is exactly what you can think of every cop movie. You can say that De Niro actually asks himself: "Why am I acting on a police forehead?" Chase Range is portrayed as a Hollywood hat, but if you look at its opening scene again, it's just doing it to save its work. What he is doing as he sees the sunshine, he wants to be successful even then. One line says it all: "Who does not want to stay on TV?" Maybe it's reading too much in a lightweight movie, it's just set to be entertained, but it gives a little spin that I have not noticed before. <br /> <br /> For morphology. You have to appreciate him for looking this ridiculous. Trey wants a star to be so bad that he is willing to sell everything with communication. Murphy was a big star and probably hit a nervous that it was so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with guns is certainly boring. Both verbs and crew require a lot of effort, which is nothing special in the sequence of actions without end. I noticed about Villen, who dressed as Pop Star of 80. George Michael thinks in mind and joins the whole media spin. <br /> <br /> So, for the first time I trashed, but what was the head? If you're going to do this then why is not it really embarrassing and De Niro and Murphy have taken a great chance to do this.
