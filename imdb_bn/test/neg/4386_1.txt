This film was like collection of people from other movies and they really decided to create a bad movie. A girl from "The Cossy Show" was a child from "Detroit Rock City", who kissed the dog and bought the sausage "Sorority Boys" and there was something else. Well that's not a bad movie to myself, that's just something I've noticed. Hooker and French girl had the same thing with the statue and wrote these notes with 37 people and if they think they are mixed ... ... you tell it. And purse thing, that was just a little stupid. It's so bad that I've seen the movie in two parts and it's still made in 50 minutes. If you look at it and expect a movie like "van welder" or ... do not .......
