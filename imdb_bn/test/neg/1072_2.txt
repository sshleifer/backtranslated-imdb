Sincerely, Mr. Thaludi ... if you make a play movie in a high school settings after more than thirteen thirteen in school school and if you upgrade the timeframe and jump back ... if you do that you are using the same camera as "Elephant" device It can not use the same visual story which is next to a character, and the scenes are shown 3 times from different angles. You can not do it because it's hard to believe that it's such a punch rip. This gave anyone more than 5 ratings. <br /> <br /> where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years ago in this movie)) using school shooting as a focal point for his script (or to correct the shooting of the Column) 2:37 using teen suicide See the reviews that the shock value works. This is a very slowly story telling, many dramatic piano music going forward towards a finish that you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to have worked hard to be somewhat different from that section. So you've got a vague gay guy who works like a stoner / scatter, a violent lover-boy who can not cope with a brother and sister from a gay family, both of them fall into their own problems and the noses come here. <br /> <br /> You have also got one of the humiliating balmic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ... A man who blows his pants because of "2 uritha's syndrome", who has not heard of the invention, rather than the diapers rather than his pants Pisses and then change between new clothes and so every day! Wow, the harder the film tries as realistic as I have ever heard the most stupid thing. She got beaten in the toilet and is probably ashamed to do it, but she does not waste her nose's blood while passing wet pants and bloody noses in the whole school. The reality of the new era leads directly to the "twist" and the ultimate character, who can be suicides ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old "realistic" life shows pregnancy, teen pregnancy, bulimia, grade and appearance and your "Very realistic" is trying to be a parental pressure for parental pressure like daily soap). We see a girl that we will die, there is no reason for this movie. When he was talking with him when he is running out of room left (a thoughtful piano playing on bitidabliu biudabliu, saw that before somewhere ??). And it gets better ... Before throwing his wrist in the painful long scene of "yes" and "no", he asked 2 urethra-men, if he is okay, he laughs constantly and then he has a wrist-cut toilet with a school scissor. <br /> <br /> Now you've got a movie that is a complete rip off of Holli, it really fails with some unforeseen storytelling (the entire rape-material was very enjoyable) and people call it <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> I said, everything seems to add some pseudo-dramatic music, annoying stories and adding a shock thing on top and people think there's a big message here? I think Elephant has already gone astray, but that movie was original, although it is a clear rip-off here which has failed a lot. I have never seen a complete movie theft of my life ... and believe I've seen hundreds of horror films, so I know how much you can go. It's been given down roughly in all sections ... it's not realistic, it's stolen, its slow and all the ways I'm more conservative ... Another romantic suicide (Many give this point to this movie that makes me wonder if they're only Romeo See Juliet all day long because there are several movies that work on a clear non-romantic and more practical way of doing things) or this laugh Tax Setup ... Come on! I'm still trying to work if the urethra-guy or suicide itself is more unreal and ridiculous.
