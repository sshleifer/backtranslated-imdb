I was frustrated with the third picture of the "Death Wish" series and if you are not really bronze, then do not recommend it. He is one of his normal self, perhaps a little light-hearted than others; Seeing a week's movie on TV, the rest are good - the film has a bad production value of the A-team and I like the fun of a show like this at the party, but on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that even demands the latest Does not. The film takes a little while to run and finally when it ends, it goes out of control in a ridiculous manner. The plot is outside of an episode of "Highway to Humane" and Brunson looks like fish outside the fish with the cast of most senior citizens, and without the control of the gun, you are not satisfied with Bronson's retaliation against Taiwan. Bad guys Leave this and go to the 4th installment which I highly recommend.
