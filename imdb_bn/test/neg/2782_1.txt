When I rented this DVD I knew well that it could be one of the worst movies I ever made in my life. But it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen say it will put light on. I wonder if there are some legal measures that can be taken against people who have allowed this image to be produced. I mean, funding came from somewhere, someone had to borrow money to make it !! ?? <br /> <br /> I will mark different production values ​​directed towards the failure of this movie, but this image violates every production standard in the universe. I could not make it through the whole movie, because I started to become bizarre from the scary movies. I can not tell you how long the scenes were closed due to the fierce dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think my life has been permanently stained. If you have seen this movie before getting this warning, then you have to start thinking of starting a support group for poor people who see these Orthodox people.
