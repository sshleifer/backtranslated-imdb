Oh f * Hell cking, where should I start ... First of all; This show is simply another stupid American non-funny comedy which is a charming act and very poor humor. The American way of the sunny business makes the whole thing worse. How can I hear a smile, is not it still funny? Very stupid, huh? This show is for American people who have never heard that there are many fun, good and intelligent comedy - not just in Great Brighton, but also in America (for example Simpson). I can not easily understand that "Reba" is so good that the television has been running for a long time. It's nothing new to offer, it can (potentially) reduce viewers in many ways, and this is not just funny. There is so much bad rituals seen as "Reba", but why they wanted to run it here in Finland. In the few seconds of this horrible show, if my entire day is destroyed. Accept my word and believe me - this show has dared more donkeys than Americans "comedy". This is simply terrible. Make yourself a favor; Never sh * Do not guard this peace. <br /> <br /> I am commenting on those who make this language better. Thanks for your (potential) interest.
