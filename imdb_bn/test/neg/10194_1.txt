This movie is poorly played, badly written and played badly. The letters were all two-dimensional. It was a real amateur effort. The movie was fundamentalist Christian campaign. Christian characters are more sacrosanct than you, and they are compassionate or skeptical. The film was a genuinely suspicious character and a "spectacle" for an audience, which kept us very uncomfortable. I complained about the theater management and other movies were given free passes. I think another film about the same thing, "The Rapture," played Mimi Rogers, which was done very well and professionally. I will see again I watch "Rapture". If you come to "unknown" and do not like it, then I did not warn you.
