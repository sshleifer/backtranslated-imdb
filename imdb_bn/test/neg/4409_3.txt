How many giant trees you can watch in your lifetime? Well I'll go out of a limb and say. It's good to see the movie late at night, beer packs 12, close words and make conversation with you and your friends. <br /> <br /> In a Pacific, a young man was sentenced to death with "bad Americans". (It seems that his loving wife is sleeping with a doctor who is sleeping and has set him up, so Doc can be king.) He promises to return and retaliation. <br /> <br /> Americans come to shout the scientist hats before you shake a stick, "Tobanga come!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young man did the same as Tobanga, the monster of the walking tree. Yes his revenge is terrible (and this picture too). It seems that these natives can not move from the wood tree, so they quickly toss them and sink them to the mountains etc. Soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom. An axis or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> There are many common problems with this movie. Comedy Relief A Kakny Accent (Such as the film requires a comedy) An unpleasant woman. You want to die on her first face. Leading lady whiny.The leading people are a poor. Acting wood The dialogue is tough and Kathmandu Locals have the pronunciation of Brooklyn. The giant suite is pure giggles. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie but it's fun to watch. It gets only a strangely sunny 3. If your dog could rate it just a bit high but only if the trees were not there.
