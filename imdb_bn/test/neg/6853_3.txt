I have never been disappointed in the Kura≈°ova film, but perhaps this is the first one. "Dopelganj" I saw the worst from this director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Taran Films declares this ad as "the most horrific movie from Kiosi Kurosawa". What? The most horrific film from Kurosawa must be "Cairo". And if you feel this horror, for your surprise. This can not be classified as horror, or thriller. It's a drama, and that's a pretty bad one. Suddenly astonishing scenes were a lot of fun, and many plots are really confusing. And since it is Kurosawa, slow pacing. But it is so slow that you lose interest in 40 minutes and feel like doing something else. The thing that made me most annoyed was to use CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if executed with little care ... it can be a disaster. I think there is a scene description here that uses very little of CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that I can do is "Doppelgargar" it really works well. Kozi Yakusho gives a great performance as well as the rest cast. But it's pretty cool ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > It's a smart drama, a bad, bad effort. That's cute, but ... Well, there's a lot missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good acting.
