There are a lot of seriousness that I think is fun, it is not * * * <br /> <br /> A film. (Quiet dramatic music) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's too bad - it's a good, totally weird, Jackie Chan stunt-off-of-all. The women warrior is fully placed in its place of kick-butt and jackie. <br /> <br /> This Sunday afternoon you want to watch with some good friends - surrounded by Miski, ready to roar with laughter, have fun on the good son, fool the bad people and constantly imprison, "What?" When something completely strange happens. Great pleasure !!
