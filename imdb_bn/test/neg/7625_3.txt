Weird It is a TV movie, but rating the box rating and said that it does not have any movie on R.there which will qualify for R rating remotely. Apart from this, the film is very slow and dull. This meant that the idea was good, but nothing was done with the story. It just did not develop. It is silently unclear, and acting is actually quite good, better than film. I do not see it myself again, if ever Other movies have been dealt with in the same concept, which is better than that. I have not seen many Wes Crane films, so I really can not compare it to anyone else. Although for this movie, I think it is weak ideas and weakly executed. For me, I can not give more than 3/10 rating to Chilar
