Well, I do not know what to expect from 555. Actually I've never heard of it until a few months ago. But, as a collector of almost all kinds, I have guessed that I will go ahead and catch the sloppy 80's slash. <br /> <br /> The story must be working with an assassin who killed every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. The title is the third 5 ... nobody knows. However, at the start of the killings, the killers made fools in lazy places for young teenagers. He condemns the male and brutally murders the woman. After that, he earns the dead body for rape. Police believe that they are moving towards the killings but there is no idea what is actually happening. How do they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder some of these actors went to do something else. Three main actors made up of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. When I say sexy I'm getting annoying, she does not get as much as she is non-sexy Two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle doom. One of them included his part and another actress could leave the school of Shatna. The performance is so bad that it often forces you to lose interest in movies, thus you can almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing to hold this terrible movie together is some beautiful scenes. For a budget movie, the makers have to make special effects, which is still not very good. <br /> <br /> As long as you're like me and owns a terrible movie, I'll definitely recommend this movie steering. 4/10
