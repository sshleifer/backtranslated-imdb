I can not honestly believe that this is a sequel or a 1985 John Lennes classic comedy horror movie. I think you can not describe it as the original movie because the Bengal bone of the story steals the material from a set of London: An American tourist visited a famous European capital, he survived a Verobol attack by killing a colleague, he was a professional professor. Emphasis on sexual relations with someone (he pardons), he became violofole, his death He visited. And I read the previous line, I discovered that the fact that the story generally corresponds exactly looks exactly the same. There is a difference between how enjoyable and entertaining the London movie is <br /> <br /> There are no scenes with this Paris based movie that really stands out. No nude person is awake in the zoo that he is going to return home without any money or clothes, Nazivruvolov has no wonderful dream sequence and no spectacular measurements. Does the AAWIP try to be fun but there is something more embarrassing than the humorous fail? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott wanted someone to say that he got chewing gum in his pocket and not condom! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no cruelty involved in this suspicious following. You are really sorry for the fate and conflict of the playwright of London movies, here you feel that Andy is not much more than a cipher going through the literary motion of a script. A large number of plot holes are visible. This is the first time a Lunar Club has a genocide? If not, how many bodies have been broken by the press in the press worldwide? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See, it is quite painful that some curtuents were converted by CGI in the Weiroff conversion when it was achieved through some blue screen projection. I will not see Anthony Waller as a director who has completely destroyed the film because of the reliability of the CGI (The main problem with AAWIP is the Scrapplay, which saw the audience with a higher degree of 1981 film classic), but I have special effects on Rick Bucker type I liked the transformation used. Perhaps the budget is not stretched so far that it may have been supposed to be fair. But at the end of the day it is a fairly poor horror movie that does not need to be made and DG Sullair's very good entertainment
