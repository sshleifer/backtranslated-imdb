Anyone who trite such, clich√©, yet indeliberately discolored the idea that the comical movie could be concocted. The final 20 minutes of this picture is ridiculous glory! Six people dug enough trenches in 10 minutes and stirred the runway with petrol for $ 747, when an estimated 'head' was 747 in the 747 meter crosswhite fully - this is why the movie is called the wrong landing page of the crash landing ... <<br /> <br /> Some conversations were similar to the sandpaper in my ears, and the only aspect of this movie to save for 1 is a bod inside the screen There was only one direction to fill the screen. The movie is not merge for this unfortunate excuse, but my mute button has finally received a workout. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk! 10 out of 2
