This movie was awesome ... there was absolutely nothing to do with the Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very confusing because it showed a scarecrow and a sketch, which did not appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was a quarrel with random scenes at the beginning, most of which did not have anything to do with the movie except that it shows no man's mental ... but very good ... <br /> <br /> First After a 10 minute picture, only one person is looking for the character of his girls. When the daughters die two years ago, they meet women when it is vaguely interesting. But it's its dimensions. <br /> <br /> And why, I can ask, what is the movie rated now? There were two drops of blood and 4 capsules. And how to get it a video shop on the earth ?? This movie has been played badly, badly illustrated, badly written, and widely executed extensively.
