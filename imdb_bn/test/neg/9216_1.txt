Remember to see me this year ago, it was a potentially promising start with a fun commitment, but then it quickly degenerated into nonsense fast. The effort to add to the unexpected character, drama and excitement has failed, and a bit of simple philosophy also, all culminating in a terrible end. <br /> <br /> Just, it's trash. Before I can see the film of this TV, I do not think there will be any movie that I have seen "bad" that I have seen, but after seeing it, I knew that if someone asked me from then on Which one I saw the worst movie, I could say without hesitation - "second coming". Avoid <br /> <br />
