I can not believe the amount of critics who are appreciated as realistic. I'm one million miles from an expert, and I'm not going to climb the mountain; But very basic knowledge is found on reading Thin Air, and on seeing Everest Baid Theat and several other Everest docs, it is understood that it has become more ridiculous in this movie. There are some good climbing footage in the beginning; And when the leader of the millionaire mission asked at the beginning of the movie, "Do you have more than 8000 meters experience?", I hope this is a wonderful and perfect man-versus Nature ODC hope. Instead you have a bunch of hikes with a mountain zoom up with nolimatization; Climb with goggles in full sun, and they are sometimes breathed out to perform the miracle feats of consolation. The Summit only proposed little fatigue, such as accentuate the physical achievement of climbing a giant peak dramatically, almost as a postought. If you do not have any idea about mountaineering, give it a look: be prepared for some claude heroes (though not much more than any other variable flickr) and a clinched result. I have been developing a minor bliss with the high mountain and were looking forward to watching K2; But other than some amazing scenery, it was frustrating because it was moved away from reality. I can imagine some experts involved in making this film, but then it is easily overlooked following the heroic and sadly fantasy tales. Also, if you say something like a tight, you say "Welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
