Jimmy Durante's MGM Holdford throws a big team for everyone in Hollywood. No bigger scenes are seen - we got the Three Stog, Laurel and Hardy, Durant and Loop Balls. I did not recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The movie contains annoying unfunny joke and some really awesome songs and danceography. The only thing to save it from the overall disaster is the "Battle" with the Loopel and Hardy Loop Valves, and an extraordinary color cartoon named "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that makes this movie a huge development. Otherwise, the film is a magnificent bore. There is no director's credit - what's that you say?
