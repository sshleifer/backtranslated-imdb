This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is it a comedy, which is not funny, but it is made very badly from the top side with unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" of their fiction language are simply annoying and it has confused me so much that they have touched each other in the genescence. But the worst of all the dirty incidents is the mention of Germany's history, and in order to show the sensitive point of view of "heroes", there is an inexplicable effort to appeal to this film, which shows how Eric and Stefan show a mental illness to the sick woman. Their "delightful" lifestyle (!). But Michael Michael "Bulli" did not expect anything better than Harbig, he did not even create two fun TV shows, it's not a funny western movie and almost funny SF-comedy film. But Iraq and Stefan were a bit better with some of their study-up programs. The only good thing about me for the movie is Alexander Nayell, who is very beautiful to me.
