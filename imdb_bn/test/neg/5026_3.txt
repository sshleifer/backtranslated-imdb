Let me state this right from the beginning. I do not hate this show. I actually liked several aspects. Actually, when I first started looking at it, I quickly got hooked. I just started to come out of the whole "Stereotype for anime baby", and the mature elements of the program made me curious. Unfortunately, through a whole series and a few films, I can say that my overall nature has changed, and it almost all fall into "bad" anime plagues. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. To the end, only one friend and I still see and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain the plot for you. If you do not want to know, you can skip this paragraph. Kamiom is a high school student, who one day falls in love with a magical love near his family's mausoleum. Then the skin came out, at that time, in Japan the feudal era came. He meets many other characters and they constitute five or more companionship groups, who begin the journey in revenge / justice / character.) Overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of sacred jewelry shard, which will increase the power of the giants using it. <br /> <br /> There are many, although many stories and tales arcs, there is not enough near material capture of 167 episodes. The only story that is striking enough to watch is still the yarn (seven bands). After half the mark in the series or even earlier, it has become painfully evident that the plot has been frozen and instead of making the series, there will be dozens and a few fillers episodes in place. <br /> <br /> These episodes can not have any impact on the story and very rarely in the characters. In some cases, some characters that had an important role in the story would eventually disappear for dozens of episodes. Many follow the same cookie cutter patterns as the same story before episode. Air-scar shoots at Inuyasha Enemy. Windscar deflects. Gasp in the characters horror The enemy has got out of the bar. Kakom spent three episodes and tried to kill the enemies before the fire was set on fire for him. <br /> <br /> ** The main speaker: the conclusion will be revealed ** The lack of any conclusions seems to have diminished you 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** Main spinner ** ** <br /> <br /> Animation itself is average, and in some cases nice. Even the revisioned animation cells plug most action scenes and when it is clear that the exact same stone crosses the character five or six times in the row, it is very difficult to ignore. <br /> <br /> While the bright side, all the characters were very well developed and romances in some of the characters were really captivating. Also, the character designs (transparency) were bright and especially I saw that with the best seven bands. There are certainly no lack of cosplay opportunities here. Still, I feel optimistic that a character will die so there will be some kind of movement in the plot. And among the characters, humor in the show is used several times. A special joke (sit-in) is found in the first five episodes and you can expect it to be used again and again for 16 episodes. <br /> <br /> While the show has some good aspects and why it is easy to follow a huge, the series is influenced by helpless fan girls who drool on Sesshomiru and Inuyasha. <br /> <br /> The following line: Check-out is certainly sure, but the whole series worthless. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for some. But then, it simply becomes dull and tedious. While watching a TV show, it should not be considered a joke, but in any case this series only performs it. Do not expect too much from "Inuyasha", because you just feel frustrated.
