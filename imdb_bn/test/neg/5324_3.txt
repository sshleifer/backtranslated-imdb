Before reading the book, I actually saw the movie. When I saw the movie, I got annoyed because I was surprised that Dean Quentz made such a bad book / movie. The film was confusing and there was no flow, it was sticky and forced me to throw a rock on TV. I could not connect to letters, so I'm not worried about what happened to them (Naturally I love letters because I can relate to their personality or problems). Then I read the book and liked it. I often read the book again, and collecting movie dust. I hope someone will create the Quantz film following the plot of his book, then the films will not get so much suction. Do not watch this movie if you do not need to earn money!
