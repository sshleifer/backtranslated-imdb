I watched this movie shortly after watching the moon light and the Valentino with Elizabeth Parks, Gwynth Platro, Huley Goldberg and Catley Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. They both have great casts and good acting. Both of them have stock letters of sisters who are very different, an offender midwife, a female friend / believer, a mentally unavailable father, a dead mother and a wonderful lover. Characters in both films experience life-changing perceptions and both films enjoy all kind of tenderness in 'conquering love'. They add little headline to both the black underwear with Cameron Diaz and with the naked partial back of Gonyith Paltrow. <br /> <br /> Both films seem to be compiled, such as the authors of the authors research the market and say, "Well, there is a market of stories about the relationship between women, so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offending stepmother ?? " In other words, rather than the drama originating from the relationship, the relationship is invented to adapt to the dramatic situation. It seems to emphasize that the letters do not seem to be true, the relationship is incredible. <br /> <br /> The solution to excitement in the characters expresses a completely rage with simplicity, which makes everyone feel warm and vague. After sometime It's not just real. Romantic fantasy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sidel Feller is so hard to believe that the father will be with him or even marry her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you like Munn√≠lite and Valentino, you probably want her shoes to be good. Both enjoyable performance, in fact, are the way out of the narrow feeling of actors scripts which bring depth in their part.
