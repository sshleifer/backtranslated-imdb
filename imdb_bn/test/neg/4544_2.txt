Knitting! Very annoying, and they probably shot in black and white, it was so colorful. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the text of the text explaining the crozenics and asking whether God or the devil is behind him. There are some protests outside of a chronic lab. Some people loot a bank, and many robbers and gunmen shot. A robber's father (I think) arranges to frozen his son. In addition to knowing how visually scenes are visible to us starting from the scene, there are many jumping in the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a power outage, and frozen people get hit by electricity and they come up as zombies. They all dressed like silver melon and made their skin dark green and fork (no idea why they seem so bad - they are not frozen their appearance), and their silver eyes. They often kill people, sometimes loot like a dead body, and sometimes they continue like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair shows occasionally every time, I'm not really sure. I think his character works in the Krianjics lab, but he is not very important for the plot, and his role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some writing frames that tells us what happened next letter, which is pretty stupid.
