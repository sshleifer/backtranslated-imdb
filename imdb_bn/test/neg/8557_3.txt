Madness Edge is a story about a woman in the 1800s who handles the dirty Scotsman who can not keep her pants in her penis. He only happens to be against the rape of small sisters and to kill him, but constantly say that it is an accident. It makes his wife crazy, she is confused and she falls because she loves George very much. <br /> <br /> I said, such things have already been done. It is Canadian and it is rarely a budget produced in the budget that is associated with fewer known actors (except for a child in a lace, yes, he is in it). I do not know whether it's going to Oscars Bate, but it was sure as hell boring. And it's based on a 40 page short story. Half of the short story is included in this glance and I'm glad. Otherwise, I'd like to die. Unfortunately, I had to see it in my media fundamental classes, and I had an assignment. Read the short story and compare the flick and contrast of stories. Boring <br /> <br /> You know, it's hard to answer movie questions if you do not like the movie. Ah well, I hope this is the last type I allocate and get my class. Annie Heeron was completely hot for her price, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked her nude part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Boring, Oscar bat performance and graphic sex ..Plus nudity.
