I will be picking this time and time again in the rented shop, I wonder if it will give a shot. Today I broke and it gave a cyclone, and probably I should not have. <br /> <br /> While the author / director paid tribute to this picture, it was far less compelling. Characters, when you wanted to feel for them, you did not have enough development or depth to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual blasts were tired - fast I do not think sex in movies, and I do not think of malicious characters, but being a "bad" girl does not mean that you are prone to ask people randomly for sexual tension. After what had happened to the characters, I became bored, and towards the last episode, quickly, some exciting ... and nothing could be delivered. The people of the story eventually feel forced and unreasonable, and have not been played correctly. If they had some pain there, I would have been interested. It should have been a subject of suspense / drama film, and the whole "red right hand" and should be stuck in the title of "John Good's Wife" instead of a cover-like cover. Hell ... This should be the suspense, time. <br /> <br /> Any other way ... See it when it's not on television in a snow day or the last night. Although I was not as big as I expected, I would go for it on some informatories.
