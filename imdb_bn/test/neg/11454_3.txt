Like many movies in the early days, Simron should definitely see more of its historical interest than recreational entertainment. Best Actor Nominated Leader Richard Dix's actress Hammy may be forgiven as a proponent of the silent-film school acting. However, even giving the benefits of suspicion, Siemann plays a dramatic shape in a dramatic shape. This is an unfinished figure that connects the non-related sequence from an obsolete sequence to a slightly dramatic effect. Unexpectedly, the film is two hours and four minutes; Seems like four hours when you're watching it. Unless you want to see each of the best photo winners or have a strong interest in the primary words, there is no reason to waste your time. In my opinion, Simron is the worst choice for the best picture in the Academy's history and this award will go to City Lights or Little Sears. Simron is rarely remembered today, and if you do not want to win the Oscars, then you have to remember.
