Let's face it, this is a very bad movie. However, if you're ready to be fun, you can survive with the experience. Well, you scream very hard. African jungle makes fun of a doped way. <<br /> <br /> Tom Conway (who mostly wakes up the film with Funkie Chapu) is becoming "perfect" using local witch doctors and crazy science. It looks like a wind that has been drunk in six weeks and a dress in the dress. Ugly kind is being. But it will not be killed for him because he is using a good girl as his subject. She needs a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two small hunks in search of African gold. The syllabus for MS English should have been at the top of the search list. He is a bad girl and everyone lets him know the appropriate performance of a junior high school game. Mac "Touch" Connors White Guide English and Fuller Con are leading leading campaigns. <br /> <br /> English and Conway finally saw and made it a match made in hell. He is the perfect thing b make his Voodoo creature because he will do something to achieve what he wants (some stress). You do something to stop the pain of this movie right now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What kind of dead animals are trying to find out? He thinks that if he pulled down enough on his eyes, someone would recognize him. <br /> <br /> Really bad movie.
