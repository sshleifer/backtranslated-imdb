"Cover Girl" is an extraordinary WWII musical that is not absolutely memorable, save for its signature song, "Long Ago and Far Away." Before the genre Kelly really hit her artistic pace, the film came out and there is evidence of its growing talent, but in most cases she plays side by side with Rita Hayorth. And there are problems. Rita Hayworth is fantastic, that there is no doubt about that. But he does not simply attend a mandatory screen. I always wanted to choose myself more than myself, and this movie is no exception. She is not just a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. She is looking good, there are some vapid about her, and this movie suffers due to it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
