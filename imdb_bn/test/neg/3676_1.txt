This movie is a total draw. I love Wall Kilmer and this year was very surprised by the "Felon" (a good movie!). The whole DVD box is confusing. Vile Killer is in the movie for about 2 minutes as one of the main figures in this movie. Even the essence behind the DVD is not entirely true. This could be a good movie, but the direction was horrible and the plot was thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is horrible, you can sit back and laugh at it. Although this picture is so bad and annoying I actually fell asleep (which I never did during a movie). Avoid all costs!
