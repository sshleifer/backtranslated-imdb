I recently watched this movie, and I said to myself: "This movie is bad!" William Shatana is a great actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> Just acting is not bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad story that is called a plot! I started really because I was really bad, where Kirk and McCokou taught that "Row, row, your boat rows" how to sing <br /> <br /> <br /> What about my William Shatner? Is there anything? I can not. But when it comes to being a manager, he breathes! This photo is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But the Star Trek series is the worst! <br /> <br /> I noticed that it was not coming back after coming back to another series of this series. After this incident, they did not want to run another film again! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sells! <br /> <br /> 2/10
