"Men√©s" is not funny. It tries hard - it is very difficult. But rarely brings a smile. Have no acting, just mugging One of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on her whole movie. Suspended as acting less gifted Wayans brother, the film wrote and produced they were completely blind in their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Menace consists of a kinky series, a joke skits. The location can be seen a mile away, but you will have to wait until all of it is visible. Here's no zippy one liners or snappy dialogue. Just another scene after another building up to the trick. The joke is the kids themselves. Loc Dog (one with Perma-Grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she ... breathes and then she likes her nose and wait for her (remember that you always w-i-i-t) remote! Is that funny? The boys of ten years old may find it interesting because they have not heard jokes long ago. Alternatively, if you see movies completely drunk or rocky, you will be able to follow and even find it fun. Without the challenge, the level of the movie will become drunk enough to reduce your mental state.
