I would say it, this is the first movie I'm reviewing here I did not end the watching. I mean, "I am continuing!" In the end, I'm not too objectionable to see things, 'The Ballad of the Saad Cafe' found no match with the viewer. Venacea Redgrave has acted as a strange woman in the city. Like things to walk through the river with the whole cloth. Anyway, a long lost relative comes to visit, he is a mood and? Well, I've got so far. I was not even bothered to wait for Michael Carrine, because I was already intelligent with a combination of slow script and had to deal with a mood in a dramatic role. I call this coffee table movie. Movies that appeal to you only a few, but others only live.
