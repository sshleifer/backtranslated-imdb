Mr. Brenta has wondered if this film was made by the Dragon Z-TV series but it was made. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a Hong Kong Actual Action Movie based on the first episode of Japan's original cartoon (which was based on a comic book series). And I do not really know whether it was produced under the license of the Dragon Manufacturer ... <br /> <br /> The story of the monkey-boy with special power is an ancient story known around the world (in Japan, Sonaku in this story, China, it is Sanvukong; it is Sonagong in Korea;) and the story of Dragonball can do much more with that story. However, I said, this movie was based on the first episode of the Dragonball series (which followed Dragon J Z, although I think the US version had a different aircraft sequence). And all the sex scenes were included in the original cartoon series too (it was overwhelmingly over and without a strong exception!), But due to your comments I think they were completely removed in American Dubbing. <br /> <br /> However, I agree with you about the uploading of the movie with you and the poor about this adaptation of the original cartoon. But maybe because of that nobody can see it ...
