Mario Raksevic is the only user of Europe who has posted a comment so far and has added the main points of the film. Another solid film in UK shopping again. I had to go through "midnight video" which had Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought it on order, and its title is just a title in SKR30. <br /> <br /> Many people run under "solicitors" depending on when and where this movie is in the market. Previously bought "The Blosser Lead the Dance" (which you will find when searching for Imdb under "Public" and input "Crista Nell"). The actor who counted on his private island in the next film, was dubbed from him, an unknown sorrow in Italian English, and an actor with rather tired voices. When I heard this same word drowning the English soundtrack, I was so happy that the police inspector, who is investigating the death of the slain prostitute in this film. Of course, my choice was to see outing another by D. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A smell of this picture - SLEAZE, gives a taste in the words (but artistic sled) which gives a taste of the word. The default contributor liked this movie, but the low ratings suggested other Emdab fans without explaining "wheres and whyfores". Personally I have thought that there are many subheads and the main story and the relationships of these subordinate characters are not enough to develop the central plot and their screen characters. A professional film editor was also very much needed because most of the scenes continued for a long time, creating their point, so that the movies drag them to places; For example dance scenes of transvestite. Cristista is seen in a squat scene with the Nail Client, but this is also a diverse picture and I want more from her, director and screen. <br /> <br /> I love the political flaw shown in old movies (30 years from its creation), such as office smoking and some letters react to each other in the office! I would suggest 4/10 as a true rating and I've rewarded it like this.
