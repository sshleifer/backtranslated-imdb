Wow - this movie was really bad! Do you talk about formula, usually movie plot? While watching this movie my head was repeatedly hit by my brick wall. Trying to cool the change but failed. The plot ended, where we found that the bad guy was unexpected, but he did not have much knowledge until his stubbornness. Yet ... the amount of graffiti in this movie does not help. Need all the pictures? My last complaint is about the movie's share. PD is really a lone officer to find an unlisted warehouse, subway tunnel, or a body where the perp position is unknown? And ultimately romance will happen suddenly? The writer is trying to fit every Hollywood clip that is. Do not waste your time watching this piece sometime.
