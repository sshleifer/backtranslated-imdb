I bought this movie because I wanted to donate to Operation Smile, based on this charity ... but I could see the movie's writing very strange. It does not really focus on the same organization as the Operation Smile or Sunny Train, and their hard efforts to suffer the children who are born with facial deformities in Third World countries. No, it is an American teenage volunteer kitty, who focuses on life in Malibu, California, a life of a "privilege", a mother who takes her to a doctor so that she gets birth control goals before sleeping with her boyfriend. What should this birth control be, the audience shirk? In 2005 If I was more surprised, in 2005, Malibachha was not on the birth control, even if she was, then who else thinks? Kitty Contesting is the character of Linen in China, a face-to-face girl who missed the chance of last year to get an operation and does not want this year. The character is not written in such a way that the audience can really recognize, alone understand the motivation of the girl. On the other hand, the actors did enough work to try this bad hand that wrote this ridiculous script. Lynn's father was the gentleman's best actor, though most of his conversations were in Chinese and subtitles. Operation Smile deserves to be honored by much better movies than this!
