This movie was really bad, plain and simple. How wonderful is a movie like this gets me a wonderful release. <br /> <br /> This is a decent idea, but it was not just out of meat. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "Dinosaur 3D" Point-to-click adventure Demo I mean, I saw cut-scenes in console games compared to 2000. I mean, the hack ... the main grave Ryder T-Rex looked better than this. <Br / > <br /> The kid monkey was ridiculous. I thought they were "killer inst Nights ". I have now seen a good shock-doll monster that I think. <br /> <br /> You know, there is a ton of TV production that is better than a movie like Scifi Channel" The Burning "is how to get so little listeners, but" this is easy to make 4 kidas "is this load open out? I do not care if it's Ray Bradbury's story.Lameeeee
