The plot here is simple. The son of the country, Lem (Farrel), goes to the town to sell wheat crops, falls in love with the waitress (Duncan) and falls in love with her, her neighbors father and woman bring a group of hungry crops to her house. What they wanted and they have here and men here what they shade. The restaurant runs in two tall order set, apologized, consume the first half-hour and is neutrally paced. Lem is so weak that he permits his father to offend his wife, who has proposed to Mac (Richard Alexander), who is going to meet with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good thing in this tedious potboiler, whose insight and lack of beauty in the movie we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbones, so we will be transformed into "real man" (Mac) to take Kate away from all. With the skewed sympathy of the audience, the film loses its descriptive progress. At the end of the film Father's transformation is unreal and incredible, it is made for an unused solidarity. For this photo star and director only - the general audience is not required to be disturbed.
