When I went to see this movie, it was a compulsory choice because my original purpose was sold. Then what was horrible terrorism, this movie is so bad I can bear it The story is notable, a gay goalkeeper creates a gay football team to play against his old straight-side - while discovering his sexual orientation - has given him tough times. Loaded with vulnerable old and exaggeration clichés gays, thin skeptics perfectly match inane dialogue ... It's absolutely wonderful that actors such as dietmar bär or charly hubner waste their talents and time on such imitation. 1/10
