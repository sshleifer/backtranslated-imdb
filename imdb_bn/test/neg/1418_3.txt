The main foundation of this movie, a comedian talk show host that became independent of the president for independence, is fun, entertaining, bright and even a little inspirational. (Thinking about the West Wing controversy when Tom Dobbs left his position, Steven Colbert had thought of proclaiming his candidacy, a good time). The first 15-20 minutes of this movie are very funny, especially debate. When he is finally elected, it is a sad reason that is due to computer fault, you want him to justify victory (though it is unreal.) <br /> <br /> But after that the movie is completely sealed happens. I thought we would get a great movie like 'Dave' (1993), where we can see how a comedian actually operates in the country. Instead, a thriller from the movie comedy, romantic comedy and active from a play and not any good. The computer conflict becomes the main story, which really sucks. The boy is frustrating. I give it 3 stars only for the premiere and I really start to start the film without closing it, which is usually good things with me.
