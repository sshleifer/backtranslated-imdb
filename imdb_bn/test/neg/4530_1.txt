Almost the whole few of the audience, rarely sitting in silence through almost complete film with chocolate. Maxwell Smart's character was so inconsistent, I think the whip-lined ashed. When it is convenient for the plot, smart behaves as a spy. At other times, he works like a dishonest. They lift many classic lines from the television series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "It's Missed by Lot" is interesting, if it is a conversation with Braggodoco tried by a failed failure - but it becomes ridiculous to say the qualifying thing. To a lesser degree, other characters go from dynamic cartoon to dynamic speed of inability. Chief villain Siegfried seemed intelligent, but he decided that no enemy would be so fooled. Nevertheless, a movie character is disabled as this mess writer. I am very disappointed that many IMDB users think it was good.
