"You know - I'm in some of the cities where the girls were not all beautiful, I'm actually in some cities where they are very ugly but for the first time I'm in a town where there is no girl." I'm sure fans of the great class think That word is Vine ... the true seven (from the first film) ... <br /> <br /> Now I I want him to repeat the phrase here You know - I've seen some movies where the plot is not good at all. Actually, I've seen some movies where the plots are terrible, but for the first time in my life I have not seen a plot in the film. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my above statement is slightly upstairs but it is true ... how anyone can call this conspiracy in this movie. Bad guy (Oh, do not ask me to give you your name, because I do not remember and he does not have a name that is named Calver's name and the character is unforgettable ...) The name is trying to build his church, his late boys were killed in some battles, and this is bad People are abducting the poor villagers to force them to build the church ... <br /> <br /> How many churches should have to grow up first, hundreds of villagers have to build it ... Are some Egyptian pyramids or something? But okay, let's stop here about the plot and the completely forgotten character of a bad guy here and say something about the self itself ... <br /> <br /> Yule Brenner's good old Chris, always calm, always silent Less spoken but the talk has gone (unfortunately). Oh no ... he was as calm as he was ... But now, his peace is so fake that you will not buy it. (Imagine, he is showing a good old friend Chico, who needs to be retrieved after many years and there are only a few "hi, hello" and even handshakes (as long as I think). In fact, it shows more than two internet chats Like meeting with strangers, then meet with Chris and Chico. It looks more like "New Chris" Robocop, or Terminator, but our Priy Intelligent fast ... <br /> <br /> I will not talk about other characters here, there's just no one ... (Imagine that the powerful actors like Yule Brenner forget so badly, then what will be the other characters like) br /> <br /> Still trying to do something we have a background story for each of them ... for example, a woman's favorite person, the second is a man with a woman whose wife has been raped. Law and Indians killed him and since then he is killing everyone and everything is going ... but these characters are not making any ignorance or none of them can take your heart. <br /> <br /> I think I am small I was a child and when I was in the first film Orlee (Charles Branson's character) I was crying. Here, I just do not care for everyone ... even if all of them crew in the film, but I do not care too much ... <br /> <br /> So, please Go and see this movie ... I recommend it, because after this there will be no more chance to see anything worse.
