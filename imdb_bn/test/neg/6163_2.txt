An American boy commits suicide, goes to Paris, and then invents himself to be an artist and returns to the state so that he can fix something with his former friends. <br /> <br /> I think people are rating this movie so much that all fans of X-Files, although it does not have an alliance or serial killer. Do not be fooled, this movie is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is incompatible, does not explain why people are doing or why. When you do not get an explanation, it does not fit that story that went before. It is what you bore. For all acting talent in the film, it's not just interesting. I'm surprised when the sex-addicted Duchovny is going to bang someone the entire movie. Maybe he was behind this scene; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrong to start with. Despite a big secret mention in the first few minutes, there are no particular interesting or frustrating revelations. It's just a guy who thinks his life as attractive to you. <br /> <br /> I saw that Duvovini wrote the script within a week after seeing the insignificance, it is quite credible. The man can work, there is no doubt, but the writing and guidance must certainly not exceed his talent. <br /> <br /> Why does this self-invention make this story green in Hollywood? I discovered myself in the morning in the shower but I did not bother about making a movie about it. Although the mine would probably be better than this one; At least some nudity will happen.
