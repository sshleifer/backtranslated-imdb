Possible spyla alert, although there is not much to hide in this movie. I did not see the first movie in Project 2. I do not think I missed a lot. Project A Part II, which I have seen, is not one of the worst Jackie Chan films (yes worse than 'Fantasy Mission Force'), this film is one of the world's most unexpected films. It's okay with the 'Plan 9 Out of Space' on the Sleep Solution Scale. The plot has been curved and the cat's 50 feet ball has hit the ball and finally went to the dead. If you can call it 'Happiness', it seems as if it is written by a boring high school fridgeman, who will tell him that he is not so funny, his link is determined to find humor. And this movie is painfully bad. Fugitive Jackie Chan has been appointed as the Navy Officer appointed by the police force, which can surround 'all known criminals'. He round them up in the first half hour of the movie, and I pray for a quick ending which I do not get. I do not have a source why the movie disturbs the progress from this point. The film fails to weaken so much in an effort, a plot and humorous effort, and they show carrot as a comedic genius. Kung Fu Lam in this movie, and forgot. Kung Fu is good about 3 kids in that movie. Project A Part II is not an action movie and no Kung Fu movie, but it is totally waste of Jackie Chan and Maggie Choong's anticipation, which makes these films the world's best. When Jackie Chan escaped from certain deaths repeatedly, I entered Blair Witch mode and asked, 'Now he is dead, so can the film end? `. For example, this film is ridiculous: for example, Jackie Chan is handed over to other people. A gang of pirates (which does not show anything like pirates) threw an axis into the jackie. Do Jackie have a grab of virtual axes and break chains on the hammer? No! You see that the 'smiling' will be wasted handed to her to others. If you have a friend who can smile at all, I encourage you to see this movie with him, and they will not be able to see it outside of this movie. If you are uncertain then this movie is sure to make you sleepy. Do not work heavy machinery when watching a part II of the plan. Possible side effects include death by headache, retinal strain, and irritability. 0/9 stars
