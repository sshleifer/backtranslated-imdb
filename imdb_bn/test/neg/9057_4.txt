I do not hate this one. I just could not cope with the story. It does not really grab me. Michael Man is a very good manager but I have to agree with his approach. I am a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some of the projects he's in is very nasty but his acting is bright. My favorite Daniel Day Lewis films are blood and will be a New York gang. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked about this and it was a musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. All thats about me though I liked it. This image has a high vote as well as a bit random. I can see that a few people like it but the total rating is not enough for 7.8. <br /> <br /> If I miss this movie then I will vote much more for this. So I guess you'll see it and make your own opinion in your thoughts. I really did not like it ............................. 4/10 .............. J. D. Sitton
