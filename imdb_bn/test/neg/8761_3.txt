The "revenge of the zombies" is a commendable weak and barely passable junk effort. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Travel to Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Wartington, (Murish Hugo) said that a friend died. Local Dr. In the interview with Von Alterman (John Carradine) he repeated the idea that he died mysteriously. While they were there, they realized that there are zombies in this help, dead rebels dead, those who are bidding their masters. After breaking the bodies, he revealed that he was using animals in various experiments and tried to stop him before it was too late. <br /> <br /> Good News: Here's a little right. It's easy to open, it's got a lot of great marks for it. Where it begins, the decorated silhouettes are published in all ways in the dark, it works wonders for both its mystery and the great image. A really big scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and vague shot. These are all done here before opening credits and are a fun sight. The middle scene where the creature inside the coffin reawakens is quite cool and looks really great. The last big positive is really fun ending. With the end of the memorable feeling of so many universal efforts, it fits into that style. From the real step involved in rebuilding a fireplace to the swimming step, it's a fun and really works with others to really implement its real positive characteristics. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There is only one couple of errors, but they are the main ones. The first is the main annoyance of the film from inactivity. There is almost nothing happening here, mainly because of the tendency to talk instead of doing something else. Junkies have only rare scenes, but there is nothing that keeps any step in the film. This is not an easy task, and that's what the film hurts. It rarely creates a scene that takes interest and sometimes it actually takes a lot longer than it does. The last error in the picture is a meritorious excuse for zombies. Getting no fear from these creatures who used to hire more modern will be a difficult time, and they really serve only different scenes. This does not behave as a threat to the zombies here, making them even less awesome. Little screen-time, nature of nonthrittin and non-modern behavior from this zombie really destroy it. This image really hit. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: something bad to see with bad bodies and rarely, it's a weird endeavor here. Those who used modern zombies will look very interested in it and will come out of it like this, only classical fans are advised to take a shot. <br /> <br /> Today's Ratings-PG: Light Violence
