A wicked thriller that a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren), only to prevent their activities against them. The attractive compound can render a good movie, but it is only tall and portable. Boring with annoying completion, at least say. Mrs Miron tried to give some dignity to this muffer, but she too - a good actress, doubt in it - can keep the garbage saved. I give this a 4 (four) one.
