We will never tell the truth about 11/11. And this shoddy movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently saw a YouTube report claiming that there was no plane involved in the destruction of the Twin Tower; All news programs were supposedly provided with the same-angle shots of towers from a mysterious source (probably the Gobmint?), And at that moment the CGI plans were replaced by real-life MISSSILES which actually hit the towers .... <br /> <br /> This is a compulsory video and even though I'm not theoco conspiracy theoretical, yet I'm still not convinced myself that On that day, if anything, did the plane hit rakrta (Towers, syankabhila Field, the Pentagon) - because no plane wreckage was found. (And what about the infamous "black box"? No one has been restored.) More than one million other theories, in large quantities, all of them float a small fantasy of truth into the ocean of compromise. In the 9/11 commission report, before you can find real or valuable things, you will be sinking in the baggage, a horse-drawn picture that is trying to close the base doors after all the horses and jihadis have fled. <br /> <br /> Writer-director, Leg Scott, apparently wanted to illuminate the audience of a relevant American citizen who could publish the 560-page report. Actor like a man like David Duchowy, who looks like a guillotine, plays a role in his film, but he is a Russell Crowe and another person who feels that I am sure that he is working hard to make a goosehead. . It will help if its camera operator does not have Parkinson; If the light director was not trying to save electricity; This will help if its editor does not have an Attention Deficit Disorder or if the soundtrack is not unreasonable in the new world; And looping should probably be inserted when people actually move their faces. <br /> <br /> We can not call this promotion. It's so funny. And funny, I mean unexpected. <br /> <br /> You can not shrink this complex for two hours in a film, but Leigh Scott is still trying, whatever sexy catch-phrases we grew up with, bin Laden's attack, buying weapons from Somalia, Iraq With the non-aggression agreement, flying school, Musawi, mass destruction weapon ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: We know it is all past, so every discussion is related Oyenda companies have in common with each other, and everything is clear conversation with fake haindasaitera bound. Everything in the opposite reverse engineer is properly mentioned, so that we see our heads wondering how the government of these branches failed. <br /> <br /> A funny question to beat a lubricious bibo. A guy with his face tomato sauce. Now - that most people will consider it as torture without considering a turn-on. <br /> <br /> Tagline is: "What if the attack can be closed?" The calculation of this film - and, we guess, according to the commission report - the CIA and other underground companies were not ready to hold Bin Laden. Everyone involved in the "terrorism" report (have you actually read this report?) So we are so concerned that we want to impose them on their bad performance. <br /> <br /> The whole story has become so deep that after 9/11, Neglected Kush Clan fooled the barbarous words on the American people. We now know that there was no change or achievement of holding bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks - the wheel was running with or without the Taliban, which involved a possible picture of the miserable imagination to unite against a common enemy of America. . Unlike popular belief, "stars" do not "attack us" As Ron Paul tried to explain clearly, it was an incident in the Middle East BlackBack - "They" were so ill in America that they started the "here" war "They are here" Although George W. likes to talk strangely down, "We're fighting with them there, so we do not have to fight them here", actually "because we're there, the war has been brought here." <br /> <br /> 9 / 11 attacks were not so much about the complex plans of the terrorists, because of the total negligence of the Bush administration, we know (except for the investigation of the commissions) since all Intel was from Clinton administration; Information about terrorist cells to reach their intentions because of critical mass and chaos. But oil idiot of Texas, who refused to read his daily briefing, and instead of spending extra days working on it, wanted to leave his crawford farm vacation, he canceled the oath of taking oath to protect the American people. And then, who called himself the President, because of his negligence, for the second attack against his own stupid deposed countrymen, the United States was stripped of the American constitution as a political hammer and took America to a fake war. Lied (WMD), a country with which nothing was to do with the 9/11 attacks. Curiously, the film is never too close to Kush Clan, no opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott Scott wants to remain neutral. Tell them to rape and rape thousands of people in a militant war against terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> From pure restraint I realized I was watching this DVD when my Bush was lying. Thousands have died. T-shirt.
