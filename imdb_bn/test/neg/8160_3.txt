"San Francisco, oh you have evicted the city wonderfully, thank you, God, for destroying it, and making bricks on our joint head, and humble to make your innocent, obedient sheep a fool of thousands, O Lord, so kind in your heavenly way. .. "This should be the song for this song, for the inspiration and the complete silly movie title song. <br /> <br /> The movie is good enough, Gable invented a Cinderella. Very annoying but acclaimed operatic voice, and he shoots stardom soon. There is a lot of problem with our Cindereller that he played by Janet McDonald, who, if at all times and 30 glitzy feeds are seen, "it takes time", he realizes that he is ugly. However, playing this role is very ugly. Yet Gable and everyone else fawn here everyone else if he had some extraordinary beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is completely modest, healthy, innocent, loving, kind and generous God - enough for you to vomit for a whole hour. Macdonald plays his role as a "rational", "oh" and "oh", rather than being sympathetic, a rhetorical role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This clipped, heart-gold, God-loving, non-child-tempting priest (who is in his "free time" box - like priests do something There is a better role than it was). Even the ever reliable Gable is not up to its normal value; He is more animated, and his character is very vain for a person who is supposed to be the aspiring western "scoundrel" (though, perhaps, the scripts of the script). <br /> <br /> Ping-pong game with Gable and his rival Holt Cinderella - using his force. How? Well, at first he was working for GaÃ«lle (singing), then he worked for the halt of the square, then he returned to Gabel, soon returned to Holt. (And, of course, both want to keep her as a girlfriend). And if the earthquake does not prevent this table-tennis plot, it will be a safe bet that will stand back ten times, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They almost make the first "disaster-movie musical" Almost to try What a fool The song that he sings in the "joint" song of Gabel is fine, but when he starts to cry bitterly in the open segment, I think that my ears attacked the enemy with unwanted and unjustly attack. Actually, there is an opera number that will last for 6 months. 6 It may seem a little less than those who did not have the first experience of Vietaparamam with such horrors of audio abuse, but it is like the years of the dog; A dog's year is more than equivalent to seven people. The opener is one minute equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or acetic urine on your feet). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster film, but it was like a near-disaster film. (I read that some of the dialogues in this movie were written by a Silent-Era film director, Jesus ...) musician, and only occasionally funny, the real star of the movie (ie earthquake), just one and a half later. When Joe Earthquake eventually shakes the city and in our clipped letters, I almost feel like saying "Please thank God, death and destruction here finally". Unfortunately, Joe comes too late in the movie to save it from his growing intercession; Destruction scenes are very good, but the film's earthquake is very annoying, destroyed by religious closure. You see, Gabeel, who always wanted to be an atheist (actually without using words), finally found McDonald alive - after searching for the day - and suddenly he turned into a believer because Cinderella was alive? !! How stupid! Those who tell me that the character of Gayle is a weak mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is ending in a very mobile phone. Gable says "save" to his daughter "save" (and for her on her knee) "God" ("see light)", and the movie's small old devil "Thanks" for converting himself into a believer in Gable. God is a terrible American end ... <br /> <br /> This is why there was an earthquake in the first place because someone thought of asking this "god"! Sad and unrecognizable satire is that the term "drying" ends in the applesauce; Above all, he crafted "suckers" who have fun for their greatest horse - meaning religion - and eventually he becomes one. Now I win the victory of the human soul! Another ridicule is that the ending was supposed to improve Galilean like a person, but I see it quite differently; On the contrary: It was the only big joke to make Gabbel a God-fearing, humble, gentle, submissive believer in faith - who joined the sheep family of the world. And as such, the fall of this intellectual fall of Gabelle was not very painful and frustrating, and for the first time, "earthquake musical" real hair-raising (this is the word you will go), great, and hope-enthusiastic beautiful musical scene: Frigo (or "God" Probably it operated?) A dozen (or hundreds) of panic and proud, proud citizens are all together, good, bright, Joe-Shaw for the future of the future Ronama sing the song together. Hallelujah! Do not skip this movie if you are "sticky" for the Hollywood feeling.
