How do horror stance styles exist in existing possible clich√© and stereotype rounds and then how to stuff them in a massive lousy movie later? Answer: "Camp Blood" It's a micro-budget amateur amateur slasher nonsense and very little bit inspired by "Friday 13th". Do you ever see the most incredible teenage characters? Are they ugly, stupid and annoying like a combination ?? Go camping and find yourself quickly pursued by a homicidal smoker in a shoe suit. Do not ask me about the killer's motivation or even who he was, because if he plays in the film then I miss it completely. This is one of the worst movies ever produced with no inspiration or tech. Production prices are so unfortunate that actors do not play multiple roles or even annoying them. The only semi-decent and appropriate sequence across "Camp Blood" is the opening mother tongue and Brian expresses sex in the jungle with his son Guy Scout. Yes, I am fully aware that it is a completely shallow comment, but again it is a child and disabled film, so who care?
