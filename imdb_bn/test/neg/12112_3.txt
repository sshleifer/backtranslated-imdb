This movie is bad. I saw the rated and unrated version. They're terrible! Now, I think it might be a low budget, Spider's pornographic spoof, but Spiderman is not good in bad times. It's not funny! Not all fun !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie gave me down. There are many nudity looking forward to at least unrated version. And it's me because Mundae is not a great looking woman. He's okay from the waist, but leaves way up to be much desired. She does not look good in that school girl outfit. Please, if you see this spiderbob then rent it first. Rate or unrated, really do not make any difference, they're both bad !!
