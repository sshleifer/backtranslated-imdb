This movie was recommended by one of my filmmakers who created this film and was therefore well-anticipated. Sadly, I was frustrated by the first half - Ah, a movie about a cobra's revenge for a trick, how real is that - and the second half of the fast moving forward hopes to find something that 45 -odd minutes I already have like wasted But I got all the 'shock' ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that it seems unable to define a movie that it wants to say and what it says (say bad to the worst). Great acting does not save a full script full of scripts which I can take care of. <br /> <br /> Now, if I do not see the light of the moon in the movie industry, then I am going to be surprised to discover the silly politics and exploitation behind the screen, but my feelings have come upwards: 'Hu Hum'. <br /> <br /> If it does not have to be done 2/10 ... 1/10, then the acting and the paper cut scene.
