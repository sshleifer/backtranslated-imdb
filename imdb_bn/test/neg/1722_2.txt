'Tycos' can often be a science fiction movie that is bad. <br /> <br /> I could find a little better to tell about this movie. Completely wrong in the premises. A comet is believed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to the earth, but no one believes in someone who does not believe in this scientist. A launch pad for the entire underground city and nuclear armed rockets is built without observation in the hills of California. When Dhumketu came to Earth, the news came to the TV and newspapers one day before the incident. And so, and so ... <br /> <br /> It does not make any kind of emotions on screen. Finds comets and builds an underground city humanity or an animal a savior? The director or Dennis Hooper does not seem to make decisions without playing this role, and in fact it does not make any difference because the acting and direction is so confusing that you are amazed by what you are trying to say about this movie. Special effects are so cheap that they can not be credible during the era of computer age, but four decades before the film was created, they could not even be convinced in the 50's. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time.
