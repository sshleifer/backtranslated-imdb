In the 1990's, a number of attempts have been made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nissiqi tried to resurrect the old Yamato Saga in a Yamaha 2520 in the form of a ridiculous "Yamato 2520", which is completely abandoned only after two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and unmatched "Harlak Saga", when the Galaxy Express 999 was a movie called this hack with his name. <br /> <br /> If you have watched "Queen Millenia", you remember it was an amazing movie in its own way. The Mattel Legend tries to say a signal in this already-ending chapter, finding a way to act like this. <br /> <br /> This film takes on all the annoying aspects of the Generic Loop science fiction film, it is badly mixed mesodram, and to add insult to injury, toss among one of the most famous characters of Matsumoto's universe. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> You thank me
