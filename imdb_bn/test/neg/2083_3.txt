Watchable but pretty terrible. How frustrated that this great Gregory La Cavalade was the last directive credit! Even in his well-known role, I do not care about the genre Kelly. She seems to be smug, hostile, and self involved. Here, with a little actress like Marie Wilson, they seem to show those features in the spides. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The actors seem to be working hard to work hard, the picture seems to be a solid, inconsistent core and they are all right. <br /> <br /> All Butler seems obviously fun, but he was an extended Franklin Pingburn famous (and in spite of his stereotyping, he was usually funny - in contrast to this guy.) Phyllis Thaxter is always a resorted to secondary plot Riff on stylish bits as attractive.
