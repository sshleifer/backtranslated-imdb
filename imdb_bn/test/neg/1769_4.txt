Generally, Living Steve Rail Back is a good movie for any movie. However, this movie does not comply with that opinion. Life Force is the average film below which is very confusing at the beginning (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but when London becomes Jumbo City, it is finally able to pick something. A horror / sci-fi mess is very difficult to sit through that, even though the naked spacegirl / vampire look very easy to look at. This film is worth 4 ratings out of 10.
