This flashing is worse than its belief. Even for an independent low-budget film ... it's okay, well, suck. I can not believe that Tromas will find such a Baptist. I'm a fan of some trombone flickr years (poisonous avengers, squid play, rockbilly vampire names) But eloodid, let's go beyond any border of taste. It has some of the worst performance features. I think it was possible to find out the unemployed people who could be good ... oh, wait, what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. No luck, the producer and director of this film will get a huge functional loan because of this torture. For example, special effects people But beyond the horrific acting and horrible special effects, the ear of the conversation is absolutely traumatic. The scripts are full of filling the size of the Alaskan plot, and have serious continuity problems. But the worst part is, it is not even entertaining in even the smallest ways. And this is the most ineffable sin of film making. But, do not take my word for it. Go out and waste four odd fares. Just do not say I warned you.
