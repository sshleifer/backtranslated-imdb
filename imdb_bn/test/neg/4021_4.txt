In the 1930s, I saw nearly half a dozen of poor poverty budget budgets created by Ke Maynard, and I am constantly surprised how bad an actor was. How could he ever be a leading cowboy actor? They say that he can quietly sail back quietly, but he does not have anything particularly impressive on this next sound films. Nevertheless, he may have grown up because he was older and could travel. <br /> <br /> Another version of Phantom Range is not as bad as Keane Maynard, but it's still not so much. . Some other characters refer to him several times as "Young Fellers", where I think he is old as another old actor. <br /> <br /> And if it does not fool you enough, there is a rather significant script problem in this movie. At one point, how one of the characters has commented on how the vanatta was preventing a valve toxicity, something that has not happened yet. Just a few minutes later we see that special scene. No, it was not a flashback. At first I thought that when the trailine films were moving the DVDs, they could be opposite of two trains. But at that time the film had about 11 minutes of film on the railway, and the whole opposite took only 3 or 4 minutes. All others had a logical order. So, it seems to be a real continuity problem in the real movie. Probably one of the reasons Carloni photos have not lasted long.
