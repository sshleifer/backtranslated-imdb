I think this picture did not come near to hit the theater. Perhaps this is the road that my neighbors used to portray this movie with their mother's video camera. Very amateur acting This movie does not want to see anything until you are obviously indifferent. Actor director and crew members think twice, without any "professionalism". Director (s) and / or actors prefer to continue their efforts to make films, I would certainly suggest maintaining their skills and possibly take some (ok, many) classes about filmmaking and acting.
