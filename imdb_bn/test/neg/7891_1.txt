This is a film about a black man who has bought an airline and turned into an African-based organization on the top flight. They represent the owner not only to the owners but also to control the part of the terminal terminal at the airport. The next time you see him, this guy has won $ 100 million dollars, he runs across airport acting like an airport owner. Everyone calls this picture as a parody, but there is nothing parody about this movie! This movie is a flop and Wal-Mart will always have $ 4.95. <br /> <br /> I can not even come to terms with why I am losing MGM 16 million dollars. This movie does not even issue straight-to-video status. The authors (one black and one white) should be blacklisted forever from Hollywood. They are not just black, they represent their senses. I'll be ashamed to go to a movie that continually insults me. Do not waste your time looking at TBS in the video store, Wal-Mart, pay-per-view, or Sunday afternoon.
