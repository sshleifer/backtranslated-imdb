Was this supposed to be fun? This is a film that just does not work. Jim Carey was the first Bruce Almighty, some very funny moments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its performance is very common and she can not afford it like Carey. <br /> <br /> A good thing about this is that I was paying only $ 1.95 for it to rent. This is a movie for children ... very young people who have seen about 4 films in their life or in their little life <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to know that Jim Carey plays a movie and without a series of them, it is usually a huge Turkey. Does anyone remember the faces of masks? Avoid this movie lovers (IMDb's 100 Best Movies All-time).
