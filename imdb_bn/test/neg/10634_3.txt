In this flat, half-documentary style, it is said that the film was so popular at the time of creating, with great issues, directors, and anyway involved in real unreal movies. (And hello, it's not a movie-silent!) Unimportant, too complex, too much populism, there is no cycle, no focus points, no excitement, and no visual purpose from one scene to another. A Valentine of supposed and highly suspicious cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on illegal immigration issues. <br /> <br /> The scene that hated me when Montluban and Mitchell were brave from their prisoners, probably because of the equipment of Montblanc, to protect Montlaban's injured partner from being killed by a gun in a farm, "Faster - we try to save him", but instead of doing it, they fall on their stomach and about 5 (!) Minutes screen. The second view of morphine when the device is on, and eventually run over him (or, we guess - but the machine is turned off, and another two Guan "rescue" after the shooting, and they are detected.) Visible. The whole thing is so terribly impressed and completely anticlimatic. There is nothing worse than a play (apparently, Montalban, though he has closed the screen for half the film) or even does not even try. Jizz, Ricardo, do something! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but Hell, all his movies are not classic, but people. How bad would it be to get an old movie less than 6 ratings?
