Sometimes a film is so bad that you just keep watching scare. This is one of those movies Of course I'm biased that can not help. I'm from Chicago so I've seen close view for precision and I do not find all at the Billy Crystal Funny. And I can not work with English style photography (Tony Scott etc.) smoke machine overtime and all flourecent, soft lighting. I think we believe that Billy Crystal actually came from Chicago because he wears a shaws jersey. Oh and plot If you really think about it, these guys should be locked, or bad guys, because they are more dangerous. And of course the retired crane has the clich√© of the police. But the most interesting scene is Clifax where the good and bad guys are machine gun gunmen at the Thomson Center (a state building!). This is definitely a great building, but the White House is equivalent to a huge drug deal.
