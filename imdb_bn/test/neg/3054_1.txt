Dear friends, I have never seen a trash film, which is Knight of the Eggs (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenny Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's desire to make a copy of classics like the same calendar of the resurrection of the living death. Cinematography was frustrating, the film was very dark, so I had to start the brightness control most. In fact, the horror picture should be dark, but not like the night of the Demon. The whole film was ridiculous, no doubt, in Roger's role, bad actors, besides Alvin Alexis, and deadly make-up effects 5 votes for that movie? I can not believe it Perhaps the users were satisfied about actors tits, ass and pussies, they actually had 5 stars worth. Regards, Hans Dieter
