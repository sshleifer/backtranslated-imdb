Hold my hand and say that I see this picture first (and probably last !!!) one. Where I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which is not bright enough - it's good to know what hemesh But they say, do not leave your day job - HR certainly not. <br /> <br /> The acting of HR is simple and easily awkward. Even if the movie was a plot, even the thing that bothers you most is why this person is on the screen and what he is doing here. Two words of HR consultation - leave acting and secondly, use the chopsticks. <br /> <br /> There is no screening of HR, no acting skill and female lead seems very young for him. For Malika Sarawat - Just the same old Bollywood Vamp Bride. <br /> <br /> You can package the product as you want, but if there is any substance it can not hold. Do not waste your money ...
