Koyaanisquatsi the best movie I've ever seen. This is a wonderful part where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "beautiful" or "nice", but the camera is never too pixy or intermediate. This is exactly what's going on here. The camera is used to intrude, humiliate and ridicule. There is no magic stream here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without the broader purpose or plan. The music is boring. How I made the best movie, rated Quanissacatski, is the worst. This is a "pure" film, but it's a negative form, which should not * be.
