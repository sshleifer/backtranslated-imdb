This series is formula and annoying. Episodes are the same thing every week, with just a few different settings. Some purely bad characters do some desperate work, Walker goes after him, and it ends a Karate match. Fame is super-impressive super-stereotypical villain, good boys are all pure, honest and content, and the story line is simple and unrealistic. After almost 2 episodes, the show is completely disqualified by at least the intelligent fans. Of course Norris is not the best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag for weeks. If you enjoy a formual, annoying, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then it's for you.
