First: I like Se Segal! But in this movie, he hit the rock bottom and started digging! <br /> <br /> Plot what plots? Very weird and incredible plot <br /> <br /> Step down to Seagull quality! <br /> <br /> The best part is Mr Segal, a pro. And it shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> Samari i m. Segel can write a good script (and so). If you read this Stephen, mail me, I'll give you a good script for a better movie! The only realistic part is where ... (see the ironic part). <br /> <br /> Participant (if you want to see the movie, stop reading here!) - Gas leak? How nice. Discover a 'Black Box' Recorder in a Hotel Room? I'm an art, ridiculous! The bad guy 'goes away', who is really true in life!
