<br /> <br /> I think the movie lacks the dramatic mystery of the first movie. It's hard to be done when it takes place a week. The original movie leads to the final weather scene at the end of one year and it is still less violent than the Siegel. One good thing about this movie was that the movie went faster, because the plot takes it. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no funeral in the film. Another was brought down to Emmy Irving brought down. All its scenes bring down the speed of the movie. The movie dialog was terrible. This is reflected in the way babies speak in any way. The film can hit the conclusion, but after the opening scene, it becomes different.
