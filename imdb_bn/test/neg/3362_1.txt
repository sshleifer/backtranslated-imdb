When I first heard about Jack Frost I was in the tradition of renting a monthly video of Miranda's video Eiji with my family. At this time I dared to move towards the horrendous part of the shop. Browsing different titles, I finally came across Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my pleasure. Years later the film will be invisible, replaced with the only unavoidable yet unnecessary sequel. I went back to the horrific section and only highlighted the case for a conclusion: the film would be awesome? But not deliberately. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: Rear of the Killer Mutant Snowman (perfectly titled), where it left the predecessor. Sheriff Sam is seeking counseling after his exams and Jack is now in the form of anti-fridge. For his past escape, Sam and his wife walk in an island hotel, where they are with different types of slash film stereotypes, busty female models, thick head sport sports and Caribbean workers. However, Jack released his liquid from the grave and returned to his ice system. He walks on the island and earns to kill anyone that can prove to be an awesome death. Only Sam could stop him. <br /> <br /> I just say that it's a direct video image so it's bound to be bad. But in the top movies it is terrible even in the eyes of others. Camera work is bad, using a camera will be a soap opera royal appearance. Half of the actors seem to have come out of a porn shooter and the other half looks like they came out of retirement, but in reality they actually came out of a shelter. The special effects used in the film are widespread, which is one of the options among the Blood Puppies and the CGI, which can be developed by the child and the death scenes are mostly depleted and still eligible, victims. But the film is most memorable for its killers, such as "there is something that needs little Christmas stuffing" and "I officially declared dead on f ***!" Ultimately, the whole purpose behind such a film is to create a sperm flick for Friday night and even fail it. To create a seagull for a movie that was a poor slash, which should be considered as unbelievable as a child that he took some nerves of steel ?? Or total frontal lobotomy. Director Michael Cooney ?? Thanks for wasting my time. Everyone else ?? Avoid like arsenic.
