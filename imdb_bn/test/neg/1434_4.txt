This may seem like a lamb or zodiac or something like silence, but it was not. It really was like one of the Halloween movies without all the jump scenes. It was understood from the outer space like a small plan 9 that the main bad guy was making me an anonymous conversation, which would make me snake without a break. A person who is so crazy that he will kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual knowledge, that's really a fun idea, but the execution was very much made for TV's sentiment. I would say it was better than expected by a DJ Schneider writer and for a movie starring. A good first effort. Maybe he will learn some lessons and the next attempt will be less weird.
