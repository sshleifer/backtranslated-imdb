If you prefer the poor SE, (some) the total lack of bad acting and credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap looking movie, but I like it anyway. Why? Because I like this kind of movie. I can not help laughing when I watch such a movie ....... Producers, actors, directors and SEO people are wondering when they made this picture? Do not expect a "unreal" or "allian", just a (very few) budget horror / adventure movie. <br /> <br /> There is a nice "splatter" moment when shooting a man's head, but for the worst, the awful fantastic joke. The final monster is very nice. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes long, so you can not make mistakes there. Maybe you can see it on your local video host or TV. I'm sure you will be good at viewing it. <br /> <br /> But do not tell you not to be warned .............
