If this movie is coming to a theater near you, please consider it a threat. I was so sorry to see this movie in Tokyo. As I am in Dutch, I was surprised to play a Dutch movie in a metropolis like Tokyo. I think it could be especially special on the way to the Dutch film going to Japan. So I went there with some friends, and we were glad to tell the theater staff that we were Dutch and we were so passionate about the movie. As it was seen, it was the most childish, stupid, stupid, the worst act, I might have seen the worst English film in 10 years, and I have given up the theater to try to avoid the staff, because the disaster film responsible for it is almost responsible for it. Sometimes you get this feeling of what the director is watching: Lola Rent, movie like Trainspotting Instead of scores, there were more like McGee on drugs with old breaktit music. But if I do not feel overwhelmed, the movie was a bit lonely, because it shows Holand at its lowest point.
