This French TV saw today and was most disappointed! The film starts well but nothing is clear and ultimately we are no more in the beginning. To see a husband to kill a husband, it is not only valid. You need a minimum proof of proof to convict someone. There is nothing in this case so it is not valid. Old adage "innocent innocent until proven innocent". There is no evidence that a woman killed her husband that she disappeared without trace. So I do not really know how to try to create this image. The results are totally unreasonable and unknown, no provoking evidence is shown to the viewer. So quite obviously, it is a complete waste of time viewing. Finally, a film must be entertaining .... In this case it is totally untrue and I think it is the dust that will be handed over immediately!
