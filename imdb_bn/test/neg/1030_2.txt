It looks like if you're going to post here but it's going to be a 10-star rating, never mind dislike anybody, I do not like anything honest, but here we go, the Rachel Rae Show is just horrible awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of Snal's character Linda that she can eat some food- whatever she can mourn. I must say that at Rachel's day $ 35- $ 40 on the food network, but I'm sorry that he does not have enough days and enough life experience to make his fun day give me ham to the street, atheny bordine, interesting people, but in most cases I He feels annoyed, he actually told a member of the studio audience to stop "yes" a joke Urna way, but is closed to shut up, and his stories about pet care, you are sorry Rachel has been canceled !!!!
