Please re-watch all the 3 series and do not go to see this movie, the trailer is completely confusing, and the 3 weakest characters in the series think of the most painful 2 hours of my life, a terrible 25 minute TV episode of a terrible movie. The tube and edward have it for a few minutes, Mickey has a line, and its lipp is exactly the same tired old puns reels, also the appearance of Mr. Briss's expression film, played badly, changed 5 times, and really laughing a few said, it looks like 2 hours of recycle I think this series has broken this painful piece ...! Batman and Robin were all forgiven
