I will give it: try it It tried well and even Luke Linson was involved. Luke Wilson is good, but he can do so only. The story was very flawed and could not create the characters because they were not supported. <br /> <br /> The "joke" running with the bandits was sedentary. He was not funny and I got tired of speeding fast. And barefooted baby bits were very weak kind. Did he beat Hitler in Florida? Yes okay <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > I like that little cart, especially when turning on Wilson Ceyron. But, nothing more than my time was worthless. "D-"
