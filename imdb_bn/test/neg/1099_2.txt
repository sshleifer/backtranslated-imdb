It started in Pennsylvania in 1913. A group of children die in a mine explosion, deliberately dug by the owner of the mine. Cut in 2006. Recently, the widow Karen (Lori Huring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little girl Emma (Chalo Moreatz) went to a remote house near the mine. They do not know that the little children's ghosts roam inside the woods and anyone who dies after dark. <br /> <br /> The slow and annoying "horror" movie. The premiere is clear and has already been killed. There is also a huge gap in the reasoning of the story. It has never been cleansed why these kids kill only someone or why they eat after body (yes - it is shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why did not they get the main villain in the story before? He was near the area. Why is this time to attack him? Also the letter does not prefer at least bits. Sarah comes across the worst. It has few preserved graces. The location was beautiful and weird at the same time, some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the children kept themselves silent in the night. But, above all, I was tired and I got up. You can skip this one.
