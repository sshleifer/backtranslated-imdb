I saw this movie based on the fact that I was on the nasty list of DPP video, and when I was happy I saw it because it is now 'another video downright' - on its own merits, Andy Milligan's film is not really bothered with the price. Of course, there are more bad movies on the infamous list; But that's not one of these easy viewing pain. The film was definitely shot on a very low budget, and that script was translated; Bloody people often work on an idea seen in horror movies and do nothing new to it. Basically, three couples who are waiting for the results of a will to find themselves in a home-made plot center. They do not start sorting long ... Bla Bla Bla. Nothing happens for most photos; And then finally when we go down strongly to ban the film, they are so amateur and stupid that they are impossible to take seriously in any level. This is a very good thing that this movie does not have long time running, otherwise it can be used as a bad method of torture. It boils down to a fittingly tiring finish at all, which is successful to be a non-incidental epic proportion. Apparently, this movie is still banned in the UK; But since I suspect it's because of its shock value. Basically, blood writings are not worthy of sighting and I personally do not see any reason to recommend it. Until then, you did it your business to watch everything in the nasty list of videos!
