I enjoy science-imagination as much as the next man ?? But what was that? His previous film, 'Various (1926)', was shot in the scene for more than three days, using an additional film stock, this is a frivolous futuristic frenetic frenzy of Gene Rono, which is produced in a budget that may not be much more than zero. After the Great War in 2028, Africa became the most civilized region in the world and previously Europe was nominated as "Terres Inconnues". "An African Explorer?" If you follow me, then a black man wearing a white man, Johnny Higgins, played a black cloth. His round planes were destroyed by the ruins of Paris and a Parisian barbarian (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and his lively The companion, which I have probably seen, travels on the outside of his foot, is part of some strange sex initiation program. Bay Barbaraw, Charleston started showing dance explorer, which he was happy to learn himself. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that he did not help Hessling's film, who was surprisingly named after Reno's 'The Little Match Girl' (1928), next year's dancer Not even though the use of slow-motion is too much for the occassion, and I am very surprised that Renoir has given his own wife a sexually explicit material It is not surprising to learn about their divorce after just three years! Besides, I like the idea of ​​a general science-concept behind the film, and in contrast to the racist roles, the impressive touching sensitive touch is usually in these stories. However, why Renoir decided to dress as a minstrel in his black actor will have a mystery all the time. Innocent, filthy and uninterrupted, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is the film's curiosity among one of the film's most respected directors, and perhaps an attempt that he would like to forget. The DVD version came with a musical soundtrack, but I compromised the selection of pieces from Dmitry Shastakovich.
