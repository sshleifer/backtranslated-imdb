This is one of the worst movies of my life. They said that the person had the answer to wait in the groin ... what I'm trying to say is that we did not really respond. I can not believe it is actually made. The director can choose another profession, because he can not make a movie. The script was not good. It was made in no sense and was very dirty. It's much better than Bet movies and I'm very disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence on this bad accusation of the movie. If I could get back in time, I would not go back to the media player to buy the film, I would just keep looking at it instead of wasting my time.
