A young man, who is not in the military and is not trained to be a jet pilot, moved to a foreign country to rescue his father. If it is not quite ridiculous, he discusses a colonel of the Air Force to help him get a jet [wow!] To make the film even more fool, the colonel risks his career and life with the help of some risky boys. They just do not make such a colonel anymore, but they never did. This unfortunate, dry film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a MIG.
