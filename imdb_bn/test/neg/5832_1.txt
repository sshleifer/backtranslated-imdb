I am from Bangladesh, and here, c. C. Costigan is the goddess of horrible sex. Everyone jokes together, a friend and I awake in the middle of the night, watching movies for both of them: the Action Channel, when we came across a series of Flight-Fi-Escrower flights. RoboCop 2 was (not bad, ... not bad anymore) ... then Judge Dredd, (Stallone almost destroyed his career) then a movie named Leethal Target. Someone would think that the title "Lethal Targeted" is only a great, and really the pinch of Rambo can be rendered knock-off. But no, what is distributed is what I want to say "semi-software, semi-pseudo-action, semi-sci-fi film" ... In fact, I think I can say that it is not a film, all of it. If it is not for the warm summer of the original character, then the movie is closed when my friend and I close the movie. <br /> <br /> I have some questions (I do not even want to say "brave" courage) who made this film. One, in the future, why did we use surgery in 1999? Oh, wait, I can get it, all they can do, okay ??? ... well, why a normal linen shirt and a vest, what kind of people wore in the late nineties? ... oh ... I found it ... in space, it was definitely a fashion statement .... Well, then ... why, oh, why the main character dragged the 3.5 floppy disc to a point in the picture so that he Can upload bad pictures? WTF! ... We have progressed so far that we have traveled the space, but we still do not move more than 1.44 megabytes of space. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm asking too much. <2: Question 2, let's just say ... yes ... it's a soft porn So why are only one real sexual scene, and why it lasts for 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you are standing in the middle of the night to see this bad (I say 'movie' and?) ... and hit it under 2 minutes. Hell, they only took that sexual scene and sold it in pornographic movies, and they made more money from this "shit" than this work. <br /> <br /> <br /> And the actress is no crime, but I work as well. And I have mentally disturbed, and only have a testicle ... (C Cortigan, ... Please email me ... we'll lunch) I will write more, but I have finished the space.
