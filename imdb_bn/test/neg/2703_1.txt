As a cartoon, the Spytroops movie was quite bad. It was only 44 minutes long, but several battles ended with COBRA headquarters. A downer movie was at the very beginning. There was a animated war simulation of war fighting that is better than the rest of the film. That right was a major turn off and the rest of the movie created a lack of credibility. Then Shipravrek got tied up with his parrot and entered into some room where some had examined for a few days. What is the surveillance camera? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment were available. Then there was a stupid idea that 100 complex arcs could be made overnight. For the little kids, this plot was stupid. Spongebob, PowerPop Girls and even Barney Dinosaurs are paying more attention to their plots. <br /> <br /> I did not understand anything except Dersro, and the Cobra commander was not a fool, much like a villain. In fact, the rest COBRA characters were ridiculous and rarely impressive, except for Storm Shadow and Jartan. The GI Joe Charter was pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were here in my favorites. Ship and beach head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as a hooligan ball and the head of the beach sounds like 1990's surfer dude. I guess the author, Larry Hama, was trying to create a character who was attracted to teenagers, but he dropped a Marker's decade. Just heard the Beach Head Spikoli Surfer Talk (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), I'm surprised that the new GI Jose is going to smoke drowning before the big mission. <br /> <br /> CGI was quite like that the Cobra commander was a jerking spastic walk, and the vehicles do not look at all realistic. Flying tanks and explosions were not very impressive. Old style animation has been much better than this. Since the Hasso incident liked the cheap things, they found what they found. I was sad to see the whole thing, it was just boring and there was a soul or a lack of GI Joe souls. Even the old JI Joe did well in the commercial. Indeed, the DVD included additional as four or five current advertisements for JI Joe Spy Troops, and those advertisements were far more entertaining than the movie. Advertising was more kid-oriented fun and soul. The video was animated, while the movie was dull.
