This movie is so bad they should burn the master. You can not loot this plot because there is no one in this movie. Less than graphics mesh, they are horrendous. Then you got gambling through the street work of Gaza-non-Hollik, who has cast his demonism and mad preacher into a crazy gem. And finally when he created it from DC, he did not even have the authority to kill him; The giant (which you do not know at that time) is already dead but how ... knows and of course it is the last tragic end ... everyone else on the planet is dead or die but his family and a boxing fight stragglers survive Imagine that! This film is C Thomas Howell going to his graveyard, which he has ever played. Perhaps it gave him nightmare.
