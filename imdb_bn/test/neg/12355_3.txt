<br /> <br /> Firstly, maliciously, it needs to add "Spear Alert" to adjust to the parameters of IMDB, but there is nothing here to "loot" here. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> There are six letters: beautiful films whose "mountain" "The area's A-list mountain guidelines and apparently all the planets (including Mount Everest Sherpas). His lost love, which has disappeared from the title two years ago, whose party is deliberately seeking, but can not find; Owner of his shop, also a guide, who may be better than Sherpa but no match for him; The strange lead actor who engaged in his service, and says that he will find his long absent love contract; One of his collaborators, computer hackers with direct unlimited efficiency, Gates can ask for advice from him at sufficient levels; And his other colleague, a bodyguard who did not even look at the IQ near three numbers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is information. What exactly was not published <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is the most interesting The aspects were part of juxtaposing with three flicks or roles to meet me. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, hidden secret information reminds a non-listing / debut film called "Spanish Prison", which is not particularly clear around a valuable corporate "process", but better for it. Certainly not even here. <br /> <br /> Second, the lead wafer probably proved to be more wealthy when "ramboo" behaves faster after quick presentation. Third, I think Steven Sigal Flick (not to skip the title), where he was half-aware and had almost 1/3 of the time and was fully comotose for 1/3. Although I did not try to see most of his work, but I have seen enough that during Comotose, he provided his best work and knew most of his time with his lyric personality. In this tears, while awakening, the young hacker may be the most compelling person on the screen, but in the next uncertain and unsupported condition and unable to express feelings, he did the best in this unexpected two hours. <Br> <br /> Take a thin, silly basis for a plot here. Imagine that it has four roles with a light on Ciline, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short. Here they can laugh the record with some changes in the dialogue. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Even in such a Turkey there should be a small trace somewhere reasonable. This one is completely perfect.
