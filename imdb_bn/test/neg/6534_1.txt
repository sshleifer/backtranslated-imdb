Plot: <br /> <br /> - A chair from Ebb <br /> <br /> - Random people <br /> <br /> - Random people talk ("Dude, it's okay." If you are a hippie, you would love this movie. (You must be high or drunk, otherwise you will question your life seeing this junk.) <br /> <br /> This movie was not thought to have been started from the beginning until the end and other comments probably the crew padding reviews. This is not my demographic target, I do not know what it is targeting. I have not found annoying plot every day. This is something that I will do, and believe me it is not worth the movie. Going to a street and silent filming is not a movie half!
