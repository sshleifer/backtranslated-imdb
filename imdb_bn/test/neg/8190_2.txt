I have not seen much movies worse than this one. Storyline, dialogue, acting: It's awful! The story goes from one to six without just a logical step. Each time you think that you missed something, but not: it was created in a way that it could be. And why did the world so much love Jenny Garth on the world that any hungry person (who is actually acting movie Cinderella Manager by Rachel Crow)? Oh, it's not Spielberg, of course I have to write ten lines to post. This movie is not really enough inspiration to write 10 lines! This is a good movie with a romanticized story, so if you're ready for it: you have a ball.
