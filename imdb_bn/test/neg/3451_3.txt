A few days after the inauguration of the Dublin International Film Festival, I found it just like the second world screening. Two nights later in the same theater, I was on another film, I saw Brendan Glisson, Paul Mercier and the rest cast and the crew in another promotional screening of the stands. <br /> <br /> I want to say. Critically frustrated with the film, I do not expect any title, but what I was presented to, I believe that all the important elements of this section have been established in itself. Before I continue, two things, I acknowledge that some filmmakers like to abolish the general expectations, not just here. Secondly, I know that it was based on a game (which I did not read, it was not a brave thing of literature), but it does not excuse the massive story of the film carrying it. <BR> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the script, it has forgotten based on a game, it does not work as a sports comedy which simply does not work simply, the down and out team is trying to win a football cup , A few games are shown (when they are, it is too small) and we are not given any satisfaction because of any of their achievements. After reading so far, you can guess that this is not a strict sporting film, but the psychological research of the relationship between a director and his charity "charlatan". It certainly does not achieve it, even if I'm not sure if it is noticed. Hackneynid and Peripheral, any attempt to stir a character's history. Overall, I was missing the script many cases. <br /> <br /> I think performances and music were good and technically, the film was well-formed. But from this point to the expectation of an Irish film, I felt very disappointed with the theater. <br /> <br /> My judgment seems to be rigid, but I think there are some hopes for energy in the near future that the national Irish movie and this simply does not return the argument. Studs is a proposed Dublin syndawar film (I was part of the screening viewers), most people seem to disagree with me, so you probably will take your own movie verdict.
