There are a lot of holes in the plot, it makes you amazed if they know that it has its audience for them and only collect it. I do not know much about George Zucker, but I saw him two movies. Obviously, he was cast as a loving father, a mad scientist, a vampire guy. She looks so simple. I was surprised that he ended up in the section. It is common, "I'll create a monster that can be used to fight as a military." With the transfer of the wolf (or coyote it) in the hands of his hire, he turn him into a Veruwal. As the successor to Karloff, Karloff's successor, Glen Strength Friendsteen, plays a loving, loving harbinger like a monster because he believes in a crazy doctor. Once the petro (his name) could be transformed, then the scientist could control. But, like the invisible man, suddenly he started morphing on himself and became a liability. The girl has a small love story and a reporter such as a high-sounding voice (Galley Miss Brooks). She wants to leave but her father, doctor, will not approve it. He mocked his research before being managed by a group of his colleagues and now he is going to satisfaction. The manner in which he planned to embarrass or kill, has become quite distant and depends on Petro and people are waiting for an attack. This is not a very good movie. Powerful points are the atmosphere of wood as the humans and monsters hide around the Spanish barn. Again, the inhabitants of the city seem to have escaped from the bad West. There was one thing with me that the little girl was the first victim and it seems unusual for a movie of this era. There is a pipe smoker old lady who knows about uselessness but nobody listens to her.
