In my opinion, a good documentary - one that is particularly relevant to controversial political issues - should be informative and as smooth as possible. The point should be revealed to the truth. This means, in particular, stay in experts and specialists interviewing all parties. This image is a failure in this case. Most of the interviews in this film were included in the "holy streets men" in the holy land, explaining the question of peace. The wall itself, the film is supposed to be a supposed subject, no serious treatment. In most cases interviews only wait for communication and general questions such as "What do you think of the wall?" - Do not contact the random people near the wall and ask them how they were affected directly. We do not have any expertise in providing the context of our wall outside an interview of Israeli generals in charge of building the wall (for example, how and when the project started, whether it was successful, for groups and against the project, etc.) <br /> <br / > Outside the interview, there is an extended shot of continuous scenes in a very large section of the film, Emana wall shots, building the wall, and the people getting off a bus. In my opinion this shot up, take a lot more time. It looks beautiful to see what the wall looks like, but the wall (and only the wall) is 20-30 minutes high for filming. Obviously, these shots (with Arab music that carries the sense of grief) include the only purpose of inspiring the visitors' feelings of hate for the wall.
