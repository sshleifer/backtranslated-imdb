Heart of Darkness Movie adaptation as a film and disappointing as a representation of Joseph Conrad's classic tale. <br /> <br /> There are a few small differences between books and movies, but there is hope for any book in the film's infections. Kurtz died in a different position; The manager did not accompany Marlow on her ride; Kurt's daughter spent much time with her than the story. The real thing is the amount of footage stored in the movie, which has no basis in the real story. For some reason, the director has found the need to "spice up" some of the scenes, plays or actions that rarely make sense and are always essential for the story. Some examples that seem to be striking Marlow on the "concubine" of Cartage and losing him. Nothing happened during his sale and Marlowe did not provoke aggression. Passed a couple hours and he awakens: Total waste of time. Kurtz has a pet monkey, for some random reasons, he's killed on a haul. Also, when Marlowe Cartage left the station, he took the "great" decision to go behind any invaluable motive for a real cause. Another error is the character of Kurtz. John Malvovitch is a terrible choice for a person who is described as long and inspirational: a man with a commanding presence. He effectively shouted all his lines, which was very inspiring in the hands of more skilled actors. I can not remove John Malcovitch's picture when I see the role of the cartridge playing the mentally disabled Farmhound of the mouse and Man. After all, I'll rate the movie in 3 out of 10. This is a good movie if you read the book and would like to see it in film format, perhaps to help you view the scenes, but I would never recommend it as a source of entertainment.
