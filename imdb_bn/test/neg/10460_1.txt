When trying to create a major or complex or something like that, a rich landlord ignores the ancient American handicrafts that burn the land and the bone eater ... that creates a stray and kills people looking for fallen friends or something like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film will be a scientific-channel channel. If not, then the director should not give any further instructions. The effects of the film are the most ridiculous and the sister Eater giant is nothing but a CGI-animated film that is being added to the frame later. Actors do not see things when they see the thing (probably they are not really, and they're just terrible actors). This is a great comedy, although it is even supposed to be even scary horror.
