This is the only positive thing I can remember about this piece of junk that I can finally get a good answer if someone asks me if I saw a bad movie. <br /> <br /> This little effort has been made to make it even more spectacular ... much effort and it can even be brighter. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to sell waste? <br /> <br /> I refused to believe that a director could become so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Creating a completely intolerant film can certainly be a dot. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anything else does not understand.
