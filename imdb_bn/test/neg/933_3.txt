In the middle of the Friday, while working on a computer, I gave some rest after a great week, and some files were clear and answering some communication. There have been several breaks, so there was a problem getting all the details directly (though it was not a work of the ratio of hits to Hitko, where the details were missing through the off-the-counter), and it was not a "harmful" piece also. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So commercially, read only the previous comment here (via "Magclan-1"), and most agree with its details. <br /> <br /> This movie is so awesome that it's a great "good", but I want to tape while playing again (instead of viewing it as a broadcast), so I can move forward as fast as possible and the parts I missed I can see this for the first time. <br /> <br /> Give it "3 *" due to the attraction of four primary characters.
