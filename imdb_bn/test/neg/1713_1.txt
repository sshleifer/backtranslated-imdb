Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. $ 10 dollars for a friend that they can not sit through this whole movie. They can not change their viewpoint or be confused by some. See your friends now. To win or lose, you will get $ 10 entertainment. <br /> <br /> It ends when people watch movies and give it 10 to 1 or "succes" their thoughts faster. (And when "Why?" Asked, "Just because." Array.) That is why this film exists. My only purpose is to say to me, "There, this is a horror movie, it's 1 out of 10!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . It's not funny. It's not entertaining. And for some parodies, it's completely wrong! Awesome acting Uncertain dialogue An intelligent story. Terrible "special effects" After another an INANE joke. And to make things even worse, even irrational nudity can not be very beneficial. <br /> <br /> This film is spread with stupidity, gets stuck on the stupid, and the countries face the first fools. Even I love to love, seeing the movie "Check Your Brain in Movies" I saw myself physically excited. This movie is not even a "hard ticket to Hawaii", so terrible - it's bad ... it's okay. Note: I actually challenged a friend to see it as described above. Only he could not make all the way through it, but his head was in pain and after that he needed a few minutes because he felt a little sick. True story <br /> <br /> I could not even emphasize this rating ... 1 estimate of 10!
