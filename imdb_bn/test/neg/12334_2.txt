It may be seen that the picture I saw was completely different than the other, although the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut that I saw in Europe is different from one in the United States. <br /> <br /> However, the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. (Closely following the climate ...) <br /> Why: In my opinion, this director has taken the elements of each thriller in the thriller, mixed it, inserted the wrong sequence with the wrong music and it is published. <br /> <br /> (For example: some are not happy, music gets scared, and still some are not happy. "Gambhir" officer is so annoying to let the actor spread the acting class. There is an unexpected scenario and all the problems in the next scene are gone.) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a smart movie: see the Memento. If you want to see a good thriller then think of any thriller. If you want to see Patrick Soow: See Dirty Dancing.
