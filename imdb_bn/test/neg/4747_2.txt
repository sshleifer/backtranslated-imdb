While closing the last AVP, Alien "Chestbuster" appeared from a dead proprietor of a producer spaceship, and in modern day Guinness, Colorado, the predator space crashed the ship, where it also produced several aliens which created hostility. The hunter send a very experienced and armed hunter to "clean the mess". The characters of our people are caught in the middle of intergalactic warfare. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. This movie moved along a very fast path. The opening credits are only rolling and after the alien reached the full height, the predecessor ship crashed on the earth, a predator and son's character was launched, but we both learn before they die, then we see the hunter fly home-war and the Lead Prietor Alien Infusions war Goes, and this all happens in the first five minutes. This irrelevant motion is not given up for the whole movie; National Guard arrives in the city but everyone dies within two minutes, even without a good look at a face face, a scene of the development of a pizza store manager's character is found whenever we see him once again, besides learning his name, Random Habos, a coffee The shop waitresses and chefs die again without learning their names. At one moment our main characters are in the house, the next city is going on, next to the gun shop, there is an episode later, and this random set is jumping over the over which does not give viewers time to sit down <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Another problem is the settings and time frames. The movie is set in Guinness, Colorado on modern day. All other alien and predator films, such as art space ship, guerrilla war zone rainforests, alien planets and underground laboratories, were shot in deadly settings. Now comes with Avp-R, it sets "Highlights" in American Cities, a sporting goods store, parking lot, pizza shop and little girl's bedroom on a small modern day. I mean, did they really try to see the movie as uninterrupted, unexpected and as flexible as possible? Like the terrible creatures hiding in the bush outside of the rebel's full shell, or sitting in the bush outside the little girls' bedroom, these giants are very hard to grasp. <br /> <br /> There is continuity with this movie. The Allian series was set in the future, before the first man, a person did not listen to aliens and the aliens were never in the world, but if they ever reached the Earth, then humanity would be destroyed. This movie destroys the whole idea by setting it in modern day, the average pair looks at the alliance all over the place and at the end of the film, humanity is not destroyed, and it does not even suffer from minor damage. It pisses on the whole idea of ​​that other movies. The effort to maintain continuity is widely made with Deus pre-Machina. The predetermine carries an unlimited magic blue fluid bottle that can dissolve an organization with just one drop, the army is working very hard at the end of the film, and a nuclear operation collapses, despite many survivors in eyewitness interviews, all the evidence of the existence of the alliance has been easily removed and the plot It is impossible to cover the holes Many bad attempts have been made to meet. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie "verse", it prejudices favoritism in favor of the predetermine. For most movies, only the hunter manages to kill dozens of people, if there are only a few aliens, but only when the single scratch is found in the Mile range, when the Allianans kill the left right and the center like the pigeons, only they will wait to protect themselves Without any effort, the killers started to be killed. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", as soon as it should be "Hunter Genocide Alliance". I mean, how can you fight two species with mystery and tension, when it is portrayed as superior to each other? <br /> <br /> The characters of these pictures are among the biggest flaws. They are not just pale than the characters of the previous Alien and Predator films, but they are silent, scary, even miserable, as a single film alone. The characters of this movie include me being rude, horny couples crazy, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbo, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste work and replay off Newfound Off; The worst and most cliché potential ideas for the characters. Not only that, but all the above characters are played by teenagers. Casting of young people to cast young audiences is a clear attempt, but its movie looks like a general tinker slash-and-porn movie, like a young actress who is being completely empty mouth expressions of most masked dialogs with young people. Not only this, but these characters sometimes do some of the painters' obstacles, such as predators use guns, comment out of power for a few hours, instead of going a little away from the city, following the fool plans to escape from the city, and many other statues The movie was actually the audience due to the disappointment of the audience in my theater. Finally, this movie is just a horrific movie, which is directly entitled to live on DVD. This movie was a theatrical release that surprised me, because every part of the film is just amateur.
