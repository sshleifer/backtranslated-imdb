Plane 747 jumbo Cockpit is located at the top deck of a 747. In the film, the pilot does not ride in the first-class cabin to reach the cockpit. They are walking through the door in front of the first-class cabin and cockpit. What a gaffe !!! The first-class cabin has a clock room in front of the jacket and a TV screen. Besides the radar dome The takeoff is shown before the 747 runsway on the runway. Only two engines were shown at the airport. Ariel 747 has four engines. Who was the continuation of this film? There are toilets in front of the plane in the early part of the flight - another horrible gumf !!! Then the front part of the plane becomes rear and vice versa. At this time I stopped watching. Absolute trash !!!
