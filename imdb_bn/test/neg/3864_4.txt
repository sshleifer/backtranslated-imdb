For the first time to comment on IMDB, I think what type of review is written and it often happens, not really due to the extraordinary movie, but rather the real annoying. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> can do. It's about Do not worry about poor performance, length (very long way), lack of immersion (the character that I've seen for a long time has to be an interesting character - if he dies, he will not care less) or often a ridiculous solution to find the lead character in himself. Look for some problems. <br /> <br /> If it is not for any other review then I could not give 10 stars. I gave four, but maybe three of them are closer to what I think. I do not want to see it again, but its mere thoughts shut me down if I want to kill myself. Oh, and a so-called silent film is nothing but a good soundtrack - not the case here. The last song seems more suitable for the western film. <br /> <br /> This is not romance, it's not action, it's not, it's not good. This will be my review if it is not for the lowest 10 lines.
