*** Spyler can be **** <br /> <br /> I was very excited to see blood and chocolate with my friends. I could not wait because the book is my favorite. But as soon as the movie started, I could not believe how different it was. At first I was okay, all right, so both of his parents died ... maybe it's okay. But then left the rest of the movie. I was angry when the time came to an end. Nothing was right, but their name and love in Vivian Aden fell in love. After the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite of all time ... and then the film went away and made him totally stupid fool? The film also shows the shifts, or the Beaverwood, because these atrocities, evil animals, just as the book shows fit and want to keep their pack safe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll go out and see it again and buy it, but when I think about it I can see bad . You can not see it again or pay me to buy it.
