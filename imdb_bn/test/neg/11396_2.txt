If you read the autobiography of Irril Flein, you will see that the film is full of poetic license. That does not make much of a difference, because Errol Finn was generous with autobiographical poetic licenses anyway. There is no need to worry about spoilers, because there is nothing to loot there. <br /> <br /> I would think it would be more intelligent to use the story about a fabulous Hollywood actor; Then you can go and find him better actor than Duncan Rigger to play and you will not have to worry about the audience: "But Captain Blood did not have his torch." Another failure of this movie is to show Flin as a bi-dimensional character. Flin was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. This picture only focuses on his funny pictures. <br /> <br /> A disaster in the rugby The rest of the cast struggle with their scripts. Hal Lunden is just like Warner, Barbara Hersc√© has built a credible Damita, although Lily Damita did not think of herself as herself. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this picture is to forget it and it is a bit of a bit slow to slow down. So what I'm writing for this, I can not imagine.
