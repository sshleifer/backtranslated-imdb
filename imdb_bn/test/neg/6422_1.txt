If you see this movie on the TV list, ignore it. If you are looking for something scary, you will stop seeing the restoration of X-files. <br /> <br /> Previous comments have died by mentioning incredibly poor acting by female lead. She is almost unwatchable The total sum of its range includes 'whiny and awesome' and 'not whiny and not afraid'. <br /> <br /> I kind of enjoy a good 'bad' movie fist. But this is ridiculous. There is no direction. As simple as the plot, the number of such numbers throws on you and it does not make any sense as the number set. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Close the TV and give your dog a bath.
