Without doubt this film is the worst one I've seen. It is very annoying that I simply can not wait to finish it. I saw my girlfriend after giving a good reviews to this girlfriend and after 30 minutes she looked at me and said that the scene to say "your brown" was visible, because the image was nothing but almost the Bush air leakage bits. The performance was fantastic and the film was only a waste of the idea that the DVD was a good idea. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have been stuck to his neighbors at least washing his hair. He did all that he had done on his phone but did not sell anything as a salesman. She will be dismissed weeks ago. His girlfriend (once once in the Quetude) was dancing at the bar, at least he looked hot. <br /> <br /> The person Vincent (who saw that) was so annoying with his phone call. Any normal person takes her home and hits him with 4 bits by 2. <br /> <br /> In this world, I do not know who likes it. I actually saw people tolerating torture.
