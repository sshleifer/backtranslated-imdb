This type of movie is about 50 years old schoolgirls and those who think of themselves as social issues - but a source has not been found. Actors - I think all of them are amateur - try their best, but the script is so clipped and fools that they can not save it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " A quick translation 2.30 in the morning on one of the songs of the song has happened: "I am a wolf of society, an emotionally helpless person." <br /> <br /> Please!
