Uzumaki, which translates into "spiral", joins this new wave of Asian movies like Asian violence, such as Rings, Zoo-On, and The Eye (with two remixes.) And Dark Water and the stories of two sisters, diverse, supernatural The thriller element is smaller than the characteristic features of other films, the only thing left to do is that it is not the same as an oddity to Tim Burton or David Lynch, but the unpredictable Geek and impartial manner. <br /> <br /> <br /> She starts with a girl, a different child on her, her best friend and her father is wrapped with Uzumakis! Everything creates anxiety for Uzumakis, people die and you see the ablaze. So okay, it will go along, amusing myself by spirals, amusing amusing, the letters do not seem to go anywhere, but I will play along. We cursed the city by Uzumakis, and people started screaming in Uzumakis and the point is everywhere, the movie is a disaster, it does not know where it goes, without the power of Uzumakis! !!!!! Some cool ideas such as when the mother sees Uzumakis, her fingers cut off, but another scene where she listens to her husband (outside the grave), tell him that she has her wings, the scene she operated was not just ridiculous , Even the Chesi was not fun, there is some (little bit) of cool scenes, such as collecting Uzumakis's father and Uzumakis's hairstyle. Yes, Uzumakis hair, outside of it, seems like it is taken from a fruit snack commercial where you eat Ujumakis fruit snack, its taste is so incredible that your hair becomes vajumakis, if it is not bad enough then suddenly snail male Is there manel ?? Anyway ?? And you know why? OK? Because their shells have UVUUVAWYCHISES ?? This is just enough time for the Left to end anti-climatic climate and at that time I was sick of Fijgin 'Uzumakis. Ujumaki here, do you know, how many people you are looking for? If you want to see a movie about the spiral, then see Pi (3.1416), now you will get some cool cooling ideas which are a few simple things in life and dark city. <Br /> <br /> This movie could work as a music video, it has already achieved a religious title and for that reason I was forced to see it, but after doing it, I'm not sure why people think it's cool . I was really frustrated.
