All the kids' movies I saw over the years were probably the worst it was. I have taken four kids from 7 to 11 years old and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> This script was based on the Wiley Wonka style story but it did not have anything to do with it. <Br / <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie wasting your time, then this is bad. <br /> <br /> They are making a signal, so it can be valuable to see if it can be worse, but I do not think it's possible.
