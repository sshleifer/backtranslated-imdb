This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I saw a review in a magazine magazine magazine, it seemed like it was interesting, but when I got the chapter, I realized that it was totally stupid. Well, the first 2 or 3 chapters are okay, and the series has a value. But as the plot progresses, it becomes completely inconsistent. This series tries to display some mysteries based on Christian mythology, but it is a total fool. It features some demons and stigmata scene ... completely surprised. It seems that the series is deeply worn, critically or legally reviewed, but an observer, with some brain and cultural references, will soon realize that all the components used are not real money: they can only imply <br /> <br /> final The chapters are completely full of selfless elements: the fight between the cats, between the demons And in reference to the war in controlling giants (there is no apparent reason). The final is completely meaningless; An unconscious observer will see a floating final that gives them a place to meditate; But the truth is this: The end and the whole series is a total incubator and estimated candid.
