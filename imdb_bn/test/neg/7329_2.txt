This movie is specially available 101 and horizon 102: Available as a special "bonus" feature for the double disc. It has nothing to do with movies, it shows that producer / director Dudelson and Clawl are in a gem. Like other movies, it's a young man who goes to a building where they get trapped inside and runs down the street paths a lot, when they pick one by one. At the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity. By the worst of these three things <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to open the mausoleum of the dead at Halloween-night. The museum does not have many exhibitions and they are all types of Central American The museum also has meat eating, infection-spreading bodies, as well as an ancient cannon fighter and two female fighters. <br /> <br /> This movie is very repetitive. It kills people very quickly, you are wondering who they are going to kill - at this time some people show no explanation, so that they die. Strangely, one of the characters has a cell phone and is able to actually call the police, who actually take it seriously and display them in the museum. When someone tries to choose the lock to enter, another tells him that "compulsory entry" will be. If you've found people stuck in a building that was injured, I think it's irrelevant. Police are stupid even in mobile phones, when they shoot a zombie on top, it goes down, but they shoot other bodies in the chest and they do not go down. They happen to shoot another zombie in the head, and it goes down. They continue to shoot left zombies in the chest. Stupid <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This is something interesting, however, some attacks are made in the same way, so there is no argument. <br /> <br /> Awesome.
