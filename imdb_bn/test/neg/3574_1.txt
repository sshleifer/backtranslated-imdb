I recently rented the movie in DVD and thought it was an interesting choice both to the north of England (Bradford) and to be interested in making movies. However, it soon became apparent that the film lacked the improved level of script-based development. The letters were weak and often stereotyped and lacking in the substance of the story. The subject may be an attractive foundation for a film. However, this delivery appeared naive and frankly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it felt that it was ruling on characters - the filmmakers would punish and reward the thinkers wherever necessary. It felt a little weird and stupid, and felt odds with the 'reality' used in the shooting style. For me, the film deals with letters and content rather than heavy elephants and painful approaches. It seems that the author has already decided how he wanted to finish the story and set it around Crow-Barring, except for everything else to fit. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I feel strongly is that under the water there was a greed film. UK film financiers do not see that there is more to British movies than 'Rettiyas reality'. It almost became a safe alternative. The film is a wonderful wonderful play ground for fantastic ideas and it is not being exploited by UK filmmakers. There are many talent in the UK here. It is unfortunate that most of these people end up with 100% of music videos and ads or they go to America. <br /> <br /> If love / hatred is spent in 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a TV drama only then it worked well.
