It originally came as a 2-DVD set associated with American graffiti; I was not here for several months in Iraq and at the moment I will see a lot, after the first ten minutes I dropped this movie into the trash. This movie was so bad that I do not know where to start. Badly played, shot, directed, written, scored, edited. My 9-year-old daughter was better at the first light of filming - and she portrays a sleeping dog. (Think about it, I'll give that part of the movie cinematography 9, but I favor it.) If you have a slight appreciation for making quality films then all costs should be avoided. The only release of any character in this movie is not stored for the Icelandic girl, which does not have a single line in English. I do not waste much time on my bad time describing this.
