WARNING !! This review may have spoilers. The back of the box is confusing. This is telling the story of children's ghosts, which they call this shit about this work, but then it implies that they all will be killed by some killers. It does not happen. They seem to be a little interesting, especially with dogs and all the defeats, but mostly rather annoying, wood monsters, some silent girls and major movies.
