I'm not sure whether it's a comedy, or I found it pretty funny. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a distorted pastor and gardener should fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you will get some smile at least Eccentric jealous father, satanic sister, doll's mother valley, and then a cowboy boyfriend; Help fight against giants from favorite Ishtoob with skirts behind animals. Sometimes it feels like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see it. Instead of cool head-twist, sailor curse, and crucified refrigeration that did in Regan Exorcist; You have jumped on his bed in Isobella, as it is a trumpoline, hiding in his closet, and jumping from a hello-loft. Yeah, it's a chuck. The cheese has gone wild. So, if you want to see a quote awakening horror movie which is waiting for you to finish with some laughing prices ... this is your movie.
