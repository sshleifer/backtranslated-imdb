First, the nature of the film is beautiful, and there is little Mongol music. Well, the horses looked at the Mongolians and camels, but that was all in Mongolia. Oh, the message is played by a Mongolian actress, although a hairy performance. But she is pretty beautiful, which somehow revitalizes the lack of performance in her part. <br /> <br /> However, how could I have understood this painful surveillance piece of this 1.30 hour imagination completely failed. Mr.Bodrov. Absence of any feeling of complete coordination of plot. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. Actually, there was no story here, just a few scenes with some of the "Malaysian" dresses, with the slightest visible scene, the word Mongolia is somewhat piggyin. Most actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia, and it was a boring path about what was a "Mongolia". The dialog is slow and the scenes are slow with the dialog. Battle scenes are ridiculous. All the supernatural stone hair and it is probably ready for the lack of stories. <br /> <br /> Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at her, no one could understand how this person could be a leader who might unite the psychological tribe. He looked sleepy, soft, strong and kind for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not want to start this historic relevance of film waste. Chinggis-Khan see half of the movie as a slave, her two first children born from other men, see her wife Tangut merchant selling herself ... My blood starts boiling. And where are beautiful stories about friendship between Tumuzin and Zaku? One could make it a great movie. Where is the story of the rise of Tumuzin? His childhood, his relationship with his family, with his brothers, how he struggled to survive in his family's powerful enemies? Where did Bhan Khan, who helped him a lot? Where is the life of survival, life of living, their traditions, and their relationship with other people around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the development of letters? Combining Tamuzin with what we saw, we were completely unsuccessful and how they separated them, and most importantly, how Tamushen became Chingis-Khan, how he was able to combine a Mongolian tribe without any resources and military power and created such organized . The effective war machine that crushed a country after another nation and made the largest land empire in history. It can create quite interesting and dramatic stories with complex complex plots and deep letters, but unfortunately we did not see any scenes of it in the creation of Bodrum.
