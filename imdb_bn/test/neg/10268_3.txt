Everything seems so absurd that seems absent here. It is only "to run the rock climbing cycle of rock", but without the main motivation. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story, actually it seems that they ignore it the first one. Here, the monsters run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, most residents are grisly killed in fashion. The effect of makeup seems to actually convincecing less than the first time. Although the actor was not quite bright in the Demon, 2 in Demo were actually very bad. You do not care about these characters, all at all. The plot is incomplete, music poor (in addition to Salmon Boswell songs), it is not least scary; It's not just good. <br /> <br /> The worst movie was also associated with Dario Argante and Lamberto Bava (Bacho is a cameo in this movie, not very funny). <br /> <br /> 3 maybe too many ratings, but at least I could see it all and I did not think it was supposed to stop midway. My advice Original stick
