I watched the first 30-40 minutes of the film on television and agreed that it was the worst of the series. This is not funny, even Randy Coed can not save this mess. Enrique Idol N. L. Was not funny at Euro Holidays, and he's even worse here. The only interesting scene where they are at the airport and some people equipped with Santa's camera shout, "Does anyone lose it?" As he hangs up a prosthetic legs ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 out of a star ****
