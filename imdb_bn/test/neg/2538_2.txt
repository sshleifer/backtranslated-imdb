Anyone who can see tromba movie knows, and appreciates what they're going to get. Not saying, I do not think it was possible to make a movie, and still mandatory. I got to see myself finally how bad it was to see. First, it has an American action character with an American character, which works and works like Christopher Lloyd and Rambo's dying son of "Taxi". She has made dresses like Sly's "Cobra" in Jakarta and even has a custom-made building firing range (with action-pod cutout of her most enemies), although she is in CIA and has just arrived a few days ago. Gun-game (M-16s, no lip glow on the sound effects only), motorcycles (busts through walls), carts (where no one interacts physically) and even some sex (where all actors are ugly). The main plot of this epic should be at least reasonable, but not here. It's the world's most dangerous drug cartel which is going to find "drug detector device". Why would they need it? That is not revealed, why not kill the drug dragon dogs? No sense makes, however, it is taken seriously. Actors should be praised because they thought that the film would make them all famous and try hard to "work". Best line? "Now you dance whore whore prostitute to your grave!" The best view? The rambo leaps towards the flying helicopter, the machine gun from the hammer, continues, falls, shoots the helicopter, the helicopter flies, is thrown into the water. F ** King Genius! You can not appreciate the trash, do not see it. If you can, it's awesome. One last thing, have I instructed three Punjabi brothers?
