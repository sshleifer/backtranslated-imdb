I do not know that this overwhelming film has been labeled as an unauthorized sign in "French connection", but it also has the same flaws: The script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninterrupted and has gone out of the picture. , And the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy, even the great cheezing order can not even liven up things.
