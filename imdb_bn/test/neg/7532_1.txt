This is a really really bad movie. That might seem like an oversimplification. A mad, pillow beat is comparable to a tiny destabilizing humiliation. Indeed, I can not tell about the confusing mock plot, the real torture act (I'm speaking nasty here), or the random image of violence towards women, which is basically a horrific horror movie pasch about chaos - movies, not good and decent in human culture that this affront Promotion that makes mistakes. Please accept my word for me, never see it ... I'm serious. Close. You will be thanked for it later.
