Even though the great director Bad Batechke is an impressive effort and fantastic yet, one of the critics of the inconsistent actress Nina Folk believes that this is the character of a particular type of B movie. It's not just good kind. And a committed premise and an overactive cell machine are wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic plot - Nina, there is a nightmare, because of her nervousness, a nurse on vacation from wartime duty. He looks at a resident colleague, where he breathes his nerves and realizes that in the dream, although he never met her. Meanwhile, it is our hateful person working as a spy, and an extra secret, the Hush-Huss mission that is going to fail is going out. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are noses. And plot holes And the smart people acting in fashion can reach completely unnecessary scraps, so that the running time can run in an hour. Finally, the film becomes a competition that groups of groups can work more foolishly. If FBI and OSS were acting like this crew, then we would have '42. <br /> <br /> Lost war. <br /> The film is rather a smoking shot (despite the best efforts of the smoke machine) and the performance - like the Columbia B TCM looks like many recently - oddly unorganized. It is less stylish than similar budgeted Warner Bros., but it's less fun to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Probably the problem is that the script is not going to do such a style during frustration and the actors are tired of a schedule from their five films annually.
