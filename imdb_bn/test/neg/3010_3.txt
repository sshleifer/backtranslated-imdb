A professional product with mental actors who does not touch the heart or the funny bones, is trying hard. Quality Cast, Stark setting, and excellent cinematography have made you optimistic for the Fargo or High Plane Draftster but sorry, the soup was not spicy ... or for meat. A 3 (10) for the effort.
