The novel Nottinger Abbey is a boyfriend for this BBC adaptation and throwing objects on the TV screen - In fact, if Jane Austen sees himself, he'll be a little upbeat and probably out of the box. In the adaptation of Maggie Wade, Gothic novels (and readers of Gothic novels) turned into ridicule in Abbey of North Bengal. <br /> <br /> The role of Katherine Murland in this adaptation is closely related to Austen's Catherine. An impressive, liberal girl whose imagination simply drives away with her. But Henry Tylen of the novel is not a protagonist of a Gothic novel, rattan, molecular line - he is a lively, filthy house and a living (almost right, a missionary from Henry Tilani, a charm dropped entirely from the script). Some of the best scenes from the novel, when Henry is completely dead, indecently cited psychologically, Catherine is not portrayed as an expression in fiction, journal, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc. When a large part of Henry's personality is lost, those scenes are not unnecessary. Also, Peter Firth's appearance is not correct-Henry Tilney is considered to be 24 or 25, dark hair and brown skin, 35 or 40 and not blonde. <br /> <br /> There are many irrationalities in this adaptation. That wonder and hate revelation - who is Marchioness, and what he is doing in the story ?! Why is John Thorpe a dunce and less a schemer? Why is a fort in Northjan Abbey? With her romantic attitude, the novel's cathrine, hidden paragraphs, and dark tapestries look forward, but the answer is that North Africa's Abbey is really a comfortable, modern house-mocking element! Why painted ordinary teal as drunk? Why is Catherine Mrs. Allen's strange view of her fingers threading? Catherine's imagination simply goes with her in Neverna, with Henri gradually correcting her. And in the end, why has so much information changed about the death of the Tilani family and Mrs. Tillani? To make the story even more terrible? It is very strange to ignore all these curiosity and more easily. <br /> <br />>
