A young man, who never knew of his birth parent, got an old farm in an isolated part of West Virginia after the death of his normal father. She visited her property with a cross section of possible victims including comic relief black guy and a conventional lesbian couple. (Hmm, skinny will be dry?) Unfortunately, the party ends when the evil spirits are used by their evil grandfather for the death and fear of the soul's soul. This film is well started. It is a casual photo of depression-era photographs and phone calls against the statement of FDR - I believe, it establishes its first appearance in a murderer SquareCro movie. I made some hopes for the film, which was partially realized. The story was fair enough. The setting was fairly bucolic. Photography was basically the focus. While acting, when no great shakes, this budget level was slightly above for horror movies. Fear of fear that the film can actually work within the narrow demands of the movie. But they were not cheap they were. They were not all horrible. Good giant, good movie. These scarecrows alone will not scare away, Dorothy.
