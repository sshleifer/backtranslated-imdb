This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the "Funny movie that's so bad". Rather, it's just plain bad. Other critics have mentioned bad light, but beyond the abundance of bad plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, poor screenplay and uncertainly depended a lot of acting talent. The main characters are one dimensional and annoying. (It is difficult for somebody to feel sympathy). The four characters are difficult to see as close friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, (it does not take long to see it).
