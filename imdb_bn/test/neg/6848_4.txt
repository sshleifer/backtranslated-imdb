The three young film theater workers were given the task of restoring a long-running old-time theater, which took place many years ago in the murder of murderers. It seems as if more murders have occurred since then, but it remains to be known to these three young start-ups that they will eventually make it big for themselves. Things to reach at the grand re-opening night became unknown, and unknown things suddenly started moving around themselves, and a terrible old man became very frustrated in the premises. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is really awesome. In fact, if Mary Vernov's secretary does not have any vulgar free explicit statements for the character, but the scene that she stole every scene visually and steals incredibly sticky but totally sexy Selina, steals incredibly hot chick, it is a total loss. I'm not saying more about this movie that the only other good movie theater of the movie theatrical genre has been really innovative, although very poor (a choice for me but not necessarily for others), fashion. The rest pours only into the constant riddle (very few really find humor in it) and after the other annoyances performed by the expected slasher, they kill one boring character one after the other.
