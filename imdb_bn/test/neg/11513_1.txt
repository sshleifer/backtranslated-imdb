With actors like Depardieu and Richard it's really a difficult task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master making a slow motion setup without any widgets and depth imagery. The story of this movie is high but the character is low. You do not know any of the characters without superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what all is slapstick. Her style may be described at the hit and miss. Of course some slip on a banana hole when they smile. Weber this much indicates his humor. It's a shame that how good he is in the genius. Many good French comedians were dismissed by the middle director.
