It's hard to know whether this ham-brained B-Movie Adventure is a fool, respect or just plain betel, but it does not work as you see it. Based on Michael Crichton's novels, it is a nutritional mix of lost cities, giant hippo, giant monkeys, bad visual effects, and a little bit of dialogue. The first one that hates this tashi is Gorilla, which can communicate in sign language, and it is not necessary to say that the film does not get any better than that point. Making these old ropes somewhat effective, Tim Curry whispered ham's fever and makes a whim, which denies detection and is also Hodgson, who feels that it is a burden of old garbage.
