When I first saw it was a joke. I could remember "You get 8mm camera, I'll get my younger brother's giant toy, we'll make a movie!" Why would someone like this in the modern era of 2001 create a science-fiction movie, it seems to have been made in the early 80's. A director of Indian cigar shop, a 4-year-old boy from the director, who is stolen from a burning power shop, has special effects on poverty and above all, making him a famous producer who must make him famous that a director. The end result was not spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. Have fun with Venus and I'm sure everybody involved has a blast with their silly film. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 to make a brave, hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
