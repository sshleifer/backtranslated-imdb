For some reason you could keep the characters on the island and you could stay in the same movie. The first was the original story, the second stole from King Kong, and finally (I hope) the story of this triangle was completely bypassed. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and see them run for their life. That was it was all about me. The special effect was 8 dollars but was not suitable. Wait for your local area's discount theater and see it for a profit. I do not even bother to rent it. That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.
