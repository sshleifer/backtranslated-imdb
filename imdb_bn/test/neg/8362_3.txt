Kristina Richie congratulates the film for creating this movie and putting her wages behind this important issue and trying to create a great movie. Richie is my favorite actress: She is so gifted, so natural, her reaction is perfect and so she constantly radiates energy, which often gives misapplied word "star" belief. <br /> <br /> The movie missed its mark for many reasons, but perhaps it is notable for the visible unexpectedness of the screen to create a compelling story ... More later. Cast is excellent at first glance, but to remember it, Jessica Lang as a Jewish mother is very Protestant and not exactly right, Anne does not come close to showing condolences and encouragement from the hit book, and when you make a movie, how are you anne hey and Do not tell Jessica Lange anyway? But the real problems are in the making of films: First, the failure of any kind of sympathy for the character of Elizabeth Warzell and the second to say something meaningful about the general and terrible situation that the poor girl has found herself. <br /> Unfortunately, for the construction of flashbacks, Leiji comes as much as the most affected teenager, but the book does not come as much as the devastating ill. This is a major problem. This story was told from the beginning to the end and from the therapist's couch. His depression was only eight or nine, when both society and home started due to devastating social causes, and this is a suitable sympathy for him, not only in his case, but also an important factor in the matter of gravity. He is so gifted, and so weak and unhappy soul is so early, that his heart can not help but reach him because of his prey. This image can be missed. Finally, one is trying to tell what the film is trying to say: this is a bio-diversity of a seriously affected girl, but it is a movie about a nation who can not get her work together; It is not very clear but interesting in the book, where Harvard is more confused than the average college college. Eventually the movie is not able to find these messages compulsory and it is very bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an essential requirement in a country so that many people can not work without chemical crutch? They do not try to work with difficult and challenging concepts and give them any address in a less or less compelling way. The Challenger Disaster is an interesting figure as a dangerous American symbol, but its effects are not affected due to cross-shooting and inadequate development of control themes. <br /> <br /> The performance of the rickshaw is tight and heartfelt, and the best in its acting career. <br /> <br /> Michael Williams is fantastic in his role.
