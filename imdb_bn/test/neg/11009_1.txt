At first I should say that I really wanted to choose this movie. In most cases actors and actresses saw their portions and were fairly good in their role, but the film did not have any real intentions. It seems to be so thick that there was no interesting story ever spread. Also, the camera work is often damaged, the hijacking camera tries to work and fails badly. Most of the time, the shots meant to look cool would end up confusing. Perhaps some of the translation times were lost, but some letters were just stupid. Like a dog, a gentle boy is a soft boy? Uhhhhhhh OK. Overall, a fat stinking 1/10. Do not value your time
