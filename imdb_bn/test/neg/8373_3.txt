Maybe we have only a whole different idea of ​​the Aussies and there is only one problem here in my lie. All of my DVDs have a database (including receipts as it was - which it was) and so, when a new entry is made, I always refer to IMDB as Routine, Runtime, Director, Lead etc. This, I've noticed that it was a comedy and so I decided to see it at such a time when I wanted some light and good smile. Well, it was not! There was absolutely no sunshine and the illogical amount of illogical helplessness (actually allowed radio broadcasters to broadcast what Stew Jones had spread)? What would happen if a suitable child is safe in his station?). <Br /> <br /> Instead of enjoying a good smile (or even a little quarrel) I found the whole thing totally depressing. I gave it 3 out of 10 but to be honest, I do not know for those 3 things! I think the basics of light and sound were not too bad! <br /> <br /> A visible stone has broken up to us (Giovanni Ribeisi) who still seems capable of driving a reasonable car (who supplies fuel?) and can rent a nice apartment to rent it?) A beautiful Given the opportunity to form what could be a meaningful relationship with what turned into a girl, she even blew that up! Probably he was (Lin Collins) who earned 3 points in this movie! Instead of headdresser, he acts as a stripper, which is actually some of the aspects of this movie which is quite sensible ("I do this work one night in a two-week headrace"). <br /> <br /> Do not forget that you want to be depressed and want to have a toothache!
