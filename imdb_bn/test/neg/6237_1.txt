What was the point of this ruthless film? It looked pretty interesting at the beginning but quickly fell flat on her face. Should be based on his true story, but there is no script writer in Hollywood to scream loudly? People iv'e sometimes saw these guys in some good movies, defoe can play just about anything and when I see a movie I do not have a problem to rent it but I'm starting wonder.redford too. Great actors are also slipping; Perhaps their hard-up or just lose their sense. The dialogue is long and horribly heavy eyes, especially at home with family. I wonder if the actor is going to hit it here? Perhaps ... Oscars Oscars?
