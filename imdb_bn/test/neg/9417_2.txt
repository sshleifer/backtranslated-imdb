Solo is a poor film - that can not be ignored. Most played in the very wood (the only exception being played by Adrian Broder's Solar Builder Bill) and the story is a little enough that you will probably forget it when you are watching the movie. Who said that such movies are more about the action than plots / acting, and as such, the action set pieces are live or killed - since the end of this kind of film - some 14-year-olds laugh at some of the adult films of real-time film clips. And even this is failing to provide Solo - what little action is done worse, shameless and uninspired After watching the trailer for it on television, I expect something rather than a Predator, with a robot instead of a proto. Instead I got a fairly solitary worker film with a deeply ruthless attempt by taking the message that robots could feel too much. See Watch Terminator II or Pride. Besides both the classic that this film wants for a sudden, it lacks the motivation or budget.
