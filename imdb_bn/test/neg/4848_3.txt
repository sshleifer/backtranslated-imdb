I saw this movie while in France and I must confuse it. It is a story of a cavity thief and a young singer who runs together in Morocco at the same time together and forms a connection. Easy enough? Well, the problem is that this kind of film that is both fiction (the movie is not played completely) and in reality (what I actually saw was that it was really a dream, or was it just a dream?). Aside from those parameters, the film was bilingual, it was really hard to follow and I was not sure what had happened at the end. I imagine that some deep artists can understand this film better than me, and it may require more than one philosophy to understand.
