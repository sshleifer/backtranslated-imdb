This is a real middle film in the vein of "Baku Bananjai". Cast almost runs like "Mad Max" wannabes, and they seem to share a joke that they do not want to share with viewers. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the responsible actresses who is happy to be happy all over the film, but she is not worth the rental price. Space Maggot started an electric fire, and 4 votes a burnt.
