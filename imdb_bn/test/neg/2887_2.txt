Yet it is not good enough enough to be enjoyable again. Actually this one is annoying. It has been created correctly, although the script is bad, the effect is correct and the average of the acting. (Always great in addition to James Mason, but this underlying language) <br /> <br /> I think it's hard to write anything about this movie because it did not respond to me. <<br /> <br /> Soft, dusty, dust, dust, dust.
