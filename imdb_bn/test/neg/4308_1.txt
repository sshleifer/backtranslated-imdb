I knew it was going to be horrific but this terrible !! !!, it's one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen, nor an awesome thing will happen! All the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly annoying !, plus the end is especially hair! I'm the big fan of Michael Dudicoff, because he's broken down here and looks very boring and does not show any emotion! Plus when the movie was over, I shouted aloud loudly loudly! There was no plot like the movie and everything was not there and the ice was awful (although some things were okay) but Dudikof and Yevette Nipper had chemistry together. He failed in a scene in the mindset of the movie, but Yevette Niper did not show so much emotion, but there is a suitable car Chase scene, but my horror movie is not enough to recommend it! The Plus dialog is violent. Avoid this movie as a plug-in is not a great thing, please avoid it and believe me you can thank me later. Directions horrible! Fred Ollen Roy has done a terrific job here, doing a weird camera, ridiculously looking set pieces, terrible angles, ridiculous use of stock footage, and incredibly slow motion to keep the film. Terrible acting! Michael Dudicoff is not near his usual amazing soul, he looks very annoying and sometimes does not see any emotions, his character is too neutral, because I can not believe that he signed for this trash, he did not have any chemistry Yvette Napier (Dudikoff still With rules !!!) Ice-T seems to be barely bothered and bothered, and he's not convinced me a bit. Hans was not very good here, she was a bit upset, I did not like her. Yvette Napier is beautiful but here really was terrible, she did not show much emotion, and there was no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not have a rape about her character! Art Hendale, (Wyan Marsh), Cathy Harron (Catherine Marsh), and the rest are bad. Avoid Like Plugin Overall! Fred O'Neill Roy and Steve Lathas should be ashamed! 5 of the BMMB
