I can not find any redeeming value in this movie. It seems that Lion King is dependent on thinking in school. The father dies, the boy can not fill the shoe and tries to escape, etc. etc. The only difference (except for the jungle, instead of being in the wild), trying to "lively things" with the Bernard club, type music They go way to the top to try to be calm. The problem is not really cool. It's like "that guy" Everyone who is "hang out" with a small crowd in a vain effort to "know those guys" at least one and still ride on the youth. They try to be calm to fit but they are not really. This movie is <br /> <br /> <br /> But if you have money to provide money and you think that someone can overcome your life in 90 minutes but do not let me stop by all means.
