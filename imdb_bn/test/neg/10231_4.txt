For my New Year my little cousin had to hire a few movies and he chose Swann Princess: The Minster of the Enchanted Kingdom and the Little Mermaid 2, and we saw both of the films when he was asleep, I realized that I could get a couple Comments. :) Although it is a very sugar cartoon, it really was not that bad. These plots are new to children and it can be a great part of these stories to them. The odead has discovered that Derek has secretly kept secret secrets to the secret mystery and he immediately told Derek to destroy them, but he is a man, generally he does not, and tells him that he can achieve magic without his help. No When a witch named Jelda puts his hand on it, he discovers that Derek wants to destroy a spell that he wants to finish, and kidnaps the destet to recover this information. <br /> <br /> Swan Princess: The mysteries of the tempting states are silly and predictable, but for the kids I'd like to tell it to go one. It is very rare that we have this clean cut cartoon day now, so I'm going to reduce the film a bit. It was just strange that all the voices had suddenly changed, I grew up with the first, so I think it stuck on my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
