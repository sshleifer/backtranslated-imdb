The worst movie I saw during this looooong. It reminds me of a SAARC Doo Souliil show shown in Vegas six years ago - without athleticem. By this I mean something interesting, artsy, the images appear randomly, without any durable framework. Fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. These devices just do not justify and are certainly _Tuvalu_. Abbey apologizes to Lincoln: You can fool some people in some time.
