I saw this accident in the Fox Channel this morning (my dog ​​awakened me) - I saw it many years ago and thought I was fairly well remembered. As a kid, I was enjoying it. But now? Another poster commented, most rolls were without order, and it was weird at first, and odd, that was to fit production - which was awful and very funny. The "big" fundraiser shows ("You're in the show business, I'm in the show business, most of the kids are in the show business, give a show)" music numbers do not come from anywhere, all about putting a show, and then completely unrelated The "direct" scene fades without applause. Leading female girlfriend shows, lines and lines of dialogue spits out, then invisible. I was half-awake, and it's like every insane minute.
