I hear this movie is bad? They even feared me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I saw it after coming to the national television. Kevin Williamson saw the movie means torture! His circumstances are not funny, obviously not terrible and at least bit creative. Apprentice Mrs Tingle breathes in the same annoying atmosphere as his brainless series 'Dawson's Creek', and is probably also meant for the same target group. Before credit started 5 people already wanted to hug and they said that I love you-the sentence. The soundtrack is filled with annoying pop / rock and it is not as good as the story is super-thin. At the end of graduation, three students were cheated by the evil teacher in the school. There are teachers in every high school, you know ?? To save their skin, they tried to convince Mrs. Tingle that they had no intention of cheating, but this attempt has been a terrible mistake. Usually high school humor is completely lost on me, feeling overdose suppressor and acting (with exception of Helen Miron) is abominable. I'm sure Katie Holles can work ?? That gift proved by its role 'gift' ?? But he must immediately stop taking the role of frumpish girl. Earlier, the only positive comment was that Helen Mirren had just gone as captivating casting. Catherine Turner's 'Serial Mom'! The role suits her perfectly and you can not imagine playing with someone else. Apart from that, these teenagers were avoided unused.
