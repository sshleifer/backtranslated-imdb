Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin has discovered that Raymond Boar is protecting David Copperfield / Rick Blen from charges of murder associated with an assistant like Peter Scolari. A technique involving medieval a suspended glass coffin becomes terrible and Nancy's body is damaged by one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scolari got seduced by her and she claimed that she was impregnated. Secondly, he was living under an elite name and was secret from his past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought that he was doing something in the law enforcement army that could do something good. When the old boy goes to the village home to find the truth. For Ken Malansky, a little more than usual, he almost killed himself. <br /> <br /> A great error in this mystery is simple forensic. The medical examiner's report should provide strong evidence that the hunter was killed in such a way that Scolari probably could not do the job. The police should have been looking for a different direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> When you see that the killer you do not blame personally, then you'll get the investigation officer James McEquin wrong from the start. It's kind of spoils this special Mason movie film.
