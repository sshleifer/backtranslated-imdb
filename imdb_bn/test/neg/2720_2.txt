I appear to be minor, but I was quite terrible "radio". Most of these "heartfelt" films seem to have been cliche. <br /> <br /> The inspiration for love characters on the radio has never been explained. We just wanted to admit that everyone, except just a few bad apples, loved the radio. <br /> <br /> You can see almost all the big moments in the story 100 yards away. When the movie you wanted to draw "Awww" or your tissue, I was turning my eyes and I was instead seeing "Rudy". <br /> <br /> Cast had some good performance. Very bad they were not given a good movie willing to appear.
