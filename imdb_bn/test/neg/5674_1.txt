This show is made based on the ideas that are + unnecessary + repeat = funny. Comedic writings do not exist, in fact, I do have serious reactions even compared to any kind of entertainment. Here's the premises. Two girls mistakenly posted on the Internet after their Schengenies and their initial success, they think that they will create a web-cast to show their brightness. <br /> <br /> OK, so where do I start? Let's start with a sunny track, but the usable audience should not be used to laugh. According to Foley guys, this show is the most fun thing on the planet. All of us should drop the load in the front of the pants because the luminosity in front of us is the brightness. Smile tracks go every few seconds seriously. It mostly tracks up on the use of over-the-counter Euro-over for the sunny King. <br /> <br /> Then our face-to-face-to-our-lung-the-poodle-clan-word-mind-minded strategy is also employed. Do not forget to make the new word of Hua and funny trick Is it web-to-lysias and pop-stastic? <br /> <br /> finally played. I can not fully complain here The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should be corrected and corrected by professional help. Nike actors should define their crafts due to inexperience. Instead, in normal nike fashion, the actor is placed in front of the camera and is called "law". Most of which are the lines Robotics curriculum, missed time and overall epic fails. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting representation because of any disadvantage of this show. Do not waste your time. This show is debasing debut all of humanity
