I had only hoped to be the other dancer in this movie, David Dhawan. <br /> <br /> Great bad reaction to David Dhawan He has made many interesting movies in the past which did not make any sense, but none of them had the pain bag !! Is it the waste of talent and beauty? Donor does not agree on the movie like this actor because of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no variant of the reality of this movie. The movie is not perfect from below. Bollywood is the ideal and potential Bollywood. <br /> <br /> The only thing Katrina was looking for was to watch this movie, but we do not need to watch such a movie! Rebuilding Hollywood's Flickr Hits It is clear that Bollywood directors will not be able to create the perfect maker. I consider this to be the worst movie I ever seen. Terrible 1/10
