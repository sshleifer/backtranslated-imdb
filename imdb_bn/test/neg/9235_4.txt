Immediately convinced by IMDB 7.0 points, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I have seen this movie boring (about 2 hours) and clichés full, after many years of childhood strikes, more than one girl got multiple personalities. Tamara Kadagli is funny in this movie, conversation speed etc., you will see it, she looks tough in American movies, probably too much copies. I will describe this film as a general American thriller with little bit of Turkish touch, unfortunately again I am sure that comedy and dramas are only the only branch to watch in Turkish movies. Anyway I've given this movie a 4, it's very annoying and full of Clichés
