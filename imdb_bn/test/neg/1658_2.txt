Seasonal teens on a small Ohio city summer break do not find any meaningful way to fill their time. Consider some Chicago driving; Others are blamed for drinking and their colleagues. Alcohol fuel is a random law of arrogance, bullies rude up a homeless man and stole a strange book. Handwriting is an archive made to call the giant forces. After one night or two, one of them is reading a substance and is quickly possessed. He turned into a deadly killer and quietly started to hunt his former colleagues. <br /> <br /> "Daily Summer" is a amateur production with a microscope budget. Production was low, but filmmakers were smart enough to be aspiring. Special props or shooting were limited to the location. There is nothing really played in the weak and plainplay. Positive, special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget movie standards. In spite of this, it is very low. On the one side of the makeup effect, this film is going slightly, even for die-hard gore-hounds. Not recommended.
