I like to find J-Horror, Anime and even the Riot Pink movement, some of whom claimed this member, but it did nothing for me. I'm going to move one step further and the label of the biggest reduction in my movie viewing career. <br /> <br /> Three young Rockaby girls get their kick out of rape. The group started developing a concert about their pass-time when her child sister almost kept her in the act. Immediately, once the group activates itself as once the friends begin to fight each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is long continuously shot which is littered with increasing only the problem. Above all, even when the movie starts doing something interesting, it suddenly becomes confused with a miracle that never gives a conjecture. For example, after one of the friends changed their mind about the attack on girls, he went out and did it again, but then prevented his friends from accepting it. is not it? Cinematography is slow and light is poor. Writing is OK, as acting, which makes this a sub-par cinematic effort from the beginning. Combine the lack of technical expertise with radioactive content and there is nothing more than waste of your time. <br /> <br /> And, an extra note, at least one of the women who appear in Buff's view that old stuff is doing old. <br /> <br /> 3/10
