After watching the Road Warrior and feeling the superiority of that film, I did not say Mad Mackay right, I was a little disappointed. It started in the desert movie as a kind of kids and it was combined with the Mad Mac franchise (bad idea). Casting was not the best, I mean Tina Turner to come? One of the main problems of this movie is that there is no good villain. No wiz, no hamungas, even a terrorist! If you were planning to see this sub-side action flick (can this also be called?) Make sure that you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Mac, but both are good. Another problem with this movie is that there are many people, even in the order of the Thunderdome War, MacO does not kill anybody! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not the best) and after watching this movie, it has left a very bad taste in my face.
