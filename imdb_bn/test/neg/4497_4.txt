Photography is perfect, acting is quite good, but virtually every other section of Greek tikon is an authentic bore. The genre of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the inspiration of the love of the real life, is that the film is full of shiny but absolutely empty soap operas all day. Visitors embrace the whole "Celebrity Magazine Culture" (rich and famous paparazzi photographs and Gossipi stories) will certainly find a lot to overcome their hunger here. But those who like movies about some other substances, art, and curiosity, they will get a butt-nunking slogan for the 107-minute running time. <br /> <br /> American President James Cassidy (James Francisco) and his beautiful wife Lease (Jackline Bisset) is the official business in Greece. A humorously rich Greek shipping tycoon, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), draws attention to Lease at a party of his elegant manar. Since both of them are married to someone else, they have immediate attraction. Later, at a private party on his yacht, Tomasis made his wishes known to the lease. After a while, the President was killed when Cassidy was strolling over a beach. Lease is stunned by his death and sorry, but he is not long before seeking the comfort of arms in his Greek lover Tomasis. Eventually, two of them married and their loved ones spoke favorably of the world's newspapers, magazines, photographers and dresses. <br /> <br /> Laughing aloud with the producers of the film, Denied that it is the play of the story of Kennedy-Onassis. They wanted to show this movie as the original story, which was transformed into fiction. But anyone with a brain can see from his inspiration drawing. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that Greek tech has received the treatment of Hollywood in her love life (if the rumor was believed, then in the hands of Annabeth Quinn was actually in the hands of Tamasis!) J. Lee Thompson is really the right indicator for this type of movie ?? Is he better suited to the action sheets like Navarone and Ice cold guns in Alex ?? But he is an uninspired, mercenary sued with professional sufficiency. Amani is very watchable as Tamasis; Biset looks as lovely as his desire; Francisco uses a mouthpiece of honesty to create his treacherous smile and a credible politician. Their performance is good on the page, but there is nothing deep for the actors. Likewise, Toni Richmond's photography gives an elegant patronage while transferring from an external location to the next, but the density of scratches proves that there is nothing behind the shiny out of the film.
