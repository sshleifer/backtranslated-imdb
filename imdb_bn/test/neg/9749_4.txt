Perhaps this is the only movie where I have seen that the IMDB review on both sides of the spectrum is 100% correct. "The Stupidas" is a tyrannical, slow film that is not absolutely artistic, and denies the director like John Landes. <br /> <br /> To appreciate the "Stupidas", you need to know a little bit, but remember the true maxim spoken by director Abo Curo: "I'm requesting you to look at the bad films, they often often spellbind "To do a film work, the film must establish its own logic and if it works with certainty and sincere Is it really possible for Bay movie. For example, when you see "Freddy Got Fingador" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it is complete and completely rubbish; When you realize that this is actually a neo-guest comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Goss" does not accept the fact that it is made, then the blast of the aircraft will not end. However, many people think that "Jao" is exaggerated for such causes, and they are not wrong. But its power, is not it? The point that makes this idea of ​​a movie like this if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, fix it, others never explain that it often explains. Jim Jarmus once made a compulsory defense of "shows" and even then I can not see it from his POV. Although he does not mean wrong, though. When you watch this movie you have the right brain (and not I'm stoned, I'm going to sleep it now), you can actually enjoy the movie for a mobile phone, cheaper, pointless snapstick. 80s / early-90s-style fcece that's it <br /> <br /> Defenders and loathsome people of this movie are correct: it is stupid, and this is the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the letters in the same way, "The Zerac" takes the image of the young Johnson. And by taking it and driving it with it, the film especially uses this to advance the plot and define the characters. A "bad" film will actually do this and fail to use that argument properly; Bad movies are bad because they make it go along, where the "Stupidas" movies are going, what is it doing and why it's from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can not protect the film from an artistic perspective, why I give it a low rating. Most of the acting is bad, Jokes is very worshiping, and the live-action quality probably destroys a cartoon. But I can not deny that it is entertaining on its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it straight away, and I do not like those. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I was dragged into this movie because Christopher Lee's delicious comical look (telling him "Leave the bee bee!" if I hated this movie, the rent would have been worth it), but Jenny McCarthy Along with the TV studio Applez sign segment, I never was bored and would not be disappointed. In fact, many comedians were laughing at their cartoon (especially airbag-cigarette explosions). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the film does not pretend to be anything else: a stomp comedy about Stupid characters and instead of being apologized it enjoys itself. <br /> <br /> and it works just fine.
