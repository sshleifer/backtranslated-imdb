Again, I fell for it, in my roots I wanted a funny and poor horror movie, even a vampire. Even if it is stupid, even when I get my fun roar in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it does not take much more. So I saw the cover of "Blood" on the Hollywood video and it was interesting to see what kind of interest it was, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? This movie did not satisfy the satisfaction of my cow and the intense violence and nudity, but I refrained from my heart. The story of this movie is a vampire movie and it is not really! I'm back to return to the shop and I'm begging for a refund because it's really a rare time to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist has seen a vampire, it seems, Donkey, I'm still trying to identify what he was but his name was Rainfield, so I guess he is feeding a man who is afraid to make people Like I think I'm underwater. However, he thinks the artist has a certain flair for the darkness, so he gives him a drug to imagine an alternative where a feces exists and the blood needs to go live? I think I'm underwater. So his friends are excited to decide that they want to try drugs, I think, I do not know. So after trying to drag, things get weird, fantasies are real, I think, I am submerged, and vampires are now enjoying the taste of big breasted girls in Scandinavian dresses. I think I'm underwater. But a couple of girls really end up being a vampire? I think I'm underwater. <br /> <br /> Sorry to all, "I'm Duno's", probably one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but the reason is that the movie is awful, annoying, and confusing. I just want to see these actors who can tell you that boyfriend looking for that "big break". It is not terrible that they fall into the clutter of the horrible genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, in this case, they could have read the script. Everything about movies, looks, feelings, acting, this movie was bad, I really recommend you to pass the movie if you see it in your video shop. It was probably an interesting movie with a different dimension, but why did he choose this manager to show his "creativity" if he had any? It was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
