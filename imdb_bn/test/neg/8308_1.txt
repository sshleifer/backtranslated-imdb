As part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-In Kult Classics (featuring Crown International Picture Relays), I saw death machines as a part of the DVD. I work on my way through more than one DVD set, I am growing increasingly love for Crown International movies - especially, unhappy, lover, emotional thriller! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, never made; But there is not much for it. <br /> <br /> There is no plot; No story to really talk <br /> <br /> The acting is not clear ?? Only actors responsible for the actor Tony made an attempt to "act in character" (with thick, fake Italian accent). <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only theme of this movie ... Why did the filmmakers compelled to make this movie? What do they think: 1) Three ninja, 2) two competing criminals; 3) the character of a school student in a supportive bartender; And 4) His cruel love interest was so nervous that the world would not be complete without creating this movie? <br /> <br /> This is the complete waste of time and money as you, me, producer, writer, actor and director.
