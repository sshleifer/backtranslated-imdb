This movie has some of the worst production values ​​and edits I have ever seen. While remembering their lines, actors are walking in front of those who are talking and there are few examples of the performers except seven film frames. Not getting a shot in the chest, not mentioning the heroine, yet she started limping! Oh, and the secret passage that is well lit and open. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is non-existent, doing something with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and any type of cave war. At the end of Atar's film, a hang of a hang-glider. Dialogue is stupid, containing gems such as "It is everything and nothing." And "I can feel it, here." <br /> <br /> The movie is a mess, confusing, obscure mess. Ather is a silent protagonist, sword fighting is irrational, and the plot plods slowly. All in all, a movie to avoid it.
