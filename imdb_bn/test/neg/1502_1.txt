No way! I hate granny. First of all, he is a very long way - surely he, Tom, brother, who plays him- and he does what he does, pushing his faux silver hair behind me, I hate it, but: there are interesting parts in this movie. For example, every single actor VG (Very German), and they think that even if they are alone, they say that the person (Tom) has their "real" granny or something else I especially love- not- at that moment Charlotte goes away and starts walking for some help from the nearest gas station. He suddenly found himself in the middle of some woods (where was it before? Nobody dares to explain it) and roams around and roams around and wanders roaming around ... and ... granny is behind him, ready to strike! ! But, however, the music was not so bad, hairstyles were just fine and ultimately a very stimulant ... Mmmmm ... was my German version.
