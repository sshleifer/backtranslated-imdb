I was excited about this movie after reading the other reviews. What a disappointment! There are many ways that this movie is bad. There was a lack of computer graphics at least to say. I did not find the rigid and unbelievable acting. See the sand in the lost "e-pods" (what a real name!) Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized other parts of the same movie, such as alien, pitch black. What is a huge ship carrying a prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Can he speak, talk? I waited for something to add to the story bit together, but it never came. It shows if this movie is made in a low budget. Finally I like the only part of the movie that ended. I do not want to say that I like the end, so no. I just loved the fact that it was ending. A trip to the dentist can be more enjoyable. in my opinion. Do not waste your time on this one.
