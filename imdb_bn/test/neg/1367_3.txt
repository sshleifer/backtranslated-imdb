The "Brotherhood of Satan" is a stupid combination of some horrifying characterizations and variations in the wild (Bernard McAvailability). Father Charles Betman (as Ben) started driving with his beautiful Goldsmiths to the West: Happy Ana Capri (like Nikki), and the girl Gari Reislal (eg KT). Things to get things weirder and weirder, as they approached the city of Hillsborough, which is covered by a devil worship! <br /> <br /> When violent passengers hit Hillsborough, "action" takes place in a more compact collection of the film: Cities L.Q. Jones (as Pitt, Sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (Jack, as Pastor), and Alvy Moore (as Toby). Their interplay is sometimes fun. Soon enough, it gets all too silly, and expected. Mr. Martin stand out (you can expect); He considers the possibility of becoming a "cock-and-burn" story of a devil religion, but of course his leader. "Come, baby" is annoying; If not, perhaps, it was the film's original title.
