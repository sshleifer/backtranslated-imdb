I really do not think about watching this film. I saw it in my terrible movie shelf in the local video rental store and did not think much about it. Just run your rice, flashes a bit of a cloth and flashes flash with a sexual scene. Not a special thing, I'll see Python ... Oh do not wait, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I just decided to watch it when some of my friends watched on TV and said it was a terrible piece of trash. So, I decided to check out these stories, and at the same time I realized how terrible that the film is hidden behind the DVD box cover and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a limited area of ​​a plane, and the zombies should look at them to be a real death trap ... A good compound for a jammy film. But this image took a good setting and it all imposed on poor performance, unsteady camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score on it. <br /> <br /> All the characters have different levels of horror. Two young couples are mainly friends who are vacationing in France. One couple made a joke and his annoyingly malicious girlfriend who has a relationship with Mr. Jake's best friend, who came along with her girlfriend who had a blonde psycho. A policeman is also following a con-man (a fungus and extremely annoying con-man). The police are probably one of the very few irritating characters. Then there are several air hostels that mostly end up as a zombie cha ... I did not see the whole movie, it was a very painful experience which was often seen by the Cancellous Holocaust. Oh and his wife have golfer on holiday, some strange wind martial, who does not think seriously as far as Jimmy is escaped, calls for help, these three scientists who have died and two pilots. The camera work often gets reduced and even though many people do not think so, but it can reach your nerves a little later, such as keeping a small flyout around your head. It's small but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adulterous couple is really annoying. All of what they are doing is sex in plain toilets when their spouse is not watching ... Actually all young adults in this film are very annoying. They are mostly thinking about crazy and enigmatic boring dialogues in movies, anxiety, debating and yes ... it makes them happy to see them die. <br /> <br /> The score is fierce. It kills any kind of suspicious scenes that can create a scene that is so generic and unidentified, and thinks that someone is scrapping black with their nails and laughing with you. Actually, it sounds like a score ... Python! That image will not make me hunting. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that filmmakers feel incredibly comfortable to be in the shots as much as possible. A nun, sitting near young adults and throwing his bible, which has so many shots that if you play a large part of the film then start thinking ... but if he does not, then why does he have to show so many scenes? ? Because the original project of this photo maker was a silly pornographic picture? No one will ever know <br /> <br /> Jumbo looks pretty good Their makeup is good and they are probably much better actors than living characters, they are much more believable and preferred! Guardians responsible for keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal goods were quite funny. A big piece falls on her, and the camera shows the viewer that her legs are broken by some intense objects ... she does not suffer from pain, scream or pain. He is just screaming out trying to get the thing out of his leg and is extremist ... actually he sounds more like an overweight guy trying to poke his back than a man in pain. <br /> <br /> Oh, I can give all the 1st interesting settings and 1 for 2 jumbs. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to bake young adults and throw things into each other. Sadly, something interesting about the whole thing will probably fail to see if you're on any kind of psychological medicine. Be high.
