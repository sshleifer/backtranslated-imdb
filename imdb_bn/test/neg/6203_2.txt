David Dhawan hit and duplicate this type of unauthorized copy. The film is funny or ridiculous, even in 1/2, with a boring and annoying tale of compulsive stories like Lorra, like Laurer Plus plus an unwanted fool, Dawn and David try to slap the drama but the movie looks disconnected, annoying <br /> < br /> songs pop in, so everything except romance and some funny Govinda scenes, dancing before the gap, mentions nothing else. Noteworthy scenes are a lot of fun but it takes a lot of time. <br /> <br /> David's directive is as bad as Maine Pierre Kun Kaiyao, he must change his style or try to do something good, music To protect tunes, some songs are good <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Salman just plays himself and his nose tone plus his head of a fake style of acting Yatha <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
