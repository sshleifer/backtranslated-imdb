Julie Andrews is trying to play a direct dramatic role here - for some time she does not do anything - but Judith's character does not try to pass it as "Judy" (in advertise), old-fashioned entertainment and adolescence hairstyles, and Andrews 'getting older' Acting as any other actress explains disappointment. This is an amazingly unusual drama in Barbados that holds Omar Sharif (even not in 1974!) And even hopes to spell Andrews and lead him to a gradually motivated bedroom. There are some shirts in uncomfortable oats: Credit is like James Bond's credit a delicious hoot As Julie: She is calm and thoughtful, but not much for the audience, or for the film. Black Edwards faces like a funky freakin 'thing paces * ****
