Disney Studios's own 1965 Slapstick classic remake expresses concern in a tricky role that the FBI Agent of a kidnapped woman. Christina Richie is a Church, Let-E-Outta-works as the owner of a cat here and is played by Dog E Dog, shamefully over-the-top like the human cartoon. A pair of rich neurotics (Diane Canon and the original "cat" throwing member Dean Jones) are funny and the source-plot still has a little juice, but the handling here is so heavy and shameless, and the cat is so ruthless, it is strictly DOA <br /> < br /> * ****
