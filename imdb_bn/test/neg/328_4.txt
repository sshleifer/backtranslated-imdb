I bought jack-in for selling blockbuster videos a few months ago, and since that time I did not expect anything extraordinary. After watching this, I realized that I never received less than the price, but much more It seems strange, I know. And it is done. But when you consider the complete oddity of the word "jack-o", it is perfectly appropriate, <br /> This film follows a young boy named Shaun Kelly. Somehow, through the relationship of ancestors, he was identified for the death of a tragic, scythe wielding pumpkins man's hands. This pumpkin man Shan's grandfather-uncle-cousin died etc., and now the murderer has been resurrected, it is apparently very important for his henchmanic mission to revenge Sean's death. However, many "awesome" hacks his way through several neighbors before the war ends with Jack-Shawon. <br /> <br /> I'm not here so much to discuss the plot here because I can determine who this movie can find a value. I can honestly say that Jack is one of the worst movies in the history of time. Acting Deadpan (except when it should be), obviously a 1st grade group project, and the production budget could not exceed $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous death scenes in this anti thriller take place, and when you realize that director Steve Lataso is serious about making his film, they are even more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And yet I enjoyed the impressive film. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can say that I had a great time to see it with my friends, and that lucky first saw it several times. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie helpless and inappropriately time consuming and it is worth understanding. If you are like me and ridiculously enjoy bad movies that take you seriously, you will find Jack-an instant classic that can understand. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to rate this movie. If I rate Jack-O's quality as a film, then I do not give it anything. Actually, the studio will give me bigger. Even if I am rating it is based on pure enjoyment, I will give it an 8 or 9. I'll give it 4, so that somewhere in the middle. I advise everyone to go out, rent this, and form their own conclusions.
