This photo is horrible. It's absolutely zero smile. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) set to save Hanuko from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Probably a committed enough basis for a plot, indeed the film does not progress beyond this premises. Although some (remote and some) beautiful touches and plots are relatively coherent, it's functional, hackneyed and finally silly annoying. There are many screenshots in spite of all that Goldberg, Dick and Gray (Hammer's client / love interest) have. Despite being played for something that can be described as an extraordinary over-the-top gag, this film is constantly in the middle-medium-of-the-road mack. Do not waste this 85 minutes of your life. (Note- the music was good ..!)
