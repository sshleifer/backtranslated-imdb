Well, anyone who wants to see a great work of art will not see this movie. There is no doubt that a sophisticated filmmaker would be seen to see the horrific production costs and an extraordinary actor (Joseph Cottenen). Mr. Cotton certainly needed money or he was very sticky, realizing that the film was painful. The same incident happened with Dan Andr√©s, who was camping late in his career and the deadly Fragen Dead. I know Mr. Andrews was in lush lips, but why did this mess? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seriously defective version. Then, unexplicably, they introduced a girl. It was not a bad thing ... Until then, outside of the blue, they decided to stop making a horror film but made a soft-core pornographic flick !! The changes were dramatic and bizarre. They almost said, "Okay, Mr. Cotton has worked with his scene and has gone home, now ... ladies, ... strips!" <br /> <br /> The problem is only horror, without the makeup of the film giant, every level. Although not great, it still looks quite cool. But bad writing, acting and plotting to create a mockery and horrific spark in the $ 17.46 budget - no one should persuade anyone to spread so much nudity.
