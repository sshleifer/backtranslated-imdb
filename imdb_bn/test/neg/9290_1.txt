To reflect the comments of previous critics, if you are a Stoods fan, avoid all costs! My basic question is, why experienced soldiers of the radical and Larry tries to continue this act when they were so clear that their home studio Columbia was not interested in giving them serious writers. Veteran comedy director? This movie is playing like one that is giving an empty emulation of three and you can see how Moe and Larry are working to do relevant work related to the slopstick. Despite the background of Joe de Rita, Vaudville, there is no job as a replacement for Kolli, Shape, and Joe Besar. If the ladder and Larry were about to leave, they could simply shut down the shop and enjoy their leisure years. They are keeping our fans with better memory than ever before. Always leave their smile policy for comedy and always when you always quit. So when the signfield leaves the seat, instead of stuck for inevitable deterioration there.
