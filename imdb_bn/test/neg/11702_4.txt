This is one of the biggest films I missed as a child on Italian TV: It is notable for older stars, many of whom have never made horror films (Fred Astaire, Melvin Douglas, Douglas Fairbank Junior, John Whomman and Patricia Blue), Men are coming back for their hunting with long secret past crimes. For Alice Cr√®ge, it was an ex-dead body, but after their unfortunate incident, when they insulted their arrogance, they were forced to expel them! Fairbank, who was responsible for this work, has two sons (Craig Wasson), and so the crew orders his retaliation. Soon the next one, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman all dead air. Therefore, the remaining Wasan and Ashtaiyay decided to deal with the ghosts in the scene, where they can oppose the cruise bidding by some mischief trump anyway! I was waiting to see these veterans on their last leg (before the Douglas died, the film even premiered, until that time, he had already done another role, though it proved Astaire's own evil tone of music), but many changes in ghost stereo mood - whole life During a slower pace and leaning towards exchange - a failing query It's something else. The impact of shocking make-up over sex dildo (including the latest nudity to Wasson!) And marred the old-artistic elegance of Jack Cardiff's (long-lasting yet another significant) cinematography.
