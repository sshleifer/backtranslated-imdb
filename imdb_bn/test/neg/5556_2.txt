All right, I've seen Hirshal Gordon Lewis before, but it really takes a cake, it's really serious and fairly, does not mention annoying about how strippers have been done, I'm doing a bad thing, considering Hamlet, planning only out of the outer space, Karuna Harry Young has been delayed as the owner of the strip club, yes, take my wife ..., please, the streetcutors are the real sexy for 1972, I believe they used this same plot again in Roger Karamon film; Died in 1987. Previously HGLIS enjoyed the Flickr 100 Maniacs, it was a small artist, but bad acting, there were no rewards here, but be aware that it was a scam film that saved the 13th street on Friday, and saw.in was a boring scene with a half-naked stripper his butt Have a drunk with a meat tenderizer. morbid stuff here. Luiz strikes again again! 10 out of 2
