The shaky hand held on camera (this piece was shot to you in the movie, not the movie, the mind was shot for you) Only cinematography in this movie does not keep you aware of how horrible, but to make you completely submerge in the story. The poor Miss Austen will be rolling in his grave. I can say that if you enjoy the novel, then the BBC is one of the great and intelligent time of their time (like Pride and Prezudis with Colin Firth), which I'm not saying to imagine imagination, stuck in there, the ostensomeny respect ). The BBC does not dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and indigo girl hollers on a shot of a historical castle and a loving hug. Giles Foster has often been confused that they are editing expert music. If you want to love Austen, then look for the BBC logo ...
