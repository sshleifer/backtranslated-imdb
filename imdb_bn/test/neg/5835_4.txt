I challenge you to watch this movie and refuse the above statement. That is, you can stop seeing her functioning flawless face. He has also made a bit of fighting and shooting, but I'm not as much as I expected. The film is extremely slow and low budget, although at least they tried to find an excuse for falling so much to the spaceships; Almost the entire staff is "suspended animation", and the ship moved on automatic pilot! And the heroine does not deliver any of them, or returned some "home" useful; It seems that the evil lady was the only part of her mission to travel through space, which ultimately did not complete missiles to fly the ship. Some long but rather soft-core scenery and some "aliens" -piper-monsters that kill almost 2 people. * 1/2 out 4
