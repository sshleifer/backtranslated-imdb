I wanted to know that the curse had killed the cat, but I only wanted to see Cycou's remix, especially after going to Hitcoak and after learning about his work. I saw the original psycho even though I was young, I knew how to respect it and not only this, it was a wonderful movie! One is good, actually! When I first heard about remix, it was said, "How do you rebuild the perfection?". I got stuck with that too, but I think I now have a more open mind and it seems like it was a new way to introduce psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But this leads to a total humiliation and this is the original psycho face. I know this has been said, but I saw this movie and the director said "Oh, I want to update it and shoot every shot in the shot" ... What is fridge? ! All right, but I want to judge this movie on my own, even though it attacks the main attack. I mean, there was no difference in acting, but in truth, it looked like actors that they saw the original and just kept lines from there and thought it painful to them. <br /> <br /> This image, I wanted to get rid of Anna Hashe, she said, "I have never seen the real, I just wanted to work with Gus." Oh, it made me angry, because the truth is, he really has not played this role as Marian, he is not a believer, his shower scene was not really awesome. Vince Von was not created ... let's insert it in such a way, this picture was very scary. It was a sin against film and it, it was actually a bad movie. It was too much of what could be a new role for a new generation and destroyed. But to Gus, leave the movie anyone knows what they are doing! <br /> <br /> 1/10
