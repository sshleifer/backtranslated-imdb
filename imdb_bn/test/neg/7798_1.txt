I saw the preview of Felalien and thought it could be a great movie. Activated, it's a horrible trash. There are not many nudity in the film, there is no mention of having sex. With some weird dance, you just did some mobile phones and intelligent conversations in the audition time. In our case, you can even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I did not find anyone for this. Just leave it alone.
