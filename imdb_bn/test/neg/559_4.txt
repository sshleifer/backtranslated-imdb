I think this movie series is going to be an insult. After all, part 3 was not measured in Part 2, and this is not Daniel Sun. Miyagir was not such a surprise as part of the comic 3, but it was interesting enough to make the film valuable. <br /> <br /> The girl's section was pretty good. She needs a lost teenager who is in the direction. I find the plot a little difficult to plot. Under the supervision of aunt aunt, aunt agreed to leave her home and her niece. Of course, he was the friend of his brother. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the monastery. Someone might think from my other reviews that I loved the fans of the dance, but I think it was fun. It's how they know how to do some fun. Now if fans in this ancient Chinese used to dance pop music, then it was another matter. Perhaps the most intelligent part of this movie was when she thought that the fool was not fool, killing a bug. Miyagi told him that the street gang is killing each other, stupid, trying to destroy each other, but respecting all life is not stupid. Miyagi published such wisdom in other movies. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. Of course, I like some things. It was not as fun as part three, and no character can live in part 2 until ever in Sato. This movie has no re-watch quality. I can not imagine watching it again, but once worth seeing it.
