Now, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I accept the movie of the land is not generally good at all, but I like them anyway. In spite of unclear acting and worthless dialogue in almost all Jumbo movies, it is one of the worst till. See, there are some ground rules with zombie-movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Strategies are rarely used, and they do not work like a boxing. They do not hurt the head, they take a ugly smile. They do not face it and face it, they hold your hand and bite it! 2. Can not speak hair. Only Evil Dead Otherwise, they do not speak. 3. Do you fight zombies with melee-colored weapons. You loose a mail war against Zombies. Firearms are used. However, in this movie, the road to Melley, which is wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
