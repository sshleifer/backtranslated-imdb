So I was energized during a snap weekend on my snake, after the movie we craved some more. Why not have a train snake? Probably how bad it might be, his snake probably killed people on trains. The snake is supposed to be rattlers. At first, my friends and I think that snakes are snake-free tiger snakes and pets with same hungry musical clips. We actually bite it through the whole thing completely prepared to stop it (we walk on and hit Hit too lazy). The next thing we knew was how we did not know how the hack was going on, but some extraordinary fun was over. This is one of the finishes that you can laugh a few times, because you were suffering for so long. <br /> <br /> The last 10 minutes is an "8", the rest of the movie is 2.
