First of all I hate those Moroccan rappers, who were suppressed a gun against their forehead, if those could not work. They are cursed by what they are doing and they shoot each other and act like a clich√© version of the gangsters. <br /> <br /> This film does not take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before. The warehouse is not a sympathetic character in the film, except for the homeless, who is only half-brained. <br /> <br /> Both Bill Paxton and William Saddler both mountainous deliveries and the character of Saddler are just as a villain as gangsters. I did not like him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with uninterrupted violence and Walter Hills: people are everywhere flying through glass windows. There are not many plots and this is not a big problem when you root for something. Everyone, except Paxton and homeless, dies and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> Only two black people who can work, they are homeless and dingy but they are not actors by profession, annoying ugly brain dead rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this shit and instead watch 48 hours 1 and 2. At the same time they care about the characters that you have, nothing but humorous ideas and Cast's real actors.
