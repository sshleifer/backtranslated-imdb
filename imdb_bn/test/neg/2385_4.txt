What we have given in this endeavor of the film is that "friends of colleagues" are now "30-year-old" (we all know, of course, their generation thinks as "new 20"). With four guys and a girl, we pushed us to the following kind: Apparently "unemployed" and drug users, a person who works successfully and who is trying. They all, in their own way, drifting while trying to find out both a future and emotional happiness. One, perhaps two exceptions, these critics must surely never care to come closer to modeling. Nearly everyone has frustration after frustration after the frustration in their lives. Except one person's example (shows the way to find it), nobody is facing the emotional satisfaction of his life. And so, the only heartfelt moment of this movie is that it is unexpected and heartwarming to the person standing at the door, "I love you." <br /> <br /> Specifying exceptions only, these people <br /> <br /> PS - Writer / director, Johnson, certainly there seems to be a problem showing lesbian sex scenes - --- Prolonged and publisher With no problem of discrimination disclosure Why could that be? <br /> <br /> ****
