One way, you must respect Arakanese. It is clearly meant to be respected for half the big bugs, and the special effects look terrible; At least the movie does not feature CGI. Anyway, on the other hand; You can not respect the film too much because it is a garbage load. Terrible acting, the special effect (as mentioned) is impossible to take seriously, and once you saw a giant spider being bright; You've seen them all, so it gets rather annoying. Plots follow a bunch of people who are lucky enough enough to crash a plane after a meteor shower. They go home only in the area; Which can be just a house where a man has a huge spider that is used as a circus attraction. Eventually at the same time, meteor shower has raised more giant spiders than underground. All characters in this picture are poor caricatures; None of these are similar to a third dimension and they will soon start you thoroughly. You must feel for director Brett Piper because he was not enough to work with this film; But it does not make Arakanai any value, and overall there are better giant bugs than this, and so Arakania does not get the approval seal from me.
