This one compares space adventures to its time. Those who are Star Wars and Star Trek. And when I'm not a fan of Star Trek, I admit that this film compares to crossing the series trek. In fact, I will put futures in good light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is a boy captured by Space Riders. In an apparently fake and unentertaining battle, the captive son pirates friendship and even help them. And gradually, one after the other, the enemies who died. Eventually, the boy comes home, and the last remaining pond is seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The acting was not so big. But what is really obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, impact and story. How did they get 80 minutes out of it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But be warned. "D"
