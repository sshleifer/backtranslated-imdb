I saw this photo on oil the other night and I do not know what it will be ... I knew it would be a fool but this is not bad! Examples of all these examples are horrifying Australian comedy. Along with the most exhausting, vague situations and characters I have ever added (the very suspicious French made American tax break comedy!), In most cases annoying, incredible, intelligent and not so funny ... terrible! <br /> <br /> A scene that really bothered me, was looking at the scene of the bus. The authors have made the most outrageous use of a screen writing - incredible - not to mention that these three are trapped without their accessories ... they are on their holidays and they are at risk of it (with $ 300) deposits, luggage and rooms) To apply the right to dance on the bus? I mean, they are halfway away from their destination! At least they could have kicked the bus driver but they did not voluntarily go that they could not accept it! And they can spend their holidays ... However, I can not believe that the authors did not work in this workshop. Wonderful scenario out I think the 10-year-old set-up can become more tricky, fun and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I can go with many others - true unimaginable stereototypical psychopath, complete relationship with anger, girlfriend and virgin tag, 'Wow people! She was undergoing a train operation - everything is just naughty! I can not remember the feature of this movie, otherwise the Third Wheel Nerd was a beautiful kind. Even though he was stripped of his carrier in this trash!
