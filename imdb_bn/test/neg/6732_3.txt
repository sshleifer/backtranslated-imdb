Can they possibly get worse than this? Probably. But after Steven Seagal he can do what he does. Good kind; Instead of this time bad boys were seriously injured, they just wound their wounds. By fame as a bad ass agent Seagal is providing a special package to France from France. But it is not an easy task for many people who try to hide and leak the mission. The fight is not just enough bite and big bangs are just bigger and that's all. It seems that Anna-Louis Plumman is the only Cast member who does not see the presence of wood. Also in Cast: Jeffrey Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Do not blame all over Seagal for this clunker.
