This story was a good plot to four elderly men who shared a fierce secret about a young girl who met 50 years ago. After all this, the young man comes back to take revenge. This story occasionally cuts me off the tired lift music and never stays in the middle of the thunder thunder storm ever so consistent. But it seems valuable to wait until the end when we find only the mysterious woman, who confuse the old men in their dreams and interfere in the lives of young people. Most of what I liked in this movie were the mystery where the young woman appeared to men just before their death. There was something special effect. Every time I called to them by phone, "I will not face again". But it was a good movie, I wish that the speed is slow or the act is not tedious. And what I like about the movie is the 20's flashbacks, very authentic and the costumes are real.
