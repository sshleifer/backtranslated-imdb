In the late 70's and early 80's I was a fan of the old SCTV show and why John Candy was a big reason. He was given very interesting off the wall characters and was simply delightful. Unfortunately he could not take this role in movies. After the time I was frustrated by the mid-movie where he is almost playing the role of "straight" instead of the funny guy. "Armed and Hazardous" rarely try to use the zodiac's joke or Harlem Ramis. This is simply a very expected police and robbery type movie. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, then the movie is worth watching, just do not expect much laugh.
