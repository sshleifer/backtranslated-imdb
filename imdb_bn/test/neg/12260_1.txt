I do not understand why this movie was released, it seemed like something that you showed to your partner after buying your mam handracum in 1987. I work for a video store in Australian and United Kingdom and think that if a lovely movie is done <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> /> <br /> The picture was BAD, the sound was superb and played, and played, it was the greatest performance in the history of the film. It makes me embarrassed and annoyed that they used the term 'Australian' in the title because I am proud to be Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give people wrong ideas. <br /> <br /> Please note that anyone who has viewed this movie and watched this movie, please take a look at other Australian movies because you can choose between them and it is even better. <br /> <br /> If I take the camera, but for a photo of me, for an hour, I waited for my body to go through, then threw away what came on television ... there was no crime. <Br /> Do not see this image !!!!!!!!!!
