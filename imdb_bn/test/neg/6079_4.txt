Great piece of fiction played as practical. Today I was looking at Alcrase's Birdman. The Robert Stroud model was not a humble prisoner and he was in prison because he was pumping and one customer did not pay. Once he was in jail once he was uncontrolled, he was mostly held alone in prison or who was hospitalized. Some people were also killed in the prison. This movie reminds me of Alcrund's Birdman but worse. Robert Stroud wrote the book and he contributed to the society for some time. And there was some indication of the BOA's Strouds Luency. But this man Henry Young, who first died, thinks he was a famous bank robber who was arrested and beat him in another robbery. He was not a poor person who fell into the grocery store, which took place at a post office and took some money. These people were a hard core criminal. He killed a man three years before moving to Alcrase. He did not kill another person for a long time due to solitary confinement for more than a year before the assassination. The real story of his life will be more interesting. They were not even right in the Warden thing. You can not be warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. And through all the accounts go to the warden as a beautiful stand up guy in the warden of this film. Plus if my math is correct, warden directed by Karl Malden in Borough is considered the same warden in this film. Oh boy Not only this, in this movie we think poor Henry has committed suicide. And he wrote the winning words. Not true ... she could be alive now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was in a medical center in Walla Walla and was released for the murder of another and then released, and in 1972 Parolee was not found crossing. Maybe he is hanging up with the person of the Sebbi Cooper who blew up the Washington State plane after working on a bank robbery. Now acting was very good. Kevin Bacon is in the class of actors Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, most recently in the actress club. Gary basics may well be they could play it because he could have made up part of the warden so he was great. Christian Slaughter still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or not. Bacon wife was in Sedgwick movie because I think she is his wife. I did not even flick this of her though. For some reasons when I first came out of the movie, Kevin seemed to be a special project for Bacon. I think he can take a person who has actually been subjected to a disciplinary system, he is quite sure and has some light in his plight. Otherwise pick a psychopath to show as a victim.
