The "Curse of Poli-Ninaar" is not really long and detailed review, so I'll only observe some irregular observations about it: <br /> <br /> - Cool Opening Credit <br /> <br /> - There is no plot. <br /> <br /> - Anyone who never seen horror movies before and can not guess, who will survive in the first 20 minutes and none of this team can walk. <br /> - Hey, that's new Arrival (Alexander Ford) is quite hot! <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a big role, but she's not funny - she's rather embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - On-screen 40 seconds for Martin Cov√©, but his name on the video cover is still available. Did they give him this look or was it on the other side? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer-generated effects in awesome movies. <br /> <br /> * 4/1 of 1/2.
