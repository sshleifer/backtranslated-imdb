I really did not hear too much about this movie so I saw it went. I understand that this movie only appeals to someone who did not live in the real world. Even these people would think that the film was moved very slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman going to the nude camp. Stand up. shock. That scene, the dialog, was all great. And then the movie went to Dhaka. <br /> <br /> Although I have the vision of the filmmaker, I respect this view. It was very slow, very expected, and was not moving enough. Robert Doni Jr., is as good as normal, but this movie is not good enough to sit. It is frustrating and tries to be unusual, but it uses bad luck to all actors. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, sex scenes were boring.
