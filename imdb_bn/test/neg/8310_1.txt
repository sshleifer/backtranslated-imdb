People in the Bay Area probably have to remember Paul, from the Diamond Center, an unexpected late night hocester who opened simple credit and cheap rocks in the late night in the early 1980's and early 90's. I only mentioned him because there is an actor on Death machine who is looking like the owner of the Italian restaurant. She appeared in the best scenes of this horrible and near-obsolete crime drama about the Lady of the Lady (local filmmaker who is playing Marie Hanjo, who is advertising after completing the film). Let's talk to our hero (let's not tell Paul from the Diamond Center) Simpsons' Lugi ("Do you have grandfather spaghetti?") With all the ingredients in the restroom and when his sponsor complains about food, he feels vague. No, there is no sough of soup or hair: Pastea has a red Buddha, a murderer has a calling card, who sent an image to each of its possible victims. Death measurement is no worse, and quite annoying, which is an even worse offense.
