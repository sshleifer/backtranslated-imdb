The film shows the relation of dead mother and the boy is very involved with her and expressly loves her. What does it show? It shows their living conditions in a very bad situation. It shows how they "walk" tenderly (really he is bringing him). But what else do we see? When they were walking together, they started walking alone in the same place. This is not possible. A person who loves and cared about other dying, will do everything to make his life better. He does not get a free minute to think, to stay alone with himself, and if he takes a few minutes, he will run away from wherever he lives. Another thing. The film was dedicated by writer Andrzej Markowski. We have seen that he has learned the visual effects of many Turksky. But they only affect Sokurov's film, they do not support any sense or mood. Someone compared this image with "Mirror" ("Jerkalo"). There is nothing common without this visual effect. "Mirror" is a great movie and it's just a poor imitation.
