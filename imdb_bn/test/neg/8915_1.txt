To start, I love Steven Sighal, people are a genius. But recent movies have made me amazed, what is he trying to do? Seagal's part of his latest movie show almost no effort. Rich out, very clear that his line is doped. . Sigal does not face his fans in this film, but a clap to John-Cloud Van Dam and his fans. As a second scenario, when he is ready for zip line in the drug dealer panthouse to steal jewelery and money, it sets him a gun and shows it in the Neon sign. Do not say to yourself, 'Yeah, what does this have to do with Van Dam?' Well, this scene was stolen from the movie Jen-Cloud Van Dam. Both rent, both see, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Today you will not only waste garbage, but it was daring, I was an insult. Sigal is still good to run an Ikido, but why does he do not do great films for the death sentence or the law, but still got the pace and attitude, I wonder why, why Sigal? His new film has such stupendous scenes that there is nothing to do with the story, and there are such stupid story lines. I hope the upcoming Black Dawn film will be out of the woods or in the other place because it's the last chain of the movie, especially Today You Die, really amazed me if more big action films like its Double Team were made. Please do not watch this movie until you hate Segal, if you do not like to see his movies, but it will ask you questions about the future of the action film.
