Where should I start with this movie? I know that it's a mess. Get scripts, stories, or actors. After all, this movie is very frustrating from Salman Khan, who gave us a fun present before Dulan Hum Le Jayen and gave Joe Peir Karega. The second queen is becoming really annoying, she is in a stupid film about Kuch Kucha Hata Hai (Mistress Sathiya Shut Off This Dirty). The Wadeing Guyara story has been stolen, but the funny movie has been destroyed. There is a lack of dialogue. I laughed here, but entertaining? No !!! In the above films, Salman Khan was tolerant, but here he is mad. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and in the next minute you wonder how he is poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like a flat Jain that no effort is being made. This career is going to haywire around this time because he luckily broke his career with Satiya. Pooja Batas kept a little less with its appearance but it is still not enough. Jackie Sharf has been lost. Kashmiri Shah's beauty and acting escaped from him because he has chosen such a horrific script. Rabina Tendon looks beautiful, but kept a little performance. Musilin Belal is the worst actress award (they need Razzies because of the terrible cinema in India). She does not have stupid dialogue, horrible dance, looks weird, and her regular form. Just to tell you, Cast is much more awesome. If there is no reason for Rabindra's extraordinary beauty to make Mary Life, I will not give a point to the movie. Otherwise, the dance of Salman was terrible. Pooja Batas were dancing like Savasri in the air, otherwise I wore clothes and the rest cast (and their monkey dance) was flown out of the air. The album had a good song and Priya and Priya did not have enough good screenplay. The same half goes for a decent title song. Otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) is not a number for everyone.
