I think it seems to be an all-out terrible movie, but it's quite bad. In the sub-Disney story, the dog is playing soccer and fell in love (well, how beautiful!) The role is not bad, but it can certainly be good, especially young Canadian actor Kevin Jizar, who sees the whole movie time. Ashamed, he does not even want to stay there. However, the kids will love it, but parents are careful!
