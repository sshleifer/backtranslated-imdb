This movie was horrific! Ashley Rose Array, when a talented dancer, and singer (actually slightly better than the temple), is a terrible actress. She plays on screen whether she is playing her screen or offscreen personality as seen on screen on screen. So what we do is an overly cutesy, and completely unrealistic (not referring to the typical) portrait. If anyone wants to see beside him, nobody can hire a movie of him. The only bright light here is the Giftwood Temple of Britain Brighton I think it was not very realistic, but at least it was well played. Protect yourself and hire poor Little Rich Girl.
