I did not expect much high for this one. Before watching this, the story shouted "Stereotypt" to me. <br /> <br /> means ... come on! It is foolish to realize that the plot line about Android is so stupid that those who made him immoral, then decided to change everything. <br /> <br /> I want to see it thrice. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so unbearable. The movies are so rare that my films have slept so much that I have fallen asleep on them. For the third time I forced myself to watch, only to warn the public about it. <br /> <br /> I have found this unique impression that all the cool / decent things that were responsible for these messes were tried by other scifi / action movies, and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! They take on Android / robots, many steps, thin stories, stereotype characters and ultimately a big fight and throw it together. Unfortunately, the movie sucks. The acting is so wooden that you can create a house from it, the storyline / plot is ridiculous, the camerawork and the editing are awesome, the direction is unincorporated, and to be completely removed, everything is so tedious and ridiculous <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I told you, I told you, what? .
