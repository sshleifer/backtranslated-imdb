A cartoon from mid-90s ?? Featuring a superhuman female hero in black latex clothing. This adaptation is adapted by the lovely Charles Theon, Aeon, as a line-dancer who is as cold as a disconnected rebel and as fierce as a viper-snake. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but it must be. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but hate the sudden flow of parasitic future destostian technology - Island (2005) and Eqilibrum (2002) (under the pill). Eon Flux has all the problems present in this film, but elaborated. In other words, there is nothing left to compensate for the smooth style that matrix (1999) is compensated for. Special effects are exciting in Eon Flux, which makes it a few points, but the surface is excavated and there is nothing literally there. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the performance of this movie is fierce and some actually wound me wound up. Charlene Theron's character Ioan Flux is interwoven with the most Chess hard-chick schickick and thinks director director Karyn Kusama can not decide where to go with his next ?? Will he make him more different or more emotional? He does not know! Let's go both ways! Imagine that you buy a shotgun, fill it with the risk of developing different types of character and set a random world fire. This is the character of Ioan Flux. <br /> <br /> The movie Eon Flux keeps each 'compulsory' ideas of a distorted society - versus society, nature versus science, passion vs. cold cause etc. You've seen this all before, and done it well. Read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even see Logans Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... some! Avoid this harmful cheese-festoon as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
