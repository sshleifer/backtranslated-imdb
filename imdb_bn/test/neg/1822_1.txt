This short review does not have any spoilers because the movie looted. It is wooden and pedantic. It has no saving grace. If someone invites you to visit his house to see Mr Imperia, then do not go. Even the title of the movie is horrible and the rubbish is false in it. The whole plot is so bad that it can drive mother Theresa for frustration !!! It was not a stroke that had become the cause of the early death of poor Ezio, he had to work in this clanker. It scared him for the rest of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted Americans to revenge for his imprisonment. He found this rebel a perfect vehicle for his wrath.
