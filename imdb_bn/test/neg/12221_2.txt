I did not care much for this, it seemed very distorted for a documentary. Also, filmmakers started driving me down to some letters, and I was totally disrespectful about what I have chosen to show them. <br /> <br /> This movie disappointed me because the stories and the people were interesting, but the film suddenly fell flat due to the edit which does not give enough time to view the viewer's view. Due to the development of the story, the audience became impressive instead of showing boxers or other things, which they said was that the event was ceremonial. <br /> <br /> I suggest you avoid it and read only this story up.
