I do not understand a lot of reviews here. I saw photography and scenery beautiful, and two main actor appeals, but here there is nothing else to recommend this movie. The most annoying fake accent and the badly written dialogue. This does not sound like my real people. Though men are exposed to various types of sex without the characteristics of normal labeling and stereotypical characterization, but most stories are without motivation or reasoning. Greffith expresses his feelings to his psychological sick soil, which is the only thing that plays extremely well by Black. Lee, an attractive character who was more sensitive, said that the conversation was more natural and his motivation was more obvious. Yes, I realize that he is a stranger, but his actions can not reach any conclusion like the movie. This film is considered as a perspective, especially for it it has a beautiful atmosphere, but it is running slowly and deeply defective. A serious revision and improved performance can be saved, it is committed to outline the compound and stories.
