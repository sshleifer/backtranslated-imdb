I know everybody loves this movie, but I'm not afraid that I do not. I hated this picture so much that I had to stop filming the midway due to frustration. A lot of time is spent on weeping and emotional bed, the balancing character is separated from his divorce, the extra jackhammer on the audience's head. Already enough !! And why did not we know more about her former husband? He made a case in a while that came in a while. She must marry some, what will she have to do? What about him that makes her divorce so devastating? With a kiss on the bedroom floor, the bullet can be spent more than one shot. The conversation is stilted, cliched and terrible, much like many of those "ABC Afterschool Special" or something. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this movie, it's all expected and therefore annoying. This movie goes into overdrive on the molded factor, it was not supposed to be like it too stupid and funny! It is only "I'm the woman, heard my thunder", among those who have done horribly in movies, "Waiting for Exhale". If you want to see movies, "I'm Growing," which is actually entertainment, original and orderly, then see "gas food loading" or "ruby in paradise". Leave this shit !! I give "hot floats" 3/10.
