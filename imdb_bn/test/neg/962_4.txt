Since 1950, a revision of Rudolph Matt's movie has been given for 80, Dexter Colonel (Dennis Quaid) is a lecturer at a university who used a successful writing career, but now the tubes are gone with his wedding. The initial exposition gives the impression of the viewers that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he is poisoned, we are not surprised when you are familiar with the origin. After less than 48 hours after Dester's death, his Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan) decided to look for his steps with the help of one, but they made many hurdles in their way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promise of black and white, such as Dexter Staggers, because of the rain to the local police station, where he wants to tell about a murder ... his own, but this beat of the Hugh Levies Style 80 is the scene To remove it, just a sense of tension and tell the viewer that it is going to be very bad, how bad is it? Soon we are using the old flashback media, but now the movie resorts to the technicians completely. Nir has some slight respect, because the embroidered couple is standing in front of a Venezuelan blind, but there is really nothing to recommend it, performance is terrible, Ryan is doing a normal pink smile with a normal pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to set up an ornamented Omph in a fine film scene, apparently trying to cash in the audience with the heat of the body, undoubtedly the results are targeted at the audience of the teenager and should be noticed that they welcome it. 4/10
