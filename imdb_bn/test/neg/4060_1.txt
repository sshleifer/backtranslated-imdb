[Warning: Some spoilers included, though it is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of managers. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, Broadway, STARTUP.COM and War include Maun across Rome, all horror documentaries I would highly recommend. By seeing this finally annoying and insightful account from Depac mode 1988 tour, I realized that there was nothing to work with when they went to edit this movie together. The band members were certainly less likely to be on the camera; Therefore, undoubtedly, the competition for adding fans to a week's bus travel was added to some objectionable things. Really, now, I mean, come on. Who is a good idea to think of a concert film in a synth pop band with three keyboardists and a singer? Please, I like Depp Mode music and Martin Gore has a good melody, but the concert seems to be not that interesting and this film is a positive proof. Stay away from this documentary until you have a huge fan of Depac mode .... It is a complete waste time.
