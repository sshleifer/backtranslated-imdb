... and shame that a shame! Please raise the sun and burn it all copies of Dracula 3000. It should be the most vampire-flick of the new millennium (I still do not see the darkness, but they do not get anything worse). Do not be fooled by the movie Cold Hr Gijar√©kov cover This is very bad, it's almost lovely. I can not describe all the emotion conjured in this movie. I smiled off my ass, shouting at the screen, I was sitting numb, I put my head in disbelief, ... The film has 'cheap and cheese' everywhere. The best thing about this movie is opening-credit and opening shots, which show fewer than or less than CGIs of two space-vessels. But when the sound of Caspar van Dine comes, then you start some torches. And, actually, it goes on fast after all. <br /> <br /> The crew of a salvage-spaceship finds a abandoned ship, which is the dimeter, which seems to be heading for the world. They write it, sealing their fate on it. This film is all-over, mixed with a shameless low-budget allen-rip off, vampires. Urra, the character of Irina Elinichak, on the right side of the plot-twist, he released a robot. Culio dip-smoking, blood pressure 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name? !!!) is as above-the-top-up. The name of the character of Caspar Van Dien is Captain van Helsing (hahaha!) And he seems to be ..., well, Kaspers van Deeven. As the Demeter's former commander Captain Verna, Udo Kear has been shown only on the monitor screen and he seems to have difficulty reading an auto-quote line (poor woood, where are you going to this flick?). And then we have seen Langley Kirkwood counting as an oblique, which is one of the most gracious and ridiculous Dracula (D) silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Future black suit or something, showing some cool things, instead he is wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. Do you think it's incredible like Richard Roxburgh Van Helsing's Dracula? Then wait until you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> Set designers have gone to such an account. The interior of the dimeter looks like a cross between the oil tanker and the old steel plants, which they decorate with green, pink, blue and yellow dark colors and color. Pro-Master must have forgotten that this film took place in 3000 years, because the characters used a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair using today's 45 magazines and "Pruff" songs. It has pushed around to move. <br /> <br /> In addition to one dry body, there are few impuliments and one defect of absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fung and contact-lenses look like hell. Add the most furry, stupid and accidental finishes: Threats and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having a final (bloody) showdown with the Counter Orlock, they lock themselves in control. Then Aurra explained that before joining the program and joining the drug, he became "Pruthas 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So he said, "Well, what are you waiting for?" Hmmv replies, "I do not have to say twice. Let the girl come," she picked up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" Ship Burglar and Credit Roll No sex scene, no Erica Flashell 'her boobies, no bloody climax, ... just one more shot in Udo Kier read a line of monitors and ended it. So, this movie must see for everyone a bad-movie lover, but I must warn them: it gets really painful from time to time. And everyone claims that van Helsing, underworld or even dumped queen, the worst vampire in the new millennium - is definitely insane, or still not seen Daklulu 3000.
