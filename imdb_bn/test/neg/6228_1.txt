I have to say there is a redemption spec about this "film". It firmly placed below the barrel. Now filmmakers know what to look up at while making a movie. Another that I regret watching this danger What is the cruel abandonment of making this "film" What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's right folks, one thousand dollars). This "movie" reminds me of the "Adult Video Awards" ceremony, which is a group of "industrial prostitution" groups, who admire themselves, believe that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Then I saw the blue movie with good acting, instructions and writing how long. Executive producer, Justin Eમેન્ટ should have been in "film" only. He plays deputy Jake Barker. I'm sure his "acting" career has been closed ... there's a part of writer Ted Pfiffer. He was no doubt wallowing in the clichéd glory he created. It must be noted that the film has a major role in Kerry Finkillar. You can remember him from Gass Van Sant's 'elephant'. Although I'm not sure he would want to write this picture in his resume. And I'm not sure what is sadness? Money is spent on making this movie or people are going to watch it. One of the worst movies of the year 2004 with 'Torque', 'Godsend' and 'Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow', if not the The Day of the Film.
