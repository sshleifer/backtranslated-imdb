The only reason to view this picture. He gives a very good performance - deserve much better than this nut. He is very nice and very talented - he deserved better than this. Also depressing is to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who has qualified, but he has given very good performances as a seai. So, if you are a fan of them, you might want to see. Otherwise, stay away. Another complaint - did we not see more scenes of the SI shirt?
