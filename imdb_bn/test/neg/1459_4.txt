It is difficult to determine what to say about this. It is not completely 100 percent bad. Although the movie-in-non-movie is vaguely meant to be a camp, but absent like a mile. I'm sure that this is deliberate but sure. Danny Iylo is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nail her cruel character. Dion Canon was good at a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the last distinguished girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had such a brave view that she pulled up very well. <br /> <br /> It's not bad at all, but I do not believe it achieves its goal. After all, this is probably the cost of passage.
