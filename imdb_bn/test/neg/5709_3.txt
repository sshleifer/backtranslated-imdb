I can not really see any interest whatever I see in this movie. A woman fills a man, she wants to play games, too, but she does not feel that she is absent. He left, and that's really it. Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) took 9 1/2 weeks to leave John (Mickey Roar). He should leave her after 30 minutes and our sadness ends.
