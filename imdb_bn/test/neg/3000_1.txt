This is a very annoying, scary and stupid movie that I've seen for a long time. I saw at the Beverly Hills Academy, and there were a few people in the lobby who had left screening and asked for shelter. Everyone shook their heads and they should see the funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse, this critical blimp has given critics reviews. What's with them Do they fear that they will not be considered "hip"? They were guilty? This image is violently bad. Do not take a date to expect to chat with a depth of Cheesecake factory in the future. If you had the idea of ​​watching this movie then he would fool you and keep the rest of your life alive.
