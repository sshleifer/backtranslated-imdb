Why do we all know that by changing the shows of the cute, angry television, and loving a crippling effort to target the teenager? They do not have to do that. Watch Regular Rugrats of all ages. When I heard about this, I thought, "Hey, they've made a TV series about the movie, except they are really growing up at the age of teens, it's going to be better." When I saw it, I told Ginger as I saw it, and they sucked it. Great job <br /> <br /> When was the director of Tommy in the Regratus series? Ever. Originally about the love of Tommy's instruction in all episodes of this attempt series. I do not like that. I rather plot the plot that changes every episode. Do not have the same thing over over. Also, when does the old series of characters in the old series have their own party? Ever. This series did that. I was not that everyone was separate from everyone I do not want to look for Angelica's story. I hate him <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if I like spoken by this grapes and rugs.
