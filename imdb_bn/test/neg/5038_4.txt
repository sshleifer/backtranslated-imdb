The Great Rock N Rollie is not just thoroughly wrong, but it is not interesting or even entertaining when it comes to it. Malcolm McLaren apparently ruined most of the revenue of this film's sexual pistols, which makes it even more objectionable. From the beginning, a memento of McLaren's "talent", which today is full of credit for creating ping music, making a sexual pistol, and sometimes writing all songs. Visitors follow McLaren in various settings, where he stands by his side of the story, the female left, and the credit for one thing after the other. Especially the excited scene is in the Hangman of a deserted aircraft of McLaren, waiting for a plane, being terrified by journalists and giving them "big stories". The most entertaining elements of the film are small pieces of animated, but even the challenge of McLaren's self-confidence. <br /> <br /> Even as a rhythm, this film does not work. Except Steve Jones, it's surprisingly decent as an incognito person, it's a bit entertaining about it. After 20 years, Julian Temple, who wrote and directed this photo, also mentions a sexual pistol documentary "The Fiddle and the Furry". Although the film is much better and more interesting than "Swindell", it is still the "artistic development" of the temple which does not work perfectly, like the Band members interview in Shadow, as they are some criminals who try to hide their identity An interesting bit of quarterly: movie critic Roger Ebert movie "Who's Killed Bamby?" It was the original author, which eventually became "swindle".
