I like full moon images, so I ordered this movie from America, because in Germany you can not get it anywhere. I thought it would be as nice and fun as a subJoxy or pop master master series, because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this Chess movie, I was very frustrated. Actor (I think you can not even tell the actor) is annoying and untalented. The story was a poor performance and even set and monster was very cheap and obnoxious. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will ever make a series of horror movies or rebuild them. :-)
