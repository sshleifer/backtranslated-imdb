This is a classic B-type movie which you would rather not waste your time and see. It started well and I think it would be big as a good thriller, but I was wrong. All the movies seem to you a long time that something will soon be interesting and it will suddenly become an exciting thriller, but it will not happen. It gradually and peacefully end up, it runs with something interesting. The end was just unexpected and original, but that's it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10 Oh, another thing. Why this movie is no longer rated ???
