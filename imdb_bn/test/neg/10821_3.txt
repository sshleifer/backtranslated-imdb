I think most people would agree with me if I used to say that the Allian cinema mostly set bar for the atmosphere. I saw a number of films that matched but none of the Alien's lady tunnels and dark circles did not cross. The cave is a movie that makes it very difficult to reset the bar. I believe the trailer also mentions some of the frightening things like Alien, although I never was fascinated throughout the film, even I was thrilled about that issue. <br /> <br /> Now we get the ball I can explain like negative rolling to explain why the cave's head hook (my environment is not paying attention to you) wasted my time. I would say now that most of the sets were superbly and nicely flashed, but what we heard and what we know is going to destroy what we see. The music for one is terrible. We get music in both corny rock music or hugely spooky house music. OK that it pushed a bit but I could not bear it. Many water scenes were bad enough (it is a well known fact that water scenes are always annoying like hell). I did not need rock shaking in my ears while swimming only with a cave. It has actually created many fuzzy humor which was later increased by the waterway crash scene. <br /> <br /> As I already mentioned, it was not the only music that killed the atmosphere, the hack no. Secret animals in the dark are supposed to call awful. I want to be worried that they are going to be present and only a glimpse of them can make my blood cold. The Cave wisely does not show the whole creature for a long time with a page from the Gentleman handbook and reveals glimps only, but it does not work because animals are so tall. I think it would be unreasonable to hide the precision, but they are basically alliance with the will. <br /> <br /> I think you got the point right now. The atmosphere destroyed. Yet I know a lot of people who still can see exciting movies. I want to tell about the cave but I will lie. This movie has a slow pace of action and once we get there it is astonishing when the deal is finally over. We have seen it better before removing some lovely scenes (Stalactite, Yale and Rapid man), so you do not have any romantic tension from showing people with unreliable alien nanophos in endless tunnels. <br /> <br /> Ah, but pain does not end. We must accept letters and account to be played. Well, I can not remember the single line of dialogue other than "run" And the only character I can remember is Jack, but it's just because it's kept in almost every other line near the end of the movie. Perhaps the actors were able to execute them but the script did not allow them to do anything else then debate. They almost did not have a background and when they died they easily closed it. It is very sad if CGI Eel keeps an eye on the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> CGI does not say; There are plenty of it, which is mostly terrible. I appreciate them for using suits (at least I think they were fit) but nothing really does not match the environment and as a result most of the effects show a nice hockey. <br /> <br /> I think wrap it up, the cave is bad and it's going very little for it. If the film is directly in a low budget in a Saifai channel premiere movie or video release, it can be more love to me, but the film is released in theaters. With more intelligence and talent it might be a terrific fun movie but as it stands, this film is about as terrible as going into the basement and that is not very good. <br /> <br /> My review from Freder Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
