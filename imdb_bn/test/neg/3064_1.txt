As Mitchgandar, I got Michigan Jokes. Very fun - Pontiac, Ann Arbor, Detroit who make fun of all the sub-cities of the city. Yes, yes, I've heard this joke a million times. I would give Grosse pointer their credit for properly portraying chaos. It could not get more white. Did you hear that lovely Michigan nasal accent? Where girls talk so fast, you can not understand a word coming out of their mouths? As much as I love Michigan, I hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I could never show a person from Gross's Point. Listen to that awesome live band and that annoying and awesome background music! what is this? Is your grosse point one of the band of homeboys? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you guys have there. The interesting thing is that people from Grosses Point always say from Detroit. They are so white and wealthy, they want that they have made some accusations. <br /> <br /> However, this film blows up. All the way to the development of terrible character from fragile comedy about girls. Oh, wait a minute, you want to say that the whole foundation for the character is that he said the F-word is so much? What a deep personality Great work, grosse pointer! And I love all sexist sex, like killing the first daughter of the narrator, which we can not even say "fool b * tch". It's really nice Those <br /> <br /> and Marilyn Manson Content lenses are really cool. And why do I love it as it is the perfect knowledge of why come bikes and kill people. And how was the obvious role in their narrator master movie ... ?? The main lover dude was so annoying that I fell asleep. Three foolish guys (or was it two or four? How can I say that they all do the same thing and work!) I was trying to smile at such despair, but Beavis and Butthead already laughing back my butt humor in 1994. And what's with gay jokes? This movie is not related to any surprises - all of them must have some minor problems with their manhood? <br /> <br /> The grace of this film was only the original girl. Despite what other people said here, he was actually a good actress. Teen girls talk about talking They've really played the way. His performance was very natural and trustworthy. I really think he's a grosse pointer to shop shop convenience. She probably! And yes he was big boobs, here mostly women. Michigan Union is the most fattest state, you know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the suburbs of Detroit. They are full of very white and purposeless teen angst. Limp Bijut, ICP (yes, one of our suburbs of ICP) and $ 75 bags all the way to the pants! Nuts are crazy about the rich children who have nothing about their lots of money and complaints. And they are bad movies, too. <br /> <br />
