I never saw this show when I was happy. <br /> <br /> I was wondering why it lasted for 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80's of terrible people, fake clothes, and fake music with fake music. How can I survive growing in this era? <br /> <br /> I saw most of the episodes are compulsory. This makes for a very annoying show. Plot lines are not very interesting as the old twilight zone show. Old shows inspired Kalpana and took the next show forward. <br /> <br /> Hold on the show of old twilight zones and torment yourself to show garbage.
