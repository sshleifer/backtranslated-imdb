A hunchback of 'distorted' which is a haphazard and violent thriller - but without any charm and intelligence. The plot seems tired and anxious to be ridiculous and free from these tedious entries. This film is a tough example of a bad plot and a very bad idea. Thomson and James like to see good actors like shame.
