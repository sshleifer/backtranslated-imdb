I failed to see this movie for several years, although it has been very successful and has created a lot of discussion in Israel. I'm sorry I did not postpone it indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The theme of 'Kados' is a very real and painful subject known to the Jewish religious world - the place and society of women in the Orthodox family. The basic situation of the film's premises is possible, the problem that is brought to the screen and the conflicts described in the film 'solution' is wrong. Gite does not appear to be very sympathetic to men in religious world, but the ability to select their characters or to express their feelings, the character of such characters, is considered to be straightforward. Even he does not serve better for the characters of his women, although at least here he show more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and talented actors, Yael Abbeesis and Metal Barda. Overall, Gitey's view is very unilateral, his movie is very basic, he concentrates on the technical statements of Jewish religious life, which may not be attractive to those who do not know them, but they are not really relevant in context. Full story What we found here from a fascinating place is a boring movie that seems much more than that, with a very static approach acting, seizing music in the same music, not only from a musical instrument but also from an emotional perspective and even even a misleading end If not, very unintentional. The difference between this movie and 'Happiness' is inspired and narrated from the same social landscape and which has succeeded in sending human feelings on the screen. 'Kadash' has very small movies and very young people's emotions.
