Everything you tried to do in this movie is good - and "Run Lola Run" is fantastic. The red-haired hip kitty, the critical timeline, The Laver in Zoacardi, and the "Crime Page-Sometimes" message. However, unlike "Lola", it is not believed or kept well together. It had worked for me if it had been closed to a labored knock, if I had seen it before "Lola" - but compared it to it. Yes! Falling beetle was nice! But this was the only surprise in the film. See yourself a favor and Real McCoy - (and real hip-red head!) - Run Lola in the run!
