I am in a loss. This whole movie is made in absolutely no sense. It was like watching a kindergarten movie for football. Cut the camera, motion, copy all so I thought it was not very serious to treat them like this. Yes, we all know like football and beauty patrons. Will it be awake with us as an audience? I saw Li and J due. I was expected to remember the young talents or Titans in the style of the Dead Coyets Society. I was completely stopped by the film. You will not get the letters. It was driven character, but you do not understand anyone's motivation or their actions for the most part. The mother's only child covered him as a football player. Why is he so silent? What is his contract? Did we really need his scene with "proof" of his violence? Why should we care? The film has given us insight into the lives of these kids, and has not stopped paying for care. It's just made in no sense. <br /> <br /> And why has it lost a team that lost a team? I know it's real life, but who makes the movie about damaged? These guys stop paying us some money for their hard work, which they did with all their "imaginary" problems, Darnat. We got nothing. At the end of the film we got a little hug. We told that in the third year Mozo won with the 3rd string (Lee). Why do not you follow that story? What did we find in this one? The movie led you along, but you never lead anywhere. I just felt something missing. Remember it's a bad genetic cross and tetanus among the warrior blues. At least those two movies have brought you somewhere. Friday night's night is a harmful team that has lost star star player early on in the movie. The actor who was great in him. You were completely annoyed by that point, but at least you understand why. They are sure that you understand him, but he could not play, so why do we make sure his problems? <br /> <br /> and another team of players ... do we believe they are a high school teenager? Those men looked like college senior or professional player in 30's. Who are they trying to kids? I know the other team was scared, but it was passing a little line. I like the topic of their discussion with the Black Team, but again, how the film was fits in the overall theme. Nothing pieced together. The letters we knew more about each other than each other, and that settles strange with me. J.'s letter was absolutely nothing to add to, but she was shown. It was just a mess. A movie ticket or a rental fee is not worth it.
