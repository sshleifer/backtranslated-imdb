Sometimes it is difficult to judge how bad a film made in Italy or Spain is, because they all use the same stability of 9. 10 ESL-trained voice actors seem to have provided English voice for release in the United States. And the written material for the expectations of European audiences, the DeLogo, the character shots, and the plot elements are lost, maybe funny, hip or dramatic, which may not be very good with our American ideas. I imagine that the group responsible for making sound in English for the soundtrack of this movie took about 3 days to start from the beginning, and probably each one of them earned the equivalent of paying it to Fiyat. In other words, pure hackwork is dropped into one or two people and does not restate or renew anyone with the real ear of American language. Seeing "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if you had an Italian presenting it in your native language, you could find it a little fragmentary little piece of light. You laugh at 'joke and ridiculous drunk', you rely on the hypocrisy of the monster and the bad boy, and you will not be looking at Peter's striking partner - Darrul-Daryl Hannah. There is no doubt that a person has already killed one of them by looking for a reason in the middle of the search of a couple's couple. <br /> <br /> But jering voice activation and tin-yard dialogue keep us out of the film's experience, we can not help but feel that the editors had a serious attention deficit disorder that nobody on the screen could act like a true spirit. , Which is made because the giant does not give absolutely no idea that the action succeeds in the complete diet of oatmeal All effects syera and director, screenwriter and producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about buying or renting this movie - With a few of your beer one Saturday afternoon with only watch TV fist, or Mike and Bots on MST3K with help and protection.
