Ewww! A Disney signal that junk! Who thought that? Indeed, here are many trials by comments, and they are not wrong. I'm actually looking forward to seeing this terrible film based on my choice of original. And there is a lie in Disney's complete "cash in" mentality. Find out which old junk you can get for success and people will go for it. Do not think they are curious? Ask yourself, then .... How many Disney movies have signals? And then .... how many signals spawn a follow up? A significantly lower number <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculously simple and drawn. Even more annoying was the increase in the number of items and views "out of place" - for example an old people at home and, God forbid an AJCT version of Boy Scouts! Worse, Cranke's opposition has a completely inconsistent English language pronunciation without any reason for the Chipmomak Leader. After a very short period, grating over a nervous nervous system. <br /> <br /> There are some good things. Animation is very nice and voice talent works well with the sub-standard conversations they provide - especially in the role of Warburton lead. But other than this is really nothing to suggest it. Sure, little kids may like it, but it is a little fun when they can scream mother and father through this shocking damage to the main idea. <br /> <br /> Stop refraining from this rude folks that you want to avoid.
