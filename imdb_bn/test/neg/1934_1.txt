This is probably a cultural thing --- the way this native of this country is considered to be funny. I saw this incident early, during an open-air movie event, where the movie was shown before the feature. Most local listeners smiled and did not, it was not a sanitary or a disability for children with disabilities, it was in a very good area and most of the audiences included educated adults. <br /> <br /> It may be possible, anyway, this ridiculous, but honest, honesty, I do not have any idea what it takes - perhaps it's a long-term exposure in the air or in the water, causing this situation to happen. Something can happen, maybe, what I can say is, I'm not sure that this is not a reason: the movie itself. <br /> <br /> No joke in this. It is dead in the brain, stupid, indecent, lazy, hair. It, in short time, wasted time. Any Tom and Jerry are fun, even funerals fun. <br /> <br /> Just if you are fortunate that there is no performance of StuGege: It is behaving, running, even talking like disabled children, a plot, a real purpose, and illogical harmless without any real conclusion Creates all kinds of things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My suggestion about this: Stay tuned. Far away
