Cybercuta is set in Los Angeles for a few days, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'Dragon Wilson) senator Robert Dili (John Opria) is protected from a killer group known as the UHR. In order to lead a computerized judicial system, the agreement that Deli has agreed to send the cyber tracker robot to justice and prosecute the culprits. However, Deliveries affect her very much, and she decides to see her believe as a cold blooded murder of betrayal like her treacherous activity, when she kills a woman when she is a good person who killed Eric, to keep her calm. Eric escaped and came out to bring Delight down, but Dilly is a very powerful friend and uses his frames to frame his influence and sent his cybercrackers to search for him ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced & Richard Pepin I think movies like cybercrackers give a bad name to movies, I do not like it very much. Jacobson Hart's script is quite predictable, it is not excited, it does not imprison one of the best concepts and other best science-film themes and martial arts action and a similar mix of science. There are few fights, some cars, and some shots, but it's all changed and forgotten. Considering the film being set in the future, there is a lack of imagination and it is managed with robot, technology and path society and it is specially judicial system. Not surprisingly, the Robocop (1987) mixes his violent actions and brilliant social commentary mix but CyberTracker does not even attempt to draw any meaningful moral message about any relevant social statements or law enforcement, using Robocop which basically uses the idea of ​​scripting Well done but managed to include a good story. There are very few cybercrackers that I can say was entertaining and how are these movies right? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin is ok but nothing is standing, forgetting it all and it's not particularly exciting. Science is nothing more than an object's robot, and the film is not entirely future. The action scenes are okay, some explosive cars and some shoots are out but there is nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> The technically cyber tracker is the average, it looks for a movie set in the future and the special effects are poor. Acting was bad, I used to think that Don 'Dragon' Wilson checks with that name? <br /> <br /> My time was lost on cybercracker, there is nothing real or exciting here and the action will be forgotten immediately. The need to tell the poor and all that is needed, is not recommended.
