Although this picture has received lots of praise, I personally found it annoying. There are some excellent Brazilian sunsets and letters are credible, but our values ​​are very unusual but how they are related, its story is not so interesting enough to keep the film for so long. Central women take a person's intimate knowledge of each other and their children's interests first with a person. The tolerance of different people is expanded, we see to develop their character. The story unfolds with glory and helps by excellent acting. It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilion Hinterland far from the city, but it is exciting enough to keep its eyes open.
