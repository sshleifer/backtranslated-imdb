Vicente Arndar Another Inspired Film If "Joona La Lola" is similarly worried, at least its quality is higher (thanks mainly to Pillar Lopez de Ailla's superb acting), "Carmen" is boring and full of subjects (Broken brunette with a splash of stocking, poor people passion, Sierra Nevada gang , "Terores", has gone crazy due to ...) <br /> <br /> Clearly Puja Vega is beautiful woman, but she is more susceptible to her talent. The role of Bong Sabaraglia is stupid that is almost incredible. The script is weak and Arndor's helpless character influences the whole film. The result can not be good with this element. <br /> <br /> I think the worst movie, but not the complete failure.
