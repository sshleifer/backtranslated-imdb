I should have said in the future that any film made by Saif Final and was released from the DVD, that it was actually made by such a channel, since I knew this fact, I would not buy this thing. It was not bad at all, but when you were faded for the middle of your film, it simply destroyed the film flow. This makes the movie rather more annoying. It was an interesting story, but the light-hearted and very generic soundtrack from the movie confused one another, like most of the bad actors, except Deene and Linda Carter. This story, vampires must not have been vampire movie rules on South American invasions, which are not in any films of vampires I have ever seen without Blade Trilogy exception. The team claimed that the squad was sent to the war. To meet the team and send a soldier to arrest a former wife ... why is not he just his wife, who knows as the part that the plot really goes out. Still we get some wonderful jungle scenery and many blood ride in an interesting boat. However, this phenomenon does not look like a film going on a bad way in its presentation and sometimes stupid. I do not know it's CGI blood, and smoke and whatever they have to do CGI right now, although the old effects look good and do not cost more. I mean, cheap Italian zombie films can bullet holes without siges, why can not we now?
