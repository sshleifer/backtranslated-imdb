"Scarecrow Wild Wild: He's Death of Party!" I want to say more? Scarecrow gone wild For a simple reason I got ten big four out of me: from terrible acting, plot hole, cheap special effect, and anti-climatic whistling, it was cinematic gold! I think this movie was really good, but SquareCro was proven as a baseball coach (as illustrated by the ever-presenting Ken Shamrock). But again, they could have cut off the light of the light of the "Jedir Return" power. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, my friends and I was sure that it actually wrote our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This film has weakened the woman, misguided the fake Gore, and such a conversation that can not come out of paper paper bags, or in this case, a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If I can ask the filmmaker one thing, it will happen; "How much does it cost you to write this for you?"
