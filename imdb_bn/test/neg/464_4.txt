The movie is valuable, and a babe in the cage. <br /> <br /> Anyone agree with me that the punk presentation of this movie is very important?!?! <br /> <br /> Where? ramones ?? misfits? Social distortion? cramps Sexual pistol?! anyone?!?!?!?! Music This movie is incredibly frustrating! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the movie square squats punches. <br /> <br /> While it's a 90's movie, SLC Punk draws a more accurate picture of the rock rock scene in the early 1980's. Just Sayin '.
