C Class Cast and Badly Transposed Scenes have been done with terrible acting, I believe that it will create a good TV such as a small respiratory failure FX presentation. Although in my local blockbuster, about 9 copies were kept on the roof, when I did not rent any title (I wonder why ....) However, this title was going to be almost ridiculous in the director of "horrible". The full "countdown" under the screen was completely opposite to the plot, as the helicopter was crossing Angola, and the toll was running at a speed of 23 million to 24 to 24 minutes. The death toll counter was re-set, (probably several hours or even a day after the helicopter landing), the moment the helicopter was coming to the area. The end of the film has a huge balance among the whole plot, and God knows that no one is waiting for a seagull. However, do not rent it, I only recommend showing it if you get the title without any financial loss and you're in the mood of a Chessy Season movie.
