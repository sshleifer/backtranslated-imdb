Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster film, it's like a remake of the old 'demon attack [insert emiceless here]' - movies 50, 60 and 70 Or rather, instead of what it was, it should have been like a restoration. So, how was a giant movie done in 2002? Well, some chemicals have been grown in the form of spiders since the general opening, they mix films like Gremlins, Jurassic Parks, Starships Troopers and smell it with some parody like sculpture movie. Gremlins are probably the best comparison, but eight Legged Freaks parody and stupid joke were so full that it was more like a sometimes scary movie. It was very much the way, at least if you are looking for a giant movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes. <br /> <br /> For such a movie you do not expect more of acting, and that was exactly the way. The story was very thin, very loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly, <br /> <br /> <br /> a 4/10, and the special effect that is quite good And the hilarious spider is funny.
