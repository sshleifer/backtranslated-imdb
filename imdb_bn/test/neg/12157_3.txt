I was waiting for this movie for a while. On the first day of Turkey's wind, I saw it. It was completely a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but one of the screens was a myth. First, the original character of the movie Singies Han, the great victory was portrayed as soft, calm, even harmful. You can not feel power in the movie. Historically, he knows the years of war made war Â¾ (even more) of those who win. To do this, combine the first Cengiz Asian tribe. However, in this movie, this harmful man is poor-looking man in a scene, and in the second scene, he is the commander of the army. The war scene was incredibly weekend. In the final battle, the Mongol races used double swords on their side and the enemy was cut. :) As a result, mine and my friends just smile at those scenes Mongol army means Mars's archer races You can not watch movies. Another sick thing was the use of superb ingredient in the film. I do not want to go to the scenes that pictured Sinige as a prophet. We can say fairness of the movie, it is acceptable. However, when the scenes saw the old monk and went out to find the wife of Sengzin Khan, it was really fun. When the slower death in the desert, Kangiz's wife feels the dead and finds the corpse on the continent. We're talking about Asia? Again we laughed. There is a lot to say, but I do not think this movie has more value for talking.
