This picture proves that a good actor is nothing but a good direction. Ed Harris is terrible. How can you play an actor like Rambo to play "Maestro"? She shows no credibility and Bitoveren overplays Most, long hair does not look good at all on her head. The main actress missing all the subtleties needed for her character. The camera shot is cheesy and very common. Light letter emotions are closed. Bad cast and cheap direction very bad! When the only picture of the price of the movie is Bithra (I hope you do not want to give him his nickname?) Pushing the girl's song to a joke. However, I'm hoping that Harris can find his way in true movies where he can really show his illiterate talent.
