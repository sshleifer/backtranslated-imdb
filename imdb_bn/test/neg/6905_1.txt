Words can not describe how awesome this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I will take a stab in it: 1 - Merciful. The Hollywood graphics set creates more talking creatures. Apparently do not need script and storyline. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Children's movie but one of the letters is still severely attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Slowly stupid. The film is actually portraying human beings as farm animals. In Nemo, fish can speak, but in most cases they still fish. We only hear English as translations. At Bernard, animals could actually speak English, which others might understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Intelligent - There is no smart story line or even a smart comedy. (All right, the 13-year-old dog crutch was fun). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive - "Black" cow is actually played by a black actress. Pink cows are played by a white actress. The black cow was playing a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Sense - I'm aware of that thing like a male cow. I believe we say to them? If we are going to release our children's drip, it can be the simplest information right. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Barish After 4 years of my 4 years old we went away. He really fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate because it only proves the producers of Hollywood that the American public is just waiting to pay 8 paisa. Just get one or two hours to get some cool and calm kids. In an unfortunate situation. Why should the producers spend the actual money when the return will be in the same way.
