This movie sucks. It's horrible If someone likes it, then people should examine the head there. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a catastrophe. The man who tries to kill Gofar, he loses and sucks it. Although Chieve Chase was in this film, he was not funny. This movie had strange and weird jokes and Rodney did not die from Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Although Jackie Mason's character was the character of Rodney Danzerfeld, the character of Mason is frustrating. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should come back! I do not think so much about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray also came back. The original Caddyshack Murray had career performance. If he was first funny, he was funny in the second. <br /> <br /> Final comment: I recommend this movie ... no one !!!!!!!! This movie quarrels !!!! It's frustrating, it's stuck right now, and it'll always be in the scar !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
