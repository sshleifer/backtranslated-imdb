There are rumors that the fourth underwire will happen. If so, the third part, which is a prequel, will be in the middle of the franchise. With the projections of the original movies you always ask yourself which movies you want to see, so that it can understand ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I guess it does not matter. The third underworld movie is not equal up with the other two. They had obvious flaws too, but there is a little lacking in it and it seems like cash. It seems that it is not entirely embarrassing, which is embarrassing, because actors can definitely use good material to work. <br /> <br /> The story is fine, but it is not something special. A wonderful movie, but Ronana Mitra could not complete the shoes of Bichelle (yes she played another character, that means my void, Kate B. left) ...
