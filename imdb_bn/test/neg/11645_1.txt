One of my older high school teachers was ambitious that he made any movie, so one day my friend and I decided to create a movie called "Pacific Infarro". Later, we got a debate about whether Karl Weedars or Billy de Williams played a major role. Our teacher's argument seems to be interesting, so he came to us and told us that the main role of "Pacific Infarro" was by Jim Brown. We thought that he was trapped in a lie, until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inforio" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent a movie ... it's horrible. Our created movie was a good plot than this piece. The weather and Billy D were very good in the film.
