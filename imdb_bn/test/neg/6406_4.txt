There was a time when Joel Schmacher's favorite director was quite high on my list. In the late 1980's and early 90's, when he was associated with several great films like "The Lost Boys", "Flatlinens" and "Foling Down", he was the most expensive director of Hollywood. Then unfortunately the "Batman" signals came, and after that it seemed as if every possible great screenplay became a huge world in the hands of Shomacher. Both "8mm" and "phone booths" can be better movies and even the incredible concept of "number 23" should be processed in a more compelling and entertaining film. Originally beginning from the beginning, "number 23" tries to be strictly a mysterious and extravagant thriller and hence uses all the awesome clich√©s from the big book in the history of the movie, including heavy voice descriptions, flashbacks, incompatible structures, multiple personality characters, increasingly unreasonable and numerous plot twists that increase sinister shelter settings However, due to the continuity of the original formula and the explicit intrinsic participation of cast and crew, nothing simply helps. As much as you try to get involved with the lead character and to think openly about insane theories, it is still not a movie about two-digit numbers and two digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (James Kerry is a rare non-playful role) A sedentary creature whose wife Agatha gives her a weird book on her birthday. This book tells about all kinds of malicious theories and strange phenomena related to the number 23. Walter often identifies himself with the hero of the book (a miraculous detective investigating a suicidal suit of suicide) and has 23 igigas in his personal life. I have done some research in Google and Wikipedia and, apparently, these 23 numerical knowledge really exist, and some people really believe that most of the disasters and accidents are directly related to this evil number. That's okay ?? Crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge the people's faith and fear, regardless of how immersed they are, and I can only share my sincere opinions on a film based on an out-of-out barzor enzyme. "Number 23" does not sometimes make you think about the role of numbers in your own life, despite some cruel set pieces and nasty make-up effects. All cast members work under their normal capabilities, but the lovely Mrs. Virginia was happy to see Madsen in the relatively big production. If you are looking for a tricky and wonderful evening in the thrill of fun, it is definitely not recommended, but without the perfect creator and perfectly qualified.
