Technically I was a Van Damme fan, or I was. This movie is so bad that I hate myself for 90 minutes. Do not fool the name Isaac Florentine (unique 2), I had a great hope for this, I rely on what I saw (Unique 2), man .. Was I wrong ??! All the action fans wanted a big return to the classic action hero, but I guess we will not be able to see it soon, because our hero is coming with them (running borders - far-far-town-and-kel-bad-boys- Returning Home) Movies for the sake of God, we in 2008, and they emphasize that frustrating movies at every stage. Why? !!! Do yourself a favor, avoid it .. Importantly.
