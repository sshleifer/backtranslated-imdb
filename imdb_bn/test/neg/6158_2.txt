This picture fails in many dimensions. The script failed first, and I can understand that if the script is compressed then there is nothing that can fix. The plot is annoying, after the first 45 minutes, I say the DVD to myself, "How much?" Cinematography is quite awful. I do not know how bad the DVD transferred, but it looked like a VHS copy. Also, the sound was bad. I understand that this is not going to be remixed for 5.1, but it's not like the Dolby stereo that was the time to spend this film for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> Slipstream ad Mac Max and Blade Runner were very similar to comfort for both. It is extremely disappointing due to the lack of appropriate special effects and high quality dialogue. If I think, the pointer scene occurred within the last 20 minutes, generally it should be in the first 20. Most people will be completely confused with what's going on for the final 20 minutes. <br /> <br> The music part of the film was excellent, and then was completely inappropriate in others. Elmera Barnsten scoring, but somewhere else 'sticking' in the stuff seems like someone else's hand because it does not match overall good orchestral score (including some synthetic music). <br /> <br /> Great cast cast, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job of breathing a little available life in their character. (Well, Pacston's character was stupid, and the whole movie was centered on it. I'm not sure that the heroic stogy film is a good choice for the main character.) Again, the script is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> Kindly thank you I saw a mail order from the DVD service, or not in the theater. Overall, sci-fi fans, or Paxton fans, or a big disappointment for the attack. 90 minutes of your life, you will not get back.
