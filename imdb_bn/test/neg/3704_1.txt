This movie I saw is very bad. You might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time, but if you do not see it, then you do not know what a movie is terrible. But wait, bad news! Rerelease this masterpiece (I'm satirical) to see the studio soon! The only things that influence the film's plot, influence, direction, and production. Bill Rebeen, the poor man's Ed Wood (there is no wealthy person's Ed Wood) (I like Ed Wood's movie, though) things move throughout the film at a snap speed. It opens with the capture of a young big bird (a Little Foot? - Orie, it can not help), by a pair of impoverished hunters, who die by parents. It is the entire city where hunters live to go on a bigfoot victim jihad. It's quite a lot for this plot. Even the remake is not even anything interesting, and we can not take care of any of the characters in spectators. If anyone is interested in Reebon movies then I would recommend any other. However, I said, it will soon be reprinted with tromas to give new generation of filmmakers.
