Barney is just awful These shows say as many as other reviews. I do not agree with them (I will not do). Because I hate the show as much as I hate it. They use kids to look like six-grade, cheesy plots, awesome dialogs and really crappy special effects. Big purple dinosaur does not mention itself. He watched all other children's shows like prize winners (as I got Street awards, which I know). <br /> <br /> Please see only then Street, Thomas Engine Thomas or even Teletubbies. Avoid both, this and his films (which I've reviewed). They are both extremely crappy and unwarranted (even small children).
