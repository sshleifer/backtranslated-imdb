I guess the hearing about it was ready after all years. First it was heard from Siskel and Ebert. When they told Divine Shaft, then I wanted to see it. Then a friend told me about it in 1991. She said that her parents saw it when it first came out and her mother drowned her father almost! So I caught Pink Pink Flamingos this evening, I was ready. In most cases <br /> <br /> I still could not help but would be surprised to see the analogue close-up and blowjob scene. That said, I was sympathized with only the letters ed and egg people. His crying scene at the beginning of the movie, though somewhat helpless to the normal person, actually makes me sad. Although he was not sure, was nice, he had an intelligent voice. I was happy with her and the eggs, and they actually touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this poor-level production process was not good. And for the script, how does John Waters come with this stuff? Well, at least it's different.
