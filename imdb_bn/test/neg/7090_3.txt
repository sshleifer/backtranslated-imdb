"Permanent" / "My Fair Lady" is a new era in the story "You can see forever on a clear day": A professor tries to turn an ordinary girl into a society in society. During this time, instead of using language skills, Professor tries to do it by response to hypnotism and past life. <br /> <br /> Whenever you encounter a musical problem, critics continually set and dress up mentions plot and music. The songs are immediately forgettable. (No, "Take me to the church" here, I'm scared.) And the plot never goes anywhere. Gertrude Stein paraphrase, there are no "there" here. Characters move from point to point, from point to point. Professor Chabat claims that he will get the root cause of Daisy's troubles, but he never thinks so. <br /> <br /> All meaningful conflicts are avoided. For example, there is a time when University of Chabal claims that he stopped researching his re-birth or resigned. There is a conflict now! Daisy give up his career? Alas! Nothing comes from this development. After a scene or two, the university changed his mind and asked Chabat to continue his work. A lot for the conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent for this movie must have been combined: Directed by Vincent Mineralie. In writing, by Allan Jay Lerner. A Cast of Yeves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yeah, at the time of her career she was at the top of her play Barbara Straussand. <br /> <br /> But it's all flat. The effort to renew Lara's greatest success, the previously mentioned "My Fair Lady", has been destroyed due to failure, as Daisy is trying to revive her own past glory. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a movie theater, there is a much better choice.
