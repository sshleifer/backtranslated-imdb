The opportunity to create a strong religious epic, along with the "Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Things Ever Done", was an opportunity for NBC and instead they chose to create some semi-chartered cartoons that were like "Waterwork" than anything else. I do not remember a path in Lot where the lot becomes a pirate and attacks the ship, and Noah's son develops deep friendships with oranges, nor does Noah think that some crazy old lot acts like that suddenly. A naval commanding command and nautical words are shouting almost like "Get up in the main category!" This was probably the worst marketing decision in history. Clearly, most people are going to be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why does this film make the person so aggressive on earth? If they were deliberately trying to sue, why not notify it and at least be among the right audience? I hope they will make a real Noah film, one seriously and thinks, which appeals to people and earns money. Until then, do not waste your time with this trash.
