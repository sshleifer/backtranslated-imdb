Any temptation I see in this movie will stop, it's quite simply dull. The letters are predictable and stupid. The killer is quite unusual. This train has no tension available in the wreckage, fun, no style or basicity even a glimmer. And the cruelty of Hollywood clich√© is stifling. Oh, and you have a movie that creates an IRA terrorist's hero. Cute And now I have to say more to fill ten lines. And a little more enough? Not quite, how about now? No, the better should be the confabulation trick, but Jackal is not really worth the exposure of ten lines. The original though was great.
