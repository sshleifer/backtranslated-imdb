I've seen this movie some time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I got the vote. I tried the appropriate maker to get the story, because some moviemig said that it would be a movie for Rob Greed, that Pulp Fiction was for John Travolta ... well .. We all can see that he has not only failed, but he goes astray Fall. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw mostly bad movies. It's not too valuable to watch TV on-the-spot.
