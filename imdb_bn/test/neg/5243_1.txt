Without doubt, this worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Bad acting. Poor script Poor aspects and poor production <br /> <br /> Why are they bothered? This whole movie was a total fool. The suspension suspension can carry so far, but it totally limits it. <br /> <br /> For any comedic movie, the audience is often boring ...
