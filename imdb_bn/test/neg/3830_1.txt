About four months before the release, the movie was invited to the primary screening. I had to see this picture, and later I had to fill a packet in my mind. It was the hardest thing to sit in the world. The program simply crawls, and you're ready to wish you to die faster. It is a matter of fact, there are two types of Mormon films. Good with real good stories, and only plain strings. Monks and soldiers, now there is a good movie. However, with these wannabe comedies, writers and actors just tried very hard. Basically, they do not try to be fun. There is no wonder why so many small target audiences for these films; They are filled with 'inner jokes' which are not funny at the beginning, and they just try to have fun on average things. This story creates the movie and the stories of these films are only weak When I was asked to fill it after the movie, I could guess what my pocket looked like. ;)
