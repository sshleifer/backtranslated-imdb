Working hard to fit the horror space comedy style, this picture falls into both of these. It actually takes place in space - but it's not fun or scary. This plot is frustrating and a joke about computer intelligence, beyond death. Angel Whitthorn, as Frank and Brad Darrief al-Alton, Angela Baset makes their ham script the best.

All of this is whistst to ironing a turkey that is the best suited to late night TV.
