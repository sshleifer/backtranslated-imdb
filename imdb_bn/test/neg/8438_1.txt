The word is terrible, bad and bad, bad acting, woman leading actress cruel, and stories ... wait a minute ... there is no story ...! The plot is really bad and the movie title is confusing. If you want to see Piranhas you can be frustrated. Since 1978 and 1981, this movie has nothing to do with Piranah films. Actually, I can only think of a scene involving Pirhanhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I liked about this movie, even then run for only 85 minutes, finally the song. It is written by Jim Stein and it is said to "love all the things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's not funny to see it very bad. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I was a person watching something.
