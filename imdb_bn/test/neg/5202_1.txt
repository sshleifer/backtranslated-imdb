It's a terrible movie from almost every point. Since the previous opinions have already been mentioned, I should look at the "Serbs" and "Delta Force" boys in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Uniform Serbian "Serb" is not a Serbian. And the helmets are also wrong. The actor can not say the Serbian playing "Serbs", not even a language in the Serbian, "Behind the Enemy Line" where Boishakhi actors call their language better and at least add some of the movie's credibility. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-bearded "Serbian General" shows and works like a dead body, whenever the US Army calls him: <br /> - US soldier: "Graviks! Leave it! " <br /> <br /> - Gray-beard Moroccan General: (shot by AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Come out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shot AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravy! you're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (AK47 <br /> <br /> - The proposed person: "Forgive, Mr. Gray's bearded Moroccan general, see, we're empty and I've sent the boy to buy more, but he has not yet returned ... <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) When the army shoots the Delta Force AK47? I think they are Bulgaria There were not enough M4s to find, but the old AK47 and practice place were;) Maybe they went for some airsofts, they are cheap and will not harm the credibility of the movie. <br /> 5) Talking to rocket scientist At the time hanging with a deaf officer rope, he always kept his finger on the trigger. An intelligent person with no arms training Just plain common sense that will work. I guess that's his acting that increases the comfort level of the gun that way anymore. <br /> <br /> This movie is so insulting to common sense ..
