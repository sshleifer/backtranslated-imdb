Thankfully, I have seen this movie alone, which enables me to move fast through the worst scenes. All right, it's nothing good, partly good photography (even some under the water scene) and sometimes it's not a very bad direction. But it still does not save incredibly poor script and played badly in the way. In addition, even when I do not find "hottie" movies, even wannabe-sexy love scenes get dull. Really dull! And for the drama: You know that it's always a bad sign, when you dislike all the characters so you really do not give any priority and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet achieved, you can find something of your choice in this movie, tired of the reality series Survivor. If not, stay well!
