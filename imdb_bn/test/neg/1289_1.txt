If you ever plan to hire this movie (not to buy hope) then think again. Gary had a gun on his head and he was forced to work or die. I'm just surprised if Bushy is arrested for doing something and is sentenced to play in this movie because I can not see the guy who did so well with Keanu Reeves in this disaster point break game. It was an entertaining movie, but thousands of other good-looking movies that make you laugh at your money. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> If you like a good funny movie, pass Quigley and rent Spongebob or something.
