Yesterday we decided to go to the movies. We've also picked more "Ik oak van jou" in random conditions, but we are interested in seeing the current Dutch film making situation. <br /> <br /> This picture is based on a book by Ronald Jeffert, and I must admit that he is not just my favorite one. This film features actors who are known in Nethrallands for their appearances on sub-opera and / or discussion events in the afternoon. Some of them have been doing some fairly good things after leaving at least one (kamarling) soap in the world. So we decided to give this movie the suspicion. <br /> <br /> And there was no mistake. This movie fails on all fronts. Bad performance (best performance is actually by a Guinea pig, which pretends to be very firmly dead). In the story (Black people do not have to use sunscreen, as far as I know and the Netherlands's heating system does not produce clouds) in a strange and unintended way (why France? Why is the story from a woman from Uganda?) Like steamy like New York, even if it feels great in the film Either way, people do not wear T-shir outside New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, how? I cried one of them and said that he was very disappointed, because he loved the book. I did not read the book, but I must have advice: read the book, do not see the movie.
