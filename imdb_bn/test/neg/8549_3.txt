Despite the horror script (more about that later), the film is still vaguely viewable because it's two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwick and Henry Fonda. Along with one or two real stinger, I'd probably like to see something about them in this film, because I was a huge fan of the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 40s and 40s of the 1930s. However, how much I love their movies, I just can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts on vacation in some ski resorts with the Fund and Stanwick. The two have not been seen yet, but during the skiing, the duo began to loudly loudly flirt together. It becomes so turbulent and makes my teeth crushing, but I keep stopping it - especially when the punda fell into a snowstorm and it stopped yodeling! Hightite, maybe I closed it off! The pandal falls and Barbara goes for help. Back in Ski Lodge, she looks okay but thankfully she is also a doctor and she has been in X-ray and has returned to the health of the nurse. She, instead, became infatuated with her and offered her. Although rarely intelligent, they get married and so far the film seems to be a sweet but very little romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once they get home they are not all pink. A family doctor and she started to show signs that her jealousy is due to a controlling and potentially dangerous person. The film tells everyone to laugh, but to be honest, the fundamental behavior was surprising indeed - spying on him and his male patients, attacking any person or threatening, hitting the back of the patient behind and stuck in an amazing party that everyone there (Male and female) his wife is stolen out. He was shut down as a combination of sociology and paranoid schizophrenic, but everyone should laugh to laugh. It seems that he feels like a dangerous nuts, you think Stanwick will file a cancellation order with a ban! But, surprisingly, he becomes crazy but can not be crazy at Pandya because he is ........? I can not remember the exact word - 'vague' comes to mind all !!! Later, Neel worked counter to a department store outside the multi-millionaire fund. Then, by the magical thinking, he and the fathers seem to feel his enmity and violent jealousy is a matter of the past - so an act apparently removes anger and suspicion. When this work falls, Fonda completes the film by purchasing his own hospital, giving a job to Barbara and they are happy later. They do nothing else with the story, but I guess based on the character of Funda that he most of the time beat up all male patients as a hospital administrator. <br /> <br /> The first part of the ski was not well equipped with the lodge and the next one together, nor the final "Horatio of Algeria" inspiration section where the wealthy boy was good in the business world. They were like three separate plots but in spite of this, the most serious problem with the film was to eliminate internal violence and misleading jealousy! What a weird little film! Best wishes, not for Stan Stoody, but for their other lovely movies.
