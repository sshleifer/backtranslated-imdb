Some of the weird stuff ended, a vague, waste motion picture that the filmmakers probably did not understand themselves. If they show more of Satan's customs or whatever, it can be frozen, but now it stands, it is time and brain waste of cells. Anyone else has become ill "Draw vague picture with little baby crayon"? Probably could be a big horrible clich√©? Probably not. I know, I know, it comes from some other countries, and it is very sophisticated and sophisticated to me, so I should not expect to feed "plots" pinch, Bla, Bla, Bla. Anyway. I'm still not saying the movie.
