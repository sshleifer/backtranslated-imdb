When you proceed to a movie, you know that you are wasting your time while watching the movie. When I was watching "Dark" I felt. I could expect every twist and easily see it. It is "The MTVville Horror" and an extraordinary movie that is harmoniously compatible. It's so stupid that I got close proximity. I can not say I was completely annoyed but I think the film is very tribal for my taste. Director Balguro tried to re-launch his first Spanish hit "The Anonymous", but he can not stop it. I acknowledge that some sequences were surprising enough, but I just hate when I can decide what's going to happen next. Also, I was unhappy with the good actors of Lake Olin and Ziancarlo Giaynini that the pieces were broken into pieces. Finally, Anna Pookin as the star of Hannah? It will be a joke. She is one of the best child actors who are intelligent but she has become a very neutral adult actor. You can live without watching this one.
