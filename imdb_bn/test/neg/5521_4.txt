The Happy Days was one of my favorite shows during the 1974 promotion. But critics ignored this show with a sense of humor, with slam because they thought it was an inexpensive endeavor of cash to make American Grafitti's success. <br /> <br /> There are some similarities between American Gaffatti and Happy Days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of them were held in a pre-era era and both leading roles As one of the featured in Ron Howard. But there were some big differences. American Grafstyatti was held in California in 1962 and centered on taking this big step among adults across a group of new postgraduate high school students, Happy Days were centered around a group of thirteen in Millsclay, Wimbonson, and High School. Joy and adolescence suffering <br /> <br /> Happy Days is basically open with Bill Halley's original version or blanket rock orange The Clock Jack Box. But when the adults got hot, thanks to the success of American Grafitti, and through the original 1955 version of Rock orange the clock, entering the Billboard Hot 100 and hit again in 1974, the royalty payments went through the roof. So the song was replaced with a "remake" (the exact word is now "new stereo recording") rapidly replaced. <br /> <br /> The present theme song for Happy Days is presented to me by memory then presented in the second season. Right <br /> <br /> <br /> Fan and enemies agree similarly that this show feathers. The Liberty was accepted and the details were ignored, this program was reduced to pure authenticity. <br /> <br /> This is perfectly fine. Happy comedy is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But sometimes writers sometimes get stuck in their necks when they hit controversial issues. Cunningham's building is a center in the center of the surrounding shelters. Another episode was about to move around with a divorced woman dream to start a new life. When Howard was invited to marry a friend of the old army, pregoodis was fixed, which became black (in an era when discrimination and discrimination were sadly an acceptable part of American living). The draft issue has also come up to the next phase! <br /> <br /> The set was originally shown in 1955. Wisely, there was a problem with Caste. Most of them were teenagers and each year as well as they became older so that they crossed the Caste series, away from the safe water of Eisenhower, the serial removed from the age of camelot, all the way through JF and then in the turmoil in the 1960's. The writers who had withdrawn from thinking and later left the series like Ron Howard, left the wise wisely while leaving out of wisely, they dragged me to the show and made the right thing. When they were ahead The idol that worshiped the studio audience, who could not always control themselves, the Great Fantasy enters the scene and starts wearing very thin. <br /> <br /> This show originally featured Fableus Pfccizi. Remember that era. Healing time wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I like to hear "original hit versions" on "New Stereo Recording", "New Stereo Recording" works very well on Happy Days. And this I'm sorry to buy a DVD! The DVD of the entire first season is different, the original music has been replaced with different music in the second season. Although the original episodes were digitally restored in digital perfection, it was great that the original music was so much fun to make the show so much fun!
