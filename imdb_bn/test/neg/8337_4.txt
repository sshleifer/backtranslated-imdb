Chasey Luansi blamed Lava from La Bray's Pats of Los Angeles Even if you try to suspend the mistrust by ignoring this ridiculous proof, you will still be jealous of the mad dialogue, the enthusiasm of the comedic plot and the strange scientific plot that lies on the screen. I have a theory: Every successful actor has been lost in his career at least for a bad movie at any given time. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so kind and he goes down in flames (oh, sorry about that). Most supporters are also disturbed by the hacked writing; Some of the actors simply call their role simply. Anne Heche is a scientist worthy of the recognition of the sham for his strange illustration. As he believes strongly about this role as P. Wei Harmon, and even he will be done at least a good acting job. <br /> <br /> Scientific plot holes listed here are very numerous, I instead recommend you show the movie with friends, and there is a game of "Find Scientific Inconsistencies". The damaged ones can be forced to listen to tapes of dried line from the film "Looks Like the World". Here's a sample of what you can expect: a plan designed to blow up a building, engineers, and dynamite sets and all blasts in about 20 minutes in one place. <br /> <br /> We will not forget the compulsory disaster film clich√©s: divorced parents, scientists who ignore everyone, insulting police, tough street kids, Braati Terrers, greedy investors etc. All present and abundant. The film is blurred over the head through uninterrupted barrage of political synthesis. <br /> <br /> For fans of cheese and cilines only. All other viewers: Be careful.
