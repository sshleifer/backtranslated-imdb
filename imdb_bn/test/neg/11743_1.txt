A horrendous film, ill and raw. Anne Hey and Vince Von are worse than Perkins and Leigh in the original version that they believe will be believed. There was no reason to create this image, which simply highlighted how Hittkock was perfect and brilliant and inappropriate. Also, there is a great, enormous insensitivity in movies not in the first movie. Hitcoak's psycho was scary and frustrating, but in fact he can feel even for all concerned, even the worst Norman Bates. There were no moments of stomach, satire and feather laughter. Among the best things about Hitkoc's film, it was incredible and intuitive depth and different ideas, when to spend and what to show, whether to use a mortgage or a lengthy shot, whether an actor should be sympathetic, and when afraid of him, and so on Announcement There is no quality in the remake and even does not even try for them. It's a stupid exercise that I am surprised even got released.
