Oh dear There is a mirror in this sequel, this time, which caused the evil spirits of a psychopath, who killed the whole family and shotgun at MTVL home. The mirror kept the whole ugly incident of the frightened family, who had no time to prepare for their non-resident guest. The mirror is given to a photographer's case (who is responsible for his dad's father, and the person responsible for the killing of the family), and this is a very bad loft who is soon terrorized. Such as what is pictured by Pool Suki, Julia Nixon-Soul) where she sees it when she lives. Soon what is the nightmare, he saw his father's eyes shot him dead in cold blood, worried he could follow his footprints. Soon he looks at other events in his father's eyes, such as a terrible day throws his mother's head on the floor of an organization or feels a moment inside the cell, for example, by the doctor, he is driven by drugs. <br /> <br /> As good as Caius's Loft owner, David Knight (better known as American Wayolfsf in London) is better off than stuck in the same way, such as Richard Roundery, a psychic sculptor / artist, terry and queen as psychiatrist, and especially Lin Shay as a ridiculous ditsy, rather strange secretary nurse in the shelter (.. put the parents of the case) will be closed shortly. <br /> <br /> Sexy, eccentric saliva slutman, treacherous wife of Nutan (she was on the verge of beginning a relationship with Nikoman-Soul), rounding out the film, what supportive girlfriend Barbara Howard (Friday 13th: final chapter), Jack Oraud is tragic that the deadly people who tried to kill his son, as innocent people did, and Robert Rousselar (Alym Street 2 A Freddie Revenge) Many rejected lover (Nixon-compromise ..) who seek revenge for the death penalty, unfortunately, died in an unfortunate time to separate the painting. <br /> <br /> This picture is a poor special effects movie using the title of Amityville as cash in the movie. It was never too good to start with the franchise, but every signal was greenish, it became worse and worse. After the third picture, furniture from the notorious house is subjected to "painful" items. Although the cast is working hard, the material lacks quality (.. a mirror that creates chaos and killings in a supernatural way), and instead the special effects of mediate do not help in matters. O'Quinn, as little as that he would have to work with, why he looks so great actor, he can make such emissions even brighter as such. Not all is lost, you are always wearing a super short skirt (.. or his man's shirt on his pants), Slipman spreads his legs on his legs..then, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, Amivivil: The seventh movie in the franchise was the new generation! Picture of the monster pictured by Nixon-Solar artist, the most perfect part of the film, probably inspired by the evil mirror after watching it.
