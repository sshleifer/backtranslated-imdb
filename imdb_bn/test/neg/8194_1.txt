I was flipping through the channel. I came to a channel 124. This is a city channel. I saw this movie and decided to try it out. Because of this picture I've often been a murderer. I've made home movies and they're oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The light was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. I'd rather see Star Crystal ... .. Holy cow probably is not a good example. My main question about this picture is ... can it be a morality movie? Why do I ask because because this was a line where a lady in a wheelchair said, "I used to be another gang statistician" Oh my head started to hit. I went to the kitchen after hearing this line and someone brave to watch this movie prepared a knife to shake. But some ideas have kicked and I just changed channels to see people with Afro paint. Well that would tell me about this movie. If you want to tolerate this pain, go ahead but in the worst case of small fuses or trips is not recommended for them.
