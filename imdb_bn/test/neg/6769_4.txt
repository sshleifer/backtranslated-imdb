Repeat the episodes apparently from the Biggb TV show on the big screen. Although it often happened in the 50s and 60s because people did not have any TV or color TV, and the producers wanted an extra return on their investment (big screen ticket sales or 'sy syndication' for the small screen recovery of a series), the results are generally the sum of its parts Was less. The only time I saw it was the story of several parts (Ala Rocky Jones or the Man of the Uncle) or in the case of horror math (The Ville and 13 Demon Street). Here's a story about how the FBI hacks them, as well as the conversation between Americans and criminals of the 20s and 30s (Dealing, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Claude etc). This is a strange concoction that mostly does not work because it is clear that there is something here that does not have to be together. Once more I looked at the TV once more because things do not seem right. With fairness, I will not describe the origin of production because it is how the primary TV (and series) was. It's not bad, but it's not very good. The work that I have seen to be fully honest in the series episode is a single episode where we are not expecting much. I would prefer to rent the show's DVD instead of the movie.
