This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was unbelievable, and I have not been left out of the 1990 Oscar nomination. And like this, you can not leave brilliant writing and directions, like the Hulkers, in this movie, which vaults this best piece at the highest level of film credit. If you have not seen this movie, then drop what you're doing now and get a copy of yourself. I guarantee it will blow your mind. And if you do not like it, I have a question for you .... 24-inch Python and Hulkamania should watch over the wild running on you !!!!
