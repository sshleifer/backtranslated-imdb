First of all, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion, these two films make and define C-Fi Horror Genes as we know today. I noticed the lifeforms were often compared to Allianz Saga - I would highly disagree after seeing this movie. Something is right with the Alien Vampire, and the story line may be acceptable. I can not get past a nude women vampire across the whole movie, it's absolutely weird (though she looks good). Add a bunch of bad British acting and it's quite a lot. Most movies end up in London or anywhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose outcomes settings and lose some hope of some real C-FI action and suspense. <br /> <br />
