I really enjoyed Abbott and Costello Fan (though I enjoyed "Who On Fast!") And to be honest, there was not much in this movie that would inspire me to see any other work. It was not really bad. It was a lightly sunny scene and was actually a very strong monster run by body bars, but in any way, the fame of both, and the respect that they normally hold, is not telling me that I was more expected. When the story goes away, the pair falls into the child's job, and Jack and the Benestal as a sleeping story (with reading it to Castello) Costello's jack falls asleep and dreams in the story itself. There is a sense of "Wizard of Oz" story, in which the characters of the dream are equal to the real-life contacts of Jack and the film opens in black and white and changes to colors according to the sequence of dreams. Dancing scene scenes among Jack and The Giant and Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the compelling parts of the movie. Polly, of course, also leads to the questions of the movie - what happened to him? Jack and the gang apparently leaves behind him in the castle's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who care? Still - I'm surprised. There was also a couple of beautiful songs and dance routines. My 4-year-old giggled a bit during this time, so he was able to appreciate some of the humor. I found this as an acceptable timevaster, but of course there is nothing that you do not believe in Abbott and Costello as humorous. 4/10
