After her widow father died in a horseback accident, young Tom Berlin (as Jim Craig) went to manage the Australian "Snow River" farm, to help only crazy-eyed Prospector Kirk Douglas (as Spur). Times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for Mr. Douglas' Rich, silver-haired brother Raquan "Mr Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When comes to work a big, silver-haired (old?) Douglas thinks Burlinson go along with very young and inexperienced; So, Burlinson is behind, and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> "George from the Snow River" director George Millar's weak, poorly proven viewpoint is a weak storyline. For example, watch the sequence of events "Lost Jessica" When the girl lost in that "scary" storm, she ran away. After her worried father predicts a bad weather forecast, one of the drunk people is surrounded to find him. The daughter "Jessica" rolls herself to a conveniently present steep edge. Dad and Suddenly people do not check the burlinson farm. The discovery of the daughter of Hero Burlinson. After the fire, he decided to kiss her. <br /> <br /> "romance" is played very brutally as men and women attracted as Bulinson and Miss Thornton. To make things even worse, Douglas brothers have a "dark history" that is released before any mystery is made about the matter. The main attraction, here, is the Australian Scenery. <br /> <br /> Man from the Snow River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Berlin, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
