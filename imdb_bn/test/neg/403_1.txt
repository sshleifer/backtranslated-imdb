This is a movie you see because it's bad. A movie that you just see its little artisan. It's a terrible horror, I can not imagine that one can be afraid of soil bugs, especially one that is transparent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it. <br /> <br /> Even in addition to the budget, it also attracts detailed attention and even the attempt to make the film credible make it fun, because they could replace all the actors and the whole story with them. There was nothing to be fun during my play, I'd stop after 10 minutes, put some quality show on the sponge bob pants (rate hare rate). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Brett Piper to get along Quintin Tarantino and really pump some ointment out. <br /> <br /> :)
