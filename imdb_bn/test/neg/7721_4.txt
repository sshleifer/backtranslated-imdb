"House of the Dead 2: Dead M" (2005) is a Siegel, although you do not really need to see "The House of the Dead" first to get this picture. That said, the price of the production is definitely definitely there, with lots of zombie effects and it has been quite well-edited with very effective sound designs. However, that said, that's all good here. <br /> <br /> Story and script horror. . . There are blatant plot holes everywhere. It is also interesting to note that if the soldiers do not get blood from their mouth (28 days after blood is transmitted in any part of the body) they will not remember them. Also realistic about how little order is possible with US military disciplined soldiers is also realistic. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
