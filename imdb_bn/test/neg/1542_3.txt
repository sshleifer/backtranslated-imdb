Something frustrating about watching a film like 'Marder by Niemers' because it is a good film trying to pop out anywhere within the Hollywood source. However, by credit roll, there is no reservation. The whole thing has been blown out in most of the "Kapol side" story, where genres of Sandra Bulk and Ben Chaplin's genocide have been confused by a painful sexual relationship, which makes the film even longer. Though Bullock's role is strong, it is not enough to save lazy scripts and lazy passesings. Ben Chaplin's talent has been lost in a wonderful role (he has done much better than this year's birthday girl), along with Chris Pen, whose role is so grateful that you feel like him. However, this plot is not really the reason for this film. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt, two teen killers, are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Their talents and chemistry work quite well and they play off each other well. It is very bad that they were not nearly in the best movies. Here's a safe ground way for this kind of movie maker for Berbette Schroeder. Bottom Line: If you're a genre fan, it's a rental price, but others will live a full life without just looking at it, only with convenient commercial breaks on network TVs.
