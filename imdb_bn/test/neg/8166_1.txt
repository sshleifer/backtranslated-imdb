Well, I only grab the tail of this photo in HBO, the last 10 minutes or more, but I must say that sometimes it is the most ridiculous illustration of the distance running distance! I am a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of sports, and I'm sitting through a lot of painful protests in movies before. However, in the last 10 minutes of this movie, I could never prepare for what was shown on the screen, it literally denies faith! The scripts of the runners are more ridiculous, African hockey players keep the game in full swing and they are elegant and delightful. The female playwright shuffles like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporter is no better. Well, this alleged world war rover runs around, overweight people, many of whom are walking! I find it interesting that the director has decided to manage the women's competition in his competition, but ultimately he sees that they are walking on two broken legs! Can we believe that this amazing star has only kept a crippled man at the end of the nation? Maybe the director feels that the female runner can not drive at more than 12 minutes and he must not have heard of athletes like Palla Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> If you're not running fan you'll be surprised by the unfinished illustration of running, and this movie is watchable just as strangers and comedy. Here is a note given to the director: Next time when you decide to make a movie about a sport, it can certainly be valuable for renting at least one person, who actually saw this game.
