Awful production is a "film." As does not qualify. It definitely shot on the video tape, and that was too weak! There is a constant scratching sound for audio (sounds like a bad microphone), which is a lot of annoying which you sometimes do not understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed music will appear in a scene suddenly, and the whole edited a thing about a zero <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and ridiculous. A 20-year-old man trying to hide his boyfriend from his parents? Please! And when he kisses his son's picture and finds a picture of his son, his reaction is beyond the melodramatic and the fool is stupid. Talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! Acting is worse than a porno movie, and the direction is very poor <br /> <br /> As far as "production" goes, there is no one! <br /> <br /> This title easily tries to call yourself a "film" on a lam video. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> bad work! Wrong writing! The title of Bid Druckering, and the "Producer" title is terrible because the trash it probably cost them the cost of the videotape shot. <br /> <br /> The trash of this amtueware is not deceptive even after leaving a business in a DVD to the cunsomer. I can not give horrible pressure on how this "SUGARPLUM" shit! <br /> <br />
