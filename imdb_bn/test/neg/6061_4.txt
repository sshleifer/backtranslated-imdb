My guess is that this is going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter long, because otherwise it can be explained in a brief, brief way. I was not completely lost, but I usually partially lost and usually obscure on character motivation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most interesting idea of ​​film as a war between both women is, but the film will touch the ball on the male, so that the followers of the hero will be quite horrific and Zeus's followers will not believe or believe. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods and they have no real assurance that they exist. So it has got sophisticated ideas, but it does not do any useful work with them. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene involving bad conversations, cardboard letters, and Hercules and his three opposing sons. Not worth the obsessive but observer
