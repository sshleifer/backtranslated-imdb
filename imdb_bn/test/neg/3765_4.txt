I love this movie and after watching it a few weeks ago I saw my copy twice. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I did not check the dates, but this movie is coming later, and certainly at about the same time, we got the idea about the popularity of Coliar and Walt Disney. The spaceship is the view. Being promoted by W.O. Brown. This is reflected in the true and correct attempt to think scientific. However, specific ideas are provided (for example, step assistants), fairly accurate, other things are hilariously incorrect. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket reaches a height and then enters ninety degrees ... such as reaching the flight of the stairs and turning to the landing! Then we are told that the rotation of the Earth increases according to the total speed of the bend by turning. <br /> <br /> This is a sunny misunderstanding about what's actually happening. Most of the place launch centers are located near Ecuador, where the Earth and its pages are roughly a thousand miles rolling, leaving a rocket space, the direction in the east (the same as the planet's rotation). Of course, if the ship becomes a retreat once in space then its speed will be more with the Earth's surface, but it will not add anything to the actual speed of the car. This movie decsribed as "wind speed"! Similarly, we are told that travelers feel free or "deafness" when reaching thousands of miles away from the planet outside the gravitational field of the planet. Again, ridiculous mistakes. Most crewed spaceship travels more than a few miles, but as long as they are traveling at an adequate speed (and, along with their crew, including crew), an extraordinary side pulls their speed back into serious, they will fall free to read orbit. Of course, traveling far from the world and even a slow object will be coastal offshore outside the Earth's gravitational, but the need to achieve "counter-velocity" on the outer side (in the example of the moon) to leave Earth's orbit, about a thousand miles per hour. So the cars will already be acquired by definition "literal velocity" (and "weightlessness"). <br /> <br /> But the film is a lot more sunny. If someone misses the moon due to technical difficulties, they would have been more fun, had fallen asleep for a few days and then they were awakened to go to Mars militarily! The captain then influences that this divine intervention must be done! At any given time, any wisdom to become a scientist becomes fragmented like a collision and is thrown into the air in the midst of a growing artwork of a successful armored plot. <br /> <br /> Illustrating the power of such a movie really "how far we have come". Women's attitude is not low. Both female riders and riders on the female crew are drowning. This kind of attitude seems to have been "normal" so recently. <br /> <br /> I said at the beginning, this movie is very entertaining, late at night, illuminated the romance through outdoor romance, which actually happened from the day before. It has now turned into the 20th century as the enthusiasm from the SpaceFlight cold routine. <br /> <br /> I will not publish at all. It's both brave and adventurous for this vintage and a movie of character.
