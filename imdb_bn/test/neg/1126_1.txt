All right ... this may have May Spoilers ... but who really cares? If you do not pay for seconds in your life, then waste your trash during this trash. This film does not have a release quality ... and I say movies are the whole fan of the holiday series. I love cousin Eddie character from other holiday movies ... but he works just as a supporter character. Am I blaming Randy Coed for the failure of this movie? definitely no. I think he's a great actor ... but there is no match in this movie ... pansing is off ... it's just a little weird. And the actor who played "the third" ... Jake Thomas ... was probably terrible because of a real lack. I do not know why ... but his whole character finds me out. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this is a horror film because it does not have anything to do with Shevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo .... Scripts, instructions, acting ... special effects ... everything is a train debris. With orphans And kittens Oh ... and the train ran on some old people too. <br /> <br /> Please, do anything ... stay away from this smell! I call it the holiday franchise name dirties because it is corrupt.
