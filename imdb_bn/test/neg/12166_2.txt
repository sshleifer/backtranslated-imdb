OK, I'm really into King's stuff, but this is just awesome. In the whole movie, I'm waiting to do something deeper about the main character's new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst movies, because it is better than watching a commercially played movie. But this cake takes. I gave it a 2, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
