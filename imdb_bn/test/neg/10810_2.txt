All right, I have seen this movie in mystery science theater 3000, but I have seen this movie, so I think I will make a comment on it. I love again how Joe stuck with a terrible role, when his brother and nephew got the role of Oscar winning and left only. Soultaker will technically call you that you will be in good movie. Directors and actors took this film very seriously, and very influenced by Chess, a story that was not very meaningless, and did not mention the tricks of tough acting. This is one of my favorite MSST3 episodes, simple because most of what they have mentioned is thinking across the whole film and I'll explain why at one moment. <br /> <br /> A couple of Natalie and Jach broke up and now things are trying to work. But Junk is in the upper middle class and Natalie is in middle class, so it will not work. But on the way home and Zach's friends fell into a car crash and now the death penalty / death to death for their suicide quota was later on. But it seems that there is some kind of relationship with Nelli and it just can not move. So now Natalie and Zach will have to continue their five-minute race for one minute clock to save their souls and lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I think there was a staircase in heaven that he sang when the jeep was wrong, I wonder if black Sabbith was very wrong, lol. Basically there are many plot holes in these movies, as no one can see the character and they can not be killed, can they still open the buttons and doors? Angel of death was a very strange face and the story itself was a little confusing. Saltokar was just a violent movie that suddenly ran out and you feel so bad for the less appreciated Shane / Estovez brother. <br /> <br /> 2/10
