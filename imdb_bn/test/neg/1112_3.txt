The Wicked Little Things have a nice synopsis: the empty houses beside the abandoned mine of woods with tragic past; The family came home and strange things started to happen; Little unclear kids started pop-up here and are doing strange-little-children-doing things. But where is the finesse and potential fun ends A few decades ago, this group of children had been sealed in the mine and now they are running wood (poor makeup) with the help of meat. Oh I get it, this is a ghost-junky movie. Hmmm .... when I can appreciate something new with this style, it did not work. What was the motivation of children to consume meat? Why do they need weapons? Does anyone else think that filmmakers gathered around daily footage because they thought it was going to be a cool / scary movie? I have seen that after thirty minutes I felt the resignation that I had wasted my time in another modern cat-festival. The performance was good and the good quality setting / artists also thought of lack of knowledge about the superstitious system. A bunch of kids walking down the mall is a scarier than this pack of weaker incognito rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and I can appreciate stories, even if I had read it, instead of seeing it, I still have been told that malicious Little Things are more precisely known as the Witch Little Trud.
