I will not comment much, what ??? Stereotype Characters, full ignorance about the reality of Colombia, the scenes at the horror, poor color choices, and not funny (it is supposed to be a comedy, and they hope you laugh because it's beside some stupid songs, which are beside vague scenes), Very bad actor direction (if you see those people somewhere, I mean interpreter, you know that they are at least good, but The film looks at the mill, it is impossible to guess), you're tired of the music ... this "comedy" There's no rhythm, it's only good rhythm, rap singing it in the final achievement .... sad, is not it? Etc ... etc ... It has been so much time since I have not seen any movies so bad !!
