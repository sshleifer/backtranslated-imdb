Deodato is really sadness to see such a great director once provided such a second rate giallo. This movie was so horrible that it effectively ended her movie career. The box is false, it's no "erotic thriller", hell during the film's 97-minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely sees us a nipple! William Burger once showed (once in his last roles), but his character suddenly became stuttering and impatient. This movie fails in many ways. Claudio Simente's music is a little more than noise, and the plot creates very little ideas. For some reason, the invading ghosts using Facebook have robbed Luis. (?) To the end, all the characters forgot the last 90 minutes of hell, and laughing at Levi's ex-boyfriend Levies, because of the ill effects of evil spirits. What?!? This movie did nothing to me except anger ... and gave me half the death. For fun of the 80's Didodo, watch the Barbarian or Atlantis interpreters, let it rotate in the video store shelf. Argentina could do better than this giallo!
