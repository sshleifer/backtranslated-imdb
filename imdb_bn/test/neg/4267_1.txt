I have found many IMDB user reviews and, in most cases, they criticize the film from a very professional perspective, and the man in the street is not completely deviated from what he or she wants to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case I said it is BAD. I was caught in a SciFi junk and nothing in this movie that took me for a second. <br /> <br /> There was no right story. I can be a fool but still do not know where the government was so worried about this piece. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Half of the two pieces were already in place and he was only to add third. A 3-year-old child has been able to keep them together. <br /> <br /> This image was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
