I think Walter Pizadon made a mistake in this picture badly. Not just the role of the protagonist. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and played good enough in her part. No one else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I think the TV series of this movie has been discontinued since this little childhood. I think even a plastic "Seaview" that was great for submerse and playing with the bathtub. Many times ago <br /> <br /> <br /> I have read for some other criticism for this film: It is a mistake to judge special effects or science by today's standards before 4 decades. The effect was just right for 1961. Not great, but OK. For science, that was even ridiculous for 1961. There is no excuse. Also, the sub was very broad. I understand that the Navy refused any help for this movie, so the filmmakers did not have any idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film annoys me. (And I'm a Sci-Fi fan.) This one can not recommend. Grade: D-
