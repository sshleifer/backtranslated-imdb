A cryptologist is captured in a mysterious silk on a Caribbean island. To go back to civilization, he traveled on the coast of the cargo of a huge luxury cruise ship, and I think this script had catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> Let's start a movie that I really do not like about this movie .... The monster really looked like a man in a rubber suit. CGI scenes looked like a different movie. All the bits of this B movie are closed in close proximity to my book. <br /> <br /> The best thing was John Rice-Davies (his daughter's second stop.) John was suddenly funny and civilized. It does not matter what the author told him, he said good. He was given the job he had to do for good work. Saiposologist was at the top and had fun to see, there were some interesting bits. The moron was all right and makes good. Canon sheets for some monster like crew and guests. This movie contains some interesting funny lines and a beautiful sub-plot of a thief involved. <br /> <br /> Special effects are usually less and I swear that they use the same blood spray of the wall scene in almost four different parts of the film. I was just like a cow with a charming man. Actually the film was not scary, so I think the film's watch power should go a little more to the heat. <br /> <br /> If you like the bunny to all, it is a sight to see.
