Mode Squad is not a movie, it's a void. Is it the most interesting thing about me and keeping me watching that thing ?? I have never seen a film that has not been given much before. It is not a movie without any reason to exist, apparently not designed to be contractually obligated to someone who dislikes the studio. There is no plot, there is no characterization, no set piece action scene, there are no visible scenes, only continuous gradation of empty shots is progressive in 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about empty silent summer blockbusters, but "the pages were not available to us, so fix the camera somewhat and stop getting it for 90 minutes." This gives you Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. Its 'artistic success' makes praise. That much more Jimmy Ribi is the most tragic executioner executed by thousands of morsions by performing Marlon Brando's ritualism, Michael Lerner's dancing with Omar Ips, and more than that? Do not do that. Oh, Claire Dances has a nice smile on a shot. And Dennis Farina has ideas to kill off first. In fact, the greatest foolish movie of all time has been created, it's like humorous without humor, but you know for kids.
