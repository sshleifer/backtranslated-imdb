DVD alpha video for this movie - an organization that often publishes the best quality prints. Alfa's defense is often the only print available, but public domain and cheap-and-film expert If you can find another print from another company, try it first because the print of this movie is annoying and faded. Still, compared to most alpha DVDs, it's pretty cool - especially the term is quite clear (and alpha can never include closed captions - even with scary sounds). <br /> <br /> A man has been dating a lady for a very long time. One night, he spent a bad boy and with another woman at night. Soon after that he comes clean to his drunk, he pardons him and gets married. <br /> <br /> Soon after the marriage, she calls the other woman ridiculous - she needs to see him and just try to kill himself. When they meet, he learns that he has an STD and he wanted to know that he might have found it now. Then, there's a nurse and they're treating him for trying suicide, though, he somehow find a gun and kill himself! Makes a huge mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he will not tell his new wife. Some time passed and now he and the baby are infected! At this time, the doctor met with the man and told him about the importance of treatment and they showed him the infected person's admission room (in fact, it was only the STD people's film that they split into films - mostly those who have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In some ways the image is very progressive. This is a serious problem and it's interesting how couples encourage not to wait to get married, but they can get married faster and give sexual requests - but only with each other (not bad advice). On the other hand, the film is not exactly what it says. They do not use STD, Video or its views, even it does not even name the disease. Often it speaks syphilis, but at other times it talks about herpes or other STD - the information is not very clear or specific - this is a common problem with such films of this era. At that time the audience was quite confused about what they had seen, and perhaps even more 'quick' friends felt more naïve to explain it to them! <br /> <br /> In the 1930s-50s to say "such movie", many small and often silly production companies made movies by reducing the dangers of drugs and sex (although they really only want to promise something to the audience Which cheese does not usually see hot rent in Hollywood movies?). These are so violent, funny because they are so complete and the so-called information is wrong. The most famous example is the Referred Médnés and Saak Madness (both of which are the same two production companies) and how good the two movies are, and how good it is, the cheaper film should be like a stereotype! Interestingly, there is something weird (I must be among them) who enjoy watching movies because they are often bad and so terrible that they make fun. This one, however, is not bad or convoluted in that message and some films are not as diverse as similar films. Although the message for the 1933 film was more clear and effective, it was also quite good despite sometimes poor acting and ridiculously suicidal scenes. Remember the kids - say 'no' for suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, however, they talked about the "two-year treatment" film in 1932, in fact it was Syphilis's ideal. Nowadays, it is far more cure - as the rest of STD.
