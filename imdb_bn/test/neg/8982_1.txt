There was nothing like this movie book. <br /> <br /> Everything got mixed up. The film was mostly in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never be seen. It was frustrating for me when I enjoyed the book, and then to see how the film trashed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie to anyone who is a Noble Roberts fan. JD Rob <br /> <br /> This movie is not really valuable to see how far the book is from this book.
