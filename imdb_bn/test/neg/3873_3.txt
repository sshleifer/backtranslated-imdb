The original title always puts more than I instead of gun-tapping wrist-trump clips. Still; To support Yule Brenner, their screen appearance was covered by at least one top quality actor group. Most movie stars were in their own right. <br /> <br /> However; This was a pale imitation of the first seagull, a group that now consists of players in the B and C list, who were far more moderate than the superb. It was a similar setup. Brenner's 'Chris' had to recruit another group of gun-throwing clay to solve the problems of Mexican farmers. Another persecutor was sad to them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The budget was definitely very limited. This is not just a Cast reflection, even in the lower-level script, which borrowed much from the previous classic. It is less than half an hour of John Starges' original. Yet we still had a lot of anger and morality that sometimes made the first little harmful. However, there was no modest acting, action or position to work on adjusting things here. The filming was less broad. It is a large part of the mainland which failed to reveal the wide range of landscapes. <br /> <br /> Generally; It just lacks imagination. The first film was threatened and it was possible to quickly and cheaply combine in this pedestrian, Sikouil so that cash can be made for the former success. And it shows. It seems too much about 'it' to make it for TV. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
