This film was included in the six WEEKs of Henry VIII BBC MINISTAR DVD. I liked those six movies They played well, well scripted, and were historically correct. I actually read the book of Gregory and it is very good despite the historical error, (I think that George Boleyn is full fake gay angle), but this film did not even mention it. That angle was one of the main points of the book. <br /> <br /> All these pictures just ask me "Why?" Why do we see, someone else correctly said, "the real world: world english"? Why is the camera so common in the bad angle? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was impressive, but come! The actors were wasted time and jumped on their lines and it is clear they are going to go with them. <br /> <br /> Why is sex scene so painful? The way they worked in the book made at least a little more interesting. They are very bad in the film, they are very laughing At one stage, Mary Bolin's acting actress Henry VIII is playing the role. He looked at his face and looked at his face and said, "Hmm ... I have to go to the store, did he still have it? Maybe he can take some cheese soon after he is finished ..." <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> Why is Catherine of Eragon playing such a small role in this movie? Because of his refusal of divorce, he was one of the main reasons for threatening Christianland. That's because Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn can not get married immediately. Why does not he attend here? All, this movie is just bad.
