This image is enjoyable if you like poverty line, like public domain films in the first half of the 20th century, or support for making amateur movies. This film combines public domain thrillers together with new shot scenes, in which stock footage is attempted to communicate with "actor" (the only exception of the dead dead near Logosi Rip, all "actors" only awesome!). The "new" footage is enclosed with scratches of digitally added films, such as the oldest footage (?? !!) As far as possible, I understand that there is something to do with a bunch of strangers gathered in the island to read the plot (?) This film is a technical and creative remnant of 'Dead Man Do Wear Play', while boasting in the creative premises. In a ship, a long sequence and wounded sailor, describes the life-long journey to a terrific 'Fog Island', whatever it is! "Flashbacks" combine with the old footage of the different era and with absolutely different quality. Relations relating to The Lost World (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Belle Lugosei Meets at Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other Poverty Row Productions. It is done on an incredibly bad voice which seems to be a lot of room reflections so that the audio is recorded in a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> "Filmmakers" think that they are respecting the characters, by giving them the nicknames of famous actors (Caradine, Zuko, Ospenska, etc. etc.) to the great actors of the past. This technique has been done cleverly, as well as the 'final destination', it is simply unreasonable! Wicked, and painfully funny, Spiderman, Dracula, and Jokes about Superman. Even the old dirty 'Devi, Chitam and Hawo' lawyer's reference is used here - in the 1930s it was old and tired when using the Three Stoggate. <br /> <br /> The film used to match the scene with audio and audio, not scenes, and different sources are used for dozens of Lugosi. The last effect seems to be that it is old, short, old, thin, heavy, small and old, minute minutes later. Curiously, this image was not used as a comedy subplot and maintained good opportunities for the comedy. <br /> <br /> Although speaking the truth, it was very fun to see the delay in bed at night. Perhaps they wanted to happen!
