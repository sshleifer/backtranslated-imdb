It seems that this movie was a beautiful idea for the movie, thinking about two or three interesting possibilities, rented a good cast, then turned the whole thing into a really bad screenplay and a bad director. Director is a sculpted romantic comedy as it shows a dark, artistic film --- weird camera angle, blue filter shots, lingering, raindrops close-up. Steve Jhan was always good. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; She was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock played boldly in character, which was supposed to be characterized, but in his helplessness kisses her husband with madness, leaving her child, going to the carnival's road, offered to cross the road and started a journey with a journey. Fellow airline passengers. The script was very funny line; There was no physical comedy; It was boring. It introduced the potentially funny situation, then cut them before they could develop. To top it off, at the end "packing" was a slap in the face of someone hoping for a fun romantic comedy. If you have seen and loved the movie trailer, just as I did, my advice is: do not go to the movie. It will only spoil a nice trailer.
