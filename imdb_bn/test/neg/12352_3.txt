The rabbit fever is one of those weird films. It's 90 minutes enjoyable, the audience demands a little bit, and distributes many more, and even in a local television channel, even at an early time slot, I think that rabbit fever would be rather good. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed towards the movie <br /> <br /> This film is depicted in a television documentary style and introduced our 6 women, who have an affair with Rebeit Vibrator. This movie focuses primarily on the investigation of the supposed addictive quality of the famous sexual aid product. The story is 100% tongue on the whole. <br /> <br /> The story is strong, some good round and the role of the desired characters, some enjoyable back-stories, peripheral letters and situations develop into a compelling story and delightful decision. Sadly there is nothing new or cute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother But in some scenes it has its laziness that keeps it, you are ready for it, when you want it to be unhappy and whatever you find is a doll of sit-com. Glittery, I feel sympathetic to the theater characters, but I thought I was bitter that someone made 90-minute rel TV, for light entertainment and tried to enter the national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think rabbit fever has gained a bit, it's a playful story, a round story, a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in it that supports the theatricality of the movie theater. On the contrary - several commercial breaks allow the viewer to have a living opportunity that lacks the rabbit fever.
