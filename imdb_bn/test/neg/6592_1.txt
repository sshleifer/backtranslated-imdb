You might be suspicious that this film is written in the process of filming the plot. It started as a "Punks vs. Vigilant" film, but in the middle of the film, the plot suddenly changed when Vigilant became a honest man with his honest daughter and his honest Jim and the corrupt "businessman" had to fight. Want to start a bowl or any cost to build down Jim? Then, the plot changed again, and we forgot the corrupt guys. Villain is now a leading man, who thinks he is a ninja. People become "crazy evil" and want to spend any money to win a martial arts competition. Seeing this movie, nightmares are happening with television.
