Now I've seen two movies of director Chen Kyz, one of the best (I'm farewell to my mistress), and this bad guy, The Assin. Both films are important events of Chinese history, the first integration of the entire Chinese nation into 20 century FMC and TA third century BC. FMC succades with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, firm set, good acting and an interesting story. The killer fails at almost every stage (okay, great set, cinematography is good, and few war scenes are quite exciting). But ... call me a cynic, but too much. If you think Saving Private Ryan was very sad, be aware, it will make you sick here. The dialogue is rife, many lines seem like political statements, these pictures are not delicate or entertaining. The film disappeared by its own fault. I am really surprised that Assassin imdb gets such high votes here. 4/10
