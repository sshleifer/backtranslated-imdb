Before watching this movie (at the screening of the director himself) we won the Galway Film Floyd Short Film Award. Certainly the filmmakers will expect these results, someone can do something better than this! <br /> <br /> I do not know about anyone who does not see the Rip-Off flagged by Danny Darko. Film pure drill, acting cardboard, dialogue ridiculous and the last flat! After watching this trunk we just laughed the laugh of comfort and said, how terrible it was in front of this movie! Yes that was the meaning, but the freedom fighter! <br /> <br /> At least one of the following Irish movies can not sink!
