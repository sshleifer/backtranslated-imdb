If you like me, you try to find annoying and strange (and often terrible) to offer the worldwide movie, but in the early 80's you should not show much more than Hong Kong's supernatural horror output. Often, Kung Fu and stupid comedies are packed with black magic, and usually packed with a lot of fuzzy crowley (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes etc), these films are intrigued like this. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a point in Sukubar: a mountain tribe, whose women prevent their man from being nasty to them (which they can leave because they are filled with their living creatures and hungry Death can die). So many martial arts, and deadly lives of real life (which is mostly influenced by Gaikes, whose story does not carry absolutely anything), this picture is simply weird. <br /> <br /> The victims of the tribes for snakes and insects, which are quite attractive, unexpectedly throwing animals in their backbone; A tribal feast that hangs a cow's meat on the head and then separates it is totally hateful; And the moments that are being flown in open wounds and rising worms, they will lose their hunger for some time. <br /> <br /> However, it is the fungus of living organisms that really makes Suuqab eligible for legendary out-of-the-box fans. This is often frequent and curiosity: the gai√ßa kisses on the snake, enjoys a fat, juicy tad (weird!), And hungry mouse ate (pointing his head and then cooling the rest). <Br> <br /> A great movie (Hell, it's not actually a middle movie), Sukubar is recommended only to those who think they saw it. It gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than that, but I'm grateful to it for being able to feel a little sick.
