I was looking at ATTACK at Precinct 13. There, the film is memorable. Who is this star? Ethan Huq or Matt Dillon (I can not tell the actor, this is a big point against the film.) Gabriel Bayern (who could not make this money poorly)? Dera De Mateo is stunning but only because of his amazing body. Finally he took me to the "friends" Joey's sister working out to age. I agree that the attack on the station is so appreciated that the people of the SWAT, go as far as strategy. We have taught better basic skills than RAF Basic Training. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, even the snow does not want to go to the full bus of the prisoners! Very bad continuity <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plug!
