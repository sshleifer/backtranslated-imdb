I point out that I should be fair and I do not believe in ghosts. That said, I am very interested in this subject and I enjoy as the next guy as a scary story. I try to give Ghost Hunters a fan because they at least give them a scientific conection. Even the first episode of most former guests was the Camp Entertainment Factor for them. Unusual state does not have these qualities. In this case, there is the possibility of appealing to themselves, but with so many "reality TVs" these days, it is damaged by excessive reproduction, poor performance and harmless scripts. The creator of the ceremony freely admits that the author manages stories. I have heard that they are going to shoehorn a romance for appeal to the population of even young women. The show also has many other errors. Others say, the description quickly becomes like a nail under the chalkboard. On top of visual and audio effects become fast as boring. I am willing to postpone some mistrust for entertaining, but this whole "monster with a vendetta" story is just ridiculous to stress. Producers of this show are also responsible for MTV's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor's brain dead body, I think it's really no surprise. If you are a mortal hard fan of Ed and Lorraine Warren or see a big "reality" show, guess that you can get many things like Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend you avoid.
