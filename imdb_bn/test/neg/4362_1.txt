Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 both stunk, but the first was good. This movie special effects were not all in particular. Even though the killers were better in the assassination, they did not have anything to boast about. Part 2 was one of the things that bad thing was bad. They suddenly changed the emotions, and some of their lines were just stupid. For example, quoting a character, "You have good R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you find me meaning." Once I heard that line I figured it was the worst I've heard. Another thing I hate about this movie was that it was too small. The successful film will go for more than an hour and twenty minutes, such as the Killjoy 2. If the full moon creates part of Killjoy 3, then it can probably move to the lowest level. Overall, 1 in 10. <br /> <br />
