I'm from Romania ... and if my English is not so good for that, I apologize. <br /> <br /> I've finished watching this movie and obviously I'm very disappointed. I always like Wesley Snip's movie but it's a terrible one. I'm sorry I spent 3 hours to download this image. There are so many mistakes in the film. For example, the film stadium lia is not standard. The name of the stadium is Gennesa. The name of football team is called Stuya Bucuresti, not wooly. The stadium's scoreboard is not able to display graphical images: video transcript, live images, etc. This is a simple scoreboard which can only display letters and numbers. Dip as Wolf (South) opponent's day (probably from Dima Bucure≈üti - the main competitor of the Romanian football championship, the main competitor) is shown on the scoreboard. Images from the football match are Stauya Bucharesti and Polly Timisoara (from my favorite team and one match between my only love) - see it on the Internet and see why you can see it). Police cars are not properly created in the movie. There is a dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The "wrong list" can be turned on and on ... but I will stop here! This movie is terrible on short terms. It is not worth renting, it does not have the cost of buying a movie ticket, it is not worth downloading! I feel sorry that Wesley snipes acting in this film. A previous movie ... 7 seconds ... taking photos in Romania ... It was okay, but it's terrible!
