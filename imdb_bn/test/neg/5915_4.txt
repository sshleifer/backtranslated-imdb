Produced at a stage in his career, where he had the desire to do what he wanted, Eddie Murphy took the responsibility to create, direct, co-author and act as Harlem Knights, it was a costly but ultimately just about gangster Saga. In the 1930s, the owner of a nightclub owner / gangster managed a rights group, under which an advertisement hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adopted father (Richard Priory) and white gangsters are attacking them. That is, thinks, they correctly think of their color, by their attributes. This is probably a concept that was probably great on paper, but it certainly has lost some of the translations. This was a terrible piece for the ad, and I think that trying to be the whole show here has spread itself very thin. Happy to see Marie and Priory together on the screen, but Arsene Hall, Redd Fox, Della Reyes, Michael Lerner, Danny Eelaw, Jassine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and other great supporters were happy with Cast. Eddie's brother, really paid a little bit of valuable (though I would confess Murphy's war scene with Deli Ridge, violently funny and probably the best view of the movie). Murphy has definitely poured a lot of money into this movie and it shows a good display on screen. The industry and set direction won an impressive and exciting costume Oscar, but it was a great missed endeavor for Adei because he certainly tried to wear most of the hats.
