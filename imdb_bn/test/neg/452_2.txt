Rose ?? What will happen in this episode? It represents our two leads, a slim impressive donkey and a completely non-attractive partner. There is no plot to speak, child humor, mixed with some very bad pensing and accessory music. What else to say, really? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little improvement, that we see our first outdoor-place scenario. Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humor, paper thin argument, very bad pacing, and tired SF clich√©s. <br /> <br /> dead dead ?? The best part of the date of how to create a episode, writing interesting character dialogues and showing what might happen while integrating a playful plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Penelope Wilton brought in a little gravity in his best endeavor, effectiveness in a tough situation. Some poorly written, and swap opera elements in the outside places come in front of these two episodes and come back to the desperate humor / ridicule of bad pacing, bad platings and cringes. <br /> <br /> Dalake ?? Not great, but still RTD is far from the rental date. Panning and scripts are all subtle (although doctors and roses are still annoying). Dellak's effects and dangers have started well. In the end, an interesting mountaineering took place that fiercely touches the most infamous enemy of the doctor, making a deadly world, and leaning previously invisible shocking decay to blue rubber squid, which shows the child as a toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - The first RTD script to show a plot, even if it is in 80 second style. Yet, it was fierce by reliance on little adolescents, in the future, in the logical sense, and keeping it too far for poor pacing. Not as bad as its previous effort, but soon forgotten. <br /> <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial premises may be vaguely striking, but common sense and reasoning leaves the episode from the very beginning. Also, we are treating a complete episode of soap operas. Remember, all about characterization before you start thinking, there is a big difference between Lam Soap opera and Characters. Plus, it proves that RTD is not the worst script writer so far. <br /> <br /> Empty child / doctor dance - it started in a moderate way, with some crunching moments, and some unreasonable mistakes even a primary school student will not be able to make it (black windows better, anyone?). After that, the first part takes a more interesting and sinful turn. Florence Hoath really stole this episode, showing us what has been like an interesting companion He could work Instead we get ridiculous and politically correct Captain Jack as a new companion. Conclusion was a little brawl, but was enough. Panning and scripts have improved with a good story, these two episodes are quite atmospheric and playful. <br /> <br /> - I have to be honest without a few examples, I was so stupid in the current series that after leaving the trailer of another 'Saltin' episode I left it. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no subtlety. Like the Running Man or the Truman Show, can we get any interesting social commentary? Not certainly not. It's an RTD episode, so they're basically trying here miserably and listening to the pull in the audience. Again, the logic window goes out, we keep 200,000-a-year in the future. RTD tries silently towards the shoe-horns of some 'over-arsing' stories, there is no relevance except its own existence, and when villains are finally published ... they threaten only and the doctor's greens are more like once. Fool for the perfect! Most often it has one or two interesting moments at a faster pace compared to other RTD efforts. Otherwise, other unpredictable installments. <br /> <br /> division - big end A damp squid more, literally. All the destruction of the collapse of the Dalake is gradually brought gradually gradually. So many plot holes in this episode, usually with poor contrivances. Daleks people want to harvest crops as daleks, but then vaporize the entire continent? Blake can dissolve the continents, but do not destroy the space in the space? Tararis are now united and can give land even to the people so that they can protect it? This power can not be easily used to destroy the Dalek 'deity'? Daleks can vaporize the entire continent, but do not sneak up the satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead play near him? After the attempts and extermination of Dalek, his full-fledged Dakshit coward, without the firm witness of his activities? Apart from these and many other holes, we never thought that the former instrument solution has ever been imaginative, has been linked to each other with the continuous stress press. <br /> <br /> So what we can say about the new series, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the episodes were shown as non-original and something other than forgotten, if they were anything other than doctor and RTD Was the name attached? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Some people think that we can not say anything against RTD, because we owe them to bring doctors back to our screens. However, at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I would rather not have a badly designed, ill-conceived product, submerged at that price. I do not want to wait until someone can wait and make a real effort. In most cases, it is such a weevil garbage that gives a bad name to the SF, otherwise it is the most creative style.
