I saw this movie coming in and could not wait to see it. I would say it was very frustrating with it. It has been as good as a small series. The whole show runs very fast. They do not explain the very clear things. Finally, they see John Paul alive and alive, and the next scene he died. No explanation as to what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC has left some big time that could be something great. All I had was a blur in this movie. It seemed as if the drunken monkey was at risk from John Paul's life from one side to another, and no event explains how and why it happened. As his older brother leaves, he never explained that his brother was a doctor and so he left home. When his father died, we saw his father lying on the floor and that was the case. I was very disappointed on all the movies.
