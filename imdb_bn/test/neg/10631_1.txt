After tolerating this movie last night, I closed the DVD player with a Medal capability to get Stamina to see the end. Throughout the film I felt that you are seeing story fillers which you will find in high budget porn movies. Acting rude and pony, camera work was uncomfortable, and location and set felt like lending them to the local high school "Amateur Dramatic Society". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
