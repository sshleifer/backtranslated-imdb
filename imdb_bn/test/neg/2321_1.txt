Abbott and Castello acted in perfect film. Even our young children will become increasingly annoyed in the whole world of this movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Waps. What was his appearance was a look. Sure, he had to be part of this horror film. <br /> <br /> Do anyone think that Costello's mother looked at him in the film and looked like Fei Beater? Thankfully, for Mrs. Beater, she was not in the film. <br /> <br /> There really is no excitement for the children. The joke, if any, is quite old. Some of the singers are nicely done but the songs are ridiculous.
