I saw TCM tonight and was surprised to see Sin acting on Arthur. His wonders became surprising and usually did not have the same style as usual for diirichs and art lunds. Dietrich was awestruck during his restraint and tranquility. She is having the best things in this movie. Wild gags were flat and in most cases a newer person in the college tried to write "go away" from being worse, malicious and dirty, but not only annoying and funny. It seems that making humor is becoming very difficult. The end was completely concreved. Spirir Ayyad: For a moment, I never believe that Art Lund suddenly fell in love with w / dietrich and then suddenly the love was crazy in / w / Arthur. Oh, Billy. Get real! 10 out of 3
