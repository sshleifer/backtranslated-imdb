My friends and I have just finished watching this preview of this new Australian film. Everyone in the film agreed, what was this picture? There was no better story to follow, the letters were to be adopted, and the plot seemed unmotivated. I think it is weird that this film, probably cost millions millions, funding and making. It does not work for the theater community for any purpose, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian movies. It's really a waste of time that this drone works ruthlessly, and more time-shopping scripts should be spent and better stories should not be made, messy like this. Hugo Knitting and Rose Byon were ok but hampered by a bad script severely. Pia Miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot and its lines were the lowest. Genius is a true waste. Savoy Karuna was Geoffrey Simpson ACS 'cinematography, which was fantastic as most of the Ascii film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
