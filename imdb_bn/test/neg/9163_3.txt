I was almost surprised to see this movie, then how did it look like at first glance ... yet another Hollywood cgi / live-action rehearsal of a live cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable. All possible designs have been designed to appeal to very young people and very objectionable adults, who use comic devices such as distance, rehearsal and theodore's butt-shapes. <br /> <br /> This picture will disturb me if it's not such a clear step for Chipmunks much less. Even I found their character changed for bad for this movie. In the past, when each of them had a very different personality, they used to deal with all the weird, smart-eyed children ADD, continuously blocking the walls. It specifically bothers me to see Simon pictured in this way ... He is a smart, serious person who acts as "straight man" of Alvin's crazy antrix. But here he is mostly a carbon copy of Alvin. A joke in the film also means that Simon only * thinks that he is smart but not true ... and if I do not see this picture, then I would not have heard of Chipmux, but I would agree. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just another obvious cash-grabbing, and I'm even more than sorry. This is not a "kids" film excuse its flaws ... to frustrate a stupid movie that reduces the classic franchisee, because it is insulting to children, and a child is more capable of something more intelligent than this movie.
