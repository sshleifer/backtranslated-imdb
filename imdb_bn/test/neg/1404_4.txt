It was a character's movie. It was when the plot was not hot, but the characters were interesting and very good work. In the context of the big boy's suicide, the story centers on the Truss family. I said that, very rarely, because this story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father used to focus on the story, then they did it very badly. Acting in all parts was very good, especially Emil Hirish survived, as a misguided boy. All of the characters were very interesting and I just did not feel like watching them until the photo delayed, while it just seemed to pull. <br /> <br /> My big accusation was the story. The boy was killed as himself the center of the plot. However, it was not really. Something happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything was going on. Then he mentions that the boy reminded himself that it was central thread, The other is that big plot twists, which were plenty, are not really explained or created, but there are randomly and often thrown from the left field. Justify, the end was very very quiet. But it was also clear from the inspiration of the story: Half of the half (which was not padding) was much more than the story of Pearl Jam's song. Which reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie that was supposed to kill someone myself. I was not the only person that the poem has been spoken, the word for the word, from the same song. I do not know, it was a movie that I hope, and they really really dropped the ball.
