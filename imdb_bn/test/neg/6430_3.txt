Above all, this movie has become so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize, because I did not understand myself this terrible story. In addition, unknown cast managed by actress Laur Maenel, only awful. Whimsical and ridiculous about Sabby Tobias's expression and screaming, confusing gimmicks on acting. Ultimately but not least, IMDB has a lot of good reviews about this flicker as follows: <br /> <br /> - Note that the managers can not wait to see more work ?? On September 24, 2004, the author reviewed the IMDB only; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, surprisingly intense? On August 12, 2004, the author has reviewed only one IMDB; <br /> <br /> - Your ideal blood and gore, is not really good. 7/10 ?? On February 13, 2005, the author reviews the IMDB's only review; <br /> <br /> - Asian is as intense as intense! The author only reviewed the IMDB on 14 November 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they employed by parents, relatives, friends or by the production for this bad publicity? My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 ?? a Nova Profescia" ("11.11 ?? New Prophecy")
