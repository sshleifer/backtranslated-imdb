I was young when I saw it. Probably I did not grow up with Grease and Elvis's film. <br /> <br /> I failed to get it. I get the "black" comedy (black buddy etc). I get taunts and spoofs. Although I do not get this one <br /> <br /> I did a search to find out the name of this movie (for the help of Usenet and the best IMDB message board) so that it could be my first 1 pointer. Awful, terrifying!
