This film looked like running for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So incredible. Scenes where the President (Half Brook) was the center of the city and the man was walking in between a French. In the real life, the common democratic president has the chance to be in 30 yards. If it was not for blood and superstition, it was shot like a TV movie. It may be decent if it has been done differently. This movie of Holbrook (President) genius has never been realized. Shatner's acting is okay. The production values ​​of this movie will leave much to be desired. Overall, I think most people would be better off not to waste time looking at this matter.
