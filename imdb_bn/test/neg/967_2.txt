All the motives and intentions were the shooting of the worst movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Due to the cartoon, it is credible and you want to watch the movie. I recently misread 48 hours before watching the showtimes and the Beverly Hills quote and it was strange for some reason Eddie Murphy was still funny. Ok he's not Actually he feels like he has almost neutered. I watched this movie, I was surprised that DÃ©rono decided that it was also good enough script to give her name. Whatever Chemistry and Murphy are among them. Dreadful writing, awesome joke, the movie you think is good can not be worse than that. I did not take much time after sitting under the showtime and I watched Martin Lawrence acting national security. The movie was its fun part but that was not great. But it's still 20 times more than the showtime. Please do not see this movie in a Deniro fan of you !!
