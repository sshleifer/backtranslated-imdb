WARNING: I do not recommend anyone reading this comment because I have not seen this movie yet. <br /> <br /> Do not do it if you plan to watch this movie! I warn you ... this movie is notoriously annoying and is not really scary, not as scary movie. I made this Piranah film a mistake for another Pirenah film and when I noticed that I made a mistake, I still decided to watch it. I did not want to. This movie is so awful and intolerant that every element that I could not tell anyone was half of the movie was decent. For one, this movie should be called an annoying conversation about warmth rather than Piranhara. They only see Piranhas! At the same time, this movie sounds so bad, I only slept in this thing for 20 minutes. Finally my mouth was open wide open and I saw gloomily on the blank TV screen. It's a very bad direction guided and badly damaged junk which I was afraid to see, I feel the brain's problem ...
