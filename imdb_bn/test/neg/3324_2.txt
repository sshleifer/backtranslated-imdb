When I found out that Anne Rice gave up the project, the movie would disappoint me. I could not predict that even after a few years of liberation war, still thinking of me about the movie made me angry. The novels are amazing, and when I realize that the translation is too much lost in the translation, this movie was a big middle finger for its original work. I hope one day someone will try again, on the right track, Vampire Lestat will start. They change the role and role of the main and minor characters for any good reason. They destroy the history of Lestat. The queen acting comedy is exaggerated, but I just could not bring myself to laugh. There is not only the charm and charm of the novel. The film is a bad excuse to touch as many musical and "dark" images as possible in a movie, hopefully the American tin docks will be placed on it. The appeal of Lewis's first film appeal is that he is caught in his humanity and curse. It is supposed to take the lash and show the world's magic and excitement of the vampire. Best wishes I read in the first book, or I did not touch them after this movie.
