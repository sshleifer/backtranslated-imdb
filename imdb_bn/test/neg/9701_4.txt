I enjoyed the book and started to like it and e-miniini. I hope to love this picture, and I agreed to explain the real story and briefly permit its middle degree artist's license. However, this film is probably very similar to the original book. If only "names change for the protection of innocent people", then perhaps I could have enjoyed the film, if wrong, it is a piece of time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr Darcy" is not a psychological and weak character, and the name "Elizabeth Bennet" is a helpless, snappy, often lively-eyed man, who does not care for the rules of society and "Mr. Binley ", which is completely destroyed, the idea that director Zen Zen has read the original story of Austen. <br /> <br /> There are some real star moments in this movie - probably 10 minutes really nice. Charlotte explains why he is Mr. Collins's offer accepted it well. He is 27 years old (near the time of despair-near Spinster age), he is becoming a burden on his family, and he is not romantic. She only wants "a comfortable home." However, when he blubbers when beautiful dialogue is destroyed, "You do not judge me, Elizabeth. You dare not judge me!" And runs off tears. Later, you see Charlotte Kouto in Lady Catherine de Burga, which was not in her character according to the book's description. <br /> <br /> Another good moment is when Darcy leads Elizabeth to her home, she is traveling to the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in E & E series, but the version of Keira Knightley's movie version makes viewers so humiliating that how abusive it was for Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, I really appreciate the scene, because instead of knowing what happened to it I would like to see a happy ending. At the same time, this film has dropped the integral part of Aston's Pride and the Prejudice. Character Osten Conversation Verb Synonyms and talk of a jarring combination of modern phrases and colloquialisms. The original work only specifies or suggests the information described in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's just a small movie, Yada Yada. But a complex, beautiful book is ridiculous turning into a superficial love story. Someone commented that when they saw Elise Elizabeth, they loved that moment because it is probably "love at first sight". First love to show? is not it? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not considered to be a classic beauty, and Darcy comes to love her for her wit and vigor ... she literally "loves her for her mind." There was a moment of this version (during Darcy's first offer) when two people were shouting at each other intensely, nearby ... and almost kissed ... but they suddenly took a step aside. Esse! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and hate with each other, but are so attracted that it does not matter (at this time) they do not like each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The description of this book depicts the characteristic characteristics of the character that was actually a different story. Mr. Bennett was hungry, Elizabeth usually used to have her younger sister Charlotte as mentally, somewhat intelligent and frustrating for her own house, stupid - a cute, little planning woman, who is portrayed with a lot of general knowledge. Jane and Elizabeth's relation, rather than deeply convinced love and praise for each other, only topical. <br /> <br /> I could only take this as a poor explanation of the novel, but I refused to accept many, many historical mistakes as well. Miss Bingley rarely wore around (her clothes looked like what others wear as tight undergarments). Elizabeth went to Neanderfield down her hair and was allowed to fly all over. The family is neglected around one morning, although it is called (or called in your own home) to the relatives on the evening of the morning. Elizabeth left her barefoot in NightGown. And a really scary scene, Bingley Jane was ill and conversed with her (and sounded like stupid) when she was ill. <br /> <br /> Most people think that these are minor points, but I just wanted it a) Historically correct film or B.) The correct presentation of the characters in the novel <br /> <br /> In the first vision, the director / writer / person who gives a good story for the triangle story of honesty, neutrality and love. I can admit that those who do not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conference, can easily choose this movie and there is no mistake in it. I could not beyond my desire to see a film more involved than just two beautiful faces.
