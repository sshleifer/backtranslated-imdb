Altman's quintet should only be considered faulty: as many other critics have mentioned, ideas behind the film, even some choices to illustrate these ideas - have to be worked out - and rarely have to work in these difficult movies. Partly fog camera lens - I commented on my wife that it was the most confusing director I ever saw to be proud - I was never allowed to enter the film world. <br /> <br /> There are serious problems with the usual MAYA-EN-VIEW employed here. It is clear that at least no thought has become due to clothing and manufacturing design, but it is not effective in the development of a credible world. Perhaps it's a matter of scale; The film is so steep that I once said that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the movie budget. Here, and there, Matt Paintings may have helped.) I have seen the most frustrating Altman movie ever. Great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through the industry - it's just part of the game.
