Shiny marketers he, Jess Franco Naturally Mario Bava's ultimate sensational "danger: Diabolik!" Like Cyclalic spy movies cashed in huge successes. Franco was the ideal person to shoot a similar film, because he could freely enter it slowly and slowly, as well as the strange plot twists he would like to have. And he partly understood this very well, as a man from "The Girl to Rio" moves around a hateful organization, it is driven by an elegant wearing jealousy, which plots make all the people into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them, at least), a horrific crime run by George Sanders, a misguided crime syndicate conflict with daily business. All right components are presented well, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unhappy adventure movie. Imagination is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, the action is quite a joke. The film is very colorful ... but not very bright and there was a total lack of frustrating sex in particular. There is a bit of nudity, sure, but according to the standard Franco standards are very low. All the letters are sick of the head, so at least I expected (or expected) more distorted or a frenzied theme. Frank was probably a big budget to work naturally, and I must say that he spent more money on the more reliable set pieces and gifted cast members. Especially an experienced actor George Sanders ("The Dead", "Psychomania") is one of the best players to produce Franco. Very bad she can not even save "daughter from Rio" from being a huge fall. A legendary Euro-Smot filmmaker like Jess Franco could have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
