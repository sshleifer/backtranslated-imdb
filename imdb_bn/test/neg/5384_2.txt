From an artistic perspective, movies fail to deliver entertainment or any moral resolution. The plot is hard to follow, if there is one. Acting stomach is tough. The conversation is clearly and clearly written by some who do not know English. Only cinematography was eligible to watch in this movie, although you still see errors in the picture. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the film provoked me because it proved to be how narrow the people might be. Politically speaking, Asian women should be banned in such disrespectful role. Asian prostitution stereotypes are not only for the self-esteem of Asian women but also for the whole country. I think the real actress playing Maya, and she must face the exploitation to play such a role. <br /> <br /> Please, as an American, avoid this movie. The industry should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other, do not keep it back.
