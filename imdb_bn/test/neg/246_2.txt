The footage of 2/3 previous films in this movie has been recycled, an incident that does not look sad to anyone like me, even the original movies. And since I have never seen stuff before, whatever it seems like a rip off. This is like the episode of every TV show where the characters sit near a photo album or something and you only see recycled footage of other episodes. I've seen some producers do not have extended footage extended montages, but do not do anything after 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly seen by viewers who are already seen by the movie, so you can mount a lawsuit that it foisted the greatest Rip off of public film ever. <br /> <br /> I found 16mm prints theater, which is good enough, I think how such a movie can be rare in movies on this day. I give some credits to the film for the semi-confident Gothic environment and illogical humor, but this is about it. Aztec Mummy looks good in the giant, even some dynamics in her face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. But robots are unfortunate, although it is interesting that they make people's face completely visible. This is a "robot man" or something like this that explains something in the movie. I think that an Android is considered. So in this technically hard-fi-fi terms this film should be called "Android v Aztek Mummy", but I was very worried about the techies rather than being worried about any quality. Actually the film is kept together so well that it plays the television better. Even dabbing in Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example at one point the protagonist says, "I can start at the beginning ...." What is the translation? Is it not the word to repeat so that they could at least say "start at the beginning"? A high school newspaper editor can revise the screenplay of this movie. This is the title of a professional film producer, there is absolutely nothing in this film that will not be there for the basic commercial purpose of the movie. They did not make any effort to make it more than that and considering the extensive recycled footage, I doubt that they actually spend more than a week to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I will stop posting about it now, the method that I do not want to spend more energy in commenting than the filmmakers has actually been spent creating it.
