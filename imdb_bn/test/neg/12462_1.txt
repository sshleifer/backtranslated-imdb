As a rule, I try to find as much as I can in film as I can possibly enjoy them. I did not make any exception to "Tart", for this I have tried my best to appreciate it. But no effort, no matter how great, perhaps it can freeze the cruel excuse for the movie. <br /> <br /> This failed for many reasons. First, cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script has reached the 'poor' depth, which has taken it out of the good and real 'very bad it is good' division. Thirdly, the actress wanted to spend psychologically - it was scary, it was really. Anyone who has seen Miza Barton (here is notable as the terrible Grace, has discovered a character so weakly and realizes that Joe Janks is not so bad), Devon of John Dugin's "Lon Dogs" will be surprised to think that now and now What's wrong with Probably, he was given a character with a boring, and directional direction, at least he gave the feature of releasing this movie. Hey, this was not the case. Finally, the film is not a point, it does not reveal anything, it does not achieve anything. Actually, why I bothered Christina Owen? <br /> <br /> "Tart" failed a poor effort. The result - a film, sadly, so bad that it is very very bad. Do not disturb - it's not really worth it.
