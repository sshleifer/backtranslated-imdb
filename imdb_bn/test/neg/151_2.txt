This movie is not just for me. I like scary and splatter movies but this one has very little with awesome. The effect is cheap and when they cut one of their feet it looks so fake. The same tongue goes for other effects like torture and intestinal penis. They could have spent a few extra money on the impact. <br /> <br /> With lots of sex (with all the Japanese film-like pixelization) it's just a sickness idol and it looks like a market for sick stuff like this. Although bloody, it fits with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and Genki series for me. These movies eat girls and play with every fluid coming from your body, eating plenty of bugs and fish and like strange creatures, fur, eels and sex with sex ... ... at a glance, the fearsome fans will look elsewhere. There is no horror here, only sick and violent sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Horn fans should avoid it and guinea pig 2: flash of blood or blood or even underneath undressed mummy should be examined. Although they are not great, at least they provide a great experience and Niku Darma fails in that section completely.
