I usually like Cyan Gold's work, but this film was completely obstructed. But sadly, it does not retarded enough to make an amicable change. I was just sitting, I got up, I thought I would end. The plot only makes a whisper of knowledge. I think it was intended to be a campy. I mean, ghost hair extensions - how can it be? But the humor, as it was, was flat. Not funny Not terrible Not poor I would say maybe gold was the tenant of this project, but it seems to have written this annoying trash too. I still have to fill a few more lines, what else have to say? I'm not saying saying: next best wishes, Sono-san.
