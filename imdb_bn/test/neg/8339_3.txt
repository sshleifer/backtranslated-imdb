When I saw this movie, I could remember: What a disaster! No I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I've seen many movies, but it's certainly the worst one. I am not concerned about this issue if an volcanic eruption is possible under Downtown LA. Probably not it, but it could be a better movie ... but not sure why I'll explain you. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much lava flows out of an average volcano, but what I know is that the velocity of this film Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo are showing a small barbecue together. I do not think this film has ever been looted so much as flowing out of a volcano as we see it. I'm sure the director had a lot of money in order to spend the movie's cinema, but I was really surprised why he used to spend it on special effects, not on script and actors. I'm not saying that he should have been throwing a top, but it's really good to play the opposite. Their performance is so incredibly poor that it makes the whole movie worse. <br /> <br /> And maybe you can ask yourself what is wrong with the script. Well, can you tell me that there are a few pounds hidden in the bathroom, or even a few feet, standing up a few feet from the lava without being confiscated? Or when people on earth are drowning lava flow is not even two feet high? <br /> <br /> I am sure that I would not be proud to write such script, but obviously there are Hollywood script writers who do not remember the credibility until it makes good money! Very good money !!! <br /> <br /> When you watch movies, you'll probably agree with me that this is one of Hollywood's worst disaster films, which is not more than 3/10
