I have great respect for the work of Mr. Argentina, but there are not many such qualities in this movie, which makes her films really unique. The opening of the movie is great, and sets you for the possibilities of a horrible horror movie. There is a lack of structure or purpose for the rest of the film and many are not built in it. There are some good performances, though, and many great atmospheres. The end of the movie is weak considering this build up. Where there should be some grand climax in the vast proportion, you get a very simple conclusion that instead of using many other bad films, it just seems like it needs to be wrapped. Some scenes in the scene are very memorable for their painting, but in the end the film does not really jail to make good films. Everything until you make this director you must of course see I suggest to pass this one ...
