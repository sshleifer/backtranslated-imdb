A superb insight into the waters of the Deep Sea of ​​32 Degree only a few people had the opportunity to see first hand. <br /> <br /> When the wave is looking at the audience at first, the filmmaker fully utilizes the IMX format. A jellyfish filled the entire theater, a shark power to us, jumped from behind the hunter's stone and consolidated their prey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This picture is described by Hollywood star Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sounds spoil the joy of so ridiculating positive visuals. The deputy seems somewhat annoyed when Winslet says that he is reading the story lying to the villagers. I was frustrated that his actress could forget her wrong performance so much. The script is fairly stupid and has very little depth. Soundtrack is full of strange, unreasonable sound effects, which I think is fun to guess, but actually draws attention from the material that should be spoken for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has given a nice score, which gives rise to life under the ocean and has a great influence on life, when it allows to play outside the stupid bubbles or crayfish footsteps of chillies. <br /> <br /> The picture is a technical phenomenon, but its children's script, the annoying description and the effect of the wrong words can not be taken seriously.
