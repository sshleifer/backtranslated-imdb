I am just writing this review because I was a huge fan of the book, Prajak Nation, and I was afraid of this movie. <br /> <br /> I think if you do not read the book, you lose losing the film, as it provides no real back story of Wurtzel's depression. His childhood (his relationship with his father, his experience in the summer camp, his first therapist (actually, the film impresses that he never had a therapy in Dr. Stirling's therapies).) If you read that book, you were confused with the amount of edited amount. <br /> <br /> I found the book as a brilliant illustration of depression, it highlighted the low points of Wurtzel, and had experience along the way. However, this movie started at Harvard and literally hurried the audience, there is no real interpretation of any event happening. <br /> <br /> The events were important in the book (such as Wurtzel's abortion, working in her summer das, her suicide attempt during Prosecq) was dropped from the film. <br /> <br /> Also, it's pedantic, but Watergirl does not lose her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt at the Sterling's office was quite different from the book. Initially, he actually climbed to the countryside, in opposition to the suicidal gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> I would say to all, if you read the book and enjoy it / marked it, then do not see the film. Instead, read 'more, now, again' (by the same author). Or the Girl watch, interrupted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only freedom fighter was the acting of Anne Hesse, which I believe was Dr. Stirling very well illustrated. Christina Richie was good, though her performance takes a little ... hanging. Jessica Lange made for the delightful philosophy, but looked at the opposite side of how Wurtzel's mother of the book is describing. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not disturb.
