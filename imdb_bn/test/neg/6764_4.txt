Some unnamed aliens off a remote ship from a distant planet have been sent to demon robot cronos to hide its energy world. They've got a Prototype clanking near Mexico for open and more if they prove successful. <br/> <br /> <br /> I can not explain the aliens first that the first scientist has retained John Emery's mind, who gave the order to telonetically the first goal. Emery is later killed and the giant seems to work well enough without Emery as a controller, why the alien needed him a little witch in the first place. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists working under Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence, and George O'Henlan Emery, are not fooling about his nature. And of course they come with a plan to deal with the raging metal monster. <br /> <br /> A perfect film for fifty fertility, bad guys are sometimes not seen there looking at undermining mankind. It's a perfect film for cold war. And Jeff Morrow reassures us that we'll be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players feel like they have an old old time that the author can write in scripts. I suppose that Cronos, this type of movie Ed Wood worked a bit more carefully with the big budget.
