This film is just scary, how this genius is involved, beyond human belief. It seems that when they thought of this idea they were warm, I think it took me two hours of my life. Try Harvey Kittel and keep yourself away from this garbage, it should have been a great crime film but it has turned into a serious world of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who love to sleep through movies, you will not miss a thing. Humor, for the least general dominance, movies can raise us and remind us of life's worth, this movie only frustrates you. The film is a perfect example of this statement, said Dianei in a movie that a cruel thing in life has been damaged.
