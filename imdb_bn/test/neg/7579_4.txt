I should explain that as far as this trend goes to trap Asian filmmakers, this shutter is a head over The Grood and Dark Water, although the same amount of atmospheric melting of the ring is not achieved. <br /> <br> Although life is not as important as life, it is also comparable to that of other mysteries / thrillers / horror films. Actually, I'm not writing a longer summary here and say that instead of musical instruments, the music tries to rely on the "Starle" fear and "Bhoot" itself is not really awesome. The plot is quite basic and predictable and is almost nothing to write about. Although there are creatively frightening some unlimited scenes, most of the movie is quite vanilla. If you enjoy the pain and it happens, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
