This movie, all the chances, is the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst that I've ever seen, and I've seen many bad movies. In <br /> <br />, all the interesting things happen in the movie. One can literally start movies, take a short graduation, and then you can wake up knowing that knowledge of something interesting happened during sleep. And I've seen this movie thrice, stay awake all the time. I think congratulations. According to a source, according to any source the film can be as expected. The predators walk on the big legs, die by parents, and in the nearby town a big bird is deadly deadly. This is astonishingly annoying for a Troma release. <br /> <br /> So please do yourself a favor, and avoid this movie. You will understand why you would see it.
