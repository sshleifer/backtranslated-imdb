There was always good for any fan of nickelododon used to watch the network in the 80's and 90's. It was entertaining work like you can not do it on television. You were curious but good show like Peet and Pitt. You taught moral like Doug that even had cartoons. But like Disney, NicoleDodon has broken the nodes, limiting their demographic to shallow Prestonas and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative groups. I tried to try Zoey 101 observer, I just shook in my head hate <br /> <br /> The setting was not more fake than this. Each character appears in a boarding school named Pacific Coast Academy, which wants a punk child. A Sushi Bar, Laptop Everywhere, Flat Screen TVs in Each Room, Hanging Cold Strips etc. These shows are rarely seen in children's class and do not seem to be a real teacher. It looks like a place you would spend on a beautiful summer vacation instead of working and studying during college preparations. <br /> <br /> The letters made me too. Each episode should solve the problem, the situation that they themselves are, and that the problem should be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Joe (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect to any of her, and each of her friends asks her for help when they think they are in great danger. Just leading her to any other side. I went to school and I can tell you, there is no such thing. Chase is stupid. Logan boasts proudly playing hard people. Quinn is a cruel game who is extremely unreal in what he did. Michael is an ass A clone of Lola Nicole. The wings are just good, a solid person. Why not use some basic? Unique to this character, and something that is different from other personalities? Stereotyptic is the best producer of this event? Instead, cruel personality with the sense that these actors lack the creativity involved in their role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Being an adult Through that time, they must study themselves, decide for themselves and learn what is right for them. Zoey 101 has nothing to value those. In this case, we believe that is good and you need to be successful in a stereotypical personality. I'm sorry, but that's simply not true. People can not hope to give such things to the actors like them and allow them to sit there. If I really hope to do things in Joey 101, then I'll be on the mysterious world in the dream room. Some of these shows are related to those who face health and money problems. So at the end, Jo 101 E. Nicholodon has created a show that flattens in her face. It shows an awesome message for kids and I think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it does not have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to be a child's job and to look stupid. An awesome show, and should be forgotten with the remaining waste, NichDadion has been created in recent years. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 1
