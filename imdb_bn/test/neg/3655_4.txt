The man told me to blame for 1.5 hours of his life, I do not agree with that. The film started as a kind of class cam project and ended in a dark room. When the girls are completely naked, the magical light comes out, I know that I do not want to write the script or say anything about it. But this saw a bad remake with a bad end like a copy. It is really sick to think of a person who wrote this story. This is not really a shocking movie, because it is not a terrible cause. Its mere cruelty and violence that made me sick. It's frustrating to see the movie really not ending, like your face. The movie can be completed now, you can go home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Overall the movie is not the taste of my movie, Witter wanted us to know that this is happening, and that person wrote his own imagination. Have you ever seen a movie? They got some comfort to keep everything. Is that? No Maybe it's me, I'm very soft but this movie shakes me up, and stories are real short, sick people gradually killed the girl. But the actors crashed you in this movie that you can feel almost every scream. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I was quick to judge about this, is it a terrible movie? No it's not It is an overdone example of reality, as it could get it a real. But if you do not see this movie expecting great mystery or a real plot, even a kind of story. People get a girl in a dark room and kill it one by one, it really is.
