Wakaya The horror of Tomasaburo's ex-Kashakunin-Ojami, ETA's screenplay fully felt natural. His disrespect, his voice, his face - it all speaks dislodgement. When he entered a space, as well as the characters of the screen, it may seem that he was not there and he had strong determination because of his strong crisis. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Waqaiya will really train Kendo (Japanese Swords) and that will explain her comfort with Katana, which is shown nicely in each cutfest. If you look at the movies, draw it right from the moment, by pointing out the sword, you think that you are certainly looking at something uncertainly. He even wants to close the blood before the katana is swiftly and it can happen immediately immediately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The conversion of the knight kinsole came as a presentation. It seems like he is trying very hard to tell the story of someone else or anyone else. As a result, every time I try to engage, I can lose my firmness because he does not seem to have strong conviction about his role. Although it was painful for him. <br /> <br /> The TV series' sword was completely old school Holioyard. The cameras are spinning, camouflage, mischief, still the purpose of sitting in the camouflage, etc. Very bad from viewers' perspective. There was a moment in the Caps Wall Wall episode when Mr. Draw a sword like a child in a knock. It was embarrassing. It was heavy, though he was heavy! I almost fell into my chair. <br /> <br /> And do not know: The story is a fantastic sword. Duration Swordsmanship is a problem. <br /> <br /> The reality is not, however: the movie was a nice and manga-like thing, as it was, I'm sure. (The baby cart went out with a cluster of 3-year-old automatic, fast fire boxing? Yes ... Monga-style.) This story maintains historical cultural accuracy in historical cultural accuracy, basically, superhero fantasy which captivating movies. (Refer to Yoshikawa Eiji's Musashi [% Historical Legend]!) I really can not sit through the TV series episode. They just felt cheaper. See the first movie and you know what I mean.
