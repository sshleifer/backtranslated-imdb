Larry Bishop gives a lot of attention to writers / actors / directors, cameras, music and visual perspectives. The film seems to have no purpose other than meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues resorts, which are annoying to the audience and irritating the audience. The actor starts from the beginning of the film, and is caught in a terrible smoke screen, a painful ride experience. Hell with the journey The image is a bomb. <br /> <br /> Victor is represented as deprived Vigilants, who want to look for their own justice for lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists. Lysie Bishop's acting pistolero, the leader of the retaliation of the pack. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is stuck in chaos and psychosocial crossfire. <br /> <br /> Kimman (Eric Balfour) is trusted, but mysterious. Dishes performed by David Carradine, should pass the ride, and so the ticket-buyers (if you want to see the film, you'll be sorry, but why you find it). Billy Wings (Viny Jones) is a painful and poisonous character, which is completely disrespectful. <br /> <br /> How this film, with its all-rising ramblings and laziness, is how the film that goes absolutely anywhere to make an investment ever. Ticket Buyer, get my advice: Do not pay for the ride. Please do not make the same mistake as the investors. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes, or the movie is confusing and obsolete. Dialogue, which quickly turns into meaningless monologues, does not make any sense. The whole picture is not going anywhere. The poor Dennis Hopper is caught in a real mess. He should, too, pass the ride. There are decapitated heads, slashed throats, and nude female wrestling. It is clear that Bishop does not know where he is going with this film. He was completely lost. However, at the end of the journey, you just do not have to give a blunder. Mama Mia! Stay at home And, by all means, the ride is not. I rate this image 1 out of 10, but this movie is so awful that it's a zero-deserved.
