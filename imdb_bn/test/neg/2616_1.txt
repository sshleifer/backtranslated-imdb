This is the most disappointing seventh section of the series of deaths slowly. It is very clear that the budget was extremely low. This movie was created for one reason and for one reason alone. Dolls sells master toys! Fans like this series have decided that I read and heard that the only one in this series is the Puppetmaster's Curse. Instead, turn us away from the series. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Plots seem to have been almost there, but were easily lost in unconscious streams. <br /> <br /> The only movie in this series, directed by Dikota, is also part 3 - Toulon's revenge. <br /> <br /> Please, I support the film scenes. <br /> <br /> Echo!
