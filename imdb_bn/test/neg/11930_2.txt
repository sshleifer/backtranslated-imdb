Among the animated series: <br /> <br /> Ion Flux was an immortal rebel which was completely isolated from everything and everyone. He was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, malicious, kastik, confident, satirical, lethal, unbroken, suspicious at once. The main ion depth was level on the level. She can not show through almost her personal emotions. The original plot was deliciously flawed and thought to be provocative. Could you say you never had the purpose of Aeon This was a militant anarchist, when Trevor was a fundamentalist idealist, because of which he could not meet any stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie <br /> <br /> Monicans working for Eon Flux and its political purpose and personal intentions are very clear. She was beautiful, loving, risky, easily tamable, emotional and very hopeful. The majority of the film Aeon had a level of depth. The plot was obvious and arising. Everything is fully submitted for you from the beginning. There was no conflict in the context of at least personal philosophy between ion and Trevor. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great disappointment for me. I felt betrayed. They always had an idea of ​​my favorite animated characters, shrink all its depth and personality, and filled them with Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series in this movie was completely lost. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this movie "1" is because the visuals were incredible. It was clear by seeing some familiar animated scenes such as fly with CGI.
