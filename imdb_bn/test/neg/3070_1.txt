Must have an idea for any movie; Simple or even more complicated, it's a requirement ... problem with the fret, .. once more, when he decides to make a movie, he can "do any" so that he forgets the original description and as a result, What is doing without rationality, behaving without reasonable reason ... They are the simple dolls that are going along with the movie in the air. It's annoying and sad to remove cards like a boring card and game. Fragata always seems to have the talent in advertising itself ... and that led you to see what he ... but in the end is always a big disappointment. "The Pink Magazine star of the hot Portuguese" is not enough for a movie ... especially when half of them do not work ... they just want to be fun. Here's my only good point to actor Healder Mendes ... one of the few stars: He tried to establish some credibility, and without any direction in any filthy film (any kind) I give him credit to try hard. But this film should be checked out as the manual of "How to not work manually" ... and where Fragta's previous acts are bad ... it's a "best composition" for achieving the title of AWFUL. In a few words, just check it out! It will make you look good ... and if you have done your family films ... ... and your work always looks bad ... so spend 30 minutes to see this "so-called" professional work ... The stuff made of your home will look like a strong Hollywood flash compared to Soto Nula.
