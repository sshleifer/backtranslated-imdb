When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. You do not have to shoot a lot like this flick, hope to fight. And: You expect a rather simple story. Well, although this is a sigal film, I can live with more complex stories. But this one, this, I do not know what to say. It's really, very confusing really. At the end of the film, my main problem was to identify what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. There is so much information in the story and it is almost impossible to keep track of what is happening in the plot that is so full of plot holes. There are many people in the movie, people always change sides, and it often switches locations. Terrible I do not understand why Segal is creating such a series.
