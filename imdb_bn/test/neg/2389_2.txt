There are a few chapters on this paper: On paper, a street child crossing the horror of the past, rebuilding her life, and the world will succeed when it closes. Great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the theater, there was something wrong that left the film inside. The dialogue was hollow and unreliable, the letters had their dimensions and cartoons almost lacking in complexity and why would everyone be gay? I have nothing against gay themes or characters in a movie, but when it is used in this fashion it is not objectionable for homosexuals, it makes life less trivial and makes the movie cheaper. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were either successful or not, and each of them had an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying incident of this movie is that they come from the "pipe" great expectations. They should give you it once and that should be enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Teaches how to be bigger. In the end, with the lesson learned, Pip went ahead with his dark past and the film went ahead with his life.
