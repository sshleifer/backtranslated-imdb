This movie was terrible and even the only reason for the creation was that the story was left too appealing. I consider myself a moderate, so I was able to see this film as a garbage pill. Although I'm not a Bush fan, your dislike for GDV is not enough to see this movie. <br /> <br /> To start, the movie was shot in a low-grade movie that it stopped, cheaper, artsy. In addition, the letters are seriously lacking in depth. The character of Chris Cooper was a bad parody of George Bush; More a dramatic film then suitable for Saturday Night Live. The rest of the letters are walking and there are many other types of poor featuremile from very good movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
