Hope you have it in the child but you least expect a complete and coherent movie. What a waste I am very disappointed, not only seen a bad movie, but such a great idea can be grasped by a common film that we have seen before. If this cruise is $ 1 more than its budget, the studio winner announces, uploading all available copies, will store them deeper in the nuclear waste store under the Ucaka Mountain, and then will not create any other film again. Most of the movie will remember you, "I did not want to see." Appeal to this film intellectual and perhaps teens. This is a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had high hopes for this film.
