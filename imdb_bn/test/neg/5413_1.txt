Wow, where started with this one. Well, if you enjoy the smile of movie makers as impossible, but it's for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I have never had the chance to laugh at the Bond movie in the B-Movie God Gossa venture Van Diien's Blunders, and the boy was one of them. It is enough that the film has the single largest hairstyle giant. This thing, which is supposed as an Indian Scratch, is more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton to keep in front of you in the front of Halloween. She is clearly completely with a garbage bag, which seems to be a bucket shaped on a Cape dons, its head. At some point it is a man of clothing, on the other hand it is clearly a plastic phenomenon at the top of a horse. There is a tremendous "power" view in this demon, a clear rip-off, and miraculously presented after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spears cut people, sometimes it does not. This thing handles a helicopter down with a single arrow. Wow, if the child submits a spaceship bomb with a scratches at the end of the "cryters", it gives a lot of knowledge. This animal is untidy for bullets, but at the end of the film one dies. At the end of his assassination, we could never find why he was, he flew away. This is an incredible achievement, because we've already seen this image flown up 3 times. However, I guess this was the end time charm. Do not start me with <br /> <br /> and other characters too. Firstly, the Delta Force unit recruits women? In the end, I still neglected the military in the women of war. Also, this unit "secret." Why? What would be the reason for them to be hidden? And they are not good at this, I guess if anyone could understand that they did not have uniforms then they were military, but they were counting all the machines (which eventually resulted in changes in sound effects across the film, some point air rifles, BB guns, and others , Like Canon). Schlattman man threw some construction workers from a catwalk when there is a part and you can clearly see the pad which they read. Other times Michael Rumah clearly falls below a hill in the flat ground. They were crying a bit to give the camera a lid, but he is definitely pushing himself with this looooooonnnnggggggg Fall scene. Then when he is helped behind the hill, the rope flatten, and when it shows "woman" at the top of "mountain", the rope goes from its ribs, in no way will she see whether she is dragging anyone. Up a hill Rumah is actually a line that says, "I'm not going after him, I'm going after that." What? It's probably the most dirty thing I've ever heard of, and I see this bad movie as a hobby. The most tragic part about this quote is that you can say that everybody involved in writing / production was so bad-ass. Believe it or not, it's better than the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Acting, Bad Makeup, really bad. These characters were wounds or wounds that they liked to change their faces. Perhaps this is the alien scars like run around your face. Yes, I think I'll make a movie about it, "Alien Scans of Attack Your Face Even." That would be more awesome than the villain skeleton man, and the film would probably be scarier.
