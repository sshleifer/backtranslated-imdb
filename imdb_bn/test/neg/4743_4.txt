A few years ago I saw the Allian v Pradlete, then I should say stupid as a sigell, it was still a little enjoyable. Now, unfortunately, there is a lack of good film in the theater, so my boyfriend and I were just about to move forward and about AVPR: Alliance vs. Predator - Rikim. So we saw it a couple couple ago and I want to say that there was nothing exciting about this awesome seagel. It takes a completely different look from the first AVP film, it is not a bad idea to take the alien and the predator and take them to the top pedestal, but the idea of ​​the first explains the reasons for the existence, it is simply an average and expected horror sequel. Mention a story that replaces new characters where I was not sure why the main character is remembered and why, why I could not hold the real story. <br /> <br /> From what I've collected, sitting in the Spreader and Alien space, to deal with the stuff of General Business Computer, they are just lighting each other and why do not they decide? Go ahead and take it on some earthlings. So they are taking over the crash and the utopia of the alien suburbs. But Kenny and Barbie, a woman marine and her daughter, among others, with such a troubled couple of thirteen people, are sure to hit some spaces, the hunters are not the first to be there. Because he pushed away from Allian, I think without him, to start the party, lol, just kidding, in fact to kill some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVVR: Alien vs. Predator - Not the worst movie by any quality, it is still quite cool with most visual effects and it is too cool to see the sequence of battles between aliens and predators. Like the first episode of Alien vs. Proditar, Cast is the one thing that destroys the film and it seems that it was not developed better, I know it's awful, but the original Allen and Predator movies were characters, which you care about and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent seagull that I would say for some fun, especially why and Barbi's request. <br /> <br /> 4/10
