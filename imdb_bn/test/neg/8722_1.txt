Can i say After reading Herbert's books and the film version of Loving Lynch, I was very disappointed. I felt Buck was watching a rejected version of Rogers. Set Star Wars is like a special over-left TV! I felt mostly played played by a little pounded. The costume was great and the work was done, which gives it a sense of decoration of the '60's flash gordon. Worm! They are supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared "big stalagtites" with a face at the end of a point. The general effect was that the second rate was fantastic. I will not even start with the disrespecting "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called "dancer of frank herbert" was not faithful in his books too! It was supposed to be "Frank Harbert's Dune - Dummies". The original plot elements have been omitted, the name has been changed and the whole "feeling" of the story was "sanitized". I did not recognize Hercules! In fact, most of the letters Hertbert's accounts did not see anything that illustrated them. I'm just starting to get upset minding what was a tragedy. I'm glad I could not stomach the second installment!
