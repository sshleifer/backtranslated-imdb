I'm just watching an episode (S1- # 5 Bush's son), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on that episode, it is a very bad version of CSI, the role is confiscated. Whatever the name of the main character, whatever its name, it actually hits so the net is so fake. I will not throw him to join a dog meal! <br /> <br /> Another traumatic thing is that David Buryanage, a good actor, did a great job of fame "angel", <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The potential competition involved in this movie is displayed in the filmography. <br /> <br /> That woman is at least # in that episode. But based on this one scene, even though it is shown on the elevator screen, I will not even invest to see it.
