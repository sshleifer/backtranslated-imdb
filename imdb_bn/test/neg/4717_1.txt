Do you know that movies that are so irrationally bad that you will laugh? Half-letter was not among them. That sounds good, right? But no, it's not. This is not a bad endeavor for a horror movie that is fun to watch because it is not long, or good acting, or has some bad effects or something like this. No, half-letter is just general annoying. They do not even try to be scary for the last 20 minutes. It's just kids running around Africa's Bush country and the first 75% of elephants are rising from the dung for film, and it's not even funny. Last 20 minutes, though Hillary. I have no idea what happened, but all the white boys of the CGI leopard could not tell me about it, it was really fun to get pregnant. If you are in the mood of a bad horror movie, do not rename it, because you will go to bed before going to fun things. If you rent this movie accidentally, then I recommend for fast progress and avoid any scenes in the daylight. You do not miss anything If you look at all the backgrounds, you will not have any character or character going on.
