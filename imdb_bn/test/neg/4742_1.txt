My eligibility for this review? I own all the Allian and Priderer films and I have read and read almost all books related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this film is Stinker. Save your money and do not waste your time. If you do not like a plot to talk about stupid actions, Manmohan Gore, Hollywood, and want to see the movie then <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> , Cases filed in Hollywood and the 20th Century Fox and do not give them a penny. <br /> <br /> This movie has many plot holes through which you can play pasta through it. Read other negative reviews to get big pictures, it has not been properly told all, so do not have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The character of this movie is on the cardboard. You want them all dead. And, movies are not frustrating, almost everyone dies. Even the hot, bubble blonde led. Do you feel sorry for him? No No plot, no character development .... care. Hunters are now stupid They scan everything without their own dead warrior. They seem to be a high tech society, is not it? In the Predator movie, they decided that the army and girl were determined by the armed. Kill trophy In the AVP, they allowed Charles to scan the Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. Major plot hole! Also, the rating is because of the children in their movie that have leakage, excessive roar and violence, and there is a hospital scene where a large pregnant woman is given injection with chest bursters. He has kept 4 or 5 eggs from the mouth and mouth of the Hybrid Allian in the scene of the face and they all said in 30 seconds. A lot of exciting ghoos, nothing. This scene is ridiculous, not ridiculous. It often happens like violence and watch the alien camera and wait for applause, a thumb-up or some sort of sort. <br /> <br /> The alliance of this movie is the most effective drug. During the fast span across all the cities, cities, they develop rapidly and spawn the city faster. Sad because it can not interfere with the series story line and the alliance producer adds nothing to the alliance. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the people of the cow's love wrote positive reviews. Ridiculous As a film, as the development of the Alliance franchisee and Alien vs. Predator franchise, this film is the best one cheeseclay clich√©. If you follow this series faithfully then all rules break down and allen and predators are reduced to comic book characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a great, memorable action scene. There is almost no special effect to remember. There are no brand name actors. The plot is thin like onion paper, which ends in the end, "We have two choices to come out of this mess ... hospitals or city centers!" I just about myself wet The center of the city means that everyone is going to get nicknamed by big brother, anyone knows that the city has been oppressed because they have an adobe in the air, which can see the special effects red spots dangerous to the radar screen. I just fell from my chair. Special effects red spot alien radar on an AWAC on Central America. <br /> <br /> I scoffed at my popcorn for going to helicopter pad. Did anyone play a game called Zumbis ?? You have to get your pieces to win the helicopter pad. I forgot to laugh almost <br /> <br /> <br /> Who wrote the 20th Century Fox to write this script? Oh, oh, ask me ... a grade 5 student. There can not really be any other answer. Oh, yes another answer could be ... low budget cheesecake sci-fi. <br /> <br /> end? "Colonel Stevens took Mrs. Ettini (Francois Epe) a Predator Pulse Rifle, and told him that the technology that the world represents is not ready for it, Col. Steven knows that the UTT technology does not want to be used on earth." You're kidding me, is not it? Mrs. Utini? Who is Miss Utiini? (ForShadow: Weiland-Utani: The Corporation) He is in exactly 2 seconds of the film and in his infinite remote knowledge, he said that the world is not ready for technology technology. Seriously ?? !! Brothers Davis (Strauss) as director? Which film is responsible for this hemorrhage? They are director Doug and Bob McKenzie and Fox expelled Alien Franchisee. They are touted as special effects experts and still have all the less budget special effects on the movie. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Ridiculous <br /> <br /> This movie was created just to empt your wallet. It makes no other purpose. It's a plot. It has no major character significant. It is discrete. It does not follow any policy of the character set in the previous film. It's nothing in the franchisee advance. Special Effects LAM, Minimum and Low Budget. And, there is no end to talk about it. It's designed to take less budget and money hardly earned your hard earned money. Nothing else <br /> <br /> Save your money. Watch it on TV where it will end very quickly. Buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding ulcer completely. There is a reason why Fox does not preview this movie to critics. Critics used to eat this mess and nobody went to the theater to see it. Originally, J.R. Gaigaor hanging over the toilet at this moment, his luncheon hanging over the toilet. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is a tragic. It's worse than the alien 3. You humiliate us. <br /> <br /> Flush now ...
