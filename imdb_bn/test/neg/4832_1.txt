This is a rip off from cellular. <br /> <br /> bad casting <br /> <br /> bad side <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Well, there was no instruction since the story, the scene and setting were taken directly from another movie. <br /> <br /> Even the style of war has been copied. A man with a mesmerized bill was from the bill and the other from Jett Lee's or Jackie Chan's film (I was not able to remember the name of this film) with a fire pipe ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation Try to see and see the real things ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
