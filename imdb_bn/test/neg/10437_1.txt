Have you ever read a book, then watched the movie, and wondered - how did they make it so bad? This is one of them. Hafker's book, "One does not like drunk Indians", was great fun ... this film is not. It seems as if someone did not take enough care to move along direction, so we took care of the letters. This movie, which touches some of the real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we have not seen more humor about Holocaust or slavery. Not good
