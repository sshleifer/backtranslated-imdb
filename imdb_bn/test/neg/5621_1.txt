If you look beyond the documentary, you should remember that the director was completely inexperienced and actually was a co-worker of Quintin Tarantin in a video store. Put two and two together and you will realize that Quintin is doing a favor on behalf of his old shoulder, though the trunk is rather illusionary. Was that harsh? Well see this film and you will not understand it. Very slowly, very nonsensical in the middle, and very slow end. It sums me up. Erie Stalves and Deli only showed some of the charisma. And Kemp is actually an OK to keep the performance. But the rest were really bad. An example of the stupidity of the plot was when a "lead robber" accidentally released his mask at the time of dispersion. What will happen then Well other robbers decide they can remove them too! What a great thought Violence was relentless and insane. But not a "cool" way. Rather, an overwhelming way. I am surprised if this is meant to be a comedy. His good name is more stupid Tarantino to get this garbage attached. It's more stupid to see.
