Protector You hear the name. You think, "Oh, this is a painful Hong Kong movie." Guess - this is not Hong Kong. And yes, it's painful. This wonderful stupid Jackie Chan film, destroyed by us, yes, Americans (I'm warm with anger, oh, I think I'll leave that window!), New York is hunting gangs as a police chan, accused of killing his friend! Cool sound ... but it's not. Do not waste your money to rent it. To prove he can make a good copy movie, Chan created amazing policy story (1985).
