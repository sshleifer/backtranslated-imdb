If one wants to be a character in a movie, it may be a boring sexual encounter, which will later be ashamed of the character in life, it is only a matter that the viewers will see the behavior as shameful and now it is done. Other comments make judging some even that are not well successful. Although I must admit, I can not remember a funny scene, I had to close it before it was over. I saw a part of the director's commentary and seemed to think that he was well-versed in that movie. If you want to get the same feeling, just get cheaper, dust in the head and breathe deeply from this movie.
