I have seen this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem is that I hope to see many stylish martial arts movies through the trailer and think of a lot of plots. At the time of seeing the trial it seemed that there is nothing more to look at (if you are expecting what is expected above). At that time my girlfriend gave up half way and I hope that something interesting can be done ... nothing happened. I have not found any attachments or actual interest in any characters. I would say, you will not be disturbed unless you have a few hours of life that you are not really concerned about losing.
