Ben Affleck, about getting married, was wounded by an air crash and was involved with other passengers (Sandra Bulak, forced to work himself insane). Who is the blame for this stranger, ugly morass? It has been edited very badly, when I saw the credit, the editor did not have to read the name - it really did see if the person actually took the credit! Raúkon i-makeup rides on clichés, conventions and sandra bulk, the film does not bother to make chemistry between two main characters. Smile is absent: If the gay bar scene with the affair is not too stupid, then you can achieve big smiles (bar patronage - a big cyclone between them! - leaked out of the fluff and started to dig out their cash). It seems to be no other significance than to make Ben different, but the whole scene is misguided and the result disappears because the stupid editor is cut off ... or were those movies? It's a short moment, but it's the norm of this movie, an amateur piece of pop-products that wants to be a modern modern comedy, but there is no disappointment. It's made for shelf under your video's shop. * ****
