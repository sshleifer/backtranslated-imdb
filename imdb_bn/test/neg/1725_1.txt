Peter Crowford discovered a comet in a collision course with the moon. But the government does not believe her (Fools # 1). He is drawing a deep underground to see a shelter and who will go. Plus willing to kill to save humanity (Fools # 2). With the technology of billions, how can civilians not see what NASA can do? Plus, the end is the justification for the moral meaning of this story! This movie is unlikely and completely incredible. What was going on in the minds of these people, why such painful piles could get green light? Sometimes I wonder if someone **** ing this movie is a movie made in town.
