Oh dear God, this is awful. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you saw bad movies, think again. As much as I saw this movie in my brain, I got hurt. Acting, if it can be said, internal bleedings of your head cause enough. The story is so thin that it's barely ... no waiting, scratch There is no complete story, but in a while there are some thin lines that would come from all kinds of horror and believe me that some lines should be shot. The best way to enjoy this movie is to leave it out, and to show a comfortable fire from a distance. <br /> <br /> Someone can tell me boring in this review, but I'm just trying to give you a little bit of a headache. However, if you want to be, what I want to say, a visual masochist (like yourself), please go ahead and see this monstrosity.
