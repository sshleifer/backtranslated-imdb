I have not seen any other film by Antonioi and who saw this with me agree that he shares the themes and imagery with the rest of his work. Maybe if I had seen other things with him then I knew what I would expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as almost complete failure for many reasons. After all, the film introduces deep, interesting topics related to the fiction of the nature of social relations, feelings, reality, but these often give lectures, such as lectures, such as lectures, juxtaposing announcement instead of having a conversation. The scholars feel so worried that they will not get the point that they are not able to say instead of showing them. <br /> <br /> There is no rhyme in the movie, especially its first half. This is not only slow. Some are slowly produced with a great sense of motion and rhythm (Victor Iris or Scory's The Edge of Innocence, by example, as an example of L. T.), but it must be successful so that we are moving characters so cute or so that we can adapt it You can It does not happen in Baind The Clouds, where the first episode is continuously dragged and John Malkovich's "reality" and love stories "fiction" are sometimes fluid, others unexpected, others confusing, and confusing.
