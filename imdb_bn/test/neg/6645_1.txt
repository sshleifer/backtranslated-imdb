I would not recommend this movie. Although it has been rated G, and is explicitly sworn in for children (including the words 'F' and 'S' with horrible) Does this kind of language not particularly concern children's children? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The acting was so good that it was found in this section of the film, but the story line was very impressive and even my four year old Commented that it was 'fool' <br /> <br /> If you do not see this despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie is certainly not worth checking.
