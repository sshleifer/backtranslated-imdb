It was unfortunate enough to see this while traveling across Africa while traveling. It was the worst movie I ever covered across and away. # 1 is always responsible to be the greatest ;-) No acting, no plot, very little talk. Although plenty of App-Like Granting in this impossible unlikely movie. An irrational self-satire - you'll laugh at it or cry.
