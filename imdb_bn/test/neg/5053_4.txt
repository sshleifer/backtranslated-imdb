I did halfway through this movie, and at that time I realized that I did not know how it ended. It's basically a great comedy that I just saw because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as a cruel teacher. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Do it. You have to remember something that things are controlled in that you think events are inevitable and you need interesting characters that you like, and you do not have it. The worst movie I've ever seen, but it does not catch me for a second.
