This movie has some good performances, as others have mentioned, but suffers from it (as others have mentioned, apparently they do not mention other than filmmakers or cast friends, why they think it's "10") some self-aware and self -Applied film from school padding and extra plots. This type of plot which can handle half-an-hour episodes of Sex in the City, was no reason for more than 88 minutes of movie. A perfect example of the broken footage is the fast moving montage on the third floor of the film. Some of the stories behind, for example, were spent a lot of time with Daria's character, anal sex lovers and behind the subject, who was not a realistic character, though the actor did a good job with her. The line is given to him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The author (director and leader) cooperated with someone, but he might not end up with a 100% sunrise score in Roton Tomatoes, which would make him truly believe that anyone who gave it to 10 people.
