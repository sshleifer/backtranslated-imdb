I rent the movie another day B / Rom I loved the romance story, but this life has seen the worst in my life. I have a strong conviction that will fall in love with Sam Kelly, when they did not say more than two words to each other, when he has a long-term boyfriend who is fully devoted to him. I thought Kelly had a big quarrel throughout the movie, and she never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnet. I thought he did a nice acting job, and I'm going to start watching more of his movies.
