When I went to see it, I liked the first two and thought that they were very suspicious, so it should also be good. Wrong! There was no mystery and they did not explain about new dinosaurs! When I saw it, I lost respect to Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it was not spillberg or Michael Crichton was written! This movie is going through "speed". I thought that there was no plot in this movie and I thought that nobody would waste their money to see it.
