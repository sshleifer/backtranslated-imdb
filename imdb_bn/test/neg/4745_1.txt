The first and first film on this movie and the first Alan and Predator franchisee is the film. <br /> <br /> They are terrible movies, played badly, badly scripted and horribly managed. They seem to be a somewhat frustrating tendency to earn money from the main aliens and predatory films, but instead of giving them quality ideas, they came in the past. <br /> <br /> The original Alien / Alien / Predator / Predator 2 movies were fantastic, they redefined the horrific / thriller genre that discovered these crazy (and yet believable) creatures who took the role of 'serial killer', which Was in favor. <br /> <br /> These pictures are just feeding franchise milk and can not do anything except its name. <br /> <br /> Alien vs. Proditar comic books were brilliant and it was a great story. They had the authenticity of the Alien / Predator mythology, did not exclude all original stories etc. Why did not they create a comic book in a great movie? Because Hollywood is stupid, that's why.
