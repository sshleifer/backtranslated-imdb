I'm not saying that I did not want to see this movie in the first place; I used to see it one day, and I guess I think I can lighten it and enjoy it for it and it can be entertaining. One of the worst movies I have ever seen was the expectations that I have been expecting, not many times. First of all, there was nothing diverse in at least bits. The makers hoped to be comedic / ridiculous if they included the limitations of each line out of the underdog, and using the scene after Blend's scene, the spectators used to "lighten" the light-hearted side, although they still made "Oh" and "Ah" boring To do more with action scenes and inspiration, the lazy performance that I enjoy is M. Everyone wants to shout from the audience. Acting was neutral, humor was tiring and character / plot that they had created their entire personality for 10 minutes, which did not give any range of acting actors / actors to portray their characters with at least depth. This movie is easy and easy to fall in every case and really kids under 10 will be able to enjoy it, even though this age range is targeted for such weakness and for some reason I feel so sorry. Parents, Above, Wall-E, SpiderWeek Chronicles, The Best for the Water Horses or Dogs, the best for the recent family / children's flickr or even Alvin and Chimmons, spend your money better than this smell!
