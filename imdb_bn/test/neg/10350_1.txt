Original Australian words and Kim Bright. Why does the American producer need another classic show to rebuild and destroy? Remember the original version of Ricky Garvis's "The Office", it was a perfect masterpiece and there was no need to recreate it. Producers say that British comedians from "The Office" and Australian "comedy" will not translate an American audience from ......... ??? So basically they say that the Americans are too stupid to be fools and jokes, so they have to recreate show-ray kids mess, so Americans can understand humor. The original version of the talk and Kim is fantastic and fun. Avoid the American version like plague !!
