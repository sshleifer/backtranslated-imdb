Who, one day my dad picked up a movie with a 'twist' cover. I got home with my mother and we were good before we saw this new movie! Okay so it has started ... a startling start on a strange planet, a cool robot and a horrible gore (eek) (actually it was not pluton?) ... I could say the whole story, but I, rather, the WTFF never link the donkey name Do not pick a movie, and seriously I can never say that it sometimes judges a book by its cover (wrong tape ..). It seems like a fun movie, though its face is Sci-Fi movie, its Discipline. I mean it was so bad that I just started to laugh (I tried to be serious) I can express my determination! It kills more than one hundred thousand brain cells from mine, even I can not even write a breed criticism. That's bad! Argh and I Wana You have to prepare it for "strange" * COW COW * Mechanical P3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Mechanical Sorry, it's very funny, it seems as a parody for a comedy or sci-fi movie. Her classic batman laughs but a new packaging. What was this manager thinking?
