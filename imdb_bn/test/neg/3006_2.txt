This was a point in the movie I did not find it. A very sad movie about the final relocation of the inhabitants of the residents of a dam area on the Northफ़ਰਕ River of Montana. The problem is no real Northfork river in Montana. There are several North Farks, but they are the branches of other rivers which are divided into north and south forms. <br /> <br /> The first scene of this movie is a coffin bubbing beneath the lake, but the scene is never tied in the story and the visitors are left to guess its meaning. But there is so much left to imagine the filmmakers. Another example is that a group of employees of the dam are responsible for rescuing the residents, the dam headquarters has reached, another group is going away. Often shuffled comments have been made about these people which do not give any sense and there is no follow up in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The film has spread through a number of stories, and the movie continues to switch back and the story is quite annoying. And the story is weird. One of the residents of one of the property has been refused to move because they are living in a house that is built like Noah's ark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the same time a fraternity And share his presence with orphans in a priest's house. Someone may know how the author explains the story of the ghost story, but it must be explained. <br /> <br /> The scene was starcraft and the sun never shines. There are far snow mountains in the distance. I guess the purpose was set to mood. This incident was thought to have occurred in the era of 1946-48 that it was thought that the event took place in 1956. When I saw this movie, Darley was in Hannah's film. If he was, I could not recognize him, but I thought he was a ghost guy.
