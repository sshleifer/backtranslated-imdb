It was fun when Jerry Lewis did not write his own material and was a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he began to write and manage his own films, the example of the little talent he took was spread by his point of view. When his films failed in the American market (and well-liked creators) (they made money in France), Lewis always blamed everything except himself and others; For example, he blamed the failure of the film, according to Levy, it released a double bill with "Deep Threat", "sensitive features". Anyone should be complaining about the situation, it should be the producer of "deep throat". It is a completely stupid "comedy" about the wealthy person worldwide (Lewis) who was rejected for the WW2's military and decided to move to Germany and specifically to form a special "party" to hold Hitler. Apart from many errors in this movie (this script is a mind-stranger strange, Luis' "direction" is obscure, the film has a cheaper home movie appearance), Lewis apparently thought that without any talent, without any talent himself, Surrounding himself, like too much of Murray and Sydney Miller, the Tariff Belt Comics There was a good idea; He must have been so bad, they would look good to him. He was half right; They are embarrassingly bad, but they come out worse than them. For a "comedy", the character of Luis is broken, anger and push! They will follow such a fanatic quarrel in a dangerous mission to try to catch Hitler, because the key to abuse on its underline makes you wonder. It's wonderful that this movie is taking any money. It's the worst that I saw by Jerry Lewis Movies - I've heard that "slopstick" is more unfortunate, but I can not bring myself to see whether it is true or not - and all possible costs should be avoided.
