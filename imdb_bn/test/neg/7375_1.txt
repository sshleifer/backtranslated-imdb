I absolutely can not believe the strangers levels of this production show. I honestly had better taste than gay men. I know i do <br /> <br /> Most of the blame does not lie with the throw, but let's get out of their way ... the only genuine gambling with genuine talent (plus he was the best bod cast). He was a wonderful, clear theater style voice. All right, and Joyce Hudess's voice was so much, but every number had an empty expression. The rest could not contain a note in the bucket, although in reality the song was explicitly dubbed. Their survival has been really dangerous. They were all girly-boys except three. If I want to see Onstage Naked, I can go to titty bars. Not sure why to make LAO Productions in Album instead of New York. I imagine NY is gifted with a more talented talent, even though someone may think of LA but they will be able to find the best-looking boys. Apparently not <br /> <br /> But I blame ... here the original blame is with the Creator and the producers. This score was the most stupid, insipid trip I've ever heard. It sounds like some theater quotes sound like taking the CD's of all their music, threw them in a blender and pour goo into a page. Sadly, I'm not sure the difference between the writing of a great theater can not be said. I would seriously say that I was smiling my ass with the whole thing but not in the insane views. I think, "My lover-is dead-the-ad-song" title, "Chris, see what you missed" the most unlikely subject of the whole show. Writing jeans ... Chris / Missed ... wow ... they have to be a total rhyme ... a good song. And Jesus ... the end of that song ... "Oh Chris, hey Chris, Oh Chris ..." Over Over !!! My other favorite was "You want to be a Pumpi Juki Boy from Humpy Hottie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary songs just because they rhymed. Where did you learn to write lyrics of this song? Obviously they listened to Sandim and said, "He is not so great, I can do it" ... proved by a song "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" reference to the disabled. Another mockery: Why 20 song songs about Robert Mitchell and Tab Hunter? Obviously the musician is not coming from the face ... Again, bad writing <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like torture and pain, and I know you do not have many weird fetishists, go ahead and see it. But you have been warned.
