Franco films can be divided into 4 parts - "Arles" (often black and white and inventive), "Nottie" (in the late 1960s / early 1970s / 1970s included in Soldad Miranda), "Nude ies" (in different times, but Full nudity) and "left" as the plot drive. <br /> <br /> This is part of "rest". It is not really a cannibal movie. It is of course no gorefest. Some women in the film also do not lose their waist and have a little full frontal staff. I saw the quality of the picture in the German DVD poor. The image has emerged (it has never been caught in the fire). As Franco fan, I would not have to bother others. Do something else with your time ... Read a book ... Get a copy of "Women at CellBlock 9" ... really something ...
