Thank God for DVR and its fast forward high speed Even with that I can not sit through any of that travesty. When they asked the old Indian to come, I gave up. Saturday night can be the best for the Saifai Channel? How are some old classic instead? The idea of ​​a coed special forces unit was quite bad. It seems like they wanted to save money by portraying all of the wood. What more can I say? It was so terrible that I do not think I can bring enough lines to qualify for the review for the place. However, it will see more lines in it. Save your time, let your dog alone this dog a movie.
