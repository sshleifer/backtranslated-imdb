So I caught this afternoon as "what I had said" and actually saw it because the start was somewhat committed. The heroine, Diana Pennington, specializes in climbing a mountain ... but that does not help her when her fianc√© Brian gets hit to climb. When he comes back for help and comes back, he disappears from the mountain, and will never be seen. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a mountain ... but she will not go to Snowman Pass. Until the advent of Kurt Savar, he is told that he can find out the body of a new satellite program in his lost maternal home. He agreed and lifted the mountain with two assistants in the cart: his "bodyguard" Hugo and computer visitor Tyler From the beginning, you know that some misleading intent is going on, but unfortunately the twists are not good and lead to a ridiculously bad chasing continuation that creates the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main disappointments are the red springs, most of which are supernatural domains that never come. In the mountains, the objects of the sky (which are not supernatural), the story of how Snowman passed, and the most memorable among them: Half of the sequence of Diana's dream through the movie. But most disappointed they cut the ball. Most of the movie circulates around the bryan, so I do not understand why it happened with him and where he was, why was he not resolved through the film. It was the main plot. How to start this movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
