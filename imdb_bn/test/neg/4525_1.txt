Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve (The Office) Carroll is a movie actor who has played Movie Actor in a movie that was so bad, you saw that the worst movie you saw was the second worst movie. Seventh rate story - if you can call it but trying to take it around the world. It's so weird, it's absolutely unfortunate. Anne Hathaway looks good on Agent 99 as the only subject-she seems unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has a fine sense of limiting his screen time to 90 seconds, and some faces in the TV series have turned into a very small role. The movie is supposed to be a part thriller and part-action film. It is not. Although I'm really fond of the TV series, at least it was the light of this piece of light years ago. Pull it through all this dirt and we are cheapen whatever good memory it was. Thanks god Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it Hollywood! Please send crappy movies like this and send a multiplexes on weekly basis. The film is not going down the industrial tubes. This movie is so bad, it does not look good to laugh. If this movie was a newspaper, it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage. There is no reason to watch this movie. A main canal is more enjoyable than this. Ratings- zero-point five star If you are not a masokist, stay tuned. Even better, what's the title - Get smart and save your nine forms. You can buy gas 2 gallons with it. Put in your car and be grateful You are not going to multiplexes to see the bomb!
