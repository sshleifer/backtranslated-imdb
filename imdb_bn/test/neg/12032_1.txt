A low budget could be an excuse for poor acting talent and cruel looking mesh gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It's a genius to be able to write the dialog without making it sound mandatory and mechanical. The dialogue in this movie was equivalent to most of the directional videos shown by fast food staff for training. <br /> <br /> I also realize that you have to make some exceptions of only 20 taka when you play talented. To spend it. With that said, no serious director would look at this scene and said to himself, "That was perfect." I can see the good character in acting on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This movie had thin plot, bad acting, bad conversation and no intelligent ideas. It only proves to me that some independent films are for a reason. Looking for your fast fear, hire something else. Even "sing only" was even a scarier film. After watching this movie, I think I'd better be able to run it again in X-files.
