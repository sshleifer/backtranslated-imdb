I really hope for this one well, but it did not happen. Profiting at the very non dutch dictionary and still looking cool, style and speed that are very much like Hollywood. I do not understand that in all these great ways - directors, writers, producers still managed to film this movie completely horror. Bad jokes, cheap nudity, and actors that can not speak [ACT] only with English language. To remove the pull of Cudo, but this man was thinking!
