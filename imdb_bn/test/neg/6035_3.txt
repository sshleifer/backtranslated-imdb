Reeves plays a hero Haji Murad in Russia of 1850, <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a badly done movie, June Farooqui doing some voice. Unfortunately the lips of the lips were never guesses the lips, because the lips did not match the flaps, because the blinds were there. Anyone who thinks Japanese movies are bad, they never saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is forgotten immediately and so I forgot it to finish the film and sit for me and write it. Perhaps the film is the film that is one of the many in hopes of a return to more plot-driven films from Revis Kariakand. It could be a good thing for Reeves, but it was fatal for the audience, who was walking through the Noose Faust, where the plot of all the courts with very small steps. <br /> <br /> Reeves' defense, he was a good actor, he had no real fate in choosing any good films. They all liked it, but some of them did not see them reduce for the ongoing time of their film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image will keep you aloof. If you need sleeping and all other gentler mean fails only see it.
