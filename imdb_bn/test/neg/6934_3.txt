The movie gets 3 scores because it's brave to be very different. You can listen to their thoughts and desires when it features a Cast! It's really a weird film and an experience I do not forget. The only problem is that although the test is fun, usually quite dusty and incompatible in some ways. Actually, it's amazing that the film can be extraordinary for Narma Shery and Clark Gabelle! This image is based on Eugene O'Neil's play and it seems really tragic. In fact, it was good to have a stage production - it just did not translate to the big screen. <br /> <br /> So this film is hard cinemarias to die and those who love gay movies just to see all their movies!
