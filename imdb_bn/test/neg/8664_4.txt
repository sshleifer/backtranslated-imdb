Mansfield Park, in the second half, it's my favorite of Austen's novels and Fannie Price is my heroine's favorite, so I got saddened by the tragic fate that I had enjoyed in her big and small-screen presentations. The only good song I heard of that song was done on the radio of Amanda Root, who gave the same character as Ana in the film "Persuce": A strict, sure, sincere moral nuance. If the actress was small, she also did good visual casting. But Fannys, according to our eyes, corresponds similarly: Mary Crowford; Ruby schoolgirl girl; And (this avatar) an ambitious working, or perhaps Tart, pulled down a notch in his high moral principles. <br /> <br /> Well, I had good hopes, but there was bad fear. The serial had a hard Edmund, an actor who was the best choice and perfect, as completely hateful, Mrs. Norris; Otherwise it was down. The film, which was apparently called as a deconstruction or some other bad theater concept, came close as a mixed-up burlesque. After such frustration, and more recent frustrations of this production sister piece (new "subject" and "Northamerbee Abbey"), I could not help but could not achieve mixed hopes for it; And overall, it feels a little better settled settlement than me. It narrowens the intelligent novel and eventually leaves me with the same feeling, such as the comic-book version. On the other hand, most of the characters had to be reviewed without Crowfords, and it officially reducing or eliminating most of the book's most memorable items, including its most famous character and what should be ... <br /> <br /> The character is actress Annie Norris, always ready to handle what she wants to do, but always do her own job Ate for management; Here's the one that gets any ideas. And much more with him: his comments are spent on the Fannie, "... who and what you consider"; Sir Thomas discovers that he has forbidden the Fannis to set fire to his house all these years, and seeking forgiveness for him around him; Announces Vani's honesty, while going home, Annie Norris can manage the family better than her sisters for all her faults. But then, the whole journey is absent from the story, and most of what happened in the dramatic rehearsals, and most of those who disrespect Sir Thomas in return; And actually Sir Thomas himself, and his wife, are different from what they did. Above all, Crowford has suggested that Austen's most complex one is Fannie, it's easy to talk straightforward. It's missing from it, what Fanny's strong support he knows to be correct, and what he probably knows to be very true, Crrawford can throw against all distractions and on someone else's. To a male reader, now it is not less than writing, it expresses with disrespectfully - at any rate, as far as I know - what a woman is trying to deal with a fair but firmly with a person, because there is no reason to believe in disbelief. It's a brilliant scene, in the novel; This is just a view on TV. <br /> <br /> And, Fannie, Oh, Fannie: When do we see you?
