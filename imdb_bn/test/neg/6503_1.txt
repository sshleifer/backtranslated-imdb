ABC Gears its Repotriatory Company for another unreal representation of Grameen Australia. Yes, everyone is Baka Bourke (A little disgraceful actor Jeremy Sims) Fire Hero, Lil (Libby Tanner Bushwain Craig plays Bush), Fife (Nadia Townsend), whore of town, Bacha Bhai Joe (I think). Then there are aunt's springs Big Daddy, aunt Geoff. Aunt Geoff's scenes look like Tennessee Williams at speed As the loony missus of the only mercy saved Russian actress Natalia Novikova Baca. He is great. I do not understand why John Waters took Gigabyte as Lily's psychologist's husband. I hope the money will be needed! Still, Lil and Baqa will not last for a long time due to the closure of the Tuit Suite. Check out this lemon to see how much an awful show can be. Really, I'm ashamed.
