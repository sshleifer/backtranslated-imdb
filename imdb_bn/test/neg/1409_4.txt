I was aware of the critical pans and unsafe grows of Man of the Year, but I was ready to doubt the film because I know that good pictures can be read under the radar during the mass months of free mass months. <br /> <br /> What I get is that the movie is surprisingly obscure. An ambiguous consideration of gifts for Barry Levinson's gifts (Good Morning Vietnam and W. Wag the Dog) and Robin Williams for a clear comic gift for wonderful political adultery. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. The feature "Making of Off" comes with DVD, Barry Levinson, in a short time, talked about Robin Williams' closure of the script, as it had some naughty secrets. Um Are you really a moron, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for his joke power (Basically, each film is incomplete with an InSomiya or an hour's photo), do not have him in the script. Whatever the person wants, no matter how much he wants, it is more fun than anyone else can write for him, and his unexpected comic ransom can increase the bar of a middle film like RV or Patch Adams. I was more bothered about the failure to use Robin Williams In 1987, Levinson Good Morning used this exact formula in Vietnam, Robin Williams used the explosion of a satiric laugh in the film of war to create a lively politics. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is not so much like a smile that it can be and oddly lost in its voice. If the film has the ability to act as something, it can create a thriller from The Palicines Brief, The Fugitive or Jack Ryan, from the mid-'90s. At the center of a plot centered on an employee of Silicon Valley Company, it reveals an abomination in a system that reveals that the wrong President has been elected and trying to eradicate him before the secret secret decision of the CEO, so you have to give Robin Williams some Harrison-Ford- Type actors, or even Harrison Ford himself, a few more bis Phorana added, and the film is probably trying to go. I do not really know it and it's not valuable to try to find it.
