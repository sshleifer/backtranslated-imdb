I registered with IMDb.com so I can comment about this movie. My God was a steaming pile of horse crap! It should not be even touted as a real movie, it is very deceiver. This is the best 15-year film project. Acting terrible But even good actors can not save this. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who wrote this hell? And that the constant joke that is slowly coming from lesbian "teenage daughter" is getting old real fast. God would like to take a wet dump in my ears than I rather watch this camel again on a camel. Do not hire this movie. If they give you free movies, you will not see it. Destroy it with a hammer. Even if you break the video, you will lose your Hollywood video or blockbuster video account, but it will be good. It's a hatred. I said all I can about this without spare me. Any questions .... email me
