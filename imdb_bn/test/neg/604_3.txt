To add it briefly, this film was frustrating and could be summarized by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The act was sub-param, trisha, assassin and molly. The music was slightly wax but fits and special effects were too overused. Story / script writing was poor, unnecessary torture / romantic scenes dragged for a long way and very frustrating for the finish. <br /> <br /> The film's beginning gradually became imitated. Interest Trisha arrived at home, and there was a generation for a good story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This moment's mystery begins to develop the best feature of the movie, but then it's upsetting friends By doing so, all the possible mysteries of the movie / victims of horrific damage. <br /> <br /> The plot is blocked from here. Chemistry blends between two couples, and then takes off the killer Frank and another girl. This scene dragged and made unnecessary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not entertaining as it is done badly and it is more than shocks. The essence of this movie is the first thirty minutes of promise, but poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot destroy the image. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
