I've read reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I could see it. I am a big French lady and artist film lover, but I believe this is another case where critics create something "Ortie" or "intellectual" something. I'll be stupid: There is a scene of sexual disorder that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some major mental problems, but I do not really want to see them appear graphically. Film, originally, hateful. That is, when I saw Dream for for Dream, I was discontinued due to my last scene with Jennifer Connelly, but the hatred and reaction I saw during this movie was not close.
