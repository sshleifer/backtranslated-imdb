Looking at Man of the Year, a couple of my work told me that it was a beautiful movie and my mother said that she liked it, so I waited for the rent, and I saw it last night. I really want to say that this movie was frustrating. I just made it, because starting to be honest was good and very good, but then it became very dark and not in the movie shown from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama, that was not even interesting, considering how much we had such stories about government conspiracies. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with top prominent people and has a law where many want him to be involved in politics, because there seems to be a strong determination on how he should improve. So he did it, he run for the president, but many people suspect he is a comic, but he can win by winning! But Elenor Green ensures that all votes are considered for trying to correct computer errors, but when the government does not want to fix it, he tries to get rid of it, and Tom soon understands that this job can not be done <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting was good, the direction was right, only the story that did not work in my opinion. As I said, it has become a dramatic change in generation, because if you see the trailer you think it's a comedy, and when you start watching it you get it, but it's a very dark and somewhat scary drama. . I would not really recommend this movie, I was one of the biggest disappointments so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
