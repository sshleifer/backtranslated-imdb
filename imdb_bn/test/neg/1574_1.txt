There is no substance in this effort at a "thriller"! Some might say that this movie "Is It All There?" Autism, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, throat, murder, blood, graduation Nasaka revolver, frequent friction, boobs (can be used in various definitions), big flashlight, tribal people, Fool and dumber, "white wolf," Sleeping Dazzling, "Snow Mobile (s), a big tracked car, and under the wheels of a rocky scene under renewal Drama? All this, with an "Enyanesque" melody towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps my rating is a little rigorous, but one must surely have enough time during the movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Yeahz!
