It is no coincidence that the rating is rated as soon as the rating (5.8 times), but the film was absolutely terrible. The performance was not completely bad but it was really no point and the overall quality was poor. This is probably a B movie (or something like a C exists) and it seems like it was made on a weekend friend or something. I look forward to all that low budget movie and I usually see it across but this is really really bad. I mean "Fanglys" bad I do not know what else to say but trust it because I'm really sitting through this terrible horror film and I can save your efforts ... do not disturb. Seriously ... just not.
