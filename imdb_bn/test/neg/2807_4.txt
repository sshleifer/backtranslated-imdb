As mentioned before other comments, the main problem of the NVA is that it can not determine what it wants to be, the slapstick of the best or perfect parody in the Eastern German Army. Several moments are going on, for example, when an employer comes back with a completely broken personality from the White Jail. But ultimately, the Lander Houseman goes for children's humor. There is no doubt that the film was flopped at the German box office, because traditionally the training camp could be used to lie out of the real situation and unfortunately acting as an incomparable actor. <br /> <br /> Who works on the Frank Graham camera - always - does a wonderful job. If it was not for her beautiful pictures, I would make the movie worse.
