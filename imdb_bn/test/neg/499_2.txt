Simini has to accept the contribution of the movie. He has given us the most retained movie in history (the Hunter of Hirah) and the worst film in history (the Gate of Heaven). And before starting 'It's bad but not the worst' let me explain. <br /> <br /> I've heard critics for 20+ years and avoiding "Gates of Heaven" - it was not really difficult because you rarely have the chance to watch this movie. After a few days of watching 'Finale Cut: The Making and Unifying of Heaven's Gate', the documentary was a 9.99 DVD long version. After 229 minutes my suggestion is to find out the most negative reviews written about this movie (you will get a comprehensive selection), and imagine that critics are dedicated to Simmin's mother and she does everything she can to keep up the positive slant of her favorite son's movie. Then you have an idea of ​​how big a torch simino is. <br /> <br /> While this is a bit wrong with the picture, it is the shameful distortion of history that eventually gives tips on making the scale worse (and compared to a classic 'low zero' example). Although the organization of cattle organizations sent a group of regulators / gunmen in Johnson County and there was a list of targeted names, the actual incident of an interesting historical event was frustrating exaggerated. On 9 April, 189, Nick Ray and Nat Champion were surrounded and killed by an army of about 50 cattle, and Texas took off for guns to clean up the "militants" in Johnson County. Then the citizens of the country surrounded the regulator, who was eventually arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women did not actively participate in the war, and there were few casualties from Ray and Champion. Lastly, these were not the invasions of the siege and the immigrants did not have to travel around the circle around the rules (initially it was a filmmaker in the West and not the real technique of Indians). And a few weeks before the arrival of the regulators, Johnson County residents were executed without trial in several trials, Jim Aeverel, a common street farm keeper and his wife Ella Watson (who renewed Simineo as her two Lead and she even survived Avery) is a ripe Old age). <br /> <br /> There is no sin of making any film than a fantasy history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical events, then change the name and the location so that viewers can protect those uneducated audience members. Actually watched what a movie of faith. Thankfully, a small number of people saw this picture that the loss was the lowest. Perhaps it is hard to blame Simino for the distortion of history. He might possibly blame anyway with a frenzy defense-the film provides plenty of support. Simini was crazy during the production of the Gate of Heaven, but it would explain a lot of things. But instead of being mad, my vote goes from 'lack of talent' to reflection. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about the Gates of Heaven. Something of huge budget goes where you can actually see on the screen; Expensive set-beautiful epic camera shot-artistic dance sequence. Isabella Hupert (a strange casting choice that actually works) gives an acceptable and preferred performance, although most of its scenes are extremely annoying (the director forgets to give a reason for the audience to care for the characters). Conversation is usually simple but difficult. <br /> <br /> But with the background of this movie, the explosive sponsor does not fall into the conversation with the moment of relation to the consciousness of the character, such as communal activity. This means that the method of simony madness. Another word of 'projectmess', when a filmmaker is so lost in his project that a coherent story is not possible. The general fact is that Simino did not make any attempt to prove or control any organization's storyboard on any scene. It seems that he has kept his DP loose from the action action and is choosing 1.5 million footfree footage of colored shots. Then he successfully tried (later success) and fitted everything together in the post-product. <br /> <br /> The final battle scene is really delightful, because Babusa dressed in urban areas (probably laid out from the 'Feeder on the Rough' travel agency) regulates dozens of dynamite rods of regulators. Unfortunately each explosive just aims to explode and fallslessly bursts. 50-60 times you can show the relationship with this woman (who shows something from 'grapes of anger') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. After writing this picture, Simini's mother probably had it. <br /> <br /> So believe what you hear about this movie since 1980. It's a drunk, disconnected, poorly read, and historically distorted mess. The film is not an example of a filmmaking for the historians, and the value of the price is only as a source of inspiration for those who are wise about the true history of the American West.
