(This review will have some very clearly spoilers, so be careful.) <br /> <br /> A friend brought this on this, and before we decided it before, we made it through the 45 minutes of the movie that fast Farvard 8x speed was the only way The film should be seen. When I was watching the movie at a normal speed, I was going there, prepared a part of the lunch and came back, I could not find anything that really did not happen. Two lines of meaningless dialogue are exchanged. There was no background, no important facial gesture was created, but the mind was nothing but silence. <br /> <br /> This is not a thoughtful movie, especially when the plot of film tropes following the same basic Hollywood film. If I told you that Disney is making a film about 4 girls to start a band, and the singer is a French exchange student, would you expect to be "contradictory"? <br /> <br /> Do you have to panic on the stage? Does anyone have a vague crush? The band is late for their performance, and a side character has to buy their time <br /> <br /> * Speaker Alert * <br /> <br /> All these movies happen all this. <Br <br /> <br /> At this moment you have the least concern that these girls can not achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> * This part of the spinners ended * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Hacks, I also know about the collection of records and the bands that are going through MD, and I can sing Caro with the title track with friends. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie from Japan I've ever seen. Do not be confused. Although the characters will have points on the movie where they usually do Japanese high school things, but this is not "the normal day of life". It is "4 extremely random, heavy-conflict, and painful Japanese students a day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition, they care very little about subtitling the name of the subtitles in the subtitles, the "Parnum Moom" section is different from the "Parn Marum" menu in the selection menu. Anta Auditorium view, everything very visible Image / geological influence, but it seems to be the fault of the original film. <br /> <br /> 2/10, and see if you do not absolutely love paralyzed silence.
