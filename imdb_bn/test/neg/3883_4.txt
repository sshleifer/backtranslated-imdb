I saw this with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda, and Paresh Rawal, who are fantastic in their comedy, I really hope to be cheerful. Sadly, what I've got is not what I am. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of this movie allowed me to laugh loudly. There was a time when I circled one or two things, but nothing let me laugh. In short, it attempted curiosity, and in a similar way, the diamond ferry is somewhat frustrating. <br /> <br /> Among the three main sons, I think Paresh Rawal's role is the most powerful. It was not the biggest role, but it certainly stood higher than Govinda or Akshay. I suppose their performance is okay. Nothing special, only middle Govinda stole characters more than a few scenes. Lara Dutt and Tanushree Dutt acted in this film, and both were very bad. Lara's role has not moved me, or laughs me, and the character of Tansri Dutta falls on my nerves! It seems that this song is the only good thing to share. My favorite song follows "Tire Bin", "Afrin", which I really like. "Signal" and title song "Sharing Share" is worth listening. <br /> <br /> You do not like or do not like it. And judging by poor comedy and lack of direction, I do not have to make you
