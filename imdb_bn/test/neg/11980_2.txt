I play Farcry, a huge fan of the huge fan. It still holds a place in my top 10 game list all the time! The story line is fresh, fresh ... a really bright foundation for setting the foundation of a movie ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> No other managers are trying to make cash. A successful game franchisee (see Dun: The Movie, and much more ...). <br /> <br /> The video game starts with the player (Jack Carver) an unknown soldier by an RPG boat. Jack then found a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides his (Lady Friend) (Valerie Constantine) to the island, ships, jungle, installations and vulcanas in search of all the generals and genetically enhanced animals fighting against the accused super soldiers. <br /> <br /> The movie plays very differently: 1: Even before the 'boat leakage' scene there is a timeless 30 minutes of "backstory" (1/3 of the film). 2: Jack then walks on the beach, kills some, then drives ... ... nothing like playing ... 3: There is no other contact with the dialle ... 4: 'Corrected soldiers' single With albinos ... and no mutated 'monkeys' animals were jumping out of bushes. I enjoyed a part of the Faraki game ... 5: There is no beach scene filled with sun, no aircraft carrier, no contact stations in huge arches, no brief reference to any in-game material (characters / items / vehicles) actually following story lines No effort 6: The climatic vulcan scene from the game is replaced by the old art buildings. 7: Here is a last scene ... where everyone lives without happiness (without a cr√® ...)! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding the cost of this movie! If you are a gamer, you will hate this movie because of all your souls. This is clearly a men's film, so girls, stay away ... so you do not play Faraki at 12-29 years of age, do not hate the efforts of porting books / games near cinema. ... now it's for you ...
