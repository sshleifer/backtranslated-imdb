Like other users I got this cheap - I thought. 85 kroner (Â£ 8). Although the amount of money is not worth it, it is a total classic that I like like other users - when I was a child first and I was looking forward to seeing it again after 20 years. The story is amazingly thin (why it worked for kids), but all radio language and trucker components are made for it. It will look good on my DVD shelves to come.
