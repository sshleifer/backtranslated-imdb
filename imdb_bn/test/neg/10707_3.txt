With FBI on her, Madamara is looking for fresh meat and her creator is trying to recover her (in her own mind), she learns that violence is not limited to male species. <br /> <br /> All <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the closet hetero 'is geneticist.
