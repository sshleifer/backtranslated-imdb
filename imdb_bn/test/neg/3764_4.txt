Wow, this was a real stinker. This is not the primary science-it's nothing more than pure campus on Flickr. The dialogue has so much scientific mombo-jumbo which is ridiculous. The female character, directed by Oza Mason, is a conspiracy instrument to serve sexist comments throughout the length of the film for male characters. See this with your girlfriend, I guarantee that it will be warm in her blood. The only good thing is the musical score, which skillfully creates the mood of the movie. The special effect is not crude but rather the vintage wine in the movie is considered. Acting with some good B-stars in a limited role is not very bad. But they will be given a challenge to them given line. Challenge not smile on their heads.
