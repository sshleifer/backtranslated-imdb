I think this film can be called a misguided anger movie. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were adopting WWII generation who oppose the fight of their kids, taking medicines and listening rock and roll. But I think their real fury is that America started its long downfall from its height, which was given to her in this war. <br /> <br /> "Joe" himself is a little harassed Archi Bunker, always bored until he is grouped with hypocrisy, he survived the frustration, whoever spoils his daughter wants to take revenge on Hippi. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are silly, characters are worse than one dimensional, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle was able to do the best thing.
