I hired the DVD yesterday and it was a bad start, it's a 4: 3 aspect ratio, and it got worse, the acting is so bad and the film seems to be predictable to myself, I want to see the movie and said to me: What is going on and guess? OK ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action boxing movie do not see it, I will be frustrated in this low budget movie. Go and see Ali his way better!
