Positive: It is shot quite well. There are some interesting peripheral characters. Possible main character (though weak). <br /> <br /> Bad: Plot / Story Edit Character wasted. Jessica Albu <br /> <br /> I am a fan of sad movies, but this movie is harmful-badly bad. I do not understand that anyone could pay more than $ 12 million to this guy Jenkins. And before I go, I just want to say that I do not dislike Jessica Alba - I really wanted to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alley has made me sad because of her fake accent and her model. He was not present at any screen in this movie, and he destroyed the scenes he had in it. Not saying that romance is not credible (even a little bit) not stopped. <br /> <br /> I saw the actors leaking their birds across all sides, trying to get this thing under the ground with what they were given - but sadly, the movie was sinking. There is no mental connection, no mental conflict, and nothing is achieved. This is a beautiful empty movie.
