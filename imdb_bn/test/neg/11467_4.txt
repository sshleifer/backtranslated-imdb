I just went to see this movie with a friend. I looked quick and read a brief synopsis and thought it interesting to be interesting. If we like the movie, we definitely did not bring out the movies. <br /> <br /> The acting was good enough and the connection to the characters was correct. I've played a lot like Van Helsing. Yeah it was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> But the plot that I felt was used from other movies. The script was a little weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character tells "Oh my God" every time. <br /> <br /> The special effect has worked well, but (sorry for the spoiler) the main climax reminds me many boys out of the lord of the ring the main monster. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was just fine but I already felt like it has been done. Go and see all the way to buy but do not expect too much.
