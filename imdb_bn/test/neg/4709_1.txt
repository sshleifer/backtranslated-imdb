This stupid screenplay will be some kind of prosecution to punish the producer from funding. I think that criminal crime of bad movies can prevent this stupid more ruthless films. Make sure it has an interesting cast of characters, but I do not think that I have ever seen more cardboard performance than this whole cast such as this amazing vague piece piece These directors should not punish these people at least without any kind of performance. So the isolation is a theme, (no truth, they will hit you with this title), it does not mean that each character must read their lines as NPR. Was this film unclear? Finally, I'm not sure that there can be a person's memory with Terminal Bone Cancer, but I'm completely sure that if you die in the brain, then your cancer will grow steadily. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals, and unfortunate people. Oh, and to the end, the bombs were flown because they beat up their wings just like flying insects and raised enough. I despise people present in false knowledge as absolutely true. Do a little research before using an imbecilic mistaken concept as a premise for a complete freaking movie next time. Just believe in Christ!
