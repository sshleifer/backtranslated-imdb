What a reluctant hodge-podge It may be anything else but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or direction. A wife is made to be killed by her wife and her lover. The conspirators thought he was guilty and did a pretty good job. But Manchester United's record (Richard Thomas), whose mental records, called him "stable" and "strangers", managed to escape from the jail, beating him at the beach house of the conspirator, and secretly recorded a conversation between them that they expressed their crimes. Then, he reduced the tape recorder with all the proofs in the water of the sea, but it managed to regain it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> Location shooting is impressive. On the Cape Fear Peninsula, the beach room is nothing more than a wooden part of the Fort Fisher Battalfield ground. After production, the house was broken immediately. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it is a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot each scene across the expanded pantihuz on the camera lens. It's all too vague. And for all the natural beauty of the position, the viewer does not have any real idea about what the sand feels like, like a gray salon texture on fixed green leafy vegetables. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is a lot of work to do with actors. The best performance, in most cases, is given as Dick Olsen, a sleazy but helpless defense lawyer. Virginia Madison radiates betrayal with every beat of her eye lashes. Ted McGinley in its range as an immoral weakness. <br /> <br /> Music score is mixed with obvious mysterious evil mix and effective. If you want to hear the original, from which it has exploded, rent a hiccup "Vertigo" and listen to the suspicious theme of Bernard Herman. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any special reasons to catch it.
