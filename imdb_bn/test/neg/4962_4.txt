I am a German student so sorry for the mistakes in the end. (I'm working on it)) <br /> <br /> The style is very interesting transformed and plays with dramatic effect of the plays, in no way deletion from activated platitudinus action, terrible bad actor (expression of disrespect and unprofessional step and feeling) and so is relatively The weird and intelligent story makes less good. In this case only ordinary slasher-style with very strange action. Many by dramas partially destroy the original story and end the audience in the dark, creates curiosity and makes sense of actions wonderful. Definitely it's a hit for slashher-fans but not for me. But even though the cinematography's attractive style and light illumination are good to use. <br /> <br /> Not so good ...
