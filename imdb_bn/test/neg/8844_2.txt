I saw this movie and it was a sleepy one. Sometimes I can get intellectual romantic movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt almost like an hour long too. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculpture, which just lost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and nightmares. If you like tragedy, you might be like this. I thought it was too long, which means it is a lot of unnecessary scenes, which eventually leads to an hour of annoyance. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy see Titanic.
