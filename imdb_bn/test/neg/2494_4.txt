Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barcli watched it as a scene during his take on Holdd, but the film is easy to see. (A repeat of Star Trek character played by Barclay Duitt Slatez.) <br /> <br /> Dave Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is written weakly, so we do not see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow, two dimensional image from a soap opera. Paul Newman also misconstrued as Leslie Groves, but the problem of this film goes out of the wrong performer of the wrong actors. <br /> <br /> The incidental errors and great freedoms have been accepted (with the ordering of events), in advance, the political agenda of screenwriter Bruce Robinson is embarrassing to watch this movie. Perhaps this movie has found a house in the so-called history channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" should not be seen by printed high school or college students who do not know anything about the Manhattan project, making a film with bad science, bad history, bad screenplay and middle acting. .
