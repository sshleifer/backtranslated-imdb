When you read the comment on this movie, then it is based on real facts, smart and funny political comedy - here is the only true word it is a comedy. If you call it an internal movie about Russian politics - it's not. During this election campaign, maybe 2% in the movie from what happened in Russia. It was thousands of interesting to follow the reality of 1996 and it was a real ridiculous election campaign. Well, Yelsein's staff was a PR-adviser in the United States, but their role was only short. The whole campaign was completely different from what was shown in the film, it would show all the fun people who are walking street streets all over the country on the street street streets, and providing shows to support celebrities in place of Yelcin - at least that will be true. Because of my respect for Jeff Goldlum, Antony La Paglia and Lieu Serenb, I gave it three. And about Moscow street machine guns. I was living in a place where there was the highest crime in Russia in the mid-90s and a gunman did not see a man in the street.
