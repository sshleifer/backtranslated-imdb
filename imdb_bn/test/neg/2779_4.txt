First off I'm in my mid 40's. I was a child watchin horrible films so I have seen so many different IMO, these are not as bad as countless people given to numbers 1 or 2 <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a low budget horoscope. Dialogues are soso and moderate, tolerant, sometimes. This film is actually quite well on the plotwise basis. For those who are old enough or lucky enough to look after them in DVD. This week is like a 1970s movie too. Just add big blood and minor gore, little T & A and oath. This is a T Instead, I want to see it without Jason v. Godzilla or any other series. Not good, Evil Dead was a low budget film. At least these guys try to give credit. This can be a fantastic good flick with the Acouple Mill budget. My score is a watchable 4.
