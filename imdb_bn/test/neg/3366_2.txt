Why would I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) Jack Frost 2: Recover the Montant Killer Suite ??? Maybe it was a crack in temporary emotional nuisance? But I guess it's because I first enjoyed Jack Frost. It was a stupid but fun horror-comedy that had some good effect by Mad George's screening. This man had excellent pictures of this person impaled by giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with his blood and all) on the back cover of this serial. So I thought: if it is stupid like the first and it has some nice splatter / gore it should be fun? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> At first I say that the movie is worth getting some credit for having a very insane and crude plot. I mean, mutant killer Snowman is a tropical island that spells the snowfall of the mutant killer child, which can only be killed or damaged by banana ??? As much as I love premier, I really hate the movie. First of all: When the first Jack Frost looks like a real movie (seems to be shooting in real movies and everyone is shot), then this sequoale has a third-third soap-opera appearance and feel. It has a very sticky shot-on-video look in this way. The light is just awesome awful (bright white spots for the appearance of the day, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). Acting ... does not go well there. Dialogues range from rigid to extreme (which is the only Jamaican people were mortal, after every sentence "man"). And when it comes to the voice of the murderer's voice, then I could remember that the child had six-fold chalkki from the play, before he could kill someone before he could talk to the mobile phone. <br /> <br /> One of the best jokes was asking, "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene is undoubtedly that the beautiful Asian chick came out of there and swimming in the pool was completely naked (thanks to God for that!). Oh, yes, and on the small ship, I was badly caught in that little scene on the last achievement with two Japanese friends. But the worst thing about this movie is: cows and explosions because everyone is talking? There were plenty of shows to show some decent poor killings. Many people here have been killed in the main way, but all off-screen As I read many other comments, there was a head blast, a leaky body, an outbreak of the eye bug, the tongue ran out really nice ... but at the moment the editor cut some blood splatters at the floor or nothing. The shot of the British man (the DVD's back cover) was stolen, even in movies. I only saw that particular murder pictured from behind (meaning I did not hear sh!). I was waiting for this event throughout the movie, and then did not see anything?! What a down down! Did I see the movie cut version? It would be embarrassing, 'If you ask me, only a great amount of Split can save this movie. Many killer snobs have been reduced to bloody decorations, not cut for me. Talking to those snowballs: They are working very weakly. They make look like MUNCHIES 'weird' animatronics'. But I guess it was the whole point. At some point, the special impact crew even turned some ridiculous bad CGI. Boy, you really have to believe it. The best is not to see it, in fact, 'this flick is very bad because (well, I smile with it, because it gets worse). Just stay with the first Jack Frost (1996) and you're okay (okay remember that this is a pretty intelligent horror-comedy but it's fun in your own right). It's funny, but the writer / director Michael Cooney will somehow realize that he was a pretty bad manager after Jack FROST 2, and then focused on writing. Then he wrote two superb well thriller screenplays for I Indade (acting Ryan Phillippe) and Identity (John Cusack acting). So the guy seems to have some talent after all. <br /> <br /> Now it will be very easy to make the lowest rating of Jack Forrest 2. So I say that a nude Asian babe is a point for dipping skinny and doing a point for children who are completely disabled children snowball. Mr. Koni is going to go!
