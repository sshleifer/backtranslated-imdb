I'm just filling this comment because I could not fix the issue that a positive comment was featured on the "Positive Information" page. I really think this country would be my worst movie. This is not only because of the terrible plot, English and a tension-curve that is flat like our country. No, because it was a serious effort to create a good action film, supporting the value of Hollywood. It was the "European Action Movie of the Year". For this purpose, they hired academy award winning photo "Caracert" actor Fajda Van Huyt to get jobs. I do not think of bad movies, even if they are ill-tech B-movies, then I can enjoy them too. But I can not tolerate movies that are terrible, but supposed to be a type movie.
