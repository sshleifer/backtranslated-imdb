You can only describe this with a word and that will be WOW !!! Wow, I do not really think the pieces of shit like this would ever be released. If you see a movie called Nija, you will see at least some cool martial artists, right? However, none of them know any martial arts and it seems they went to China and they saw the first man on the street and trained martial arts for a day, that's their martial arts skill level! The way the actors are overacting, special effects are ridiculous and have no idea that no ideas. It's the worst martial arts movie I've seen and I've seen lots!
