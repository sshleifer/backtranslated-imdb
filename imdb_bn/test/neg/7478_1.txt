For a while when I was in the job, I had the habit of showing all night talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Canaan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimel ... <br /> <br /> I reached up to 1:30 minutes. Conference and XFile Time, SciFi. And at that time the only show was (and curiously still) Karson Dal. <br /> <br /> His program first plotted to me. Young, unexpectedly equipped, and with the hip padzie of the MTV host, I thought that Carson would bring little aesthetics on the night of night. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no ridiculous time for him. Her trick is definitely curious, and her self-consciousness is a painful thing to babbling self. I started to think that he was not only able to supply comedy (and I'm fine, he was not), but over time it became clear that the author's show was for him. The writing was stupid and too much overreaching and skits were screamingly bad. At the end of the studio, at the end of the studio, the author drank Karson drunk each and every mourner, through an interview, he was a blurred curse proud of the cheeks proud of the deviated cheek. <br /> <br> Zero interview skills. None. She tries to be friendly / chatty, but end up being stupid and rude. He talked too much. He cut off his guests. He asks them the annoying or shameful questions - if he can find out what questions they ask. And since someone has already mentioned, the guests are literally looking at him or their seats are clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show has left the studio and is seeing it shot in a camera. Even now, Carson refuses to indicate the NBC. At one stage, even the cameraman did not get the man, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... the handwriting on all the walls. <br /> <br /> I see Carson has created this show. I can only imagine that it is still in the air, he gives it for himself.
