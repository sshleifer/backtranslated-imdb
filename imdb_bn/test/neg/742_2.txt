I do not like this adaptation. I'm scared. When I started to see it, there was a strange feeling of watching 70 TV series due to filters and musical scores. I did not like the last scene. Mr. Tilani only dressed in his waist. Jane Austen will not ride a Gentleman without a splendor coat. It seems that the producers have interpreted a modern mistake of the romantic girl's dream. I appreciate more of the modern JA adaptation, which shows a look for these details, which makes this so much suitable for the BBC series. Sorry, I'm waiting for 2007 adaptation. Hopefully, and Jane Austen's 20-year benefits will show.
