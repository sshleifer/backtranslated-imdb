I was really frustrated with this movie. I've heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed it in the theater. As a result, I was really excited when I came to the DVD. I thought it was going to be a high-end horror movie with a horror film, but instead it was a snap-proof predictable film. The finish was completely frustrating after dragging it and pulling it without any climax and the people who tried and fled. I gave two stars to this movie for one reason. This is not your ideal horror film, which slashes a bunch of deaths to a central bad guy. The story makes this movie unique and offers a change for people watching many horror movies. Although I do not like this movie, I recommend that all the horror fans see it at least once. You might like it surprisingly. For this horrible fan, what I can say is that I hope this forgotten movie does not have a signal.
