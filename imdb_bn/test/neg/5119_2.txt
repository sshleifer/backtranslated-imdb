After watching this movie, I felt like I just ate chicken box, chewing cracker jack just could not find a reward inside. The movie has the true promise: Skunkmax features pornographic star! Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the producer that we like T & A at our T & A Flick !!! Sure, we get a few quick flash and a few "breezes in the currents" scene. But where is the gender? How do you make four girls, "sorority girls" less, this kind of movie can be the only one, compassionate 5 second lesbian scene? Good night, America offers more headlines all over! See, we do not see such movies for great cinematography, screenplay or action. We want to see some kinks! What a deviation
