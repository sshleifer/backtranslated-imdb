Giant Cloos, has always been in fierce competition with movies such as 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 Outper Space' for the worst movie. In this completely unconscious movie, a phony looking demon golfer 'Lionel Train'. The script is so bad that every letter is ridiculous to each other. "This came from Hollywood," this movie was not a major goal in this film, where this jewel creeps to the line 'A bird as Big B as A battleship' with stylish, endless needling. The line pops up unknowingly through the film, so it can not escape. From the beginning of the 50's there are several shots from '200 000 Fathoms and' Flying Soccer 'among other Saifai films. At one stage, big cattle is responsible for some death, so the military keeps the whole world under martial law and someone is allowed to go outside of their home. Of course, the huge buzzard is mainly related to this classic, Jeff Morrow and Marc Corday stars, where they may follow. Yet the director is so long that he did not provide some nice shirts with beautiful dresses and black holes to get some relief from this Zero Star Thriller's Tidium. This mistake has been a second time. In 'Tarantula', the dead cord revolves around hot clothes for the whole film, but the whole 'The Giant Scorpion' goes to the pants. The budget for this movie was not more than thirty or thirty thousand dollars and I suspect that the Morro or Cord has got more than three thousand to build it. It seems that the whole thing was shot outside of someone's garage.
