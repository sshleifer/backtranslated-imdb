I totally agree with the previous critics. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hoodie Lammer, and the film focuses on their relationship. Hadi Lamarr is not his best, and Spencer is loving and loving both Tracy seems naive, easy and overly-optimistic; An idealist role that has played the best in 'Boys Town'. If you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by train station ... wow ... it's not a crystal and cast cast. None of the parts played the best. Miscast and hesitant The story is empty and different and disenfranchised inputs are clear. Hudi Lamarr is absolutely stunning, which is really the best part of the film. Spencer Tracy does not match the beauty of his looks and dresses, and at least that is why the film does not seem credible.
