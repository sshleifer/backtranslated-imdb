I almost fall asleep during this screening. A boring story that seems to go forever, follows a few days in the life of a male prostitution, which falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, this technique gives a long letter, explaining why they can not stay together and explain how to go their separate ways. <br /> <br /> Male prostitution is then trying to find the downward self-destructive spiral of a "true love", to return to the same place repeatedly, they wanted to find more frequently or signs where they could find her love. In this, she hooked up with a ugly person (who I thought was the prostitute of men), a gay bush, and a man who was "three-second sexual relationship" with her, behind him. <br /> <br /> It never ends that made me wonder how random sex acts like a visible scene in a few seconds of the movie, for example in this case where this trick loses before poking her pants three times and feels the orgasm in a miraculous way. Does it! <br /> <br /> Because of these random face-to-face conflicts, sexual partners are called to call them, for which they can cancel their telephone number. <br /> <br /> The main character of a short side plot looks at her busy mom who has no time for her lifestyle. There is another side-plot that looks like a young woman with some random conversations, who saw her standing in the bridge several times from her window. And there is also a small known plot that shows a letter to a male contact, but the audience is not advised to relate it to this person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just show us these young people really lost and confused. He seems like living a life like Scratch. There was a good scene in the whole film that involved him in a yacht sale and was involved in finding a special record with the world's most tragic song. <br /> <br /> This movie is going on forever. Black and white, it may seem like a dream, but sitting in the theater for about two hours will see something like a nightmare like this drill! <br /> <br /> I thought I was completely confused by the fact that the young man died and went to heaven? Both the audience and the main character had to end this miserable trope that would have to endure a wonderful salary to end the lapse. But it is seen as an "independent film", as the last movies like this are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> There are only short scenes for those who are looking for you nude, and most of them are portrayed in such a way that they are hidden in any direction shades. In other words, do not waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 of 10
