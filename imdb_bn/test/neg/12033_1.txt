First of all, let me start by thinking that this film is very interesting: A serial killer, Edgar Allan Poe (which is a writer of all my writers) copies the works. Cool, right? Yes, of course not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. And that's not an excessive. I've seen many, very bad movies. This takes one cake. And I even got ready for a bad movie even before going there. Perhaps the author should study some law enforcement methods: If you have a murderer's name, his entire life history, a criminal record, and his address, the first place where you should look? Hmm . . Probably. . . His house What ?! No! This is a great idea, Anthony! How can you suggest some of the obvious and level-head instead of going into the bowling alley? * The end of the spoilers * Verily, writing is good but never bad, or vice versa if I can ever forgive a movie. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sit down and look around the potential crime scene supposed to be a serial killer. You sound good? " Moronic Female FBI Agent: "Yes, I seem to be okay. Go ahead. Do not forget to check at least measurements I do not focus on." Black FBI agent: "Excellent, what I do!" In fact, if you want to be a law enforcement, rent this movie so that you can learn how you can not work. . . Or if you are a man and want to learn the same <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Just half-point for a film production and in stores. Congratulations <br /> <br /> -AP3-
