I have seen many movies for years and I am a big fan of comedians. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost diminished me in tears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I could come back, then I would like to. I'll be sad as long as I live, I was wasting it and seeing it. <br /> <br /> The story is so insane! It just makes no sense and leaves you confused. The Scottish crowd and a German head hunter who is Pastor Vergas (John Liguizamo) of Pasteuria, after Scottish $ $ 50,000 in the crowd and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many take the form of disguise. But while doing this we hear most annoying, worst, psychological acting, conversation and film history. This movie has provoked me so much; In the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I was wasting a lot of time watching a movie that certainly undoubtedly could commit suicide. I mean, how can I get permission to create such movies when I can expect? <br /> <br /> I know people keep their opinions, but the most frustrating thing about pest is that people really like it. Why? What's funny about a man boring from the beginning to the end? A man that can not work? Who has a boring voice and confusing face? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie would be even better, of course it would be. It did not. Generally, you want to survive the good guy, but I wanted to find and kill the German or Scottish people for pests, to bring me out of my grief. There is nothing funny or funny in this movie that it is simply annoying and confusing. Curiosity is called before they die. I am sorry for the cameraman, which is not a statement of the film that is made, but in reality this drill must be made in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watching this movie again! <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll hate more than that.
