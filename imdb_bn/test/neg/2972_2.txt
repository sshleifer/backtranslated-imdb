Hollywood has been a lot of weird movies for years, but someone unfamiliar with this. Why this movie was created, I would never know and how did the Paramount sell in 1947 a ticket? It's a weird mix of long-standing styles, it's a film that does not really know it to be a serious war drama or a Vietnam operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British intelligence trying to get a toxic gas source out of Germany just before the start of WWII. Ray Millland, a fine actor, plays like a partner fleeing Monty Python, all exaggerated English pre-school dialogue In Germany, he met a Gypsy, Marlin Dietrich, who helped him to cover the cover, of course, another Gypsy. He plays his part in the film's other "Gypsy", just like the General Vienna Opereta Gypsy Character. But there is no Nazi who is not funny. And then Milland begins to feel like a Gypsy, and it is not regarded as a joke. Sometimes for a light comedy of music, sometimes for a drama. Every time Nazi shows, the score of the film plays Wagner, which itself is fun. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a comedy, or it has taken seriously the suffering of the GPC and how serious it is to show Nazis their treatment. Both are indicated at this movie, but do not follow. What we have left is a real strange mascara of the generals, which should embarrass everyone (without the director). <br /> <br /> Seamless.
