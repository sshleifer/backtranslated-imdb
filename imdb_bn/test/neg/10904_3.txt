Only if he did not want to clich√©, but Shivan could actually make a good film from this story. It was quite different to maintain your interest, so as long as the energy and money spent on this stinger, we could have done something better instead of eye-rolling. <br /> <br /> Production-wise, it is really good to expect from the handheld Camcoder, so he gets a good sign. Considering what actresses should work with, actually the actress was not that bad actually written script. <br /> <br /> I thought the days were long when we would see someone, they wanted to work relentlessly to find a radio transceiver, start each hole from the end to the end of the first one, press 6 or 7 times above it and Then hope it works. These stories are destroyed by a series strings of silly moves by all the characters without bad guy. Although we all are very shallow to understand the devices of the plot, so they are all spoon-feeding to us to ensure it to us. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you, but that does not work on me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only next time, with a proper script; Then he could give us something valuable
