How did David Linch do this? Dark-black-framed glasses and fascinating film critics are like their favorite logo, I do not see how this guy is paying for such travel. How could Lynch be gathered from a failed television pilot into a blurred, weak-acting world with a sultry footstool and the critics are annoyed about it and are actually included in the year's best list? <br /> <br /> I'm bored. If you are looking for a good movie quote, instead of "dam" rent. If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie try "Memento". But if you do not throw the idea of ​​this fun night over 2 1/2 hours of your life and 3.50 dollars of your hard-earned cash, beware of this extra-publicized stinger.
