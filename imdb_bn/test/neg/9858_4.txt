When he puffed up before the match and he lost, he did not like it. In 80 seconds I think playing chess against the computer and it was not very difficult to win. When the time is gone, I start losing and do not like. Today, I just do not play against the computer because they are very good. Not only that, games are frustrating and lack of human game appeal, where both sides can open the game for the possibility of going wrong and exciting possibilities. This documentary shows our Turkish images which is an ancient chess, an automated chess game that was itself controlled by humans. From the beginning to the beginning we believe that IBM has literally hidden a human GM behind their light-sized computer. I'm a computer scientist and I think IBM must have cheated due to losing Gary. I know how computer chess will play. It's not magic and it's no mystery. They can be trained, have a lot of chess knowledge, and they can see unprecedented detail and possibilities than humans. It's really no surprise that Deep Blue won. It was probably at times. If it happened today, the machine's growing processing power; People will be less shining. If today's machine is not able to draw at least GM, then people would think that the program was weak.
