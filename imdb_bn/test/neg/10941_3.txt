Oh my good luck I never thought that it might look more horrible for me than a domestic crisis, but here it is. Incognito plot, terrible editing, steely acting and headache-trend 'style' (sorry, I do not have any other words for it), a movie that is often a movie that forces you to re-evaluate the whole style; That is, the film is so bad that I think the thrillers are a little better by condemning the complete failure. <br /> <br /> Now, Santimo is not only a terrible movie in itself, it is also successful in tough work ripping off good movies and doing a generous work with it. Direct from the original title - There is nothing more than an intelligent effort to reproduce those who are from Se7en - I reminded that it did not smell something properly. As soon as the movie starts with a series, as well as filled with hip-hip-kapatic images and bombs, I knew where that smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two policemen, or police police Jim Reinert (Michael Pare) and police female Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating the murder of Vancouver. A serial killer, known as his "monkey killer" (his teenager, cool nick name, oh?) Killed many people for his way of working. You see, this almond apparently works by following the principle of "see no evil, no evil do not hear, no evil talk" and cutting eyes, ears, and tongues from his victim. So far, six eyes, six ears, and three languages. In a very fascinating fashion, Renéré and Smith knew that monkey killings are probably going to kill the other three ... because he probably wants to complete the 666 number. So suddenly this image is with Tom Jerik (Caspar Van Dien), a young, successful, handsome businessman, with a terrific mood. And there's American Psycho's Rip of Kick. <br /> <br /> So we follow the lives of two police officers and young psychopaths, of which at least no one is appealing until we meet at least. In addition to that, the disco where the renderer rarely misses Garrick, officially gives the most interesting scenes of our recent memory: Renault Disco goes behind the club because ... Ok, because the script tells us that it is a suspect place; Then, with a single stomach of the stomach, Rennard saves a big defensive force that blocks the path, and the guard is never heard again? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the fashion at the General Basic Institute, Smith received some dates with a young businessman, his idea According to he can discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end, but it is very easy, shameful; There is conflict, some holes of plot, problems can not be solved, and especially in the last scene where a cruel genocide, which is thought to be frustrating and tragic, this ridiculous oversone and uncomfortable seems to be that I can not tell the truth how anyone laughs Can not <br /> <br /> In the 87th minute, the pantomime is really pushing it. You do not care about almost single characters, because they are all flat (not to mention boring) because you know you'll meet them for the first time. The scene is connected through weak plot plates when you are never pulled into the story, because of the reasonably unnecessary and out of place. The performances start from the average (Van Diane) to the worst (Rubin and most supporting cast); Music Unreal Generic Techno, and Photography is the worst one I ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco in this genre, we have some unrealistic nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
