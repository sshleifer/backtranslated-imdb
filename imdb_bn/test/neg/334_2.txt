I did not really want to write a strict review of this movie because I really appreciate that it is difficult to make a film incredibly low budget, try to do something ambitious just like science. <br /> <br /> But this movie is really awful. This act is one of the worst and sometimes serious budget allegations, which is a serious serious allegation. If the film is based on believing and what the director is trying to achieve, then there is a lot of aspiring actor in the delayed financing project. I'm sure the actors did their best work as everyone involved in this product, but it was not good enough to just stop this level. <br /> <br /> Then there is dialogue Really very poor There is no excuse for that. I got the impression of writing immediately behind a beer mat after some epic Boozing session. I do not hesitate to use the word 'ridiculous' but this is what the script is like. I had no sympathy with any characters. In fact, they imposed on me that I wanted to snatch some of them on several occasions. Mr. Steatron has played a lot of role in making himself more prominent. Clint Eastwood is not he. Again, there are talented people who are willing to work for the delay if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Many of the special effects of this movie were made. For the money, they are somewhat overused, exceptional. Some people say, "I have the effect and the boy I will use it". Anyone who did the CGI work was among the most gifted. <br /> <br /> The film was not easy to find as an aspiring movie, just like this attempt. Kudos to try it, but unfortunately it fails to reach its title goal in many ways. <br /> <br /> I salute everyone involved in his production, I really, but for their next efforts they would get a better producer or something more manageable for them to be more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion I can recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic students of film or habitable insomniacs. If you want to see the true masterpiece of a low-budget Saif-fay movie, try creating a specific "Mr. Star" of Mr. John Carpenter of the student.
