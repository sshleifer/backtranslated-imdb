I love basketball and it looks like a playful movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it was frustrating. It was bad acting and very slow. Above it, it was very racist, sexist, antitemic and homophobic. Sometimes there is a point of putting in ethnic, ethnic and other types of slurs, illustrating existing enthusiasm. There was no issue of terrible superstition in this film and no one has learned from what is being said. The part of the problem is that it is a game and a remake of the 1982 film that tackled a basketball team in the 1950s. A little more knowledge was gained because of this place already taken place. It did better translation with modern times and writing was terrible. I do not know how it was originally written, but I can not believe that it was a movie bad and disgusting as it was made in television and video in 1999. It was hateful. Do not waste your precious time on this one.
