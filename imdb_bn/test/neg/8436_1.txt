One of my greatest lessons for watching movies was this: <br /> <br /> I used to work at the Roger Crimson Office, as before and afterwards, I worked like many vansinis, I was international how it all works and how essential to myself Make out (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Karamen, Roger Karamen's wife and a producer asked me to load a tape in his own possession. I'm not sure why I wanted to see it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show relay, something like that, some sort of calling card. He was looking for any reason, at that time the only free video machine in the office was in the house I was working on and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the tape <br /> <br /> Fading In: A picture camera sitting on the screen facing a screen. On his back, the screen left, there was a door open in the room. There was a coat rack against the wall away. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the man of the desk, returned to the round to answer (it's all one, static camera, no pants or dolly shots, only the camera is turned off). The second character coat rack fitting his coat and distributes his next line. Julie Corman said, "I've seen enough." And left the room. <br /> <br /> What he saw in the ten-second footage saw that the director was a fool. Those who immediately open with two characters immediately return to their back line providing the camera line? Neither sorry Next! How long have you got Ten seconds It gets up in the starting shot and you die. <br /> <br /> I reminded the moment when I was looking at opening this piece. After the prolonged long journey of the jungle, we apparently dropped several monkeys in the cage. A man carrying a gun smiles. Land a fishing boat and we see the whole-way taxi in the terminal. God is boring! Cut inside the airport Two men meet Ah! Something is happening! They shake hands Cut two men in a different corner - <br /> <br /> - And the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie which have any kind of local relation with each other and the guy has cocked up. 'Note Crossing Line' is one of the basic rules of movie grammar that jumps from side to side on the viewer's screen and delivers the viewers. The audience does not want to be confused. Mystified? Dangerous? Confused and trick? Yes All who listen to the audience Confused? No You loose them. They walk One of the pounds that they give you in the movie 'Line No Crossing' movie. This is the basic element. This is not an inefficient rule (no inefficient rule), the director always breaks it - but not the first real cut of the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I've seen enough". And switch off.
