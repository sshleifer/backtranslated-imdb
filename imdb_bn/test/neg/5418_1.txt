In the 90's I saw the worst movie. I will often use it as a benchmark while watching other movies; "At least it was not as bad as anyone's diary." Three absolutely uninterrupted segments, featuring all the players playing themselves - and he's not that interesting. This is a complete segment of doctors about hypochondriac going on. The other person who surrounds the countryside of his scooter features him. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen abusers. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Prompt me to go home and rediscover that incredible album. What you can say about the director / actor / colonialist is that he has a great taste in music.
