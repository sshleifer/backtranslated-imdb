This will be the greatest real trick ever. I am surprised that all the other actors kept the direct face. I could be wrong, but the impression I received from this movie was that they blamed Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez for acting in this movie, which cost just $ 40, based on what cost Narrot Bats and Spray Paint Catcher equipment cost. There are. The most supporting movie ever made, and Joast Estevez and Frank Stallone did not bring this joke, came back and laughed and laughed. <br /> <br /> If they do not have fun, they try to make legitimate films but I am sorry for all those involved in the creation. I have a lot of love with Chess movies, but this movie is so bad I can see it very rarely. They repeat the non-specific "special effects" many times that they are clearly trying to cover the events that they shot only 30 minutes of footage. If I am forced to repeat this movie, then I will make myself unconscious by almost half an hour later. Great Frank Stallone is not a crime, but I want to read Songstreet Fingerparting class for 10 hours in order to see the movie again.
