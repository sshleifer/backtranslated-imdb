I initially thought this little imagination would be a little entertaining to travel. I was roasted. <br /> <br /> A good throw (Roy Schieder as the president) did not help it. Terror was the worst possible scenario in every potential possible nuclear disaster that could happen. And none of which can be possible! <br /> <br /> The president's abduction can be done only with the internal help of the traitor of the secret secret service (Al Air Force One), but if everything that football and our helplessness reflects is that the country falls into enemy hands, then Ridiculous for nd degree Seriously, even the President can ride fully the control of our missile. The case is used only on order relay. In this situation, our system will completely delete the code and the whole thing will go anywhere. Beijing can not be destroyed - missiles were not launched because silo-crews were not ordered (communications include strict measures). There are many safeguards to prevent such things happen. <br /> <br /> In fact, film-like failure-safe and secure, gave some credibility to the idea of ​​losing control over our system. But this film goes far too far and incredible my view has failed to postpone. And that experience makes visitors a waste of time. This photo is a failure.
