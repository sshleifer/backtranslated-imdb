There are only two reasons I see this show ... I've already invested time between the previous episode and the Corn Tigers. For all the fans who love the new BSG, please stop me! Go to the real metropolis to read some classic psy fiction novels or watch a few days of milestone films and TV shows and you will see what the boss writer hacks do. Their only gammick "who is the fifth cylinder" Poor writing and really, no ideas of character development really. If Adam resigns or tries to take power or cries or invents the inner father, he will have to be once more ... Ah! And Roslin is a character that has ever been kept in a starships. Ride with her out. I could take care less if they were six months ago before concluding. This wannabe writer was one trick out of season. If you do not know, you just do not know how to write.
