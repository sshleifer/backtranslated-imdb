7+ to the most racist and decorated cartoons for children. Those who see this cartoon will probably try to dress, talk and act like a dress. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for this terrible program to agree with the wind. The Wain brothers might well be in the movie meant for young adult viewers. They should be in movies and will not create any episodes for this cartoon. Generally young celebrities start working in movies and voice over-over for cartoons, and then they grow old, they come to programs for young adults. A good example is Nick Canon. He began with the first being in All-Chat, and later starred in MIB 2, then drumming and presenting his TV show Nick Canon: Wild 'N Out, where the comedians compete with telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally meant for Thugabui, but I wanted to show how I watched celebrity kids on TV, for example, who may be involved in child-friendly programs long ago. It happened that very sad, but all the celebrities change and become big. It's just the opposite of the new cartoon of Waiwan Brothers. It is bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people from Ghetto, with the young generation this program, with the clock it will convert the kids with the possibilities to not just create a chance to get a better life. My belief about what we would like to see in our cartoons and my beliefs about this cartoon.
