After looking for this brusplotation for several months, and then accidentally bought it cheap, it was frustrating. I heard it on the DVD site, and it seems crazy. <br /> <br /> No, what I found was a very bad martial arts movie. Kung Fu-ying was not very bad, but the rest of the film was quite horrific and the film seems to be true, it's really long, it's 85 minutes of runtime. <br /> <br /> A positive note, Ep was fun for a few seconds (especially when I think they've closed each other from other movies), and the black guy who used to walk half way was fun because of one line. , <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ,
