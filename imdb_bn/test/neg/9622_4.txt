I'm trying to understand what I like about MirrorMask. I am a warm film producer and hobbyist film maker. I used to tell friends during my lunch, Mirrmazak, the best film of my year could be a cause for disappointment. Like the little Mungalall, the film has missed its mark. During the movie several times it makes humor. It set you up for the laugh Instead of laughing at you, it makes you feel empty. Jokes reminds one of the recent Star Wars film. They were not funny until you were five years old. And the acting felt the same terrible. I've actually starred in acting in front of a blue screen. And I believe it. But not in this picture. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This image takes a form and tries to apply it with beautiful artwork ?? And although the script is fully effective and special effects are pretty good, there is no heart in it and unfortunately fails. I consider vibrating film theater to leave my head and leave the theater. I felt holy and sad and still not gotten the yeast taste from my mouth. I love independent films. I encourage people to see independent films to support them. But this is not the image. This image should not be created. At least, this is not like this. Why did the director miss such a clear sign? They were clearly setup ?? Not just the humor. But emotions Drama Even the line is delivered worse times and. It was like four film instead of walking on three legs. Her move is odd and miss time. And could it fall on with the slightest push ?? Do not see these pictures. I do not care who you are. It's not worth your time.
