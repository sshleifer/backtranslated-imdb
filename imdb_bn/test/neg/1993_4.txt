It's OK ... Chapsky's classic "network" will run its real cinematic Big Home after a few years ... but for now, this dark comedy is not as classic as it would expect. This is the most horrific scene, though it has some good views: Although the first murder has been found, ER ER Clark, the confusing confession of the drum, and the last scene where Scott's character gets his professional integrity and self-esteem, is responsible for a wonderful discovery of billing patients. It has some ridiculous views: The psychologist of the fascinating authoritarian hospital of Scott's character, rape of the character of the character of the Scot, the horrific contraction of the dashart and the O.R. in its short sight. The doctor revived the wrong patient for the madness on the operating table because "I have already filed an evil case" Trying to reduce (ie murder, administration wrong, protest outside the poor people, etc.). It may have worked well as a look of the industry as well. According to the performance: Scott Passable, Rigg seems miscast, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart mugs out of his short performance. The rest of the custom is one dimensional.
