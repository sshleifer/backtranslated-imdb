Pretty much but weaker James Bond films mainly because Hero (Bond) and Villen (Bluffeld) both have severely abused. Loganby is looking very big and innocent bond game. She looks good like a police worker movie but dim-witted sidekick and works. The director and the author tried to establish his credibility, but his line like "Royal Baluga, North Answer" is not effective in establishing himself as a world and self-confident. Savalas is not a bad thing, but its characterization and behavior is more suited to a crowd gangster. The best illustrated characters of the film are Tracy and her father. But during the screen sharing with Lazenby, those actors could only strengthen her deficiency as an actor. This film is not too long (140 minutes) for a bond film and no tension till landing from Bond's mountains, where it starts to rise. This film tries very hard, but falls short. There are many Bondian elements and climate war is the top notch, but while watching this I always understand something missing.
