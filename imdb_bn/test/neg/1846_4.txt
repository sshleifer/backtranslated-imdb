Whoever wrote on this film for Scrapplell, he probably did not consult with any book about Lucile Ball, especially his autobiography I did not see many mistakes in his lifetime, from his early side Selaron and Jemstown were with his native country next year. I could write a complete list of the real errors, but it would go for pages. After all, I believe that Lucele's ball is one of those impossible people who can not be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucy Anaraz and Desi, Junior, then I would be disturbed about the mistakes made in this movie. The filmmakers have worked hard, but the film seems to me very vague.
