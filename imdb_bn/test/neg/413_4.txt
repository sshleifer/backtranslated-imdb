Correction: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He also created famous movies like The Da Vinci Code and Syndrome Men. He has directed the famous TV series 24. Most famous actor Tom Hanks (Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ian McGregor (Casandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, ??) <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the start because they started making such a big change from the movie. Because they changed the father of Basuria Vetra (Islet Jouer) among others, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camen Argangio). Another change was Robert Langdon (Tom Hans) who never visited the CERN. It was nice that they could stay at the CERN. <br /> <br /> After the movie is running, they race in the spectacular cars of Rome. They destroyed Galileo's work when I loved the part of Charterian archives, it was fun. It was also interesting that when they entered the second place, Robert Lambardon destroyed half of the archive and when they went out, the electricity went away? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go to the helicopter, but Camerlago (Ivan McGregor) gets alone, another story is a son from Camerlengo Pope. In the book, he is the real son of the Pope. <br /> <br /> When I should give my best acting performance, I must have called Pierrefenso Favino who plays Inspector Olivei. Nicolas was one of the worst performers from Lee Kasser, I think he was underwatch, because he played football in Adams Apples. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie is being run because Director Ron Howard has made some stupid changes. I will rate the movie by 4/10.
