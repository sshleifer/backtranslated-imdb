I think Purvis starts a gay "went with the wind" if so, sorry, tag, it does not happen. It does not happen as a gay "sexploitation" flick. I felt I'm confused; What are we trying to do here? As much as I want, I do not even care about this letter even where I get it. This movie is useful for the taste of residents of the South. It is my understanding about homosexual relations, illuminated, or nothing in advance, or the beginning of the conflict with the drama.
