To illustrate what a serious mistake this movie might have * some * spoilers * so if you are going to see it and hope to be surprised, do not read it! <br /> <br /> I've liked everything about this movie without plot; And a thriller like this credible plot is essential. It works well, if it works a bit slowly and works in camera and portland scenes are fine for a low-budget, neutral photo. The dialog is very good. <br /> <br /> Meson has recalled the importance of young people who work with the insurance salesman telemarketing company. His high school friend, Berkeley, his employer and Mason are clearly mentally ill, but look after him like this brother. Meson's nightmare which gasping him and sending him fumbling for inhaler. His outlook and nightmare have begun that he has had a serious problem with his past handsome women, and the film seems to be the serial killer of the woman. She meets a perky, beautiful girl called Amber and she sketches her notebook. He liked him and prepared for him so that he could draw his portrait. She started seeing her more and awakening from her withdrawn state, becoming almost half the people. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with other girls painted and she starts to wonder. He is afraid to pull away. Suddenly, we think that the cold is pushing him to the edge. His behavior became more uncertain. <br /> <br /> Setup for this publication. To explain how wrong this movie has been, I have to explain how to explain it. * Another explosive warning! * To work for this plot we believe that Amber, really an outgoing, beautiful young woman is going to go to a seriously emotionally ill youth, at least at the beginning of their friendship is empty empty and can only speak in monosyllables or can not speak of all. The way he crossed nerdy, he appears on the edge of the total catatonia. Yes I know that girls can be attracted to all kinds of strange form, but generally Charles Manson type or punk rockers, bad mental power with some people. Mason is actually a zombie, he rarely has. Any perky young things will cross the road to avoid him. It is simply not believable that this girl is attracting her. Besides, Berkeley has no credible reason to overwhelm Pagal Mason, which is not only believable. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a publication. Mamon failed to show Berkeley at home for Christmas dinner, where Mason expected him and his old friend Barclay would tell him that Amber and his other ex-girlfriend, whom he painted on his many sketchbooks, are not here all! He and all others are the symbols of his imaginative imagination: he saw their dreams. <br /> <br /> Explaining why a normal intelligent Amber would go for Mason, he merely scoffs at his imagination. This can be the final release of the film with proper preparation and setup, but it is not. At this time, Mason went back to his apartment and found Amber there ... he was angry, he killed him. But now we realize that Amber was actually real, not Messon's imagined girlfriend. Finally, Amber really exists and proves that Mason had killed him, Berkeley had to admit that he was wrong, he misunderstood Meson. If the meson is half-sunset from the beginning, it will work, but the audience is always suspected that he is completely humiliated and probably the killer of women, it is no surprise to us. We all had doubts along and did not understand why Berkeley could not see it. But then we were surprised again: if he was real, why would the Amber Catatonic Mason be attracted? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and if others were real, did he even kill them? What did he do with the body? <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is that filmmakers did not just know what to do with the element. Perhaps it's a way to straighten up and tell a credible mystery story, but this is not the movie that is.
