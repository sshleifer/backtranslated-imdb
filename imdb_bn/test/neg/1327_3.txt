One WWII Stalingrad will feel the author with incredible backdrop that will come with a script. No There is no story here! It is obscene, Vintet's violence prevents unhappiness, rote, and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A bunch of Germany shoots near and shoots. Gradually, at least the Germans were shot and shot. Then the Germans did not shoot, they were shot and shot. <br /> <br /> Very bad. <br /> <br /> Chilakot
