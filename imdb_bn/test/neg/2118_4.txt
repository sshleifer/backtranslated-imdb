This is a perfect example of the mainstream sinister shadow of the 90's. There is nothing to fear here and this film is almost bloody. Yes, there are some violence, but everything is just as politically correct as the TV movie. This is not a completely bad picture. Can safely say that I can see it quite enjoyable. However, the lack of originality really "hurts". If you are part of incognito movies like mainstream audiences and incognito films like "Holes" then your favorite love is "Voodoo", but if you want something very horrible to avoid this film.
