The rise of amid starts as an American type blast jumps through an anonymous American city, some people live in a building hanging on the door so that it is closed and damaged (!). They debate among themselves for ages, then a giant thing does not seem to come from somewhere and starts killing each other. <br /> <br /> Written, produced, and directed by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubblebill. The strange Rise is horrible. The script takes itself very seriously but makes a little sense, the first I asked myself if this huge nuclear explosion is destroyed in the whole city, then why are these people still alive? Why are they still standing in the building? Then I asked myself, actually what will happen, the first 20 minutes are set in one room, in fact it is a little liberal, it is a constraint for the main character's argument. Then, it is the result of the Return of Living Dead (1985) created by the Rip of Government, a virus that turns humans into one of the most sudden, vain and unexpectedly random plots twists. Just a complete waste of time happened. Then the strange rise for the final 30 odd minutes is transformed into some strange science-type type thing that feels like a ball of energy to say something, I just say what is the floating force of this force's ball and from where did it come from? What was happening again because of what was going on? Oh just that we are never called. The rise of Audid is a mess, horror of the character and even the name is not given, wrapping around half of you will frustrate the hair, the conversation will be exhausted, nothing will be explained and there is no story here. There is no dialogue between the final 10 minutes (perhaps more than a few) of strange features, and the movie suddenly disappears. <br /> <br /> Director Horton and Hub Bell are clearly working in a low budget, the whole movie is about two rooms and three aisles set! Photography is awful, they use annoying color filters at random and sometimes it actually shows that the Rise of the Auded shot in the camcorder. There is no special effect, some fake blood has splash around but there is no real make-up effect to speak. Some CGI shots in the city are burning in the fire, but it seems awful to float the force. Two people have a left-hand shot before talking about a currier's wall, because some heads are cut off at the top of the screen! The bodies below their neck may be seen, but there is nothing in the frame, they are not running and there is nothing else, but for some strange reasons their head is cut at the top of the frame when they talk to each other! It's a strange thing to actually see. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> And in three parts of New Orleans in Louisiana, there are three sets of chirads, where the Raid of the Andade is shot Shot. Acting sucks so I will not live on it. <br /> <br /> The unexpected uproar sucks, it sounds like a zombie film but all is not honestly it is about everything, it is sub par par and I know filmmakers were working in a lower budget but I am not as concerned as it really is an excuse. Certainly not recommended.
