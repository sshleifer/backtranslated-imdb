Hey ... I'm surprised that this movie still exists in a form, it is available for rent alone! <br /> <br /> This flick is just one of many bad slash flickers available for T & A and cheaper laughs. The story has a bit of "Texas Chess Genocide" with a dramatic drunken-centric background of "Psycho", and a bit of good old-in-chains, tough-al-nyl-x-ken broads won for better measurements - In other words, half of the complete irrationality covered in nude women, spices with a dash of curiosity! As director, the director is playing a sad part to land the land of Quebec's wetland in South Korea's land, I said! <br /> <br /> The interesting thing for me is, I was actually on the flicker's premiere, at that time, I was in the company of "star" Rochford. Jeremy was painful to shrink his seat, while Flick revealed his molten wings. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see that after this shock of the first flock, Rochford has become a hell, an actor. Canadian police drama "Blue Murderer" can be seen regularly, shown in "CSI", without mentioning its role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we apologize, Jeremy! It's a rocky start, but you are good, man! <br /> <br /> ~ Paul
