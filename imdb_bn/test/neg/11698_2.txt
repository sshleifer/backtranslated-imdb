It's too far to enjoy this movie from Straw's novel. Very rarely it was made in the middle of the film. In addition to Eddie's nephew changing his son to Don Vanderley, most of the major scenes and many letters have been removed, which gave life to the novel so much. What was the trash was. Straw's version was much more than this poorly executed film. I did not think that all the jobs that Chowder Society members picked did a great job. I hope someone will come along and in reality my life will recreate this movie. When Hollywood keeps the works of gifted authors I hate because they think their version is even better. Makes me sick
