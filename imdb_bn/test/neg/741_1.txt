Poor Jane Austen No novel of this dog cheek novel in a production is no justice to his remarkable tongue. Start at the top ... Badly adapted. There are additional trailing characters to try the scriptwriter - come to think of it, I do not know what he was trying to do, but not saying that he misses the light year mark !! Couple that with more acting and terrible production values, this is an adaptation which occurred. It would have been better if they paid all the money they put in the flop and donated a worthy charity. Make yourself a favor, read books. It is almost sure that you will enjoy a thousand times more than trying to sit through this amazing product!
