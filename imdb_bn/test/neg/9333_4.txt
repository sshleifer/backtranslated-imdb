The movie "Solomon and Sheba" was that which you only had to go and when I was young, I found back in the late 50's: a biblical epic, spectacular, famous actor, unusual dress, lots of extras and war sequences. So I went to see it; But I remember that "Solomon and Sheba" did not affect me yet, which was a wonderful thing, since I've enjoyed many "Ten Commandments", "Kauai Wadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The point is that when you are a child, you will avoid things in pictures that are not adult (bad acting, for example) and their arms, battles, swords and their fighters will be easy on your behalf This style is in your favor then something wrong with a product then affected No <br /> <br /> Although this image has some features, it must be of course standard and average. Eul Brenner's wooden performance as the King of Hebron is not even light when bright and half-naked, Gina Lolibrigida surrounds him excitedly. She renders well and plays an acceptable role.
