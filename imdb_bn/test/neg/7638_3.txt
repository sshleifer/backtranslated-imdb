I'm sorry, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "Resiro" seem to be a little weird. Craziness is beautiful, I did not ask and find an answer. Of course, the movie is beautifully pictured, it is almost a documentary. But then, when Gradia actually comes to disgrace, he shows every sign of a serious illness and I am surprised at all the movies I received. His behavior is very worried and the people of the village (dubious) are actually trying to send him to the right position, so that what can be done about his condition. He needs treatment, soon! Her behavior is worse for everyone around her, her husband, the poor child (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's not lie about this romantic! I hate this condoning portrait of mentally ill. Why, for God, does the husband want to cure him or at least try it? Why is the dread of going to Milan (a big city, sure, but the potential possibilities of capable people)? Narrowmindedness? Irresponsibility? However, I have inspired myself to rent DVDs on this site and after seeing it I would like to post it to others to give feedback. Actually, why did not this movie get any guidance as to the cancer selection?
