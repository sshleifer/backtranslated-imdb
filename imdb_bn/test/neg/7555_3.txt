I've seen a movie that was more frustrating than the Lord of Dance. Frustrating because it can be fantastic. Dash can be surprising because the dance is frustrating. Frustrated because women can be fantastic. How do I know though?! Your eyes have been shifted to the screen's interest and the Insane Editor shot has been dumped to spot the spotlight properly! I agree with other comments here about other Crimea light and terrible camera / editor work here. It makes me annoying, it will be spectacular movies in just ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Give me a chance to get a seat in front of a live concert and I'll shoot there! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T.
