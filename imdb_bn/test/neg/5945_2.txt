My father kissed aloud loudly aloud loudly loudly. The "funny" little movie is concerned about the older Don Amech being with his son Tom Seleck. It shows that in Amex he is not only "forgotten" but he has dementia (it seems like a lot like Alzheimer's). And, because parents often get so much trouble from "outside the lunch" - almost from the day of Baiyi, almost comfortable. The problem, though, is that you will imagine all that Babai's day knows and the child will be fine. Also, you are not laughing at the child for a child or illness. But, in this case, you are encouraged to laugh at a person who gradually loses his mind - and where's the joke? If this movie is more successful, then can the producers make fun of them, or will people create with Cerebral Palazzi or Flosh-eating virus?!? There are many people who should feel ashamed when creating this image.
