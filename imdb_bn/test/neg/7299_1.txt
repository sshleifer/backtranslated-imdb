My house mate and I silently bought the video of 'The Roller Blood Seven' from our local second hand video store, so hope to find the bad picture. This movie is not even ridiculous, it is astrologically poor, more bad than Jack Frost 2 and it's saying something. Scripts, acting, production, stunts, sounds, sets, everything is terrible. In some parts actors have even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually set the line to read them off and simply repeating them. Set in post-apocalyptic 'Wheel Zone', this film probably takes 45 minutes of film, most of which are vomiting badly or repeated ads from different camera angles to make the film even more intense. This gets very tiring. The plot does not give any idea (it is apparently an addition of two books written by Scott Shore), seven of them are not there, most of them are not in the blades, they roller boots, and I think most of this movie has been sold completely that it is about 3 minutes women There are semi-nudity. Authors and star Scott Shaw have clearly expressed some feelings of samurai and some poor stunts are performed throughout the film and the fight against intense amateur actor guns. Despite all this, his website says that this movie should never be compared to a traditional movie because it really converts the boundaries of modern film making. My roommate and I were left stupid by the whole conversation, and despite my frequent efforts to burn the video tape, it decided that it would be a kind of ring-esquire video damn that must pass. If you see the video on the video, take it from me! Leave alone!
