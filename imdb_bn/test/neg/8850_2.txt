It is a student film if committed. It does not seem like where it goes next, as they decide when they make the movie in the next movie. As a result, many repeats and a dead motion. Ghosts are a completely confusing method that affects people in the world: This includes Internet, phone calls, computer science tests, suspicious grade students, withdrawal behavior, red rooms, dark spots and _then_ suicide. Good luck connecting connections, or when a character played a ghost or still just weird. Characters are just sketched, which may be right, but they are completely unintentional. It's too long and it just ends when reaching a promising scenario, even though the conclusion is meaningless. Poor moment: When "boss" sat down to give some incompatible advice.
