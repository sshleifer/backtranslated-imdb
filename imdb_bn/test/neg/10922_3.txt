This movie was extremely annoying. I just smiled a few times. When I noticed William Shatan's name on the cover, it decided to rent it. It's about this little baby who is always sorted by his classmates. To help the elderly woman while roaming the streets, she met a prostitute. He took him to a playground called Club, where he made several pips friendships. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shutner) decides to accept Pump Business, Lil ''s pimple is permanent for his house. <br /> <br /> The animation is not very good. Looks like it was made with macromedia, which I was sure. It does not suck, it's just the harmful flash animation that has been used in recent years. This humor is not very good, I do not think it was funny.
