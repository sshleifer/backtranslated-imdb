At the box I'm typing now, I had to pick a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature film. Unfortunately there are fewer options than zero, and I have to give something. If I like, I will not keep anything, there is no number, because there is no number that expresses the value of this picture. <br /> <br /> If you are afraid to watch this movie, reviews after these horrible reading, make sure that there is no sharp or curvature in the area, it will help you to try to beat yourself in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the film has been released to the public, it should be locked and protected 24/7 in Fort Knox. I was angry that this image was available for me to visit. I was deceived by humanity, I did not think people could be cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler did not get anything on this douche bag koyel. <br /> <br /> Do not fool by the movie cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why front is a legit looking scarecrow. 2) No character behind the case is a difficult movie! 3) The tag line saying something about "new moon, more victims", there was no terrible victim, even someone died. We do not know if we die on the dam's forehead, and I think the killer did not die because it felt like he was going to hit the head. Stay away from one benefit and this movie, it's about 4 hours of my life wasted. This is the right four, it took me an hour to watch (I started fasting through the 4 minute jumpy scene which does not reveal anything in the plot), I looked at the television almost an hour, I thought about my life and after seeing this bad word I was heading, and then I started crying for noon because I knew someone, unfortunately, I could see this movie. And I can not do anything to stop it.
