I never comment on any picture, but I should say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think it was awesome even if it was not a beginner and a talented film student. I bought the lead actress and when I was in the movie I was in the acting class. Her decisions were very safe and I think she is imitating another actress in a movie and she is not acting and will not make her own decision. The direction was very confusing and the word was more than the actors. If someone narrates the story and does not sing a song, then the end can make some more money. I love Patissy Clayne, but his songs are mostly shown in movies. Maybe the selection of song may be a little more original. The song "Crazy" was such a clich√©. I had already said that I never commented on the film and saw my good and bad share, but it was the worst. Sorry
