I am a great fan of the Carpenters, and I really did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it gave much attention to its immunity and did not illuminate its true personality. I was not very interested in Cynthia Gibbs's screenplay; Especially he knew that Karen's Anornasia committed suicide, which was not clearly. Although his family was not big in hug and kiss, I thought the film depicted Agnes (their mother) as a terrible one. <br /> <br /> I saw some scenes being misguided, as if she was distorted herself and her appearance seems heavy that a mirror shows herself herself; I thought it was rather effective than figurative (so to speak). When the family is playing the pool and discussing her divorce, she will break and Richard will be upset if she gives comfort to him and his helpless body is going well (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> Overall, I think they need to bring its true personality - its more bubbles, the quirky side. Even as the focus of the film, there was no point in fact that she could understand that someone could take her to Anorccia (though certainly no one knows it), and it seems almost unfounded. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I think they could change their husband's name / profession and they could not allow everyone because they were more poor-singer-anorecina than the story of Karen Carpenter by her permission. He was actually included (there were some bad conditions), but the whole aspect was wrong with the changes. In this note, I can not remember the film bringing a family and its desire for kids, which was enormously strong in her life, and she quickly explained the marriage to romance and her husband in heaven. <br /> <br />, it ends with a low budget-for-TV movie that is not very high quality and can be frustrating if you are a hardcore fan who wants to look out of a carton. I think such legends are worthy of a great person worthy of respect and a good movie as a great voice.
