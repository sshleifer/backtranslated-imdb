Oh well ... it's funny. A sad comedy should have been, there was no common sense in many horror movies, but I think a crashed cave would break its path around this situation. Do not really expect anything near Hitako or this. It's a good thing for friends, but I will not recommend it for anything else. This film does not have all the elements of real horror films, mysteries, shocks and good characters. The killer failed to be unstable force, which I hope to have him, and he thinks he is the average rage "D" student who is able to outsmart fools only. And the really fun thing is the horrific acting and the lack of so called "victim" passion <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />>
