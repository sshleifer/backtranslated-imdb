Sorry, I did not get much more meaningful in my summary, but those two words were completely describing the film. This is not just a bad movie, but bad acting and a plot that is a bad movie incompatible with most viewers. <br /> <br /> See it only for a nude Rebecca De Moreen connected by a discipline-link fence. And moaning with 'ecstasy; It seems to be 'lover', but actually cheerful <br /> <br />
