Secret Service Agent J Kilion (Charles Birsten) has been appointed to protect the president's newly elected wife, the First First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Kilian has her hands full. He has many attempts at the killing, which is run by the President's Chief of Staff, he is the first Lady dead. This film insults your intelligence not only with story lines but with the lack of realistic situations. For example, in the visible parade of the opening parade, Rolls Royce without First Lady Agent Kylian and President is changeable. Also, we know what the weather in Washington, DC January is, and not just "top quotes", you can even see some date palms in 70 degrees and sunny weather! (Clearly shooting in Hollywood, Washington, DC). This is a joke in the movie. It's not worth your time.
