A true Gothic horror trash classic! <br /> <br /> Umm, actually, this is a horror movie. The best thing about it: Rosalba Neri made of nude nipples. <br /> <br /> This <br /> <br /> <br /> could not be heard before, but she is a wonderful looking woman. But really, it was her nip that did it for me, in the last scene, before the movie suddenly ended, all the naked and made ... total dream-nipples, people Okay, sorry, taking a little away ... <br /> <br /> Basically, what I found from Lady Frankenstein: I hope this is a stupid and horrible flick, which is a big stupid, ugly look with the Frankenstein giant And a naked tits couple And it has a fortress. So I was not really frustrated or anything. It has dragged too much to certain places (for the first time in life, the father is trying to test, speak, try something with Frankenstein). The original Frankenstein had a fun, disrespectful tribute, though: instead of throwing a little girl in the lake, Mongolia Frankie picked up a naked chick and threw it into the river. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm probably There was a bit too much hope. But Rosalba's employed nipples were worth it ... (tears, I really needed to stop mentioning her nipples). I will end this user's comments now.
