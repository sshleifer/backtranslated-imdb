At first sight, I must say, see the contract, 2007. Also with Wesley Snipps With a good action movie and more dramatic plot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Which is a little bit of a nuclear bomb, set in Romania and with dire directions for action movies - there is no romantic moment and an action movie becomes boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, when you hoped to do Wesley Snipes, it was given to show him terrible screens like this? Do not blame him, he needs money. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie 3 years ago it was the first impression. But I will not see again, there is no way. It's owl. It sucks. There I said it. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I ever sucks this movie in "IWW Review". Thanks, explosives!
