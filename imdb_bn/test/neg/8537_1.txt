I do not expect much from the ghost stories, but I hope to make a little concept in a story! Are the screen writers and movie makers asking too much? When the bad guy, suddenly got screamed, he started shining, and then a problem was spent on 9 dollars for the ticket! Alfred Hittak will be spinning in his grave. Did anyone learn anything in class 101 in their college? A good movie has an interesting story of her roots! Here are some ridiculous messages from this movie: If you get frustrated financial problems from Chicago to the middle then go from North Dakota to Surja Mukhi (I'm not your child!). If your child has a serious neurological problem from a car accident, then one of the best hospitals in the country and lecture will move away from a small town separated from the therapist, which is the largest community hospital. If you have a teenage vixen daughter, a wife and a child, without any reference check, out of blue, hire a drifter to live with you and work. (I'm glad they are not my dad!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And, of course, sunflowers blame people's lunacy on a bad crop! (What's not going to happen in North Dakota?) After buying your Randown home a couple of days - huge grounds are growing everywhere - it reminds you Jack and Bianstock, a man of x files, Al Smoking Man, (I'm glad he does not see cigarettes, I do not think he is inhal!) When you are working to offer your home sales price, then suddenly you will have a quarrel, And 15% more, for any reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get the picture. Last month I saw a lot of Badfork movies, it's just my mind! Is it too difficult to create such a movie that the audience can not be treated as stupid? I'm sorry, at least there are some crooks in this tragic movie! I think somebody thinks that they are going to make money by splitting this celluloid into pieces!
