All right, now I'm sure that my summary has received your attention and my comment is that Jazu Pitras is not without any basis of Satan. Let me tell you the details. The first film appears to be a criminal B-movie about an evil organization called "The Crooked Circle", and a pledge to be revenge for rivalry in the organization of competing opposition to solve the crime. Although it is very weird (especially the idea of ​​a private club that deals with crime) and it can be interesting, this film is different, despite having one of the most influential lists of known movies. Why? Because Jazz Pittas (never one of my favorite actors) spend most of the movie, as well as bad teeth painting Olive Oil! Although killing is being done, whether people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always rely on volume in jajuts - anyone who is about 3 years old who wants to pay attention to everyone who wants to pay attention! At the same time, he got top billing even if he was not an integral part of the film. Why is he even outside of me - I guess it's just throat and yell. As a result, I found the movie virtually unwanted and it was completely destroyed. Now perhaps you know why I mentioned this actress as a suspicious genius "devil"! I am sure the actors of this film watched the final product, yet they felt very terribly starring and amateur acting similarly to me. <br /> <br /> This image is publicly available for free downloads on the domain and the Internet.
