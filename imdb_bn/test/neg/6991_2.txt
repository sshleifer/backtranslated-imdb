I actually liked this movie. Sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain I saw was the lamest. Like Monteri Bernardo's Dante, with its laughable, incredibly funny tales and evil smile. But it's worth watching, you'll never see the power range TV series out for the blast only. You will know it when you see it. Perfectly, this movie should have a low grade porn budget. I stopped watching about an hour later, but I recommend watching through the whole thing; Very rarely, there are plenty of eye candy to enjoy all. Poor movies are recommended for viewers with a high tolerance.
