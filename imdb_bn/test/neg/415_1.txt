At first I liked the book, more than the popular Da Vinci code and even though the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there are no opportunities that I sometimes do not want to see the Angles and Demons. <br /> <br /> This picture rarely resembles the book, but actually has a basic basis for the story. <br /> <br /> I got frustrated from the beginning of the movie, got the call and fax of Maximilian Kohler, CEO of the CEO of Robert Langdon. Finds the Father's body (can not remember the name) and then request Langdon to be used on a super-fast plane ... In the book, only the parents and parents were aware of this technology, this book was in themselves and Camerlingo ... but in the film A big party was involved ... so there was never a tension ... how they found out, etc. <br /> <br /> To go out or change the story The row was a big mistake, and I thought it made a bad movie ... it changed everything since then, when Camerlio faced the locked room of Pope, it should have been a Maximilianian Kohler who shot the video from his wheelchair. The commander goes to Camerlingo, but the liver shoots him, killing it in room. Oder and Olivetti were shot ... (wrongly I got this right, but I was bored and could not really remember film events) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love interest in N Vitoria And Robert did not come when he was in CRNA and in the book, and in reality he was blown away in his experimental work. The book is killing four preferratti, but survived one fountain in the last of four in the film. The book was hijacked by Baseorea and Robert was rescued and killed in the film of Camerling, as well as killing the murderer of the church of Elamini. Something that restricted Robert to the stone coffin was not preserved by the dangers of his Mickey Mouse clock. Okay we believe that Langdon came out of the helicopter, saying that it was a little stretched, but it was important in the film because he had to go back to the film ... where Baslauria and his adopted father were involved. There was no mention of it, it was also important to know the character of Vetori. <br /> <br /> I saw the worst picture I went, but I went numb in my brain and I temporarily lost my legs using it. Truly really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor effort and Ron Howard is one of the best, in fact, he is working out how he would be working !!! I want my money back !!!
