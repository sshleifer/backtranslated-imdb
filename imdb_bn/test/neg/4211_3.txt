He was a devotee of Chauk Norris, and for his film. I had the meaning of watching this picture, but there was no scope for whatever reason. Apparently I do not miss a lot This will be one of the worst films of chalk. So this tractor Billy Daus (Augenstein) was given the opportunity to deliver his childhood, but he was arrested on the way and forced into a Zerkwater town, where a stupid local corrupt judge, Trimmings (Murdoch) operates the entire city, was arrested and Fony charges brought on her. He refuses the complaint and makes a run for it. Local Hick police beat her and she disappeared and she disappeared. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris) is looking for another trucker. He will soon buy a damaged judge that runs out of the city and that his brother can not be found anywhere. He is not long after the town just started to beat me almost. Meanwhile, the lady of the movie called local truckers on a local CB radio and they all came to the city to come. LOL with big rigs Finally, Norris finds his brother and closes more lips. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. It really started well and when you start breaking some of the local corrupt policemen in Norris, you feel very good, because such victims are affected. But there is virtually no story, acting is bad, and it's going to end? Well it's not really one. Judge her house rammed by a big rig and you do not know what will happen. Does he live Norris does not even get him a trash In the meantime, Norris finally took some thugs to the police. Who care? Norris led the city to arrest everyone, broke his arm and shot the side and continued the war. Come on! This film was apparently made in cash for the money generated by CB's madness, why was there anyone outside me. They used the CBE in the Barley movie. By adding it, the film continues to pull in the end and you're wondering why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you get bored and need something to see, it will pass the time. As far as Norris he went to make much better films than this. 10 out of 3
