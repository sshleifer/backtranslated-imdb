Okay, where do I start? I can not even imagine an understatement of this essential unfortunate excuse for a show. Check out this picture: A boarding school, where children's parents wander around with money, only shifting them there so that the world is jated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> About 23 minutes are full of their so called problems, boys' suffering, and preferences. <br /> <br /> The heroine of this show, of course, played by Joey in Madameosyl, Britney's Polly Pocket Little Miss. That sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, probably much more to learn about acting. However, I will give him some mouth, because on the surface of it, a dimensional character does not allow much room for depth. He fought for the woes of the Pacific Coast Academy's sun, moon and stars, for all women, fighting for the equality of all jinns. <br /> <br /> Those who probably have Daddy's cash, and solid chick, wing, who have proven a hard nut in the crack. Both shows are 2 and 1 seasons remaining, respectively, I do not blame that. But fear comes in fear of fear, who thinks of herself as the biggest actress in a dramatically wood with her hair and her green feathers with a fake tan. He is even more weird than Joey, if it is possible, and sinks more than Nicole, and Hell, we know that it can not be possible. <br /> <br /> The program has been spewing since Niklodian 2000, seeking apology for the television, stereotyping is a major victim. She's the next friend and her best friend for her win, often the best boyfriend, Chase, a cool, arrogant female male, Logan, a boy and crazy girl, who is not very bright, Nelly, everyone seems to be weird, Because he is extremely extreme, unqualified, quinn, too dramatic, annoying but ultra thin, Maliba is the perfect model, Lola, and strong lady, grains. Now, where have I heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's so wrong with having a personality? Just because queen is passionate about science, and actually depends on her future and working well in academic perspective, among which the rest should be concerned about her, is she "weird" and "vain"? At the beginning of the series, Lola was proven to be a potentially great figure in her way of life and different aspects of life, Joey had just to go, to pick up your pitchfork, stand her up, burn her up again, she is going back to the wonderful city, and jazz to everyone. Many for women's rights Unfortunately, Lola is not much more than just another Ox clone, all of her unconscious majesty. Probably not being expelled by his brain. <br /> <br /> Hey, 2000's MySpace, who seems to love it with Chase / Zoe's common fairy romance, Admant, "Hot" Logan and "Kick-Ass" Joe or Wing, which is your favorite, and Beautiful people Please, this show reminds us that people do not like the truthfulness, they love a provocative, shallow and vapid lifestyle. Sorry to break you down to Darling, it will not happen, unless you have a major trust fund and parents can tear you down.
