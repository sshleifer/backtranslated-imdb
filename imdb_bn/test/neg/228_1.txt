Willis's character was cold and the first few minutes of the crucify show was quite fun, especially with Gin Smart, but it was really tuned later. It's only leaving the new people and the staff of harmful kids without any innovation. I know that Casting probably picked this child and showed that Willis was annoying like her little soul, but I found this baby very annoying and Hunney.
