My biggest objection to the critics behind this picture is to mention 'basicity'. This film does not contain an innovative material. If, by 'basicity' you read a script out of painful scenes, reactions, violence, foolish humor and intellectual conviction. Then, 'originality' could work without some Swedish films. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery to me that how Ross and Carlson agree to play 'this' on a poor plea for a movie. And after creating this picture how can Eva Ross be seen in morning breakfast - it disappoints me as a TV promotion. <br /> <br /> There is no story in this picture, the script is irrational, rigid and endless but not least, just plain bad. These two young directors together combine quite annoying son-imaginations with violence, joke-strips and miniature psychological portraits. The kitchen-cooked DD on the micro-wave dinner is not really surprised to describe the daily life of these two exaggerated cinematic life as a director of two directors and film directors. <br /> <br /> This is not my worst enemy film.
