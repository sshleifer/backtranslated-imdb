Look, this picture is terrible ... Neglected by their self-absorbed parents across "intrigue", and nannies and babysitters leave a succession care, which all children run away by completely unnecessarily. Finally, the kids engineer Beverly D'Angelo was convicted of his new grandmother, why are you concerned about it? And D'Angelo shows a TV talk show about the sale of children and he will try to sell pairs ... and, well, oh, you do not want to know. It's all too unpleasant, and not all fun. In fact, the announcer showed this picture before coming to TV channel! Just do not bother in this trash one moment of your life, John?
