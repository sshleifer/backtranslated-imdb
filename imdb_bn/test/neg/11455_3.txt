Sit through Cimarron was painful. Although Irene Doe did good work with heavy handwriting, Richard Dix's 'Poppas' and 'Accented Role' brutal. In spite of the characteristic of Isaiah's character, other ethnic and religious ideas were not treated even though the film was a little progressing in the role of women and the persecution of indigenous Americans. Edit especially weak. Without a doubt, all the "best" pictures are the worst.
