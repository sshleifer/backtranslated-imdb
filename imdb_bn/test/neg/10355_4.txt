There is something about this show that keeps me looking and hoping for the future. In the writings, the curiosities are very few and far away, and the lines of the story are a bore, so I think it must be physical comedy and visual. <br /> <br /> I enjoy camera movement, wear clothes, and dresses. It is very contrary to the stupidity that is royal. And I'm sure that since I've been laughing every time it was due to John or Molly's physical comedy. Both of them have created a ridiculous intelligent couple who laugh at me and want to mute at the same time. <br /> <br /> So I will talk down tonight and go down this production ready to sit beside the kim (or as a case, looking forward to positive).
