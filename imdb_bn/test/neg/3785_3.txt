So this guy goes to a psychiatric office for his first appointment. After the papers are over, the psychologist says, "I'm going to show you ink blots. Tell me what you see in them." "Well, the patient says," At first I looked, "I see a man and a woman having sexual relations." Seeing the second, he said, "I see sexual relations between two women." Seeing the third, he said, "I see two male sex relations." Looking at the latter, he said, "I see two men and two women having sexual relations." The psychological incubator puts down. "So," he says, "we'll start by discussing your monomania." "My monomania?" People are saying. "And with all these messy pictures!" That's how this movie attacks me.
