One of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Three unmarried young people talk to each other about their sexuality and "little love" and little talk about them. They do not seem to be very interested in each other, and only so passively. I was left out feeling shut out. Exotic scenes are held mostly on the night, so Paris can not enjoy the lovely sights too! I leave it after one hour and ten minutes.
