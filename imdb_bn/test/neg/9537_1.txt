I like bad films, but this thing is a steaming hip. From the terrible sound and devastating acting from the Shaky Cameraman, this is not a secondary waste on the pill. Fifth graders might have made a good film and the first graders could have written a good script. Want a real synopsis? Dance for nefarious girl very long way in the bikinis. A shaky plot made worse by acting terrible. The on-location set was not even passable. Church scenes are performed in a dance studio and oh yeah - what does the two dance-dance numbers come from blue? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the number of naked breasts that could not even have this image been saved - 0. Add it to trash hip.
