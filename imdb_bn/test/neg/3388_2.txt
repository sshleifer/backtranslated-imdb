I want to know that the producer of this film has paid for his production - the genius of the kind of genre. The film attracted almost two-thirds of my attention, until I realized that it was not going anywhere fast. I think the music has been inspired to think something that seems to be running, but nothing was really there. It was not terrible. The dialog was poor text. The first 90 minutes should be covered in about 15 minutes. This can be a moderately acceptable twist zone or outside boundary. <br /> <br /> At this point I'm just crazy that I've been lost forever. <br /> <br /> I hope that this comment will save anyone without spoiling evening. Instead hit the gym or take a hit. Or you want to be afraid, turn on a cable news channel.
