This movie is so brave that it does not try to hide its similarities with Shining. The lack of basicity to do it. And when it is finished, try to cover the story of "Sketchy Spooky House Affected by Babysitter", it has already spread through conferences and ideas already established by many years ago. In other words, it is only reduced to itself from mere cliche. But hell, even I enjoy a good predictive horror or thriller until an interesting story, a violent and full of pride, the movie is expected and will be a tremendous turn toward the quarter. Well, this picture does not have a good story and I was really frustrated with it. What's going on for 'Dark' is a wonderful instruction and a movie. It is a movie shot well and carefully crafted full of fun, scary corners and shots. What 'dark' is not going for it mostly everything left. Starting with a minor quibble - performing this movie is unnecessary. It's next to one scene, sometimes jump pointlessly. For example, the older people in the movie (who carry most background stories, later filled with other characters) are underscores of the hamster running circle. I mean, it looks cool for the first time, but why is it going to use the same image? I guess you want to see it for yourself, what is the meaning of understanding. Another problem in this movie is Anna Pauquin's character, who is crying mostly around the film, crying and taking care of everything too much - she's a failed attempts to film in the character-driven horror films. The film's overwhelming tendency and family drama of the scene is not only believable. In the end, 'Darkness' is a molten melody, with an intrinsic mystery available with a very simple finish. And it's very scary.
