I hope this movie is that it will be another great killer toy movie. I was hoping to see a big fan of the Child Play series and the same here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the films were not at least bit scary, as well as we actually see Pinocchio "alive", this is the last few scenes of the film. The little girl in the film, her performance is so bad that it is almost ridiculous. Plus, the closing never happened to the doll what happened or what they had a small girl in a sanctuary or where she was at the end of the film. So, in my opinion, this movie is the "killer toy" category the worst. If you want a good killer toy series, stick with baby's play franchise. Ponocchio's revenge money and waste time.
