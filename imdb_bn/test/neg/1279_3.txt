Some people think negatively in Sweden: very clean, very clean, very serious, very organized and very responsive. A man is tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heavy intervention. This can not be a problem for a filmmaker, for example, late burgmann has shown us what might be a cinematic under this condition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Sweden is equivalent to hell on earth. But he no longer accepts it, and it's not just industry for me, but only commentary. Despite the amount of time it took to create serious limitation for the filmmaker, he can not explicitly resign. <br /> <br /> His earlier film, Sanger Frang Andra Wagening / compared to songs from the second floor, there are not many progress still there. This objective was even more accessible, but the difference is not the best in some scenes movie to please the lowest and larger audience. In the same absurdism and minimalism still applied, one-shot camera position and action in front of these shots (lack). Yes, is still working well, some scenes actually work and color and location are wonderful. But is not that an interesting movie? Thinking negatively, this movie is a step back. <br /> <br /> Underson's background creates a wide variety of setups as a commercial maker, but I find them just like her commercial ads. There is a message about mankind, but it is trivial and without much depth.
