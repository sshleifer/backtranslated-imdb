I'm a big Eric Roberts fan, I've collected his film and have received 60 so far. But I want to tell the truth that sometimes he really makes a terrible movie. But this is why I like him - he's entertaining for <br /> <br /> <br /> But I have to take this price, why can not I think? However, they were able to get Erica and Carabin Barcen in the film. <br /> <br /> Although Barneson is very terrible (I do not really like him), Roberts was directed as the best thing in the movie (and does not mean that much). He regularly does this on a routine basis. <br /> <br /> The female lead (brussel) looks like a plastic doll and works like one. And Tim Abel and his crew look like plastic dolls and work like them. <br /> <br /> This plot is really embarrassing. I did not see any film from Carnosar so I can not remember the footage I added from there, but it explains some things. But there are still huge holes as craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> Speaker Alert <br /> <br /> The first attack is located outside the wooden laboratory. But in the end, they cut the whole laboratory and all ends, but they forget the outside ?????? <br /> <br /> I am surprised when helicopter pilot is eaten alive. He is hello, can not see a T-Rex clipping ???? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is certainly a B-movie standard sex scene with Silicon TT This time it welcomes us to Lauris McCombus. I have no problem (she looks terrible) but a guy looks at the edge of Climax for Microsoft Mike and 8 !!!! Minute too long <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
