I love the bad movie: Showgirls, Plan 9 to Outs Space, so And this movie fits perfectly. Anyone who calls you it is not a good movie. It's cruel terrible. Tim Curry's pronunciation comes from Hungary to German from Portugal. A gourmet suit is a person who is able to communicate using a glove that explains the sign language of APE. There is a scene with a killer Hippo, which goes around a river like the Great White Shark. People are mounting up and hopping down. Kilimanjaro such as accelerators have been installed. This thing is ridiculous ridiculous. So ridiculous I was rolling over the floor. It's completely impossible. I like it every minute.
