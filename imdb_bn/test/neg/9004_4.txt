I had a little hope for this long-term film making footage from the old poverty line film. Certainly it was possible to feel more than a video video enhanced in the world market. Unfortunately this movie looks like a fun movie, but still divided into stock footage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The ship is shrink and good ..." <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> We're okay, but in most cases we've got lots of new video footage that looks like Scratchy black and white, in which the new actor Piece. Old footage is mostly inter-cut to set the scene, but old and new are small enough to match so it can be clearly fixed. This is not very convincing and I am very disappointed to find a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> If you love and love the old poorer movies, then it may still be worth watching. I buy it and warn it, but it can be worth about five taka, for rent prices) so the choice is yours (though you will not be paying away for it). <br /> <br />> Frustrating.
