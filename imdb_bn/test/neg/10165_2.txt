I saw this image today that my feeling was absent from 10 to 15 minutes, from the beginning of the story. John Wayne goes to this trading post / salon in the middle to meet some robbery owner. What he sees is the signs of genocide, some dead bodies, the signs of war and no one lives in sight. Because the owner's daughter is hiding in the secret room, you are hiding in the mysterious mysteries of old English killings. <br /> <br /> The type of stories you found in the hidden rooms were that they were past priests. In the 16th century, Catholic families related to England's old beliefs created these things to hide in the pursuit of the royal authority due to their faith. You do not see anything in the West, but a good hostage. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for poor editing or writing or both, we do not know exactly what Owen actually did in this place. But it was a B western and even it was not a good one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And see that Gabby Hays sees this movie.
