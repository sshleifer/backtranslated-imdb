It could be, though I still missed two or three. This film is an interesting night city formation, memorable of many foggy scenes of Sherlock Holmes films and it reveals it with pornographic, Kafka-eski characters. In the middle of them, the film releases Mia Faro, who thinks she is still playing Hanna, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reiterating her brutal role from Play It Ann Sameen. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and wringing hands? I guess that, if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, it would not. At least I do not think it.
