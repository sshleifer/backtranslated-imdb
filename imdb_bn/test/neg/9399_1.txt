Boring doggerel with terrible, terrible acting; Undoubtedly, superficially, and conduccendingly trawling most of the scandal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and medieval. The main actor struggled to portray his path through the film firmly, to portray the idle character and script call for self-congratulatory self-reproof, the appropriate Creator. I was sure that the book was bad, but it could not be bad! The camera is permanently flipped-yellow "Tuscan" lens filter (probably Tuscan sun is not enough Taskan), which forgot to move the scene to Rome and (Fantastically!) Ammel to move to the coast. You see the white marmalade of the Emmulayle memorial in Rome, so do not see yellow ... I mean Tuscan. Never one of the worst movies ever, and so a look quite worth it.
