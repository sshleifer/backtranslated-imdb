I always tried to persuade the rogue man and his artistic efforts, and I never realized why his work attracted so much attention. In addition to his judgment (which he invented by accidents, and which only printed the direct contact photo), it seems to be a real contribution to his culture that he first showed the image of nudity that the image of nudity was accepted as art. As indecent. But this was definitely to happen, and due to the truth there is no reason for Ray's credit. Critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Autole de Merade" ... Hoops, "The Marie" ... has many blurry photography and a Starfish is a repeat visual theme, which is not explained. Starfish has striking powers to resurrect the missing limbs - and even to reproduce evenly identical companies - but, if the movie has to do something with the theme, then the ray neglects. I was very much influenced by the title cards of this movie, which directed (in French) Rimes, a foot ('C Belle, Cybee') and some portmanteats. <br /> <br /> So often in the work of the verdict, there really is a beautiful young girl seen in this film. Unfortunately, photography is so vague that we have little chance to appreciate it. I'll rate this mess out of 10 points.
