I bought this image for 4 pounds on DVD, but it was a waste, the film is very bad. The plot is your average giant film, where it kills some people, the mayor / chief does not believe it and ultimately wars it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting is also reasonable <br /> <br /> However, the main layer of a giant movie becomes strange by adding special effects, ridiculous and a random bus load of kids halfway to the platform. The worst is bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, whenever you get a chance to see it, then - there will be something better. <br /> <br /> <br /> The real horror movie is not a PG rating "
