While sitting in a large wing chair beside a huge book in her, one and only watch at the Lugosi cameras and in the delivery of a scary voice, she thinks she is ridiculing Shakespeare's teaching, Intro Slo-lie: "Man's unknown things are unknown, unexpectedly reachable. By fastening, illuminating a lot of amazing things; (snicker); surprisingly, because they seem to be new Osira eyes are swollen, and swollen face growing eyebrows raised), most of it is not new, it is not a sign of age. "(Light in a visual scene, which resulted in an astonishing 86 seconds with the Thunder continues). <br /> <br /> And so arguably the worst movie ever made. This "movie" defies almost descriptions. In the semi-drama style with strange stories, it has been said that this plot explains ... like ... ... the story revolves around the sculpture of a person named Glen (Ed Wood, Junior); So glender reference. The film has no real structure. Instead, it is mostly a random assortment of vintets that can be formed ... or can not ... glen or cross-dressing motif related. One of the long sequences wriggling some unknown woman on a sofa, then formed a woman's whip which we will be referred to today as S & M. <br /> <br /> Then, in the odd moment, the views of any apparent reason, and more informal dialogs, such as: "When he makes a mistake, he is wrong, and when he makes a mistake because he is right, the string Dance, dance to it. " WHO <br /> <br /> <br /> There are stock footage in about 20 percent of the visuals, it is accompanied by a violet which is related to the story motif but not the scene. Therefore, we can see stock footage: city streets, freeways traffic, a steam beef, and full children's playground. But it gets worse. In a cross-dressing film we have 58 seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace, which produces hot steel and WWII's 84 seconds second strike strike scene. <br /> <br /> There are even the simplest items too. At one point we saw the headline of a newspaper that was "dressed as a man named girl". Below the title, which is explicitly adhesive or paste, ... about the article. In one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen female spat out: "Airplanes, why is it against the wishes of the creator?", A voice that only shakes helium <br /> <br /> The performance of Layl Talbot, without performance, is equally awesome. The production design is cheap looking and thrust; (But you love that tacky wallpaper). Edit drunk. Most of the background music is suitable only for the 1950 style elevators. B & D is much more contrary to the method of cinematography. And the clothes look like one that comes from a snow shop. <br /> <br /> This image is so bad that it is making "Auto space to Plan 9" making "Citizen Why". I do not know how Eddie's "glen or glenda" could make a film worse worse than that. But thanks, it's got lugosi. Every time he opened his eyes and looked with big eyes in the camera, I saw that I fell on the floor laughing.
