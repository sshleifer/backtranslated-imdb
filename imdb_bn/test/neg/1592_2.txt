The only reason I did not give this movie a terrible rating is because I think it's a horror movie in every aspect that it deserves at least 2/10. Not to try <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main goal of this movie is to be heard suddenly and its main part is not achieved, the final scene is frustrating, disappointing. Removing the film's memories and sometimes guessing its goal as the most dirty film. <br /> <br /> A very low budget movie, played very well and the dialogue is suddenly bad. <br /> <br /> I really 0/10 really !!!
