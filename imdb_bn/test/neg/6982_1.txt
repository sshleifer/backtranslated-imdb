This movie was bad but it was so bad that it could reach the rituals in the distant future. A kind of film-noire fills up Plan 9 from outer space. The story was, well, was not actually a story. A place for the world's Ed Woods and Ras Girl is preserved and this film proves this. The best way to describe it is "It can be so bad". I am deeply skeptical of whether this movie will be selected by a legitimate distribution agency, so it is unlikely to see wide openings. <br /> <br /> I will also star in that I want to see more of Ron Kearney's performance. She made her better. The rest of the acting, if I can call it, was quite forgotten. I have seen bad from big studios with huge budget.
