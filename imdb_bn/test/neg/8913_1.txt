I do not love seeing Steven Sigal's film because the reason of the great plot is because it makes me laugh because <br /> <br /> Oh, it gives me so much laugh that this movie does not get a complete point of view and it's a ridiculous movie Pearl Harbor! !! And Ben Affleck does not need any acting school just how bad it is to give an impression <br /> <br /> For the first time, so many guerrillas and bad roles, when Steven is trying to get out of prison, is worse than that. First, the helicopter roamed the security notice and when they suddenly shot a watchman, they brought their land <br /> <br /> or when he killed the man in the car and both of them left behind, Steven did not see the oil on the ground behind him. Observe that even the lighter is not oil without lighter. <br /> <br /> He is indicating a gun he grabs it and stops The shot was bullshit !!! Like some gangsters will ever happen. <br /> <br /> In the outer space, the battlefield is too bad, you can see Steven clearly take some time to wait for action. Notice you bad acting <br /> <br /> It just lets me laugh. I hope one day Hollande will come to the cinema, so I'll laugh my soul laughing laughing and laughing laughing
