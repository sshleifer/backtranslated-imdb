I did not know anything about this DVD when I rented it. The comment here was a quick look but decided to keep an open mind. Clearly an independent movie and low budget but that does not worry me. I'll look at something with Derek Jacobi and he always played his part well. What is any other mercy A few weeks ago, I saw Vanitya Redgrav with 'Antonement' and he was nice. This he just started to read the line. In my opinion, the main mistake was to cast Vinnie Jones. Sincerely I saw her picture on the DVD cover but she did not notice that she got the top billing. A sticker is placed strategically on its name! It can be seen and I like Dickens story alongside today. Probably playing the role of more effective actors can be a good job. Still it was weak.
