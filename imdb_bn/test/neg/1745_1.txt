If this is the best thing in Finnish film at the moment, I would say that the large tax euro spent supporting the "culture" has been terribly ruined here. Pasha Ma is the worst example in trying to create a Finnish "European film" for big viewers. I'm sure they want it to be all sophisticated, smart and touch at the same time. The result is reckless. <br /> <br /> To make it short: - The story is persuasive, believable and not trustworthy. Goes for the same letter. I can imagine them thinking about creating a movie where "everything is going to go on, **** and people will get hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because the Finnish people are so nudistically very depressed and their self-esteem So bad ", which brings us to ... <br /> - The film is loaded with a cliche, mostly about" Finnish mentality ". How it deals with human problems and their causes can be outside of regular women's magazines or cheap Baul-psychology-self-help books. ("We feel very bad inside!") I'm sure they also saw some Karimasaki, to find out what it is about his movies, people misunderstand him completely, and bring annoying stories about going to people. Probably for any other artistic purpose than social pornography ** by all means They shy a cry of throwing here in Tolstoy. It's just a symptom of trying to be smart. And not being. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst results, but the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is extremely irrational. It is hateful to see sulking and hardship without bringing any real revelation. I can go with such kind of ** ck If the movie is fun or a wide joke or ends in the end, but good things like liberal Wave Brewer's Wave Breaking There was no one on the ground. In fact, although I started to laugh at some point because the turn of events was once again expected, superior and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who was shocked? And who likes it? I hope they're posed.
