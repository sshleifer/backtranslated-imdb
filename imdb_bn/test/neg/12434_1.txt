Larry Clark is not famous for his talent as a writer or director, but he made some unreliable important films. Children, embarrassed, and in small quantities, why parks achieve the purpose of their purpose: Shock, rebellion, and even hatred. These movies are incompatible with their content and use their controversial nature to publish serious problems among modern youth. Kids are exposed to our AIDS expansion. And sexual incapacity in the young. Bully touches on the same problem. Why Park transfered slightly to Ham with sexual abuse and suburbs ennui. Uncertainly, these movies have published something horrible and dropped a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders in South-Central Los Angeles who are deliberately skating going to Beverly Hills. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an incomplete story. And, like kids, it features a cast of actors for the first time, who came out of the film setting. However, unlike the kids, none of them have any similarity to the talent. Pornography has good acting. Without any doubt, I showed the most terrible performance of a feature movie in this movie. Larry Clarke can be honored for the release of these young people in the process of filming, but these kids are absolutely worth croaking, people Perhaps I can add the scene that the soundtrack has been created, most of the things you never heard of Garage showcases Punk - My suggestion is that you can pop some magarin spheres before entering the theater, or you are sorry for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> But again, there were not many scripts to work with them. Each line spoken is refined, pathetically distributed, and is irritating beyond all measurements. The story itself is ridiculous. It started reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into mere irrational. It certainly starts with a playful sex with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of continuous continuation of the Clichad National Lamponian, for some reason the letters were closed and eventually a ridiculous anti-final result was made. The shots go much more than they need. For about 15 minutes, people should be ready to fall into the scatterboard, making the characters empty, shotboarding shots without a scrobding down the street. But again, with scripts they need as far as possible filler on a small 32 page. Perhaps the washworks worked well as a short film. <br /> <br /> However, I could go like this. This Larry Clarke still made the worst movie. For those interested in seeing the clerk film only for his frustrating pedestrians, see elsewhere. So far he has made the most minimal film, and it is the worst. It's terrible to flatten out. Like it, they're awesome. Surely I have seen the most festive. <br /> <br /> 1/10
