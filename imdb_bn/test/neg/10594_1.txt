The movie was slow, the conversation between actors / actresses felt "flat" and basically there was no improvement in the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Aps is looking for pouting and basically annoying with everyone, seeing the whole look of his face toward the face. Dance is not on-screen magic, and Ribi's character is such an intelligent person who wants to quarrel with it even without paying for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An old man, and perhaps you may be the worst movie in cinematic history. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the satellite (thanks for the knowledge I did not pay for it), and I did not want to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, if you ask me a terrible movie, and generally there is something good to say about me in a movie.
