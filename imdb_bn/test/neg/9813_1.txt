Anybody who knows about evolution will not even see the film as a "fake". "It's never been unpublished" is a weak argument. The universe can not be said to have been made by a giant Hippo. However, it seems to be justified, the only person who thinks is the same person who opens an email attachment from their contacts or their bank details from their friends in Jambia. No bombs found in the United States or Canada of any primates. There is a good reason why legitimate scientists are not disturbed by this study. The same logic goes for Loch Ness Giant, Scratch and God.
