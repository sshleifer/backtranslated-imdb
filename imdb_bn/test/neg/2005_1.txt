This was the worst movie I ever seen! My husband and I own 600 DVDs, most of which are sai-fi and horror B-movies which are not high quality but still entertaining. The Dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming attributes! The writing was awful, and the acting was even worse. It has made us three attempts to get the full movie, because we can only tolerate it at 30 minutes. We thought it would be good ... we were wrong. I would rather see being a body that is being embalmed than to sit through again !!! When it ended me and my husband looked at each other and said, "Um ... what is this?" It seems to be more than the end, but they ran in their $ 500,000 budget and "oh, shit ... we broke down ... now credit it quicker!"
