Clearly, I did not expect much with the film going to the DVD, but this film is so incredible that it is incredible. The only part of the film that you can find really interesting is that even before going to the island, where Adeea's son comes out of the bathroom with a jet jets and still! Why are they all bored? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were bright and sunny. It will not be. They rely on a dog's joke about the lungs and a character named 80-year-old Agal Nick and tries to get his way along with beautiful women. When the ship reached the island, the island in the background just thought of seeing the fake and the Rondie quad, although it was funny in the previous film, it seems and it seems that he is trying very hard to be funny. You have been warned!
