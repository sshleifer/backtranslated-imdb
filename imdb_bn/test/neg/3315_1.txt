I have never received 1 vote for a movie on IMDB, but for this I am sorry that the scale can not come to 10. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie that I saw it was a sneak preview, and it was my worst movie experience. I do not think stupid jokes. I can live with stupid stories. But when I do not understand their impersonal foreign lecture (understand only what the Germans understand), then I felt that I was never able to be so frustrated because I was frustrated. (If they leave them, then the matter may be acceptable ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once you or twice You can laugh, because it's funny, but it does not make any good. This is certainly not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside of Germany, be happy and this delightful job probably will not make it to your movie. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany, avoid this movie at all times.
