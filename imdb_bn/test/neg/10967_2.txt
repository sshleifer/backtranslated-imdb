At a glance at the rating, you must be told that the film was artificially voted by rock to enhance the ratings of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie did not bring anything new to the zombie style. Indeed, it's ridiculous (in acting and in filming) and its plot derivative. Make-up looks awesome and shots when zombies look even worse. The lines have been strictly distributed and badly timed, in addition to the exception of the female beauty hunter, it is the only good actor in this film world. The worst criminal is Italian people (Hans), Rin hero, and lead bad guy. I saw good delivery from pizza trucks with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> This is a self-proclaimed "Junky Western", but the only thing that makes it "zombie Western" is that people wear cowboys and that the main actor's name is Clint. Progressive is not as calm and mysterious as a traditional Eastwood hero, and as a hero anti-hero, he has no wise-cracking attitude to stop it. <br /> <br /> Do not fool yourself by fake fire reviews. This is just another B-grade zombie film that is made efficiently for its budget (it has some good lighting), but it repeats less budget, first-time directives and bad acting. There really is a lot of really stupid scenes that make this cute look.
