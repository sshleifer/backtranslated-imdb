Anyone who wrote this scrapplet can actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they are not very good at it, then doubt. No characters should be what they should be: Fannie is lively and conscious about his lethal attitude, and Sir Thomas, who did his best, seems oddly fallen in the personality of Annie Norris. In addition, the first-person story by Fanny is extremely inappropriate both in the story and its character. Fannie is not an entertaining heroine, and I would not have meant that he meant to be. In addition, in the film version, Fanny has flirthed with Edmund from the very beginning, when they were raised as brothers and sisters! Austen's Fanny had shrunk from any type of flirting, and the novel portrays Fanny / Edmund's pair as extremely uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike any other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rest on the power of her female hero. This is a different kind of novel than others. It is not meant to be a love story. I've seen this movie because I've finished reading Mansfield Park now, and I'm very scared about what I've seen. Miss Austen is rolling in his grave.
