I have seen this picture with a friend who ran a marathon with me and both of us had the same feeling: it was not very encouraging and it was not even thought of what the training schedule would be like. Non-marathons may have an idea for their training and what they will do to run them. Actually there was almost zero technical information at all. I do not expect this to be a technology-heavy instructional video, but when the information was near zero, the film was not only balanced and non-marathons were not particularly helpful in their first operations. <br /> <br /> There was another problem. Some of the first pictures were collapsing near death while trying to run a nation. Yes, real inspirational. It was very difficult to follow the time, because it was half-chronicle, but filmmakers rarely gave you a better formula that you were looking for at some time. And they stop the information. You see that the canter was an injury, and you just guessed from all his training, but then after a few scenes, he finally started to refer you because he was returning to a pine cone in his yard. <br /> <br /> Some parts were great, however, the great nation officials who were disappointed with such a woman were just like men, and the Chicago race coverage where the two runners were first represented was the first place. <br /> At the top of my head, I'm thinking of another chronological document, such as Supersize Me, and grass, where you always know where you are and you think you know what you want to know. <br /> <br /> In short, creating a good marathon movie was not difficult, and as it stands I can not recommend it to educate non-marathoners and motivate them to try, because I don 'think it That has the effect.
