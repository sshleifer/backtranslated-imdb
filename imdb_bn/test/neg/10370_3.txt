I'm a big fan of monster dolls. Looking at this surface, it looks great! You've got Decemitron, Dolls, and TOTEM a new villain! Unfortunately, for a little punk that this project can be animated, unknown objects can not work. He stinks! Her girlfriend is bad If they go out, it'll probably be cool, Blade VS. Totem I want to watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the role of dolls has diminished, and the whole film has suffered for that reason. The mysterious narrator who created the totem is the best, and the decapitron look is long, short, and really frustrating. You'd better be better off watching the first time.
