Writer-director Patrice Lacnott accepts a universal and potential instant subject - friendship - and it turns into a flat and flawless French, despite a list actor, fine film, and elegant production design. It's all about the plot, and the plot is ridiculous. "Learn how to teach me", art dealer Francois Coast (Daniel Outerule) told a random stranger (Danny Boon), and it is almost the same. We learn nothing about friendship later, and Daniel Otewail can be a fine actor, but in a minute we do not believe that he can suddenly become arrogant, the script depends on him. We hope the journey is over, but Lacan is one of his usual cathartic third acts, which are being dragged faster than the disaster damage. Frank Treasurer is like a Greek flower, everyone in this movie and everything is a fake. Lechon's only asset in the part of Coast's business partner Catherine is Julie Gawett, haircut and delicious appearance despite a major accident.
