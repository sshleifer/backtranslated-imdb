A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided to finally see it. It was sooooooo long. I was waiting for the mystery incident but it never happened. I kept waiting for something after the open scene to happen, and it does not. I stopped the movie and came back later. I'm actually forced to see the rest of the rest hope it will be better. It's bad. I asked myself, who are they? Do they have feelings? Are they just robots? I am glad that I do not pay to see it or pay it rent. When the Dutch died, the end of the shoot was over. At least we've gotten some passion from the audience. Maybe or not
