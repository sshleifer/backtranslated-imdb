Reinstatement of a successful movie can be a tricky business; For real classic rebuilding, especially one that is sure to be a director of Alfred Hitchcock's film, and something else. And after seeing this version of 'Saiko' directed by Gass Van Sant, two things come to mind immediately: what is the point, and what do they think of in the world? In particular, Van Sant used the same scrapple (used by Joseph Stefano, from Robert Block's novel) Hitak. The final result here is that some of the subtle aspects of the film making industry have highlighted: First, a 'remake' should be correct; Replacing the original instead of a 'copy' using new players; And secondly, there is more to shooting than painting, using more blood and more graphic than being disconnected from the effects of the film. Although it was a great effort of Van Sant, but surprisingly it is suffering from the same error that Norman Bates was suppressed: the film's mind was divided; Half of the hits, half van saint. And two, though met, will never be bound. Works also from the original script, Van Sant wanted to create his own picture for the movie - instead of trying to duplicate exactly what Hitako did with a particular scene. The opening shot of the film, for example, especially the 'Shower' scene, is one of the most famous scenes in film history. Copying hitcos, directly from the shots looking at the drain in the shower and using the same screen! skree! skree! 'The impact of the sound - even as Hitako reverence - again, only confused by the stories. And, if you are William H. Messi (as Private Eye Arabogaster) does a factor in performance, but there is another split in your film mentality. Messi is a terrific actor - the best character actor in business - and his performance here is excellent; But as soon as good, attitude and delivery is pure David Mama (with whom he has worked many times), and probably outside of the context with what Van Sant is doing. So the film comes in the air with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, van Sant and Mamet. I felt I was watching the House of Good Will Psycho Games. <br /> <br /> As far as the performance goes, it comes as hard as Messi, and Anne Hiech (Marion Crane) does a good job of creating the main character to escape from the trap of imitation leeye. The weak link was Wigogon Montensen (Sam), who made Marin's lover so ridiculous and unexpected that why did he have to do something in the first place? And Vince Vaughn, who - as soon as possible to make it delicately - was just as terrible as Norman Bates. His full performance was that it played a role in an actor (and not that very believable); Disintegrating his speech with the 'spontaneous' explosion of mental laughter and separating his lecture makes him Norman more impressive than a character, completely unbelievable and provocative. It gives a movie a sense of rethinking 'true events' that you can see on a television show; It was fully sensitized to the film, Peter, facing the quiet sitting from Peter, was excluded from the grave shot, "Such a lucky Norman Bates was set, on the night of the rain when Marine Crane departed from his car and in his life - Supporting cast is Julian Moore (Lilya), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anna Hani (Miss Chambers)), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), ryansa Howard (Mr. loyari), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Rima (pyatrolamyana) and James legrosa (Charlie the car dealer). If there is nothing else, Van Sant's 'psycho' is a curiosity that shows that a good director, a particularly nice cast and a script that is a proven product, certainly does not provide insurance for success. Imagine, nowadays psycho-bubble, 'American Psycho' and the era of Hanib Lake lie away from a character like Norman Bates; But in this special story of Norman, his mother and his victims, there is still singular intimacy that will be annoying and horrible forever; But Van Sant could not express the feeling of panic over the fear of the film. Sometimes there was a movie that was designed to be determined directly from the video, this is it. Well still, it was not born. I rate this 2/10
