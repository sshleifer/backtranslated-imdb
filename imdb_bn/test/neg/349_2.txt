Yes, the video cover of this film wants me to see this movie as a child. This special cover tagline known as "Screams" was "Made Into Men!". It even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all kinds of cool glory images run through my mind. Perhaps a movie about a strange virus that could burn a person's flesh, perhaps a film of Amadea jammy that looks more bloody than what you usually get, a science test has been incredibly wrong, and now with the brain, weird men will survive and go to rampage their bones. Yes, these thoughts ran with my mind, there was no one like that there was no such thing as fishing on the island. This film is actually compared to any other. Similar to the island of Moreau and, in most cases, this film has bothered me, it is not enough scientist and adequate murder for my taste. These films have enough blood and enough blood for my taste. Yes I know, I have a strange taste, but I can not help it, my horror movies are not really really bloody or quick and exciting movie.
