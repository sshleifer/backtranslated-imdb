This is not unusual for a celebrity to face "wake up call". And, they should survive this event, they come in a deep understanding and compassion for their special fortune. However, in the case of the Comedian, they rarely have fun after their epiphany as they were before. Case with Martin Lawrence as such. Actually, I pay a lot attention to celebrities because my life has something better to do with my life than to watch others. So, most of the information that Lawrence gave before this movie was known to me. It was funny, unfortunately, all common. I gave a great impression that this guy's stand-up action was not very funny. Save big life messages for a book, just be fun to stage. If you want to see funny Martin Lawrence, rent some of the old Duff Jams. Do not rent Runteldat
