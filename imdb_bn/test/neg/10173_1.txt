Since you can read only good comment about this movie is created by someone who actually sees it in his church! However, the film started a good B-movie science fiction, everything was an entertaining entertainment, easy to watch movies, then everything looked like this religious Christ-saved-all-felt mode. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two main characters, two journalists, but it quickly introduces Jesus Freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this autobiological attitude. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
