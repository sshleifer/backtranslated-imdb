After studying business in Boston through the Boston West West, a cloistered young person came back! He quickly hopes to fill his son's shoes in Spanish-colonial Old California friends - a romantic thief who is known for kissing his girls after looting him. Colorful but intelligent M-Gm production cameras have a lot of talent before and after, but it never stops. It may be fun, Abbott and Costello's second string stuff, but Frank Sinatra feels lost and embarrassed in leadership. Cruel comedy and musical angles are hampered by poor staging (Sinnatra is sung at a time in a mirror, but one does not pay much attention to his performance, how it is reflected in this way!) Catherine Grayson falls for the governor's daughter Frank, and her high-profile trilling turns her song scenes into self-parody. Apart from Robert Carnitz's cinematography and modest industry, this "bandit" remains magnetless. * ****
