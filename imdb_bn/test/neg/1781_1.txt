Even in the case of most B-films, I have seen this movie the worst ever. A giant suite of graphics that is so poor looks a man more realistic. Oceanic waterfalls are especially ridiculous, this is a scene where they are on a mini-sub board and "water" seems frozen in its place. The problem of this photo is so much that I will be here in detail in detail. Not saying, I do not tell you that the WV toilet ball can do a good job for myself. Avoid this film at all, there are other B-grade movies which are terrific, but a good way to pass the time.
