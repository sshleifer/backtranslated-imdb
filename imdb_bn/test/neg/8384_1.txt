I do not seem to find anything that's good about these miniseries. Why do you ban chocolate because you can ban something more like smoking or alcohol? It is also an Australian program and stupid that it is faking all the sets in England and everyone is faking British pronunciation. Overall I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
