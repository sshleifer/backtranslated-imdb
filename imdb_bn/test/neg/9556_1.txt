I saw this movie on a British Airways flight from London to New York. I want to fall asleep. The story line was very thin and the editor crew extended them to stretch as long as they expanded. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was a supporter of an unlikely character that was difficult for me. Andy's acting ability is good but is not good enough for poor writing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell Linda, did a good job with Gary's romantic interest screenplay. I can not say anything bad about Andy, I always enjoy her acting. The problem here is that romances between Andy and Andy are so remote and incredible. Two big screens do not have a good pair. <br /> <br /> The movie ended in the end of the movie. Pope is a node and all are forgiven, come. This movie allows some happy endings and the authors seem to expect us to accept it. Gary does not change, and due to the death of only one dear friend, his condition becomes better. <br /> <br /> Before that many great movies should be seen. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
