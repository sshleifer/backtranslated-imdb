The Three Stagues are the greatest comedy teams in film history. For the only reason, they have a very good finish in Columbia with this short match. <br /> <br /> "Sapi bullfighters" is not just right. Guessed, this is not Joe Besser's fault at all. I personally feel that some of its shorts are quite fun, due to the fact that Stogas exited the usual fanfire and Larry is more likely to appear more and more accurately. However, do not just do this short. And anyone knows that this is their last short-lived show that has ever been shown, well that just adds total hatred. <br /> <br /> This picture mentions how many minor issues were in the last death breath. And how their little effort has been made. This short is so sloppy. This is an easily made shot of Kareli, "What is Matador?", Film years ago. If this truth is not bad enough, the studio actually deletes the elements and Larry into the footage (which was painted almost 20 years ago). Is not this thing obvious? Ridiculous or sad? You'll be the judge. <br /> <br /> <br /> This little part makes it sad that it's basically the Joe Jossey Showcase, through which she shows what she has (at least in this picture) curly-like-made-all -Complete-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do to make this brief. As a Larry fan, I must say that I feel somewhat disgraced to use it as a small "The Pantry Entts" of Laser to become popular. "I can not see, I can not see!" And Larry said, "Why do not you see?", When Besar clipped and said, "My eyes are closed", all levels are just wrong. <br /> <br /> Two brave soldiers got stuck. It's all year, Howard and Fine, there's very little to do to make this short. There is no fun bit with them. The only one who qualifies is Larry, hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, "dog", trying to be his dog. <br /> <br /> Can not blame a dynamic twin. Larry and Moore give them all. Ha ha and Fine do not give anything less than their best, how ridiculous things can be (and I'm sure they have their opinion at this point in their opinion). Their efforts failed since 1934-1959. <br /> <br /> I often enjoy many shorts which will be abandoned as something terrible. I'm all for them more "experimental", unusual shorts. At least those who contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone may agree, is not just good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thank you. If they were forced to leave this fashion, they had a serious injustice to the years they invested in order to make the audience cheerfully.
