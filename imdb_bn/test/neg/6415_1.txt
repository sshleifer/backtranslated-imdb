This movie has no respect for viewers during the time. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches it in 95 minutes. To achieve this, they should use the description very slowly and everyone wanders with some seemingly insane fingers. This movie showed something interesting in the plot, I care just about it. The problem is not playing, rather instead of pacing. The story is just weak Jim Carey is a qualified actor, but his efforts to inject a light humor into a serious role have been omitted from the place only. His style of humor is not generic, so he comes across as a watered-down version of himself. The 23rd incident creates deep sorrow and frustration for the people, but the reason for this is not logical. In most cases it is gently catchy. Jim Carr has much more efficiency in a serious role than the film's release. Do not waste your money in the theater. If you have sleep problems, rent this movie. If you're still awake even after 10 minutes, you've preferred more than me. I do not like film making lights and artistic aspects. A lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown with visitors to the audience or light, and it did not do anything to improve the already weaker story.
