Macbeth is one of the most frequent stories in the film and has been translated several times in many theater and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal in the kingdom and the power of a person to investigate. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romer Stommer) set Macbeth in the contemporary Melbourne underworld, trying his hand. A movie where characters change swords for guns (Romeo and Juliet of Ala Buz Luhamman) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a lively, violent, but critical flawless film. <br /> <br /> King Duncan (Gary Sweet) works for Macbeth (Sam Worthington). After the King was elevated to Glacier Thane (as Macbeth predicted by three documents), Macbeth began to set his eyes on the throne. One night the king stayed at Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) told him to kill the king for power. Macbeth smashes his master and feels his crown. But due to success Macbeth has emerged, when he will have to go to the harmful length of his secret secret protection. <br /> <br /> Okay, the first thing. Sam Worthington is the main culprit in the film. Macbeth has a sound on his screenplay ... annoying. I was not really concerned about Macbeth while watching the film. I had more sympathy for Victoria Hill's Lady Macbeth because she was annoyed at least working. Worthington Sullen across and across the whole of the wood and sitting in the wood. I felt that he was doing his best impression of Jonny Depp's best impression of George Jong's character ... but without charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a film, so I'm not sure whether it's its director or director, but it can weaken all the fingers gathered together at the same time. <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but Geoffrey Wright's Australian gangster motif seems to be a bit of a place to associate with. The frentically paced action mixed with long Shaksperian musings creates a pacing clash in the sequence film. I understand that Macbeth and the director wanted to use the original conversation intact. But hard, quick-footed scenes can be boring if not a little annoying after a three-minute silillocyte. <br /> <br /> The camera-work is very stylish, and in most cases it works well. I'm annoying about a thing that the camera will gradually blurred around, gradually. I just do not think that shot like overdone. It crosses the state of calm and stylish and instead becomes irritating. As for other, art direction and film image are fairly well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities of Macbeth; Stylish aspects, Shakespeare dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (strange sisters), and good help in cruel, bloody violence. Sam Wartington Macbeth has forgotten all these forces considering unclear scriptures. Macbeth's role was essential to combine everything together and in this case Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed with failures, Shakespeare forgot to forget about Macbeth.
