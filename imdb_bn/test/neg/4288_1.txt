The horrific psychological thriller that is almost painful, every aspect of it is awful. <br /> <br /> Top actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Olman have been completely lost, although they give good performance, but it's a wonder why they are bored. Mark Kasdan's script is a complete mess throughout the whole of Martin Campbell, but if you are unable to follow it, then accept it as a blessing. There are many nonsensical, crazy scenes that just do not make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is not a lot of help. <br /> <br /> Even if there is a possibility of conspiracy, the director completely destroyed Campbell's view. To avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, 26 February 1996 - Video
