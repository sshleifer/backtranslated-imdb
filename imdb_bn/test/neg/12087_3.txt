The government is a moody piece, the horror story of Jewish women, who lived in Scotland in 1830 after the death of his father, was present as a Gentleman to get work to support his family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, she does not call herself a fine subtle piece of writing - a ruthless child, a socialite with the dream of becoming an actress. He attacked an alliance with his employer and accidentally solved an important problem in his study of photography. Successfully, they start suddenly and uncomfortable, when their boyfriend's eldest son falls in love with despair (and unreasonably). <br /> <br /> And like a child, she fails to understand its consequences - in the end, she tries to cheat herself, who can make life for herself. Many people claim that this is something of a feminist proclamation, but I disagree. Whether it is intended or not, if the film is considered merely as a warning story, it is resonated with me. To the end, Rozina's greatest disappointment was true - she lied, that one man wanted to help both his father and his lover, and he had to do nothing else except destruction. In this way, the end of the film impresses me that he did nothing, he did not use it, he made him happy - and it is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> Do I need this movie? And teach me this lesson? definitely no. On the contrary, it was an extraordinary cinematography, unique score and I hope he gets his up-appeal, I would not have been stuck at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Supporters of a mini driver might be frustrated by his unfinished performance, but how it looks like; I suspect the young female devotees of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will be able to awake for the salary they expect, and I can not even think of this photography buffs holds even very little cultural details to be of interest. The film has three points of rewards for its visual style and score. Regarding the power of their other work, I think the performances of actors are so frustrating because of poor script and worse guidance, but ultimately, they are indefinite.
