In all the movies I have seen, this, The Rage, has to be the worst one yet. Change direction, LOGIC, continuity, plot-script and change the dialog cry out to me pain. "How could someone come with so painful"? Gary Busse is known for her "B" film, but it is a surefire movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> For example, around two dozen FBI and local law officers surround a trailer house with a zip wagner. Why are MAs inside the jeep and "police" confused about why all the police A huge gunfight ensues in few seconds, MA is killed straight away. Police hit the blast with the jeep and they exploded with the company. The police fall like a dominoji and drive around Zipa with Zia and do not get hit by a single bullet / palette. MA murder and Gary do not seem to notice - that guy is hard Actually a miracle, as many as 300 bullets of six shooters, such a miracle happened.
