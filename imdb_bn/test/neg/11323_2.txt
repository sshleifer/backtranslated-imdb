Trite and tiring, one liners almost cry to me. Left my 4-year-old room and ended up doing a maze. I do not know how old this age was, but the author did not want credit for himself. For the song, it's gently fun. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to visit. Although I have seen it more than once, they are still enjoyable. Whenever it comes, I try to encourage my child to see something else. A positive note, which voted 2 instead of 1, is encouraging moral values. Anyone, who was watching, would be encouraged.
