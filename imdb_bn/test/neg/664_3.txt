Another movie with a wrestling star. So far I have noticed ... wrestler can not play on the screen. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is awesome. What they say makes you laugh, and they can not be serious, they try to scare but they fail and stupid look. The acting is horrible, probably from the bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid .... Only some people were kept in the hotel because they were criminals, and they died randomly. The movie is stupid, I've always seen it is the worst. <br /> <br /> is the only idea, and for this reason I gave it 3 and died on Sunday in the 1st of Jacob 1. Murdering through the head and stories of his story were great. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific movie, and you certainly do not waste your time with it.
