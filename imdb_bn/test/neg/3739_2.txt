I loved John's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and was 'no time worth' to see. <br /> <br /> I thought he worked in his part 'okay' did the job. When he said, "Your co-star is related to" your "man, I look at the movement of his face or lacks it. <br /> <br /> If you like public music, I recommend the movie as a Saturday night video <br /> <br /> <br /> If you love her music, her video has a little music from her, but not much. <br /> <br /> So good ..
