I found code 46 is very frustrating. I was good at the idea and therefore was a great potential as a movie but it is not available to be distributed. Code 46 does not make good flow of thoughts and story shortages and tales. I thought that Tim Robins's character did not get better, for example. I thought that her family had more information and should have thought about life and I was not feeling it as it should have been completely ignored. In violation of Code 46, they first said that they could be genetically linked, but they did not have all the technology available, they printed their fingerprints and took genetic details during the investigation of fraud. I have constantly seen something happen and wait for the story line development and still find it still. I think the film was likely to be an intelligent stimulant but could be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be very clever and eventually lacked imagination. I would not recommend this picture to anyone, the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively small.
