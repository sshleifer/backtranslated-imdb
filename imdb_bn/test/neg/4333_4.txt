The author of "Prince" manages to gather in a nice cast, a decent story, a middle script and carefully gather into one of them boring, monotonous, amateur mess. In spite of the strong central performance of Frank Nassau, Prince, this controversial film apparently flew away from the scene, painfully separated from the hash. There should be tears of happiness when ultimately there comes tears of joy. A good example of how time and talent is a sad waste and does not dictate a film. <br /> <br />
