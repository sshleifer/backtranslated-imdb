This movie was not very well directed. They almost completely disregarded the book. I guess they are trying to save 2 times. The only upwardly 2 was that the actor who played fine was beautiful. Some of the main characters in dialogue appeared in a small gay book which was not in the book. The main parts of the book are once again cut. You had lost all the impact, it was not like a book hunting and kept me critically impaired. Also it was a strong language though short was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not comfortable) by a new character that there was no place in the book. One of my favorite characters (leprosy) has been poorly explained and illustrated. The book was more sinful than the movie than the real leprosy. All over despair.
