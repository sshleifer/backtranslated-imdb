I could give this movie 1, but I was so frustrated that, many times, I had to pay a little bit, the off-of-the-art fun. If a movie is so bad you will think chimps writing it. You would wish to chimps had written it. The dialogue is so hard that only it and copperplates will survive the nuclear holocaust. This movie exaggerates its horror by watching the scenes of scenes from the original Kerry (really a good movie). Choosing the intersplicing scene from the taxi driver in the baby talent. Do not hire alone because you do not have to live alone. Someone will need you next to ensure the badness of what you see. The worst actress of Millennium, facing the poor poor Amy Evving, as a single, crisp wood school counselor. The worst movie of the year (see Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
