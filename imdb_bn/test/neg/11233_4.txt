This image is filled with feelings, unusual flying which crunches a pilot like me, and irrelevant elements. For example, why introduce Rachel? He has nothing to do with the film without permission from him to run the "Follow Me" truck and to crucify Dorin's sightseeing. Many of the films have become a continuation of the Stupidity. On the other hand, when the plane (it was a B-26 or a -26? - used for both films) ends, then props rolling and there is no chalk in the places. That, plots, of course, but reveals it will be a terrible spoiler. Whereas, air force control taxis have to be started. The last (again, to avoid spoilers) involves much more lecture - at the beginning of the 30s sound film with final lectures. Here, Draffas just babbles on and over. The end also includes a radical violation of the airplane protocol and a couple of incontinence / impossibilities I will not describe. What a dull and disheartened effort!
