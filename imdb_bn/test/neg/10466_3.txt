Another Indian legend that you've ever heard before is loose. As the name implies, it is a vengeful fraud that people still prefer to exploit skeletons while using them. Naturally, the field of ancient graveyard (you can say, "Poltestist?") Cleched greedy land developers were upset by building stuff. <br /> <br /> CGI, if it is even better, its effect may be even more. Traitors look, but they skimped the budget, and it shows - ridiculous effects. The invisible creature should probably keep away from the stage of some of the first killings-which may have added some mysteries or the upcoming relics to the atmosphere-but the illiterate director showed us the first five minutes, which looks like, and it was not impressive. The death is done only, with weakly CGDI again. I think ancient spirits are always used to cheat special effects. As "hunt", they show that they are going to laugh at any moment when they are fools screaming. It's always obvious that it's going to get: shows only a character that shows a few lines, strange sounds are heard, CGI points fly, the character exits. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> Still, some of these visual traits are a chasing scene, which is actually worth seeing. Unfortunately, the director does not think of anything else for his machine when it comes back again (so it is often used) as a device. Overall, it's pretty stupid, but I've seen bad. This flick is cheap, but it's a wonderful fun to see.
