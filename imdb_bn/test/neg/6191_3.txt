Peppe Le Moko, starring Charles Boy, wanted international criminal mastermind in different countries of Europe, and to keep free, he hid himself in Kasab, the mysterious part of Algiers, even before the police even reluctant. A senior officer from Paris was sent to catch Le Mokok once and for all. For Le Mokor, though Kasba allows him to be kept in police custody, but at the same time he becomes prison - a place where he can not go, because at the moment he knows, he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Bauer's performance was good, and I understand why he was nominated for the Oscars. He has captured the essence of this character - at the same time very dangerous and still very passionate. The movie itself, unfortunately, had quite a lotdown. Several parts of the story are incompatible, in which I will mention two. At first the idea was that police would not enter Kasab. This was explicitly mentioned at the beginning of the local commander's film, and in the context of the movie, it has been mentioned that in fact the police had entered regular casualties. So, the commissioner, Janevar's counsel, will not enter the police and inspector Sliman's statement (Joseph Caliayo also has a good performance) that they did not even get advice from Kasab. Lee Muko - It was very difficult to believe that the criminal mastermind was done - so fast he can take Gabiike (Hadie Lammer) to his shore where he entertained local people to sing love songs and then released Kasab, to find him, Give up I understand the mockery of the final few scenes, of course, Pep only let the freedom of his prisoner (Kasbah) find out the true freedom of his capture (because he shot the policeman.) I just think it is impossible that someone like Leo Moko will be trapped . <br /> <br /> It is valuable to see for low calorie purposes, but story is frustrating and incompatible. 3/10
