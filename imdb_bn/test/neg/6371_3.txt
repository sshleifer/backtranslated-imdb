I was a fifth language arts teacher, and after reading this book (which students liked), then we saw the movie. They laugh loudly! Unfortunately, it's not a comedy! Acting was so awful, I felt that I was playing a bunch of kids around. Imagine my student line and through the fun of closing and through the whole way. I agree with them, sometimes, it was quite bad. Nevertheless, I will again show fun to the students, and compare the book with the book. We have diagramed a vane (what the teachers knew), to show what was both and what was different, so there is an educational value to show it. I noticed that another adaptation is shooting for 2005 so we can expect that the acting will be good!
