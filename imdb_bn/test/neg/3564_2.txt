A sad poisonous teenager is a socially active elderly lady who does not want to use shade or cinnamon in her window, there are many bad things. She steels things collected from her, peeps over her, calls scandal, and runs mixed unpleasant tricks on her. Curious, he does not keep a secret from her. First, he does not seem to care in one way or another that he is disturbed. Then he began to pay tribute to her for her cruel respect. <br /> <br /> Remember some unreasonable things. One that peeps the night through a blade of glass from a brighter bright spot. In real life such a thing does not happen. A blade of glass works as a mirror for a more brilliantly protruding party. She would be able to see just nothing. Besides, everybody can sit inside his inner enlightened room and find inside him. <br /> <br /> Another illogical thing is that naughty teenage acts as a milk-donor, and one of them seems to be picking customers every morning. Easy to work, if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw a small film about love in a public show. In the end, there was no single open eye in the house. A short film about love, foreign language films for those who do not like to read subtitles. There are not many words spoken in the film, but the film is mostly silent. A certain rest in peace
