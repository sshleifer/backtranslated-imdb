One understatement I say was frustrating. An amateur film made by professionals. I was leaving the theater on two or three occasions (something I never did) I was really locked up by Claris Lichmann. She is the true ring, the only one I would say. These new women are less modern than 30 year old George Cooker women. These are "acting" to try to stay with us, but their "contradiction" is exactly the same as in movies, as always. The real fun was based on a crisp, chaotic and very funny script. A skilled direction and an unpublished throw. All the elements that are missing here TV actress with model and Oscar nominated / winner. There was nothing organic about it. The whole thing has been copied in the moment without a clear purpose. 2/10
