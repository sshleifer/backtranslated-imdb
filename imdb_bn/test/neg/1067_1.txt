I wasted time seeing this movie, I came back again! I felt sick later, but it did not touch me anyway. The audience tried to accept the audience to feel bad, but I could not take care less. The letters are soulless and stupid. You will not get an explanation for some scenes and it will not leave any thought after bringing your own explanation. All the filmmakers have problems, but since you do not feel for them, you do not believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I can write well in English then I will never stop. But I can not, so I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this.
