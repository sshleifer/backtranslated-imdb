I love the documentary Andy Goldwright Dock was great. I looked at this one - but was very disappointed. I knew about the ear and the men in the pen station were confused by the idea of ​​his lonely death in the room. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believe. The only story here is sadly in the eyes of disguised women who worked with a ugly little-known married person. In some absence as explained by this man's terrible behavior, we infrequently revolve around repetitive clips and are chronically worried - shots of his enthusiastic buildings Actually, some of the interesting but urgent films make us think about that person. The damaged soundtrack is an emotional touch that is not completely absent from the reference. The clear gift of the ear does not excuse his mistresses in his behavior or martyr. This film seems to give great artists free passes and thus the director and his mother seem to want to create sympathetic figures - I can not buy it.
