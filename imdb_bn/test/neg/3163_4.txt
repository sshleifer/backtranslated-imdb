Actually I've met Han Su Ying and seen him portrayed by American actress, which is not similar to any Chinese, when I see this movie why not spin my head, why not get Nancy Cowan instead of Hollywood ... at least it More story is true ... for love ... Dr. Han Suugh Chinese I know I've personally met him <br /> <br /> and on the whole cast Kaiyi .... So low Asian face a movie about an Asian love story also surprised me <br /> <br /> I feel good acting, but in Asian love story without the real Asian faces, the plot is so stupid and full load of the belly <br >>> <br /> Like this other movie, I know 'Conqueror', when I see John Owen as Changis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and make things worse. How can a person born in the fleshy step come with the southern accent of Alabama ??? !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br />
