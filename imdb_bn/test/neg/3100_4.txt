It has been said that the director of small budget looks like a blockbuster. Albert Pine looks as small budget pictures as high school A / V project film. This picture was quite lacking in all sections. Actually each scene drags too much, "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, Rob Lowe equals scruffy equally with acting, and the poor stripping euro-pop numbers stop the movie a dead suspension. On the plus side, Bart Reynolds has done a great deal of work with (which is not too much), Mario Van Pahelles is surprisingly modest and the ice keeps one of the longest strikes B-movie gangsters in another. Not Pine's worst thing (Urban Menace), but certainly not his best (average gun).
