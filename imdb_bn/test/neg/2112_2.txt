How is this world an awesome creator on earth? It's one of the most stylized pieces of garbage I saw in a long time. It's not just morally written, it's just a way to edit and edit a product. Cemetography is so dreadful of Manipulut and Origin and Montage beyond belief Jumble The real ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are fine to start at all, but where the production / direction team has a large gap between the dirty idols in them, in a paragraph. And this is a scientific series? I am a physician and what I can say is that the science of this film is boring, almost annoying to see. I really felt bad for involved actors that I was really remarkable about.
