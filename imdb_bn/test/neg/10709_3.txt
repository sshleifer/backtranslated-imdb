This is a male bashing bonanza I have seen Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea seems interesting. This can be a good movie, and the plot is not seen as male batching, but certain specific references to men are really annoying. I still see the movie again, though it tries to free herself by quote it at least that the women in the film do not really claim to be non-violent, but it does not really compensate for the tiring men -bashing. I mean, I understand a bit, it's part of the film's plot, but let's get it tired soon after. Not only that, but most of the women of the world have become homosexual and easily and some remaining heteroxylics will become minor in the "closet". It's just very incredible. With cultural or religious restrictions there are many more women that surround it, it is completely impossible. I mean that I know his science-consciousness, and I love the scientist, but at least at least one of the best sciences is available, and it is very unlikely. The word "strangers rather than true words" appears because the fiction seems to be welcomed at least, but not always true. This is not that movie. Even more so, the film has some good acting and last moral of the story, something that happened, something wrong happened, it would make some free but not enough.
