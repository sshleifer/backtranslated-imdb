In a world where people can live forever, they spend the whole movie to die. The first one, if you insist on watching this movie then it will be silent first, do not worry if you miss a plot, the hell will not talk even for the first 70 minutes of 87 minutes even after you mute. The main cock should move fast until it dies. Do not worry about why you do not know or how you died in your attention. Once you receive it the "good part" get it muted. Oh, how well you know the part, space suits with WWII weapons wait for a lift scene with two morons. As far as these weapons do not seem to be that the first drama laser tag pistol and CO2 cartridges were bundolars. The only remaining remnant of a plot took place in the middle of a flaming ball and a semi-hot dog, which seemed to be that he attacked Wolverine. After listening to "plot", they could not talk again if you wanted. None of the four people of this movie can work remotely, even a little bit, you will be good at acting in the kindergarten theater. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Seriously it will leave you to ignore the ignorance. The best "set" is basically Windows Wallpaper backgrounds. Ships are basically flying wrenches, waiting for some barges that wait like whales. I have not heard so much noise in my whole life. There are buttons on their wrists (large palmometer) that they can place in "war mode" and super running mode (they make them vague). It will remove their power reserves seriously, but they can find the bits of the wheels for their power recovery. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth in July, I was just a sparker. <br /> <br /> So I can capture the character that this "mother" is a space ship captain and goes to the desert. A rocket died for a while. After 6000 years, her daughter remembers her mother's memories through a few capsules (I'm not too excited) after her future. However they jabber for another 10 minutes and then a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" has started our solar system. It is explained how it goes back to time or something, it really does not matter if I guess it happens. Roll credit was gravely to the whole script on a cold paper, unless they were really horrifying details of the battle scenes horribly. <br /> <br /> After watching the credit, I now smiled more than the whole movie. Dietary supplements like "galactius sarcophagus", and thanks to the special thanks to George Lucas. <br /> <br /> I could not really give 99 cents for a movie, but seriously some body owes me for this. Most often I hear the comment "I want my life back" after the movie. You have to give some praise, but the time and effort of this movie is important but why?
