Seriously, if I want to create a movie that creates a zero sense, it will never do that and it can show the lesbian scenes as its only high-point. I <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone could make a good movie at least, and the story was not so slow and long-winded. The story ends with nothing without credit means nothing. What a waste of time. I never received 147 minutes of my life and hope others can learn from my mistakes.
