Calling a "Sunday School" movie can be generous, because even as a Christian, I think religious message is so quantitative that I do not want to see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you will not get left behind at the rapture." There was no love. I guess when you are entitled to this, I do not believe in goddess depicted in this film. The person who received the spiritual answer was like the calculator Dracula. <br /> <br /> As well as the spiritual / religious elements, the script was tedious - saying the same thing over. It may be ready to play something that could not provide firm belief for the first time, so they said the same thing over. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed the final scene. I thought it was pushing the head of the school without hitting someone on the head or Sunday. The movie was not bad at all, but only mostly. <br /> <br /> I'm on the side of more clear movies that are well done and it's true in a non-publicized way. None of them, I'm sorry. I took my family in this movie, to support such a movie. Now I want my money back.
