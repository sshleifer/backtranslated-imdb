George and Milldale are really a real movie. This attempt to translate a successful TV series on the Big Screen was a frustrating failure, as it often happens. <br /> <br /> Intelligent and clever drivers have disappeared from the TV show. The plot is a misleading character and misidentification is a common English French which is not funny enough or weird enough to express a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Die-Hard George and Mildred fans want to see the final episode of the tide's output (Mildred died on the hepatitis death before the film was released), but others would have to invest more time wisely.
