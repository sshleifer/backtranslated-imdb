All right ... I even want to say a few words from my heart even before introducing less or less constructive criticism of the film ... these movies !!!! You do not really see the sweet bundy-bands and London-activating, non-plot stories. So, why do I think the movie looks so bad: 1. There is no story line. There is no plot. The director did not have the feeling of trying to create a mystery. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, one-and-a-half hour promotion, which is some sort of bunch-still-still-looking-like- "BSB" -Band ... All the people in the school have perfect abs, not fat or Ugly young people ... There is no good looking girl in the film, not one. The main character is wet in the swimming pool, or all the sweat in her bed ... poor people A sweat sweat like that would be horrible to go. 3. Can those guys do anything good with their abilities? Anything good? Keep the fire away in the old barn or get into the accident instead of just running things broken and showing her friends who are helping her friend in front of each other. 4. Wooden acting. The main character has only two expressions on his face. Expression number one: Sorry. Expression number 2: Trying to look seductive but still looks sad ... The boy has 4 people in the band: In the main role, his best friend who got the accident, blonde, and the fourth ... What was the fourth name? I think he spoke twice throughout the film: At the beginning (he said, using "power" will not kill those who jumped from the hill) and the second time when he and the bloody girl lost it, the film can be done in addition to it, and no one can Will not notice ... However, my judgment: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Friends - Do not go see it. Very small step, no mystery, no hot girls. Girls - At least actors like ... I would like to tell you this advice is to get a soundtrack from this movie - this is the only thing about me.
