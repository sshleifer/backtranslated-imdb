Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy couple in history, and so deserve, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit her, and candy instead of taking him some lice to eat eggs and nuts. The orally leg-cast string starts with the strange start of Stan and drives Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out of the window and hanging in it, and directing Oli to look at the ceiling. When the situation goes down, Stan gets dressed like a wool, as the doctor wants to leave him, and he also starts to sit in the syringe, which is awake, he is filled with sleeping medicine, it is effective when running it. (Which you can say is a car with a car in front of a big screen.) Some favorite snapsticks and not very bad (although repetitive and slightly anticipated) classic comedy, this is not great, but it's a black and white film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy Comics Number 7 of the comics is OK.
