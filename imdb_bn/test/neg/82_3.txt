STMD! Not a terrible movie, but it's pretty forgotten. This light is mostly deliberately poor and unknowingly poor for everyone, so you can meet with headaches or eye pressures. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. Essential nudity for teen slasher flicks, of course, along with archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie is not just gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and cheek comedies in more tongue. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend you use that while watching this movie. Based on a scene that shows imagination or humor, I often respect a movie, but this film is sadly lacking in this film.
