** Spoiler * This is very irrelevant to the end ** ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief introduction to Gure's movie director HH Luis. He talked about how the movie was lost, and then the director was found few years after the death. He also talked about how the amount of blood used in the cow's counts is measured. Blood feasts were 2 gallons, 10,000 standard 5 gallons. But then he went and claimed that Dr. Gore had 15 gallons. I want to know where 15 gallons are half. Seeing the film, I saw very little around 15 gallons. Agree, there was a total amount of blood in the blood, but there was no place near 15 gallons. Some of the isolation scenes are apparently beautiful and realistic, flesh strings and all, but I will not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "Finish!" That word is known? What you say to the last half of this movie is that. After the Iger character entered into acid bath, the film was slow in a painful crow. There was no synchronized end, it was not in a benchmark 90 minutes before it was available. He stopped with a stranger van, total strangers, big deal! Whenever you keep a person (I will not say to a person because he is not a person's person) very innocent about the world around him. The doctor who teaches the girl teaches the girl, so she loves the person she meets. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we can not choose acting, instructions, or even the groom ... I would go with the likes A and B were both incredible !! The bad dreams of performing the cats and the bad dreams I had seen in my eyes were enough while they were talking to a person. But, I made it through film, and got stronger. Very bad I'm ROBO CHIC After finishing, I could not say the same <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. I can generally take the levels of my vinegar into a well stride, but once each time, you bite that back in a movie. I think this movie has closed a hand or a foot (yes ... * *) * I have enjoyed a lot of scenes where the good doctor is looking at his future victims and his eyes are open and absolutely scary. At the Blood Fest, Fuad was similar to Ramsis when he saw that lady in his Katrina shop and then did not use her power. I think this movie seems to have left Fuad's power. <br /> <br /> * The final trial * The film should have been lost. Good day <br /> <br /> -Scott-
