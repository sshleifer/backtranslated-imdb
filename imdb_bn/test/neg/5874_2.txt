Clint Howard, brother of more genius Ron Brother, in this psychological field is a terrible horror comedy that provides children with ice cream and kills people. Trying to make a film of 'So Good That's Good', this movie misses that mark with a good mile and instead 'so bad that it will be seen as ... well ... baid'. Whitter it is the constant 'Shoe Advertising' movie, pillow stuff 'fat baby', or the sleeping inspiration 'horror' which has poured me into the film, I do not know, I know that I've spoiled this movie (and it's a for b-awesome films A guy who has a soft spot). Paul Norman likes to create movies in both pornography before and after, his only mainstream film. Seeing pornographic scenes, Wonderful choice is a great choice as a terrible act, unclear tales, and humorous conversations. Interestingly, this is not the nudity of Turkey (another reason to keep clean) <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
