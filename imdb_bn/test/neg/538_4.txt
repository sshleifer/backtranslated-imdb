It is perfectly ok that people die in an animation, but there is a lot of death in it. Starting from the very beginning, fighting stories, fighting, death, and revenge almost all. It goes on for full and one and a half hours. It was interesting at the beginning, but I was very tired before the show passed halfway. Unlike other animations, this one lacks humor. There are not many interactions in characters. The best thing about it is that the fight of the sword war looks quite good and the characters look beautiful.
