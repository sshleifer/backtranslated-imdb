Perhaps only if Jane Austen was enjoying my darling in the work. Perhaps I'm very fierce in this adaptation, but I'm afraid that I favor the A & E version. It's hard times for me to portray Mr Darcy with someone else than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The letters seem shallow, and often the dialogue is mandatory. Lizzy felt so lacking in the real sense that the book is so clear. His performance for Wichham was over, and then his sudden Darcy was not credible. <br /> <br /> Dersi is well illustrated, I will give him. He managed to maintain the miracles that required, but I felt that he did not project the feeling and inner struggle which makes his character particularly happy with the proposed scene. <br /> <br /> m And Mrs. Bennett played well, but felt lacking in many ways. Mrs. Bennet's average temperature is not fully understood on its performance. <br /> <br /> m Collins was a good illustration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, they saw some freedom on the order of events that were present at the first meeting with Darcy Lady C and did not join Lijzy on his visit to Miss Lussus and Sir William Collins. <br /> <br /> During dance scene, dancer was a dancer. Legacy and Darcy dance where they can lose their intensity, because no one can remember that they look at the shape of the ballroom floor. At least this BBC version excluded dialogue between Leiji, Darcy and Sir William, when he praised his dancing because he was very ill. <br /> <br /> I was interested in the moment, but overall I found a disappointment in this edition. If you are not like me, then I will not suggest this movie and you are very much cut off by such consequences. <br /> <br />
