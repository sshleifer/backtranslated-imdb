Jason Lee loves to give this puppy the fastest promise of the film, but it is not enough to separate from any other happy family comedy. <br /> <br /> This live-action, CGI-enhanced adventure shows a shameful police dog (Jason Lee) physician scientist Dr. Simon transformed a super dog by an accident in the Lab of Laboratrix (Peter Deanclage). The underdog sets her in mind to save the city while trying to keep her identity - a challenge that she can both talk and fly. <br /> <br /> Strange joke raises a smile, but human sideklicks of Underdog (James Beluci and Alex Newberger as father and son) are dull as expected. A superman has been seen for very young children. Or Spider-Man Or even chagrin dog ??
