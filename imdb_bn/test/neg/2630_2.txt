This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. I have started looking at a movie that I do not expect too much and it's exactly what it has been distributed ... not much! In fact, I expected even less to end up giving. My First Response When I saw the opening part of the film, I would probably end up with it rating of "4". I thought in my mind that it has great photography and a hunting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> While the film progressed, the ratings went down below my path and mainly played pedestrians and a plot that went on in the end, both stupid and insulting were absolutely weird and wasted at the beginning. At the end of the film, I agreed to rate it more than "1". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
