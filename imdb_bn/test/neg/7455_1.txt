Why can each series of good movies in Canada, the other then reflect the roles in the work? I grabbed Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train debris. I just could not change the channel, it just sapped my willfulness. His fantastic story, which has played the role of IMDB "credit" with this extraordinarily, has apparently never worked. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, bad look, bad music, bad hair, bad movie pictures. It just keeps moving. The movie really has nothing to recommend it. If you are looking for bad action films to enjoy laughing, but there are other movies that you will not need to scratch out after your Retinas. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie does not get money from the government for financing, otherwise I am not paying the tax again.
