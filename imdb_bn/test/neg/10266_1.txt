<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - In the previous episode we tell about the events of the past that indicate the victory of mankind on the demons, (yes it is OK). <br /> <br /> I can tell you "now" which does not have anything to do with Demand because it is completely new story with a different backdrop. Bawa as usual, makes a casual look that does not seem to fit even in the original context of the story. Scary, and acting like this is showing a demonstration of giants through a TV set, oh God, I'm not going. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> Naturally you will find ridiculously dubbing, impressive scenes, and no nonsense answers will be treated. <br /> <br /> If you're one of the DVD archive collectors, you probably want to avoid it like a plague. It's no way around the first, so you want to avoid like plugs.
