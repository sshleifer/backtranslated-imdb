"Carlitos Angels" is a fool of "Charlie's Angels", which is sometimes not afraid to confuse himself, but this does not mean that the film is also on the criticism of the audience - it is amateur and teenager (I think "fast" Motion "1914 is almost closed). Attacker rap music often sinks in dialogue and the film feels more than that, even though it lasted for more than an hour With a very hot and adorable, wonderful fat body of the girls, and even if they are not naked, their teams give the imagination a little bit, and check out their IMDB pages that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually going through a film career; I wish him luck, because the picture is bad, but he (and also the other girls) gave it any power And I do not mind seeing him again on the screen.
