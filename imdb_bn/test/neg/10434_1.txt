Just because I disagree with calling this a stoner movie makes a look of weed. I can not even imagine this as approaching "Stone Classic". This unit will be called "granz film" The movie definitely plods along a dirty plot. Occasionally I am surprised that if the script is omitted and shuffle or it is completely lost and it simply tries to wing it. This movie reminds me that the children are acting and the story is going on. <br /> <br /> The letters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who died? When? What? And how do you work when your friend overdoses? The complete lack of passion and isolation connections from reality. <br /> <br /> For the droning guitar soundtrack that is with each scene: enough! It was open to see the open menu screen where the same track is constantly hidden in the background, not front or back front. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to hoping that the plot will be arranged gradually, and the performance and dialog improvements or something, somehow a coherent movie will focus on this mess. It never happened after 112 minutes.
