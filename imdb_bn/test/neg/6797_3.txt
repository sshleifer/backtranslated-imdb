It was an unrealistic show. In short, it was Doug who was kidnapped about this child-many trips. Seriously he may feel guilty about a flying assault and is then guilty of feeling guilty for flying. Animation grating and unpleasant and joke were cheap. <br /> <br /> It has been broadcast in Sweden as part of the "Disney Time" event and I think it likes something but then I became 13. <br /> <br /> Why I never received the letters were very green and purple. What was up with that? <br /> <br /> Really a terrific show. Unexpectedly, it has created a movie that I have never seen, but I have no great expectations for it.
