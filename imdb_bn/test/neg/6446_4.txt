My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on TV. Someone like to take revenge on The Nedars in a movie theater, I found this movie as a highly anticipated rebuild. Nerds are simply replaced by Dorks. I happened to be mad by his craving by being able to predict exactly what would happen in every scene. Cast was nice, especially Amanda Bains. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The title should have been "Revenge of the Darks" only. Probably take revenge of the sequel Dark 2.
