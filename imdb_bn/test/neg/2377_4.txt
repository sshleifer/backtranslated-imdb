This movie is a perfect example of a movie that can not be successful only in high budget. It was clear that there was a lot of time and effort in this: Animation Liquid, Extra, And Excellent - The Soundtrack is not least memorable without the last song of SÃ©ton Deon (at least I think it was her). Muscular scores strong full orchestra components. Animators and Music Composers Codos! 9/10 However, the stories and characters fall flat. It has been 'felt,' that is expected, uninteresting and plain uninteresting. Character is individual personality but there is something very desired. They bother me to the end. I have tried really hard to like it, but I did not care about the story - it was the Activation-Avenar Plot. There was no fun 'joke'. It was inducing the expected vomit from the beginning to the end. The dialogue was cliche and horror - especially the last line "It is not ... which gives you wings, love it!" Whatever it is, I feel cringing. I wish I would soon be up and running. I'm not the only one - the people I thought were boring. If you go to any of the sights, check out the film of the Estonian and Obelix Cleopatra. This time there was a waste.
