The only good thing to make this movie was that it made me hungry for the ice cream, except for the part of the dead body. The film is the most impressive one I've seen for a long time. When "ice cream king" died at the beginning, I was laughing so hard because the child took ice cream from him and began to eat. His mother asked him to say something, and said, "Leave me alone and let me eat ice cream free so that I can get my acting career under the drain at an early age." Think about that right for a line. Then I was surprised that the ice cream princess was behind her ice cream truck. Anyone was going to loot in his twenty hundred? I have never seen an ice cream truck window. It looked pretty stupid. You can forget about acting because it's just awful. Forget this movie and go to Dairy Queen and get ice cream.
