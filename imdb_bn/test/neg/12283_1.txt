One of the worst movies I've seen this year is. Everything about the film "amateur" screams. For a movie in the 1800s, everyone spoke like 1990. Acting, especially the white slave owners, the people of the game, horrible. About an hour after this movie, I went away. What is a waste of time and effort? See Steven Spielberg's superior "Amstad" for a better film on this topic.
