This movie tries to tear the pretender, but the movie is even better. These movies have really terrible special effects and a stupid plot. To find out the reasons for the disappearance of military and scientists, the forest insider is a roughly annoying male delta commando and a combo of beautiful but difficult female renderers. None of them are very bright. All the characters seem to be alone in the forest and headfirst be willing to run in a spear or sword and in their death. Some of the pterotics are too big and a bundle must be spent. But animal intimateities are ridiculous like death scenes. The authors may think that each clich√© is used. If you are looking for a stupid deaf festival, it can fill the bill. I saw this night was very slow so I was sitting through the whole thing. I acknowledge that after a while I've seen this bad thing. This movie is too small to break. I am surprised to have produced junk like this.
