The derivative drill stole from every Soviet film note and weakly failed. I have gone with the experience of the generally organized religion and the special flaws of the Russian Orthodox Church (remember that this comment comes from a person of faith). Even the outstanding cinematography kept me unknowingly. I've spent her most beautiful moments with great efficiency that it is being imitated badly. I will not recommend watching this movie until I have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its native language, the miracle in the face of communism, and the seventh soul. This is a narrow point of view (and almost) from a narrow point of view that did absolutely nothing for me.
