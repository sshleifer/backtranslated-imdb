... at least the first half time. When the Navy's three friends with the navy took part in the Navy's program, it would have been better and more difficult. The second half of the photo is valuable, especially for the action sequence and to stop the mortgage of the early 20th century, but it is like a lower dental. Also, do not see this image because it contains Anger Rogers. She has an important role, but it's a small one. <br /> <br /> This film works tourism business with three New York City friends and Sally (Ada Rogers), a singer candy candy salesgirl along with Avenue. The first World War broke, three friends seem totally indifferent to the struggle, yet the Navy has entered. At least three industrialists (Bill Bull as Billimo) are taken to the air by two other commanding officers (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Squits). To make things even more complicated, Sally has fallen in love with one in three, but there are three ways before she goes to war. <br /> <br /> The picture is a little more interesting than board ships, mainly due to the shots near our ship and chemistry between three friends. However, at the age of 49 James Glesson feels toothache a bit taller, especially when the signature in the listed office said that you were between 17 to 35 years of age. The obvious error of a real movie that believes that everything outside the Navy's scenes is torn apart with minimal care, or, I want to say, its lack. Just before WWII, we all dressed in fashion in 1931 and driving in 1931 - there was no effort to bring this film in phases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You saw them in the last 45 minutes, including some scenes from the Zinger Rogers and the Navy's suicide mission, you saw it valuable to see everything here. The rest is padding.
