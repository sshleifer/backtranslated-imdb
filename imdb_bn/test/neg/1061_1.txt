This movie is surprisingly poor. It was on television when I was present at a workplace and was shining in the Chess Mateo conversation, waiting for Leslie Nilssen's presence. It took me a few minutes to realize that it was not actually a comedy, it was taken seriously. Remember that someone is actually sitting and writing this movie, and worse - other people have funded it and it gave green light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This strange picture is so poor that You looked at yourself and wondered how it actually funded and how a TV channel should pay for it's right to air. While trying to fire each other from the sky, the dialogue between Hero and Bidyi was particularly painful, this is a conversation that was generated by the speakers of Texas's "Speak and Spell". It's the worst. Though funny
