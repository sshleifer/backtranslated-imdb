I thought this was a very bad movie. I was watching this movie all the time, but I could not help but how bad it was and how it was down to the bottom of the drain was $ 3.69. The plot was so disgusting. They did a wonderful job at the beginning to explain who dates to high school, but they did not really explain anything afterwards. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself, because they have not seen the need to explain. I basically realized what happened, I think. What was the confusion I had before all, what was the bloody nose, phone call etc? Is this guy coming back? Was the wife "Keri" or some channel? Who knows? You certainly will not be after watching this movie.
