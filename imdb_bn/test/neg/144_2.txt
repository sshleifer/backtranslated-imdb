I was able to direct this way through this movie, but it was silent because of its lack of entertainment. My friends and I are fans of H.K. film, but WOW This movie has it all, and all means I should not have a movie. Long time running for unused and stereotyped characters, special effects, chips, robots, 20 double-stroke jumps, unforeseen situations, unreasonable "mess" and "trick", primary school premises, stupid killings and even more. Jen-X Police was a decent film and this film has become more difficult to bear. Quite simply, if you are thinking of seeing this movie ... no.
