Take Me: Yet another lame PG-13 Horror Movie Expected Horror Strategy and a Derivative Plot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> wall creak. The basement has something wrong. With some of these horror movies, Clichas, Sam Raimi has smashed the walls of another house in the country - The Messengers, which is probably the most desperate tricks of the most anticipated horror strategies most likely to be recycled in an intriguing trick (and sometimes, even worse), past horror Movie <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family comes to an old South Dakota Firmhouse, another attempt is to reconnect the father (Dylan McDermott) family, especially with their former drunkards, in a more subtle small area than their home in Chicago, driving Daughter Jessica (underlying Christian Stewart). When Jessica starts trying to make a little surprise from the polarists of the house, there is panic. Some teenage girls who cry out to the gentleman, think that her parents do not trust her. How could they? The message awaiting a real horror movie in message engineers, which will be barbarous later. This is the sequence of anger in the sequence which is asking more than the family's crop (Alfred Hittak's Best Writing, Directly Rip Off of Badd)? Will it be a scary house in the history of the Amvivill Horror or the Paltzst? Or will you be familiar with the latest horrors ring and grunge extraordinary phantoms? Hack, the film also manages to move two scenes of some real bad horror movies, such as the Amavivil 3-D and the Middle Cold Crick Manor. Probably all the Pang Brothers really wanted to have a B-level horror movie, but would it be this bad? They could not stop ripping from the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * 5
