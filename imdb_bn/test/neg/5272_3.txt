Kevin Spacy is my favorite actor all the time, without any doubt with other actors, when it comes to great actors. He even pulled off a good Irish accent, even with ordinary Decent Criminals. But Kevin Spacey, as a Mafia leader? Or even a thief? I'm not so sure he can go so far. The movie did not give any idea to me and the story was not right for me. <br /> <br /> I know again that the IMDB is going to write me ten more lines. But I'm not sure what I can say about this movie because I'm still trying to find it. Not stupid, is not it? But I'm sure many of the IMMb users are in the same situation because I'm fine now where you want to say a line or two in a movie, but now you have to do ten lines now? Wow, it should be. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
