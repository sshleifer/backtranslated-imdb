In the beginning of 2002, after the "Kremson River" and "Brotherhood of Wolf" were hit, production firms were insane for a short period of time for French supernatural movies, so most of the films were frozen or their "direct-to-video" fate. However, B-movies have little tradition of opposing France, America, the United Kingdom or Italy, and it has quickly become the case that the "Samoirus", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crisson River", was unnecessarily advised to restrain order, which is a kind of magic French was not always in the movie. When they are flopped, the producers take back their normal rent: Derivative Farses or high self-referential respect to the French New Wave by former critic of "Les Caahier's D film". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This is your Bai-The Book Slashar film mixed with myths and mythological references, and you get Bibbooski female letters, a French university is like a US campus and plots twists are so lazy, you're not taking care of it because you guess it's an hour ago, the movie Even before it started <br /> <br /> These elements make fun of the 70s or 80's B-Movie and you expect them to be in the movies of 70s or 80s. However, we are no more than 80 and have warned the director Doug Headline, because this tribute to Slashar's film is nothing more than a derivative slash film. The title itself is not stupid, and since the early 80's, he wrote such a picture as a critic, but for the first time as director, he showed lack of skill and ambition, which created a bore called "Broselide". <br /> <br /> When you get together from the Movie Gulf and you keep them in the hands of skilled and innovative directors such as Wes Craven or Quantin Tarantino, you will get a "Scream" or "Death Proof", a movie that is from old guilty pleasures But these clich√©s are glorified and add a great deal to them. This is called "talent" and because of that you can not confuse these recent movies with the original inspiration of a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "In Brokiland" with a lazy path and reproducing the worst elements of the past films (unfortunately) for male viewers, most of the unwanted nudity is absent) . There is a strong similarity between the "Broccoliung" and "Halloween 3: Season of Witch" plot (potentially unknown) and in the Halloween night, the miracle duodic evil rituals and some innocent efforts to accept the world. Even the "Halloween 3" plot is more sensible than this, it means that something serious happened to "brokilange".
