Apart from Cop Rock, the show where the child dies from eating a hamburger in the bed, it is the worst and the worst event to survive regularly. If Jason Lee's film is not for unreasonable success, this show is relatively unknown than leadership, then this event will never get out of the idea. <br /> <br /> The idea is terabyball. Morne Redneck Hick spent his lottery winner to free himself with his past white garbage. Is it funny Phases but not consistently Is it a fool Each and every single episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen so many big shows, then their time has gone before, even then I could have survived more than I could imagine this mistake. The theme as episode theme is incredibly unfunny. Each episode is an absolute struggle for more than 100 IQs. And icing on the cake? Every episode narrating Jason Lee's annoying voice. If this is not for the southern state culture and not for the Southern RedNeks, then this show will have no audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a fool and need a complete entertainment, then it gets worse, tastes bad, bad dialogue and the essential characters of living ... Well, you are probably an actor of this show.
