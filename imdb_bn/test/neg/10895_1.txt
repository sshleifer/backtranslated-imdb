I have never been able to face this film with the biggest disappointment with any film. Acting awesome, mystery build up short, and the overall plot is ridiculous. I have become a prey to hunting myself and have been hunted, because he certainly wants to get out of his misery. Anyone with fundamental knowledge about how the world works, will be immediately annoyed in our questionable questions, and the so-called suspicious buildup will be lucky so that 3 year old can be gently worried. I am disappointed that a signal has been planned, because that means they will ask us to consolidate the sub plot plot line again. If this is an example of Raw Raw's work, I think I'll avoid them and movies from a future.
