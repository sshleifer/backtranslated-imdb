My biggest problem with this movie was that Lomber's character was "unnecessarily cruel" as another user. London is playing the role of Crusherheimer Smith, who believes that he has married David Smith, alongside the heavily dressed robes, played well with Robert Montgomery. The movie has some fun moments, especially when Montgomar's character takes too long to try to get his "wife" back. It is understood, the reason for the marriage is technically not legal, because he is concerned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, The effort is not very impressive, yet Montgomery is visually loving, yet the lamtern is cool like a pillar of ice. For most movies there is almost no way to conform any combination of combat couples and it is difficult to see a comedy-even dark comedy. In some cases, the film often portrays a sad idea, the character of Lombard received "kick" of her husband's poor efforts. While someone else might consider this 'sex off sexes' film, the reality is that this is a very lost war, if it: Montgomeri's character is flawed, it is not very defective to create a standard example of altogether. Choiceist / Mugshot (a classic example of this 'Round War' Michael Douglas) Indeed, the character is spread in most cases, not as Montgomar's sharp dress (which most likely carries itself as an intensely decorated actor actor), but also in its failure - but failed to play the role - his only major flaw in his role to play is its horror , But that guilt adjusts with his mate excessive cruelty Not on. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to create jealousy outside of subconscious love. This makes what is so cruel, and sad. The character of Montgom seems to be only weak. Indeed, if he does not "wear a pants" in marriage, then a wife wants to be so weak. But again, a woman who wears wedding pants does not want to be so cruel because she has already confirmed that role already. Therefore, the whole theme seems weird. This movie is not a champion of feminism (the character of Lombard appears to be some kind of independence-based woman like 60, but the concept is soon canceled and the character comes back in the 1940s), even the fight of a party is not sex (e.g., Montgomeri's character is actually a man's cipher and hence Lost reason). <br /> <br /> This movie is a crystal on the surface, but under the veneer it is a really dark, sad offer. Which makes its resolution all, well, seamless (Which probably was the odd whole point?). In any case, this movie is not slapstick.
