I watched this movie in Blockbuster and it looks like it's cool. The DVD case touted so great actors and I wondered myself, "Why did not I hear about this movie?" Then I returned the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahari, and thus the answer began to explain itself. First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a big cast is equal to a great movie, but more importantly, I think this film is so terrible? OK, the script is terrible and one dimensional letter is full. This is the worst role I've ever seen in the game of Chazz Palminteri and I am surprised to do this ridiculous thing. However, yet acclaimed yet talented actors will earn their money. Palminteri comes off about stupid as a C-movie view henchman is a dimensional police detective game. Lead Detectives (poorly directed nolt), formed an elite group of LA detectives to release him from the city with great but simple Michael Madison and late Chris Penn (whose role was completely thrown with Mudson). Mobsters for some time in the late 30s or 40s. The film portrays this squad as a police, who will break the laws of the police who consider it to be above the law, will not work in their city. At the beginning of the film, the police surrounded a local restaurant, grabbed a alleged mobster (William Peterson) and took him to a place called Mulehland fruit. They dragged him into one of the mohallahland drive arches and showed how serious these people are about the criminal behavior of the citizens of this city. Anyway. It was nothing but a cheap excuse to use a great headline designed to remind you of LA and its famous sites. After sometime they found Jennifer Conley's corpse and started plotting. <br /> <br /> There was nothing less than that of amateur and wet! Outside the quality of the B-movie, the treatment of Trat Williams, who is the head of the police and the terrible Daniel Beldwin, their reactions are only a few highlights that considered this movie as Lee. Tamheri's first picture Maybe there is not a good performance in the film as well as with Grillith, some of them might think that the film was the worst (he won the Razzie for this picture). In the end, his character was not that great and he did not really have a lot to work with. <br /> <br /> The text begins with any bad movie, and this script is not a gem. The plot is only formulated based on the setting of the next scene and does not take into account the motivations of the characters. The behavioral character was incredible way. The police believe in the right circumstances by taking the law in their own hands (see Lab Privacy) but in this case it seems that these people can get something with murder, and never bat anything clean. I guess we can guess as an audience that no one has seen anything and people will not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and the pimple has been fed so well that we can understand everything exactly before the characters will happen. However, this does not make us think smart, but despite the fact that there is no hero in this movie, the hero makes angry over how stupid. Finally, the best element in the movie was David Grossin's great score. From the beginning, it started from Chinatown, which was quick when I realized how all of the film was incredible. It did not surprise me that it made $ 11.1 million in the box office. What I'm saying is that this movie is valuable for some laughs. Nick Nolt's acting is like an impossible domestic junkyard dog and when I try to be serious, I laugh. I used to fall in the floor on each of the slow motion shots used in the film (I think there are three at the time of a war scene). When you want to slow down the speed of a dramatic moment, you definitely have some problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I would recommend this movie for a completely ridiculous purpose, that is, if you appreciate the LA Confidential Movie.
