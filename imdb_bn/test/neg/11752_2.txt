I know that the original psycho was a classic and it was a mistake to restart, especially a shot-by-shot rimikake. I have been proven by the rest of the comments here have been less or less. But this is a lot more wrong than the movie. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was shot in black and white, but how many people have realized, the original was shot after the color film was discovered. The choice of black and white films was partly a budgetary concern, but it was a stylistic choice of Hitkoc. Now, this does not seem to be repeated in black and white, but the colors of this movie are very wrong. The main colors of the film are orange and green, especially the MARION which is not supposed to be a shiny character. Bright colors look like a happy movie and when horrible events occur in these color schemes, it seems more than a cartoon and the audience laughs instead of screaming. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the light. This is a dark dark story that should be lighted by light, but this recurrence does not seem to just fail, but it can go from unexpected direction. Most of the scenes are very bright, even when it is unreasonable, because it is night! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he's portrayed Norman Bate's painfulness and insanity very well, I do not deny him. But there is one element of the character that he has failed to show: softness. At first, there should be a certain deceptive friendship for the character, which then goes away from it after realizing the truth. Apart from the character of a character named Norman Bates, this is a recognizable characteristic of all chitpaths !!!! <br /> <br /> This picture has some good aspects. Performance is something great I said, Vince Von came near to close a beautiful depiction of Norman Bat. Viggo Martensen and Julian Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the original characters, which was a welcome change. Annie Hiech may be frustrating, but unlike Janet Leighy who was oddly advertised as the biggest star in the movie, Ann Hey was given the last billing of the first credit. <br /> <br /> I read a cover on the cover of Saiko's novel that Gus Van Sant claimed that it was not a reconstruction of Hitachote film, but a new adaptation to the original novel. I've now bought this book and saved the comment because after watching this movie, the comment I've probably ever seen is the most fun thing. This film did not have any attempt in this film, which was largely unmasked, and it would be even more believable if Van Sant tried to refer us to three tons of wine from the Jafarumulks planet. These shots were copied without any real thought on why Hitako wrote the original shot. As Sam and Lilah are talking about the scene, their faces are fully covered in shade. Hitako had covered the faces of these actors in films because they thought they wanted to hide bad actors and hide their faces so that nobody could see their terrible performance without making them artistic or artistic. In other words, my review is as stupid as the movie that it repeats something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I reccomend you do not waste your time in this film and get the original.
