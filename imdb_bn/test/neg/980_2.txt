..But unfortunately no one thought about killing the pretending to save this destroyed production. The only positive thing about him in this film is his excellent singing ... The bad songs are mostly vague and unfortunate. Why do I hate van so much? Well, throughout the whole film he thinks he is doing a third-third semester of Soupy Sales - lots of mugging, bad jokes and ways to try to laugh everyone by spending too much energy. It was the worst at the moment when he used to "teach" the class - all of what these kids smiled. Hack, Van can read the phone book or their photos showed autopsy and probably they laugh! Now Van was not the only bad cutting decision in the film - he was just the most obvious. Of course, John Gilgood (a lovely actor) was ridiculous in an Asian game and Michael York's Peter Finch's brother was also in the game! The following line is due to these crazy casting choices, the film has been destroyed since the beginning ... and the worst of them is Bobby Bobby. Now in real life, he may perhaps be a lovely person, and sadly he died in real life so young, but with the material he was given here, I wanted to calm him out of his tongue. <Br /> <br /> Now I have mentioned songs - for example, that terrible song !! Frank Caper's original laugh was a delicate delight in Sarah - and the number of singles and dances in movies. So why did they decide to add a Bengali song that did nothing to help the film? They only served it to feel like a powdered mess - like the original doctor Dualitel combined with such lost horizon. The end result is a sick sweet baby movie - no one can enjoy anyone above 8. <br /> <br /> Now if you can remove these problems, then you have a decent movie base. After all, the plot is beautiful and still hidden beneath all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (but certainly not equal to Ronald Colman). However, considering the original was a perfect perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through this danger?! <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was included in the "50 Best Films" book by Harry Medved. Even though I disliked the film, it was not bad enough to match the book. I think it was mostly included because it was a box office failure and was released a few years before the book was presented. A remarkable book - Drake's "Holy Hall" is not the best choice.
