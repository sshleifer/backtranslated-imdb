This movie is "Vampires: The Turning" even I do not have it valuable in 2 of 10. Film, very predictable from the beginning, to the very end when our hero murdered the leader of the vampire Slayer. The music of this movie was even worse, it continued in such a way that you might expect something else to happen at some time, but it never happened. Acting, B-Rank was the best ... and the film was neutral. The only reason I give this film is 2 out of 10 because the feasibility of the story was even though it was unable to deliver. Oh, and I mention the dress? The dress was apparently cheap as "non existent" for this movie because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he is trying to save throughout the film) wear the same suit through the whole film. If I'm really bored of you and do not see good walls with fresh paint to see the dry, then this film will be recommended. ~ Dave, awful cowboy
