I hired this movie in my local library and thought that this film was like and that could be good considering it, but the boy was wrong. Acting stunts, war scenes were so bad and some of them were known, but they did not throw anyone with the power of leadership? I saw some people give it 10. Why would you ever consider taking this piece of horse **** 10. You can say it's worth 10 for its comedy, but when you vote in a film that is not supposed to be a comedy you can not give it 10 for a comedy. You will actually rate it like what it was supposed to be, and the director will not go for such a purpose. Perhaps some of you have voted 10 because you think that this film is a high rating so it will be so fun that people go out and the reason for the rent or purchase seems to make people confuse you. You are playing with people's time and money which you have no rights. If the movie sucks it gives a bad rating, if it is good, it gives a good rating but does not lie. I gave this movie 4 and was glad that I was able to test it free of charge at my library because the movie was gone and it was not okay to pay a cent to see it really.
