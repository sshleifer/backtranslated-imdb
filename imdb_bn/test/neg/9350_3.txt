I can not drag this image very seriously, because it looks like they're trying to make it worse, or if you prefer, you're trying to 'camp'. However, they try to make part of the part are actually in many parts, but often for cheese factor. Watch the game 'Space Aggressor', Actually acting in real life! Pull your head in explosive robots ... oh, helpless! And look at the end of the whole thing with 'Time Wars' at the end! And sexual quest just keep flying ... I'm really surprised to get away with a PG. Well good A couple hours is a fun way, but not Star Wars / Trek, folks. 10 out of 3
