Leslie Nielsen throws rock with this absolutely awesome comedy that I've ever seen the worst mainstream film. There is nothing to like about this movie, because it is essentially a playful movie and fun is not all fun. Often we used to laugh laughing laughing in the dark? It's not funny, it's just sad. Nielsen needs to start denying some of these repetitive scripts and will have to stop for Stanley Tong's production of Jackie Chan, because it's not even worse than that.
