I do not know that I hate this movie, when I saw it two weeks ago, but if you expect the facts described in the box, forget it ... it was a good movie. The great lineage described in the box, I totally compare with this dissatisfaction. If you have seen HBO's taxi cab conventions, it is not the same thing, just as fictional and interesting as is not even distant. If you want to see something interesting about a cab driver, see the 20-minute shortcut from time to time ... it's really valuable. I never wanted to pay my money back for the movie, until I saw it ... things. Annoying, annoying, annoying This is a unique feature that offers it: It lets you leave what each passenger will have, your imagination fills the gap. Which would be great, if you really care about these people. Instead, I shout at the screen, crying like a baby, praying for the end of the movie or for my own death. The cab driver feels himself through the feeling (though he is acting well, considering the feeling), feeling overwhelmingly from the sympathetic to the eccentric eccentricity. Sometimes it's appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it for yourself. "Damaged, I've learned these emotions in the class, and I'm going to use them!" Now that I'm thinking again, I hate the movie as much as I hate!
