Stephen King TV movie 5 or 6 parts could go and no one complained, right? Why would you give Stewage just 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini series, but two poters will be killed? The film moves on events that should be mentioned and mentioned in the mentioned events. I'd like to salute the stars for performance ... They had to work hard because they were not really looking like Stugge, but the soul was there. After watching the film, I pulled out a tape from the American movie classics, on which there was a real deal and smiled at myself silly. The film was emotionally difficult, especially after Karlie Stroke and Moecus would continue the business. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... I said that the film was good but could have been better and could have been much better. Maybe it's okay ... when Stuiggs survived, they broke up and now 25 years have happened again.
