Tell me this new O-Man Cartoon childhood is not spoiling memories, because I do not like the old O-Man cartoon. I liked the statistics of action, but I saw the cartoon enjoying a bit and I hated the story (I liked Hen Manny, the pre-cartoon mini comics included in the box, where Hen Man was a barbarian, the sword of Swords was divided into two pieces, and No Prince Adam, no Shazam-ripoff premise, and no Orko). However, we left the old stuff. <br /> <br /> The new O-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is an insult to yourself, it represents both the worst impressive of the old show and today's worst trend. I saw it because I have heard that your old show-off-face morals (thanks) have gone, and there were more sword and character development. But I faced a terrible mistake in the worst stories of this section, I could not help but hate the characters, and sadly the Matrix-Escack visual style. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to have a bit of background on the characters, it was shown a pre-face-squeezed skeller, but how much the character would improve, as well as the next generation of garbage I'm coming to the next stage, where It will learn the responsibility of the Tabloid Adam, his new acquired ability, Blah Blah. At least the old show Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself hating his guts. When we show an adventure for the adolescents, we can get it: Excellent face and curiosity and appearance - Teenage clothes. N'Sync should test my new episode to see if it has made a special appearance. Man, this show reminds me of the 1996 flash gordon stingbomb cartoon! <br /> <br /> dialog? Haha It follows the statue of the book, starting from Lily-Joo-Randor Randor in the open scene and immersing the skater "Oh, and hey man ... I lie!" The end And the voice of the sketter is still the same high-pitch type than the old series. 20 years, and nothing we have not learned. <br /> <br /> And make sure, nowadays there is no matrix-style remote step-related anything exists. Japanese, leave anime anime, feel fresh ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now there is no yellow skin, but gray-eyed. Oh, so no Asian people would be offended. I do not appear betting jitsu show 1996 Finger shadow, where Ming the Marilles was a green, insect like alien! <br /> <br /> People complain about the lack of Kringar's statement. I do not think if I spoke Kringer, I would have liked so much, that is enough to do this. And you have your extra ration of cheese with Orko! The worst thing is that most people who hate Zar Jar Bing may be the orco fans ... <br /> <br /> I have seen this feature, and I've got enough. Leave alone series 10 out of 2
