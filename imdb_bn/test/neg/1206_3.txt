Do not bother checking for the argument. There is no one. But on the other hand, there are really big films that are not quite reasonable, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and dislike this picture. Action Sequence in the air is really cool because I like it, you'll see a lot of dogfighting. I also like the F-16, it's a very cool plane. <br /> <br /> But I really have many Google to enjoy it. I think it is not right to wish for some continuity, because it is really difficult to make a good fighter movie. But I also think that because it should be somewhat reasonable. And I have a question: can they fly from California to mid-east on F-16s without the wind? I'd like to see that happening.
