The toxic avenger, the second part, began with an apparent revelation that the toxic substance of the poisonous Aveneger (who was apparently replaced with the production and Ron Fazier), later saved the temple in Tromwell, in his hometown, it became a beautiful place to live in reality. This means that toxy has not been used as a superhero and is now suffering from feelings of depression and complete stupidity (as the director Lloyd Cauffman and Michael Harg should think of making it), Tocci is now 'for the blind' Tromwell center ' Apocalypse Inc., a long time before the problem goes back to its ugly head. A hazardous chemical manufacturing company, plans to take tromboville for some stupid reasons or other, but to do so, they need to be free from Toxie. After failing the first plan of the evil chairman (Rick Collins), he went to Tokyo's psychologist (Erica Sekel) to Japan and told her father to see. His girlfriend Clayier (Phoebe Lejre), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and the head of Tokyo's Tokyo head of Japan, left her home. Once Toxy finds her father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsurgi) helps her in search of her. In the tromwell, the Apocalyptic Incorporated is scared and citizens are unable to defend themselves without the use of Tolky. Toxie has finally found Big Mac Bunko (Rikia Yasuoka), whom she believes that her father believes, but all parts of Big Mac AppLips Inc. Once upon a time planning to destroy Tuxi ... <br /> <br /> This successful successful TheTexy Avenger (1985), directed by Lloyd Kaufmann and Michael Harz, proved that the first film was completely final, the bad luck was comedy Combination, terrible violence and so much worse - making a good film, poisonous avenger, part II is a balance comparable. There is not a single fun moment in the entire 102 (the Oscar Director's Cut) period, with a load of 'extra material' credits, by Kaufmann, Phil Revo and Gay Partington Terry. The visual gags are terrible, Takesy can walk through woks and glasses through Tokyo, or in a scene where he bites with a bad guy and cooks Toxi in vegetable and spaghetti load, a scene where he sticks up the electric wires to the woman's nose. , An antenna sticks on his head and a microphone in his mouth, which is a Japanese radio d Discussed in Sikak, a Japanese bad guy burned his nose in the form of a fish, somewhat where the toxy holds a sword head and uses it as a weapon, or is a guy who has a fish for embarrassingly bad projected and stupid foolish facial expression, a head of literary The influence of the genius of sushi, horror comedy music and the sound gets influenced and the original movie is silently the original A pale imitation of Jar and memorable that made The bad taste is not in the round this time and the first stupid childhood comedy humor is absent, it feels like the original step from the original and does not forget that it is tromba, it is certainly the worst thing here. Some of the worst fights and some deadly fights and violence have been seen, at least 102 minutes I have seen, crushed head, broken mouth, intestine, rose in someone's eyes, and thorns wrapped around their throats with blood circulating bodies. Tearing off the ears, tearing hands and making a very graphic and fragmented a scenes scene. Unfortunately special effects by Pericles Lewnes are not particularly believable and mostly come in the first twenty or a minute. As I've already mentioned the embarrassing ratio of acting. According to the action is an ultra-cheap looking car chair finish and a few unexciting, idle battles using star starring Peter Hardy. There is nothing awful knowing something different from the set pieces of gory. Comedy wise this is very weird. Indeed, the Tikiq Avenger, Part II is really exhausted on all levels and it's topmost to stop making it altogether, most of the cast seems to have prevented people from the maximum road angle, none of the continuity exists, the main point of the film & shoot And special effects are anything but. One or two poor scenery is absolutely brown, simple and straightforward, rather than reaping yourself, see the original again.
