This * was a wonderful fun movie ... but it should fall flat on its face. (Actually, I stopped seeing it halfway through, which I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays his second parents, Jack Karkaran, who donated an elephant to his father (whom he said before he was born Dead); Then he has one week to get pondyerous pachyderm all over the country. His adventures on the way are only silently fun. Genuen Garofallo's remarkable curiosity is largely stagnant. Anta Gillette is impressive as her mother of Jack (who has a lot to explain), and Pat Hingle is standing as Jack's father's former circus partner. Perhaps the second half of the movie was better than before, but it was hard to believe ...
