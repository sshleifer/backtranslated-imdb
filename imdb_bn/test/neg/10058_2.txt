Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist from England, picked up an evening hiker. Two years later, discovering the address of the person's address in his car, he returned to the man's huge house, only the man was hanged for murder. Nobody in the family or outside feels that Hit Hiker could not kill the murderer (his own husband) because he was in Seattleland's time of crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The man's aloe but he is too late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And depending on a puzzle that creates a rigorous time line. Often, not always, there is a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk about. <br /> <br /> Because of the disobedience of the situation, the reader should take proper care to explain every element of the mystery or viewer. Redundancy is perfectly okay. We have to keep the characters and time line directly. Christie's movies are very rare, which are really useful for the use of famous characters in lower-case. (Jacqueline de Belfort? Oh, yes, it's Mia Faro.) But this version of "Audible in Innocence" is a Golan-glabus production, which refers to all the production values, a scrupulous script and skill behind the skill. Camera. <br /> <br /> In the first few minutes, Sethreland discovers that a innocent person has been hanged, all right. Then, the audience wanders on many scraps, often in flashbacks or in confusing voices that do not tell us anything. The scripts have a slapdash quality, as overnight are thrown together by two hacks. Some faces are known and that does not help at all. Everyone commented on comments and names became frustrated. Four instruments of musical score are made of irritating anatonal jazz riffs. Some of the dozers in the audience wake up to cast some nudity. If Dame Agatha survived, she would have been among the audience who needed to wake up. <br /> <br /> <br /> Duelsville
