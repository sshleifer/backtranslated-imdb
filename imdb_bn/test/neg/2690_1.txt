I have long understood why people like Shakespeare are so much and every few years I let him go. I was hoping that this drama / movie (my sixth Shakespeare's game) will unlock lucky casket and will marry me about the treasure of this literary Demigod. Wow, I clearly chose the wrong key. Once the word "pound of meat" is called 10 minutes in the film, the main part of the plot was transparent, with an uninterrupted scripte and lifeless acting. In each step, the plot puts the plot in two scenes. The idea that a deadly elite would inspire his daughter to pick up her future husband through a lottery would be unbelievable. There is no real surprise to win the wonderful jackpot, because Basani is also the main character of this game .... And to try it, the third person .... and to choose three cassettes ... and his friend risks his life, giving him dowry. The only real surprise to watch this movie is that it did not end after the verdict was completed in court. But as soon as the ring was betrayed, it became clear. Well, I know that millions do not surprise Shakespeare's love stories, but for depth and emotion. The character. But I felt nothing for the characters. Instead of being involved in mystery and respect during court scene, I sit there and hope that it will end, one day I found a game of Shakespeare Do something other than bore. Me
