I have read many reviews in the IMDB (Well, the five that I wrote at the time of writing), and I am amazed at the acclaimed achievement on the wonderful disappearance. Undoubtedly one of the less comedy performed by Stooges. I like older people like Larry, Curley and Moore, although Shame gets credit for most of the funniest songs of the six-song piano song, the other stughs are short, only funny but ridiculous, but much more than Bridgetown's disappearance. In fact, the film has a slightly visible visualization of "Dont-hit-a-Lady" movie, which is absolutely fun and in 15 minutes in the movie. Not very committed to the 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a proof that was made earlier and was renewed but it was not, I do not think it was a huge form when creating this film. There is a series across the film, of which no comedy level is equal to which the three studs are so widely known. It seems that StuGijara has suffered the same problem which hit so much in Sheryli Temples? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film and splendid sound effects (although there are more exceptions than usual) are almost fun, but these films have been plugged into their standard slots. Line "Hold hands, you lovebirds" immortal The rest of the picture is not. <br /> <br /> There are many conversations among other people who have reviewed this movie for this site, which is one of the best in this stews shorts, which you will not find a weak moment, how it's their best from the 30s shorts. This is not just true. I certainly understand the level of self-respect for Milestone classics and the generation of early comedies, which are definitely of three stuigs, but when the poor films should be appreciated more than they are, the honor is damaged. Bride's Groom is worthy of some respect because it is a stugas film, but it should be better for the same reason. Three Stooges were better than this.
