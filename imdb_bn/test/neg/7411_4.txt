A big waste of time you will find this bag. I probably rent this expected for a suspenseful movie with a few credible scenes, but the boy I was never dissapointed. I think the title "Camping 101", or that effect should be something. Well, stay away from this film, however. It numbs you death Do not be afraid of big feet, fear this shit !!
