The contemporary chapters of the devastating group below the elite waters of the US Navy are said to be ... they are apparently what they want. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is already unbelievable. Michael Biehn returns to his immediate CO, but he keeps on a rather long patch of Charlie and one of the guys is killed by Murray Murray, thanks to Charlie's patent stupidity soon. The rest of the team spend their extra time in court-martial crimes. In most cases, an exercise in random gun wars and paper thin morals, these special seals may be more suited to serve as a crash-test dummy. <br /> <br /> The scenes of some good steps reflect stupid procedures.
