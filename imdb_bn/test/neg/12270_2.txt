Although I have seen this picture myself (thanks), I still feel embarrassed to see it. I was tricked into paying it by the reviews on the front cover, and behind the bloody / great camera-which made me believe that it was some sort of documentary. This actor is ridiculous all over the film, not all believers. The story involves the Italian Australian (?) Gang, just fighting with other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeating. They offer highly strict training, which makes them better than other gangs. For some reason I do not believe that they can actually double these two of their size. I can be wrong ... or I'm not mistaken, this movie is not enjoyable at any level. Seeing the prison motions it looks like it was a summer camp, instead of just kids, it was the terrible actors' festival of sausage, just hanging out and trying to smile and look hard. This movie is not worth your time, save your money, or throw it in the trash, do not just waste this movie.
