Apparently I'm swimming against the tide of the burning commentary of this movie. I did not see it at the age of 4 or 5, but one thing I definitely remember ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> nightmares terrifying nightmares. Strange Music and Little Girl and Kangaroo Running for Their Life <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Down the waterway? Do not hug one eye. Dot and Kangaroo? It still haunts my dream And many of my friends are at the same age who think it is too vague. Maybe we can get a group rate on the therapy. <br /> <br /> Short: A weird film for her time.
