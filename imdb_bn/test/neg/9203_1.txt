1) Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2) It's definitely like a house for a bunch of fraud on an alien planet, especially in the home and in the streets you can see in the background. <br /> <br /> Horror plot with stupid caracters making rude decision making ruthless plot and blithely valuable survival equipment and clothing, left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 4) 70 70's Scifi Jumpset (probably the only good thing about this movie) <br /> 5) Interesting Ships at the beginning (seeing a lot in this Critical Space 1999). Too bad it's pushing up so soon. The escape ship got very quickly dive. * Sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists can find some aspect of attractive movies according to premium group behavior.
