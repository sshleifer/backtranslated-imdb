Yes, the sound for this actress is stupid. I know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty head and her bleached hair, shiny lips, and so boring to see with the perfect body. Instead of those walks away jeans, showing a rather big butt. His butt spread out on his shoulders. What do you understand from this? As extraordinary man, played by the fantastic Mark Humphrey, he is completely cast. A charming However, he and Lancaster just do not match. He was the opposite place of this good looking guy. Acting as well as Susan Glover's sister. Angela Galupoo had a small role and it was okay. But film director Philip Gagnon loses a lot of footage in Lancaster. After a while you look tired of him and look at his acting ability. And he was a bitch what a wife was. Hating her husband, insulting her and just a plain rotten brat. Darts are happy to see his injury with guns. I think it may end her. But lazy, the script tells us otherwise. After torturing myself and looking after these victims, I still came with the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to see. This time around her hair, folks. Her hair constantly became annoying, constantly tossing it in her mouth. I ask the writer why a wealthy nobleman like Philips, like Alison, would be annoyed like Birbo, why the Alexander Commissar argues. With the class, to choose from many interesting intelligent women. She likes this thing. What is this Rochester / Jane Iry thing? Oh well, it's all a matter of taste, I guess. This is not my cup of Lancaster tea, folks.
