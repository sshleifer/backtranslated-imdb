As a light entertainment, this film has actually succeeded in its first half, but then it becomes a fast-established script that closes it. Harry (Jude Nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and an aspiring actress Duffen (Gina Gerson) is appointed as a live window manneuven in a department store, where one evening they are late for departure and locked inside, where they testify, Protective glass is a clear homicide happening in the streets, less than the point of observation. Visible murderer Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculpture, comes back to look after the angels the next day, because he realizes that he is the only possible witness on the violent events of the night before and when a gesture pair "Flins" starts to be fun. Deffen and Harry report their observations to a local police station, but when detective receives a crime report, Harry's criminal background thinks he is angry. There are many ways a movie can become hackneyed, and most of it manages to use, which has a compelling slow-bedroom view of emotion. In Vancouver a low-budget event shot, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rot. Always able to do some of his role in Gearing, but Mancuso is incredibly stylish, maliciously so, he attacks his line with a clear loose rain. Although the film makes a fool, however, cinemographer Glenn McPherson does not like to follow suit, because he set up with cameras and illuminated some pretty comprehensible compositions which could give viewers attention by ignoring plots and non-intrusive conversations. A well-built score based on the appropriate creator, contributed by Hal Beckett. The mentioned dialogue is initially slightly fresh and is well-distributed in rebellious ways by Nelson and Garsan, but predictability is taken in the following perspective of faulty continuity and logic. The direction reflects the lack of original idea or perspective, and post-production flaws are far less than expected for the basic thriller.
