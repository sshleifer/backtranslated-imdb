Again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> There was a difference of opinion on the marketing material of this membrane; 'Explosive'? When I read the summary of this movie, I was optimistic that there would be a large number of archeological views in the cities, each of them would be hacked by bloodshed and alcohol by leakage, heroin twitching with needles and with twin masturbation; For example, a "Vice-Day" astronomy astronomy, clear-shave hero will have to come. Instead, the film was completely contradictory to what I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middlehoton is a simple little place where poor people are doing full-time jobs, forgetting a bit of annoying, forgetting pain, or showing cock-fighting (chicken, not pain) Time. In other words, the townspeople were suddenly ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate) piece was broken into pieces, Gabriel, a brainwashed presbyterian campaigner sponsored by McFadden, whose face was designed in such a way that it is proposed that anger paved a permanent air. If I was kind, then I would preach that the Giver of the Apostle's Peacock was a wonderful comment designed to downplay Gibriel and his beliefs. Unfortunately, Brian Kark is a filmmaker who quickly hates everyone in the film, surrounded by the audience's eight-plus minute dark, hackneyed tadium. My only resort from this waste of celluloid is a game to "accentuate guess" broken with rounds of "spot spaces". Are we surprised that Gibeon steals his brother's son and is hating his father? Of course not; He is a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychic. All the townsmen are looking forward to the end of the movie, but I think they have named their names as a Turkish that they have realized. <br /> <br /> The Northern Film Film and Television Commission has a budget budget, but there are better projects than this weak enterprise. What I can say about this movie is that it was able to replace "Superman Returns" as the worst movie of 2006; Achieve a hell. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
