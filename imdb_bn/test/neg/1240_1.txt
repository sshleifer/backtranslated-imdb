Did the author come here and write a positive review? I mean, really, it's a bit hackneyed, and Spike is not that funny. She seems more like a serious guy trying hard to be funny. There are many medium gigs on this show; Once, like the sketch was open "talk show, apply on the straight forehead," over over. And another that featured Spike and other dude received high, and it was not even funny. They do not even do anything but sit around and smile, over and over. Ha ha And another Spike spoke to a Korean man who had decked and told him that he had a pet duck. Ha ha I mean, Spike likes funny shows just because of her show, so people like this show
