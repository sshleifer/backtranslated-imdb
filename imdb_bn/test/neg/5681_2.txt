... and something that's saying. No matter how bad a movie is, I'll usually be able to sit through it so that I can judge the whole film. Through this one, I did it for about 20 minutes. Perhaps it was a DVD, or perhaps it was my laptop, but I could not hear the conversation, even the volume was started all the way. The sound effect was good, so the volume turned up to listen to the dialogue, I was running out of my eardrums with the effect. As soon as I wanted to see this thing, I was not going to sacrifice my hearing for him. <br /> <br /> The movie was originally a great flashback from what I can say about this plot. Character's girl. It seems to me that a military pilot must escape his ship because a man in his ship became a traitor and now he is following him on a desert planet. <br /> <br /> <br /> I like what I liked about the film; I liked something about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Oh well, I'm going to the dumpter ...
