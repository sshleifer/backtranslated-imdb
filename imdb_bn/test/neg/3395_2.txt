I'm very interested in lively children and I read many eleven Rice Burroughs novels - but this horror film can not interest me, and I could not beat all the unreasonable, unrealistic scenes. I could only sit in Africa and part of John's first few days. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'cruel fool'! Actors at the app's suite looked bigger than the big chips (there is a difference). They were a wild animal that moved with grace. (To compare, see some good planets of apps movies where they train their actors to transfer to Simian fashion). Apps can stumble in the flesh - unless I know a common Ape practice. I'm a sucker for animal stories but the script does not care about me as apes. John Clayton's mission is that the great white hunter is completely charicaturish. Clayan's parents had broken the ship on the ocean beach, but it was a long way to reach the river shore - give me a break! Let's say 'slow'. Even these people who think that a wonderful movie admits that this is not an action movie. Away from it It tries to be a character study - Unfortunately the neutral fool is the staple part! I did not read books of Bruce Tarzan, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful actions and heroic motives! This film is just not there.
