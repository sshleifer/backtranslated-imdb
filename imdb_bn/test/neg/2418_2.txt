Where to start? If you are new to Rugby's wonderful game, this movie is a very entertaining cause, but if you are outside of the United States and follow the game, then it is ridiculous. Various rugby heritage such as "Haka", which is introduced by New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by All Blacks. The leader of the hawk is usually a member of the group of Maori. This is one of the most important conventions of modern game and has been misused and represented by the author. Although the movie is run very well, it is poor script and most of all the performance is reduced. Based on a real story taken in the account, it has a great deal of clich√©s in storyline. I would strongly recommend that an American interested in Rugby will see this movie and then look at what Rugby actually is doing on YouTube because the film has been depicted in a rugby which is actually separated from it.
