Yes, what do I hope? I thought it would be a movie about the young people in the twist of their life, like "Sonellele" or "American Pie", which I liked so much. I wanted to see a funny movie, probably a ridiculous look of Ideatic Würzburg. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Did it. But I think of Blerberu as one of the best German actors, I believe that this effect was really the motive. I think the writer wanted to talk to a bitter friend - especially when he threw stones. But in truth, I do not need a movie to be indifferent to talking to the friends of a stone. The annoying dialogue makes most of the film. <br /> <br /> But okay, this is one thing. I can deal with that, I have seen a nice movie with hateful dialogue, just think of the life of Schwarzenegger. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and predictable as some of the storyline. Just one example (speaker !!): Why, do you think, does anyone take a garden hose deep in the forest deep to his horn tree? What is their water Of course, you do not usually get water deep water pipe, right? The only reason for this water hose is that a predator who will come, when two plays are collected in their dome, can be treated and finally Jaegermister can be filled with three bottles. I really hate this scene because it's really violent. Generally, I do not think violence in movies - sloppic-comedy is full of it. But there is a silent agreement between such a comedy movie and if you face them or do not kill things like chairs or things, people are not hurt. But if it happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic, then the slopstick-scenes seem to be real. In this special scene, I really thought that the hunter should be seriously injured, if he is not dead - the final scene feels to me that he is left to die, completely filled with a torch filled with torch. And the drama just walk away. Otherwise, if the authors consistently followed one style; The scene was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> While talking consistently - I miss the most about this picture. The whole picture seemed to come from a writer's mind and came from a list of short episodes. Something happened without a scene - yes, I know it's life, but it's not a movie, because the movie is meant to tell stories, not boring episodes are shown without any significance. I asked myself "Where is the point?" Always. Without the two main characters, the characters were not explained in detail, you would never know why the hero's sister wanted to sleep with her best friend Kaike, he actually told you, but I could not buy it. I think Kai was there to give these children the chance to manage the AIDS-testing sketch, which you made sure that it was thousands of times better and mostly good. Once you meet the girlfriend of character, then he leaves Germany (you do not see and the man does not care) and finally it has been mentioned in one sentence that he met someone else in America and divided him into a hero It seemed to me that the author wanted to end some loose ends. He did not really do it, you really can not know what is so bad about law-learning, after being the son of the parents (the father is finished everything and served coffee in the middle of the night, which makes my mind do one of the worst characters in the whole picture) and Beautiful living in Würzburg. Even with the parents' lace-friend dinner, to show how horrible it was to survive for the father's expectation, it seemed like another nice dinner with the family's friends (except for the journey to go later, but I think that with parents Before eating, it was not healthy to show a dope, there was no point in the scene, if there were). I've experienced a much worse dinner than this life and still have to finish my exam. I did not understand the single character in the whole picture, they just looked flat and impossible. <br /> <br /> All this made a great movie, but it will not be seen again after one. Television. It was really some good scenes (most of them were not new, though like the one like the beautiful and understanding policeman), some were really fun, some conversations were nice and I like to play Blabaturura, although he made his famous repetition again stereotypes Not good or not, I thought if this image was more than half. <br /> <br /> But then this rude scene came and I found it really annoying. Incest is simply not funny. I do not know whether I wanted to be funny, some people are sunny in the audience, so this may mean that. This scene has ruined the entire movie for me, I can not feel sympathy for the hero - I am helpless person ************************************************************** **************************************************************************************************** * Ridiculous. It may, however, be an indication of the drama, but the turmoil has never been mentioned (although we think this play may eventually be a reason to leave Germany, but it has not been mentioned again.), It is also completely unnecessary. I hope sister will eventually become pregnant, which will eventually join this uninterrupted story, but this final figure is not fulfilled, just as the film did not have any solution or thought till the end. This is not really funny, it's not actually a drama, despite the fact that it's not a street trick of La Torrentino, despite its attempts to violence, it's certainly not enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. See "Final fantasy", it's also bad, but at least beautiful pictures and do not waste it.
