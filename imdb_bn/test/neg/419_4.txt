I went to see this movie today, tried to keep open mind. I hope to enjoy a movie that I want to be different from the book. There was a significant difference in the book, which was similar to the changes made in the Divini Code. I went to see the DV code with the same thought process and instead of the book, I was inspired to enjoy the movie. It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of distorting the symbols was interesting and mentally excited. Unfortunately, the Angels and the Giant are frustrated at almost every level. Throughout the film, icons are found without any interest for the audience and find out quickly. They do not have the opportunity to look at them and realize how they work, so they blurred various emoticon symbols so quickly. The final Illuminati symbol, which was replaced by the cross-key symbol of one of the book's most striking and creative ones. In my opinion, there was a missed opportunity to spend a little longer on the symbols and focus on the long character. Overall, this film is a very bad interpretation of the book, and fails to attempt an action movie / thriller. 10 out of 4
