On this day, Asian Awesome Films are the best known worldwide, their atmosphere and refined contemporary society. This is not a movie! Instead, "The Record" is a medieval slasher film that "I know what you did last summer" and American movies like "Scrum" are highly derivative. The plot is known - 5 teenage girls have committed a terrible crime, but they cover the oath to keep it secret. After one year, dogs being managed by their knives (being stalked by a hospital sterilized mask and an orange jumpsuit with the perfect unscary camouflage). It is not generally a group of teenagers (it's one of the movies where the motives of the killers seem quite reasonable) and there are numerous fool plot setups to continue the story. The film's direction is impossible, much influenced by MTVs (such as "The Ring") from the horror films of present-day Asia. Although the last third of the film is not very bad, some sensational scenery is provided, although perhaps a "wrapping" is far more than that. 4/10
