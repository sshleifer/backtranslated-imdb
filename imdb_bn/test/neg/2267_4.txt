If you really like GWTW, you'll find the story quite frustrating. Those who can remember it may be just a romantic story and in the south, perhaps it may be satisfied with this modest TV production (I think like an important mistake for Scarlett). But, considering the novel, I can not say anything better than that. <br /> <br /> I read 20 times more GWW and I'm really Mr. We can express gratitude for Mitchell's adaptation. It took me a while to understand what was the last time: Scarlett was sure that he was going to recover Rite, because he always got what he wanted. But there was no kiss at the end. Then Alexander Ripley showed us how to be the perfect and powerful scarlett, and, of course, in detail how he got it right, even when he had an important relationship with someone else (Mrs. Mitchell's mind Could not be anything else, I'm sure) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not ok to compare it relatively, but it is not a GWTW fault. is not it? If I do not compare it, is it any good? may be. Sorry, I'm not really cared about. <br /> <br /> I hope for a little more compromise to continue with the work of someone else (Saberib), do not try otherwise.
