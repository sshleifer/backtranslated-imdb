Okay, imagine that every state in the United States, no, the growth of the same tree in every country and the soil leaves. Imagine that a monkey-trapper camp is far away from the beaten track, the first half of the river's surrounding area gives you a nice time-typed, completely straight road. Imagine a world that you will wear a complete biojagd suit to collect a floppy disk, then drop it into a jipple bag and do not transfer to your pocket as you return to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to give blood without complaint. This movie is set in this world. On top of it, one of the most fascinating pieces it has gathered, I have been lucky for many years. <br /> <br /> I like it :)
