Just a few minutes ago, I stubbed this DVD while browsing the Netfix, and decided to let it go with an impressive cast of this kind. <br /> <br /> I tried to try a new version of a movie before I did not see an existing great movie (Scarface) and failing so spectacularly. <br /> <br /> The main thing to think about the story should be completely misunderstood. On Scarface, Tony Montana is self-proclaimed "bad guy". His spectacular rise and last deterioration were not sad, it was a great (and only logical end) for a life-giving person. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa as Director, Writer, and Chief Actor looks a bit as a hero, or at least one of the complicated people. But he does not want to scream to create a realistic, sympathetic character. After six months of his childhood, his father, a gangster, showed him his life, instead of being raised by white mother. Until the reasons are not fully explained or even mentioned, he decides that he wants to become a drug dealer and actually goes to two dealers for driving a bad part of the city and said, "Hey, I want to buy some medicines." He gives up his father's name, and apparently he is not rich at all, the two are supplying him, the reasons are acting for him as follows, the reasons have never been explained. <br /> <br /> Uncle wants to feel you when a police source is lying about him, his character is sent to jail. However, since he is taking a lot of medicine before, why should he feel sympathy for him in jail? White Supremacist / rapist played by Gary Busey in the most obvious case wanted to be Chappa's good guy is executing his prison. On Scarface, some of Toni Montana fishermen do not die of anyone but some of them. But in this case they handover Hammy will be just a rapist / pedophile but a white supremacist to Busey. A little overkill, what do you think? I do not know too much about this, but their frustrated message "Please make me better! I'm a collective hangover!" Failure on each level. Try as their friend, when her friends are killed, I am not bad, confronted, or sympathetic, her wife is also killed (soon she was called as the father of depression and she was trying to escape) when she decided that While driving in his car, the gunmen should move right to the right side of the car admitted), and his last death. <br /> <br /> His performance can be summarily summed up as a shy, his only achievement is to mark the "wooden" a new altitude star. Busey should actually submit for her putting in humorous roles. Small lister did well. Stacey Kich is playing his prison prison break role. Robert Wagner is coasting for a picnic. Faye Dunaway, a touch dramatic, still activates a performance better than this film deserves. Brad Dariff is in movies for almost two minutes and he does whatever he can. And to give credit to the film, it somehow makes the squarefaces one way - Jennifer Tilly now titles the headline titled "The Extreme Extension of the Hispanic Extension". (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this movie was an interesting premiere, but stresses a poor story, unsympathetic characters, and hit-missing performance. I suggested to the chip that next time you will have to look for compassion for compassion - really, we do not have to like your character, we just need to be interested. Good luck next time.
