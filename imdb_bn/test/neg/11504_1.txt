When I first saw this show, I thought to myself, "What is this !!!!!?" One of these shows that a perfect counterfeit high school is considered "huge" with stupid problems in the world. Then there's Sadi. This is totally misfit for his friend and his family well. Shes is a bad thing that is not obsessed with the whole nature but he compared it with high school students animals! What's that like! They also made him another league of Miguar Clone (yes, because the world is definitely one of them!) Glasses are also the perfect TV girls, which make me sick! So please, this is a stupid show that gives no idea, if you like Lizzie McGuire or any other show, skip it.
