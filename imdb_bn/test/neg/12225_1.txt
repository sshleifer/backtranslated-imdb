This is the worst movie I ever seen. I do not see it for free, I will not end it. The creators of this photo will be ashamed of themselves. It seems that this shocking movie and the movie of the date movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this) is considered to be a movie, but unfortunately failed. The only joke on this movie seems to be based on slapstick. A man falls, someone gets hurt by the bus etc. No idea shines, basically the worst place for any movie. The plot (or its lack) is fully reversed. This plot seems to be central to the coach and his family, but much more is going on in the film, it's a complete ridiculous one. Awesome, horror movie
