Wow, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie was an embarrassment to the original sandals. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible. Every part of the 'Mexican' sandalat manager was terrible. <br /> <br /> Look Perry, although only a few parts were terrible. This was the worst role. Even the child actor played him as a child, someone who wants to punch you, even to the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the small movies which makes it a part of the extra mile, beyond the funny stage track. Humor was for 6 years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are 12 and older than you are looking for, skip this movie and instead see the sitcom.
