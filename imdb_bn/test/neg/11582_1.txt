Probably the worst animal feature, Boa ana Python was ten million times better and it was not great, bad acting, bad effects and one of the DVDs with previews of 3 divisions in the main menu. Probably at least harmful films, no blood or violence, people use fools and pistols when they do not have any impact on these creatures, only the coolest parts were radioactive leeches, which were quite cool, I was only annoyed in the island's Jurassic Park Fatigue and even not worth watching, but I think the character stupidity is quite funny, so it's a good comedy f Of course not, but it will create a thrilling ccitra
