Hey, I know Angel is not such a show that makes people happy and I know that they just could not perfect everything, but I could not believe the end of the Angel. I love the show absolutely, it's probably the best show. However, I really hate this last, as well as the whole way went to the 2nd half of the Season Season (similar to the Biffy Season 7). The death of my favorite character was quite dull and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters of this event, and once she and Angel went together together, she turned all evil and turned into a giant. I wanted to get back to her back much worse than, where the mountain comes back to Cordelia is not pretty, but I was still really crazy gone still. Then Fred died on the earth, after finally finishing with Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was in vain, it was nothing for the plot, and the blue-haired giant girl was a terrible, vain character. They spent too much time finishing concentrated around it. Another big problem is that they do not connect well enough components. I know that the black thorns who wanted to bring about unbroken, but it was not a date that was not supposed to happen. Unanimous should be discovered throughout the season and should be mentioned that there is some bad light one hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that the listener who is concerned about is dead or there is nothing to live for. My three favorite characters died, and Angel, Spike and Gun (I'm not sure even alive) did not have any office, even for the help of the helpless, they did not come back in the middle of a huge war and they are all lost about care. Angels and Spike are never free, they lose the care they give to the girl, and only everyone dies, and they still have to fight this weird evil army. I did not get the whole fight off you, but it was foolish to end it right in the middle. Some were not released, the knowledge that always will come many more wars. I do not get why I got so much ratings on this episode, because I think Buffy was the last 10 times better, and I was not even a monster fan. Why did they end up slipping, the first half of the season 3 and 4 and 5 were so amazing, then they went and showed the show.
