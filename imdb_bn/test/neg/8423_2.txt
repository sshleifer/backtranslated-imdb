So what if you are a porno star with fading look? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I am using this term - follows the trials and trials of the Colton, because he tries to transform himself from a lesbian porn star into an electronic (reading: dance) music singer. I just wish Mr Ford's voice was muscle as his weapon ... sorry his voice is painfully thin. There is nothing very interesting here but Mr Ford and the friends of the eye candy. <br /> <br /> Record him a song that sounds like a stupid dance tune to each other. Visit him in New York to "connect" him Let him go back to LA with a little success. See yourself in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting time watching this mess?"
