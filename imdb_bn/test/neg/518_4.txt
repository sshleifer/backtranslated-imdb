"Dry" is definitely not the "worst movie ever". Its flaws such as borrowed footage, crazy scripts and non-existent special effects (this is the worst), but there are some good points in it. Acting is astonishingly well, there are many familiar faces that you probably do not know about a B-movie fan like me. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased to see Brent Huff playing a hero, mostly for her 80's action movie, and I must admit that she is not a bad actor. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Colfield and Tim Thompson get some limited screen time, but trustworthy in their portions. "Iv-Candy" in this freelancer movie, Yevette Nipper and Nikol Egert, both very sexy and very meaningful. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy. Unfortunately only those who cast members (my opinion) are completely out of place in Coolio. He does not do any work, as he did not read the script and shot it like a wimp an hour after the movie became a badas. Not good choice. <br /> <br /> To make this film rich - it is not so bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can overcome special effects items (such as guns, so many fires, and no wounds on anyone), you can get a recycled footage from Kulio's boring performance and airport 77, but you can choose a non-bred after this.
