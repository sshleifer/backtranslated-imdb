... and this series, I have been reduced to an annoying joke with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in books? Well, in this series, one of his lunar m. Shame the fridge. Remember our uber-evil kindness Visser three? She is a throat guy with Anne Caffez. Remember Rachel, "Zenna, Warrior Princess", and Casey, my sensitive and caring love interest? They decided that the original characters who have become psychic bimbos by 10 (!) Authors were not enough cool for the TV. Excellent Extra Terrell X Remember, who is cool, intelligent, and really, really like cinnamon buns? In this series he aligned with Token Alien with a very annoying voice. Do you remember the wicked sarcasm of our team book? In this continuation our dialogue is so intense and stupid, it is clear that the authors are suffering from the lowest universal majority. <br /> <br /> So forget about everything you knew about anonymize! Casey was supposed to do allergies of morphing, not Rachel, eco-thinking *, and Visa's Three and X, rarely, sometimes, if present as Andalights (No, it does nothing to budget!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. The shock is around us. And if you're unhappy, one of your favorite books, series, or graphic novels can be transformed into a truly awful TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... worth watching television." ~ (Very cold) Visser three <br /> <br /> (R # 91)
