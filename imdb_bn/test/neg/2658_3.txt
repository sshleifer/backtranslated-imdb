Christian Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford have such a great chemistry, but each time their relationship story begins to accumulate, and spend scripts and work with some irrelevant sub-plots which do nothing to advance the story. In fact, there was nothing to do with mistress stories. They were like a commercial break that you saw a trailer for another movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> They seem to be uncomfortable until they fired some guns and fights times. Or perhaps they could not believe the audience that a man and a woman are trying to understand their relationship in difficult situations. After all, we all know how "rare" Casablanca was. <br /> <br /> If perhaps the relationship between Who and Dutch becomes even better and allowed to play, then the authors know how to end the story. This picture is not frustrating to do more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but can do more with a good script.
