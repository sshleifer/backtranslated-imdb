A feminist tract that if you believe the viewer is: i) annoying with wild animals, but instead of attacking, killing and eating (the line that does not attack the Orthodox does not invade until it attacks - unless "excited" Meaning meat shows); ii) Both homosexuality are not immoral - and its acceptability often involves the history of society with the signs of disruption and damage. iii) Both female bisexuals (in this case, really every woman has no choice for male or female) iv) divorce is worse than unbelief. v) The land has land for the use, development and enjoyment of the land) It keeps on communicating like an infant son on the ground. Unfortunate and tragic events for the child alone for the child. viii) Parental statue is a good and healthy thing for a suitable model. ix) Adult adults bear responsibility for their sexual behavior, their age and duties, the most closely and the most intimate and openly sacrificing activity of the relationship is to do this work: Marriage - Trust me, you are not going to like this movie! Originally it's a Howard Start-type colleague, who is arranged by Genie Fonda's woman (think electric horse). This is ugly element because the scripts values, ideals are all harmful. <br /> <br /> I have shared other objections about strange things in writing: a) Why does this guy lose her girlfriend? - Because he revealed that his mother's death and funeral could not be able to keep her date with him? Why she was just saying "personal" when facing angry and frustrated women, the mystery Oh? b) There is an inconsistent inconsistency (i.e., scriptor wants it in both ways), we are saying that the father of the drama loves his father with all his father - and then we are told that there was only one life in his life. - her lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) The meaning of the underlying legal concept is hidden. We never said that the executor's property has the right to live in - only he will determine the title of the sole heir and the right of possession of the property. Nevertheless, the film looks like the executor is right - which is crazy. (Intentionally try to remember a testator's property before the Will's property - it will not happen). <br /> <br /> It is similar to the idea of ​​the film that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just stupid. So, we are told: i) The character of Penelope Anne Miller is dating other men at the end of the film - after adopting five years - and before that in a complete relationship with the playwright, ii) Being dedicated to his adult life in his senior life Later, the heroine's maid - dating with another woman now) is disturbed with a female playwright Echena he "wants to try a woman." <br /> <br /> iv) A male is interested in the date of Transasualal Native. v) Mary's Place character naturally looks at other women in the college ("And they looked back," with a flute winner flip like a head). <br /> <br /> <br /> I will agree with others about the term of the DVD (I have to keep it in the highest amount and re-name it again and again, to understand phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a film that really hates traditional heroism by someone, loathes the idea that there is no necessary connection between raising a child, marrying and having sexual relations between people who hate the need for people. The film is out of propaganda - and that kind of false message promotion does not sit well.
