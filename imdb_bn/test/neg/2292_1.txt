This flash awesome! It hates and sets you to smile, but it fails horribly. The director probably does not have any idea of ​​Splendic Stick Gore's comedy, and not like the actors I've seen - lack of acting talent and comedy. Their efforts are really sad in English suffering, and in fact the lower right-hand independent Swedish pronunciation, which is said to be in the forthcoming dialogue, is probably the most ridiculous and enjoyable thing in the film. Even I'm terrible and unconvincing. If you want a good comedy then I would like to suggest that you must start classic rents such as dead dead series or brain in the brain. We all enjoy bloodshed, but ridiculous!
