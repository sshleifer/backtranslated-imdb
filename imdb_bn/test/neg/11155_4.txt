I do not know why I write this. I think most people think this movie is bad. Well, tell me this: <br /> <br /> When I first watch the movie, I like them. Then the time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. This happened with the end of the day. I liked it for the first time. I thought it was entertaining. But, after a few weeks, my opinion has changed. So, to solve this, I again saw it in a friend's house. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a logic. If I see a logic hole in a movie, then I try to ignore it. When I see two, I started to get bored. More than two and I p *** *** close. The last days stopped P **** after my second visit. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is a little boring. Everything about it is sad. Everything from Arnold's performance to movie colors. But dark movies do not disturb me, but something else ... <br /> <br /> If the devil can resurrect his wound, how can you kill him as his death? If you shot him, his skin grew again. If you cut his head, a new one should pop up. So the question: What is the attempt to kill him? I'll tell you why: Because it's a stupid movie which has a recycled villain. This devil is not my friend. This man is reminiscent of Bond Villene, who removes the whole project to Hero. <br /> <br /> I said it's a look, but do not see it twice, because it's painful.
