I refrained from watching movies in the movie, but bought my wife for the Xmas DVD, I had to see it. I did not expect much, which I usually got more than money. But 'Momma Mia' - relate, relate to **. I like ABBA, I like the music, I have an old LP. But this picture is just terrible. The Stage Show looks like a musical, but along with the songs, these tracks follow each other, no characterization, dance numbers (which become an additional role in the DVD) are dropped with only half the body. On the screen, the Europeans dancing chorus is a small Will appear on the Greek island, when set set and set up in 60 seconds by Clif Richard's musical instrument He disagreed! Merrill (see me acting) can not strip even an over-the-top musical instrument to make his usual mugging! Her Grand Piece - 'Winer Takes It All' - Maril Mete! Note to the manager - It should be shot with stereoscope with a camera showing the increasing distance between the strip and the brosan distance! Singing songs are some amateur nightly horror karaoke. The camera can not stop running like bad MTV. No one can live permanently and enjoy music, encouragement, and characters only. But what's worse is that this piece of fragmentation has become the highest profit film in the UK and the best DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labor did not really reduce the UK zombies - none of the critical faculties ???
