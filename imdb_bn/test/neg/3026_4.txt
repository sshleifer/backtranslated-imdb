"Begton", directed by Elias Merhidge, does not succeed in some interesting ideas about what they are trying to do. The film is a 76 minute long, suspiciously effective and annoying experience that tries to present a playful view of the creation of the world and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens with God, presented as a chair-side psychotherapist. Tears who tears her stomach using a knife From intensity, nature and nature of blood and human waste emerge. He earns to impregnate himself with dead semen of the dead. Later he gave birth to the son of the earth. An enemy who constantly misuses a group of cancerous people, whom I believe is representative of mankind. <br /> <br /> "Purple" takes a thick and annoying look at the life's rise. Self-destructive nature, violence, desire and greed have become a trademark for mankind. The movie comes from two problems. One is that the film's exhibition is very slow. What we have found is that thirty-three minutes spent in the world to show that the son of the earth is constantly vibrating nude and is oppressed and oppressed by mankind. Such casual longevity quickly becomes annoying and there is a lack of punch to hurt the audience's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point "Begoten" visual appearance and words. Grainy, flip, black and white low frame painting stimulate the plague of the plot, but such novels often work in short periods. As the audience gets accustomed to the description, they gradually lose their influence. Audio suffers from the same problem. It was constant repetitive and similar words became annoying fast so I had a wish to stop the volume. Shortly after the start, "purple" lost his charm. It tries to be original and creative, but it fails to expand on concepts indicated by a vague plot, instead it repeats the same scene again and again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "brinjal" is stuck in one moment. Although it tries to proceed with the plot, the scene and the audio remain the same. Showing slightly the same actions in slightly different ways with a different word. A hostage can not make a movie alone. It seems to forget about Merhige, something speed and variety.
