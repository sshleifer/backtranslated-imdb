This show is awesome and we enjoy it thoroughly. Set in Alaska, I do not agree with the show's gay content tonight. I think you are trying hard to bring New York to Alaska. Alaska is a matter of New York fight in floods, but trying to turn Alaska into New York City? It is a wonderful show of about great women and true alaska men and throwing the same sex couple in the mix is ​​throwing the equally way. Alaska women should be portrayed as a male and New York. I think the first 9 shows have a perfect balance with what you are doing. We could not have an excellent show without imbalance of nature.
