I'm sick of a movie, which ends up being what you find in the bottom center of a compost hip after listening to the recreational word in the one-line summary. Who knows: "Witchcher" can be attractive in a pitch in the studio, even a "big name throw" (such as Blair and Hasselhoff-Wink-Wink, Nudez-Nude) and the highlight choices of Handguard Connection (even I , Some woman ...)). <br /> <br /> But on the film, it is faster than a poppy-mash sculpture of rain. It seems that these people have been trapped in an island's palace from the Eastern Seaport and one of them (a woman, I guess) is being targeted by a devilish religion to bear the child of hell, others wonder, harmful ways <br /> <br /> There's a cross-section of your "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and some small films directed by Satan-worshipers. Amok line. None of this is very entertaining and in most cases you will crush your path from scene view to scene. <br /> <br /> No, Linda Blair and David Hesselhoff also do not support important issues. They just do not feel very intent on picking a paycheck and giving them "all". From the appearance of <br /> <br />, Hasselhoff probably thinks Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and think back to bed with Linda ... well, who knows; A Celebrity Pita Benefit or pro-golf tour or whatever it is nowadays. <br /> <br /> and torture scene! Ecchhhh You will see people stopping their mouths, the thunderbolt will jump inside the fire, jump into the trees during a violent storm, the ships bursting in their throats, etc. Shish, and I thought "The Devil of Mark" I saw the most naive movie .... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. It's not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. If you watch it, you see whether the cliches can count. And yes, Blair has appeared, as you did not see that Main Street was following a marching band. <br /> <br /> There is no star. "Witchery" - These witches will give you inches.
