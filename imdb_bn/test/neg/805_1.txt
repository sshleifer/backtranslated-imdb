Drain, dreary and total waste of my time. The plot is incredible (do not worry too much). Acting is strange and woody - I swear that they are trying to fancy their luck in all professional body makers, but it may insult the makers of the body. There is no interesting special effect to free up the disaster, but lots of fire, explosion, an unwanted sex scene etc. One thing that draws my attention to anything that is nuclear after the war between America and Iraq. ..hmmm Roger Corman emotional? Let's hope that "Iraq" is only a lucky choice for Karamen and the rest of the situation really does not come. <br /> <br />
