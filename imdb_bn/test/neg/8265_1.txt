This episode was annoying and even in terrific states, this season the Masters of Horror created a really good episode ... Damaged thing ... it's still too early, I believe these episodes will be better. I acknowledge that the Vampire episode was right but there was a lack of a difficult story. The episode started annoying about the couple caught by serial killers, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. However, I've been frustrated with lack of fundamentality and horror, which has been the episode of the first season. Please save this season John Carpenter! I believe Pro-Life will free all the seasons free of charge till now. <br /> <br /> "You're angry little baby!"
