In addition to this guy liar, he is total stupid, and a thief in the comedy community. Once I tried to see this excuse for a television show, I believe I actually threw a little in my face. I enjoy great comedy central programs like the Reno 911 and the American Body Shop, although I can not help him but feel a bit frustrated every time he is one of his horrible commercial ads. It shows me that makes me worried about the continued existence of mankind. It is difficult to believe that Joe Rogan can even look like a moron. Start praying now that Comedy Central will understand their mistakes and this show will end as soon as possible. Do we suffer enough?
