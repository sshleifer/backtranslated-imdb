This movie, quite literally, has a redeeming feature. Character is one dimensional, cliched, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. Looks like the script has gathered from the other 100 movies, the act is horrible, and some 'rough' humor feels annoying to me. <br /> <br /> Embarrassing for you, Gregory Poyerier, think it will be fun or funny! <br /> <br /> I've seen the worst movie for several years.
