Firstly, it has nothing to do with Kung Fu's 18 better weapons played by Gordon Liu. I have presented my Kung Fu Theater as a description that there is a complete confusing picture of the DVD, there is a wrong plot behind it and mentioned (no idea why) young heroes acting Huang Jung Lee. In addition to the beginning of 18 surgical history, some children of monks and ordinary mysterious manuals said to a monk that no weapon would ever be seen again, and all the boxing styles of war The hero Li Shua Hawa, who I have never heard of before or any other actor. The film mentions an IIMDB list as well as other director Wu Yuen Lingang. Other actors include Wang Fu Quinn, Wang Wing Sun, Chen Fee Fee, Wang Ki San, Sueen King Kai and Hawa Yu Sueen, who have shrunk without trace after this movie. Fights are reasonable and often but not great and there are not many charisma as 'stars'. The last moment is just stupid and the movie seems to have been completely eliminated even though they got annoyed at it. River scenes and training sequences are a little different than usual. Unfortunately the beautiful sister is very annoying (though intelligent) young boy does not sink
