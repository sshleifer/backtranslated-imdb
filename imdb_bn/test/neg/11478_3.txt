When I first came to theater in 1988, I saw this movie and although I knew this award was not the winner ... I like it. It considers the story of five former children scouts to be reconnected, which they have never been able to accomplish like the kids - which they have to mount. Whitehead. Of course, now the scouts of children have grown up and their personality has evolved in different ways, but they were not as different as children. Richard Levis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklin is still like Abi Group's Favorite Abby and Tim Thompson is still in the group's Surfer Dood. Certainly the leading star Louis Anderson, "true believer" in everything related to Q Scouts. He still lives in the same house with his mother, he still goes on to the Q Scout manual every day, he is brave, respectful and clean, and reconciliating others for another great courage in scouting. However, the Grasky brothers made their work more complicated, drumming two slogans from the mentioned coup scouts. Coincidentally they move in their old cave and mercilessly though they decide to annoy them. So neither the three defectors, who think of Pack 7, are from the FBI and the purpose of wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bizarre bits. Richard Lewis tries to get comfortable on a folding cork, for example, and you're a really fun bit going for you. After the next review, the entire film needed more of observational humor. This does not hold well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.
