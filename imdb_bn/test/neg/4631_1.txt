Many people in the movie have enjoyed this picture, but it just seems unfair to me. If "intellectual" smug boring about their annoying sex life, you just feel, see it. I feel bored, but happy I know people like that. The film was based on the fact that with all societies or great civilizations, they finally failed. According to the women's historical character, who shows this truth with us, America shows signs of its fall (acknowledging that she goes in more detail than me). The next part of the film is related to the sadness of their liberation war due to the poor efforts of their friends and colleagues, indecent behavior and seamless behavior and humorous effort. I saw many people where I liked this movie. I can not relate to it.
