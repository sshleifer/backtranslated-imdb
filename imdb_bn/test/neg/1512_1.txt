As a Christian, I think this movie is totally embarrassing. The actor sucked, sucked the writing, sucked cinematography, and the story was so typical. I can not say it is a great witnessing instrument, because I feel very uneasy to show my unassigned friends. Hollywood has many good things, and that's because they are the best investment in it. Christians sh * tty work out and it seems to be okay because "it is for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent a large amount of money to offer to God. David (or Saul .. I do not think) today will be equal to 50 billion dollars to build a temple for God today. But these days, showing up to $ 30,000 to make the film "witness" to film is only kindly. This is a person or a product that affects someone. Do not waste your time while trying to convert your friends with this waste in an hour and a half. If you want to have a positive effect with people, then show their matrices, American Beauty, Bravai, etc. Some movies that say something and actually reach you on it.
