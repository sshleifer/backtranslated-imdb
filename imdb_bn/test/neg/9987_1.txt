All the Roman emperors who probably went crazy, leaving behind the infamous party's gesture and ruthless killings, probably vaguely fierce confrontation ... I know there are several versions of it and it's based on 102 minutes. I saw - but I do not understand how there can be any difference in how to take the rest of the film from this movie! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid of "push" / nudity (which is not too much of a lot here - and boring when it's there) and blood, but be cautious - it's the amateurity of the technological manufacturing industry which is good and true shock here: everything is easy And simply junior film school fan project! Camera-work is frustratingly complete with strange, weird zoom full, framing framing and confusing pans (like a large theater stage and from which!) The quality of a costly, cheap image. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and disrespectful - is it day or night? Are they outside or outside? Have they changed the scene? Who is meant to be shot? The edit here creates confusing mess with ultimate sin, randomly stupid cutware, continuity error, and random transitions that destroy the possibility of speed, story progression and involvement. Possible interesting dialogue and an equally interesting true historical story ... but these results are so tragic that it is very sad. <br /> <br /> The story is so much more than just a Gourantant, burnt (and Fellini-like) Turkish which is good for some golf-smiles and Peter O'Wowel, who made the most memorable Tiberias. Oh yes, which brought our big name to the actor. I want to raise them all together and ask only: How did you get free access to this part from this part? There, I've lost enough lines in one of the really bad movies of all time! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the 10 out of Ozjep
