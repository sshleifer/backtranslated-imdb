This fake documentary is defective in many points, it has been created badly, it has an interesting character but its biggest problem with me is the foundation. <br /> <br /> This movie uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and its some work is based on the real supernatural event that he saw. I am willing to travel in Italy (for suspicion of suspicion only), but some of his works are based on reality and the existence of Insamouth is fairly meaningless. <br /> <br /> First of all, lovemaking does not believe in the supernatural, in his letter, he clearly states that he considers himself a mechanical materialist, his monster, where people can show that people were not so special. Another story used in this movie is that Prem Kumar was an expert on spying, he was not, all of his knowledge came from the most basic source. <br /> <br /> So we're ending with a movie, people embrace each other and when we finally see the giant, it's so bad that you can not laugh at it, you just feel the pain of your love for horror. <br /> <br /> Photo Frankenstein Livacrakt said that she was sorry for Mary Shelley because she felt her work was wasted. I feel sorry for Lovecraft
