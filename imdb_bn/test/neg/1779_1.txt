I was a low budget B-movie and a fan of Cami Harr, on Flickr, but it was too much for me. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the weak plot, but the effect of sugar and acting unconscious, then the terrible writing will kill you, or you will desire. The dialogue was probably written by high school stoners, who thought that "Sir, yes sir" again said, these people are more military. <br /> <br /> All the common cardboard stereotypes in the letters were: Gang-ho sir, santa gung-ho, other people with sensual side, bad scientist with a secret agenda (bad or obvious), malicious brain chick, who tried very well Hot, mobile phone sexy chick with mobile phone information, fool "talent" Nerd, other kinds of shuffle military paintings, which soon die, and ridicule Oh, yes I have forgotten about that, there is a secret military navy submarine, sitting on the ocean floor, 5 seconds headquarters (or it seems to be so) that the crazy scientist who was in charge " , Radioactive cat is full (ok?) And dead body. Your mission is vague and poorly defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you see it, do not say you have not been warned.
