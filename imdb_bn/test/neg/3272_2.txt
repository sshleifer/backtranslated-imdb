This movie is one of the worst lead characters ever. I say this because he is ready to be a hero, in my opinion, he brings all the things that he does in the whole film to bring people's life and create problems. He can not fix anything, even though the film looks at him as a cold dude so everyone looks at him. He has mood tantrums at all times, he has all the wrong positions, he is very nosy, very pushy, very macho, very arrogant, he has made all the wrong decisions and there is no common sense to end up killing mad people and people on him. <br /> <br /> It is a private detective that has been able to find a successful painter, a hired woman and boy, that she has lived many years ago. Intelligence woman and she thinks what her son would be. However, all such things happen to crime, dramas and twists to fulfill such stories. It's made for TV, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> However, movies are fairly entertaining. Johnny Depp This one is very young and has a terrible 80's hair cut. He shouted gamak for almost 5 minutes and tossed football football toss and we'll see him. For some reason, this print sells $ 40 in online auctions outside the VHS version. It will only be for the philanthropic collector. It can not be a plot it can not be. <br /> <br />
