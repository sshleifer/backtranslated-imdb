I'm a big fan of Patricia Hajj and Marim Margoliz, so a few years ago I saw this show in E & E. The program was weird to say weird, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actors. This will be the worst show I've ever seen. I do not see it again and certainly the money to buy the video will not be lost. This TV version is shy and just plain stupid! "Kicker" (pun intended) when Ruth has done her surgery on her bone. James Bond and Saifai have such flaws in the film. If this version book is true, I will not check the book from my local library! After several years I came to see the American version I'd seen this original. Americans were entitled to my surprise, because their version with Merrill Strip and Rozanan laughing laughing laughing Saga works when the story is played for.
