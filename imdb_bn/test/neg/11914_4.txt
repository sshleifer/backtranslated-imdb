Monogram is not a good one (here's not trying to be fun here) Chan entry. Shanghai has done a lot for Cobra, but, in the end, it is very confusing and too annoying to be overly satisfied. The film has been opened with an assassin named Shanghai Kobra, which has already hit twice and now it is related to scenes of diner in some way. We have a built-in connection with a man, a girl, and another person when a man dies on the street. Yes, I'm doing things here for artistic reasons, because it's really the main part of the film's problems - it's going a lot more without any real, full explanation. I did not even go to the diner dog, some of which is involved and a zooker box that talks with you and a screen and there is no problem with everyone! This is all the first five minutes or so. Then the Chan government works for the government and continues to fly to help the friend. He has the right to check the rodium shop of a bank and he is looking for a man wrapped in bandages to help with the arrest of Shanghai many years ago. I found out the very involved plot as described earlier. Back as Toler Chan. She is ever affable Benson Fong and Montmorland also returned. Both work well and are quite funny. But the deceitful plot did not believe me, and most of the films saw with strange, questioned attention. This is not a bad movie that is not only a very interesting one, but also the most dedicated to Chan fans.
