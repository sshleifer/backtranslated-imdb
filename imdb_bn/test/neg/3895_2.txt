I will admit that I have not paid full attention to what is going on in this film, but to be honest, I do not think it will be matriculation. In order to improve the city's image of local councilor Sydney Fidler (Sid James), Fire Cooper's incarcerated Mayor Frederick Bumblebeck (Kenneth Connor) was inspired to keep a beauty contest. They oppose attempts to compete against female freedom fighter Augusta Prodvary (June Whitfield), but their publicity secretary Peter Potter (Bernard Besla) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Filpets (Joan Sims) are there. Youths with Happy Springs (Barbara Windsor), Pallava Parkins (Valerie Leon), Don Breaks (Margaret Nolan of Goldfinger), Debor (Sally Gasson) and Ida Downs (Estenders Wendy Richard) show beautiful Winnie models. When girls beat the cats, it pulled the regular residents, but after some days that funnier innuendos and William (Jack Douglas) did not activate more twitches, it finally reached the contest, and it was just after I was. Can not be disturbed. Also Petty Rolllands are Mildred Bumblebuck, Peter Butterworth Admiral, Joan Hickson Mrs Dukes, David Laws Police Inspector, Angela Grant Miss Vinger, Arnold Ridley Councilor Pratt, Robin Ascith Larry, Patricia Franklin Rosemary, Jimmy Logan, Seychelie Gaby, and Father of the Army's Bill Partev Fire Brigade As Charles Howtrey clearly carries Ounce, but where is Kenneth Williams? I see kids and young people, beautiful polyn fowler in bikini, but for comedy value, it unfortunately fails and additional use of Sony quisel is only on your nerves. Beautiful poor!
