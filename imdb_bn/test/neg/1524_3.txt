I like all the other Don Notes movies, but I have never heard a lot about "Can I frame a picture" and now I know why: it can not enjoy it that it will be enjoyable. This movie can appeal to 9 or 10 years of age, but most of them will also have a finger. Most of the time there is a short entertaining short moment, mostly from Don Knuts, the same nervous, adoptive personality that makes her famous. <br /> <br /> After the end of the film, I wanted to know if my teenager could choose it, the film's fatal error. We were in the full agreement: The parody of Grace's Sidekick character was less than that of Don Note. <br /> <br /> Be happy that Mr. Limpitte, reluctant astronaut, Shakiste song and Mr. Chicken could enjoy the movies.
