How stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of rebuilt ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of the 50-feet tall building, 10,000 clothing, 2 years work, an International Ancient History Committee (Seq!), Some first-class actors and actresses. Final result? An empty-screen TV-movie for the presence of a single digit IQ.
