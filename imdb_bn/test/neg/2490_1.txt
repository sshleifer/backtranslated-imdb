I checked the screen and in 1988 I read the script for this Turkish. It was awful and even worse - I saw it in VHS on the local Hollywood video and said, "Oh, what, what sound sign sign?" Yek <br /> <br /> They had to run most of its fire in Mexico after the financing, some "big" beds were torn apart because they came out of exotic fruit drinks brown. The film's plot is okay, I think, but I know that the author intended to run a spy catcher thread for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were very cheap to hire a professional military advisor. Even Mr. Newman's volcanoes and experts were not able to live up to the stuff of Thanksgiving for this bird.
