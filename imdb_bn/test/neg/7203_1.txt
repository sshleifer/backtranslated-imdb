I hired this movie with the impression that it was "Schercro 3: Dark Harvest", it was a continuation of the SquareCro Slair series (another is ridiculous and in all the terrible series together). I was not frustrated though. It was just as terrible, if not worse, what I hope. I was smiling all over the movie. Each part of bad acting, badly shot and cut footage, and terrible special effects which makes this movie hire rents. <br /> <br /> Special features cast and crew include a compassionate view in six months filming. <<br /> <br /> Dear line, "The sins of my ancestors! They are bent down at this moment!"
