Last night I saw this picture. <br /> <br /> I am worried that I am turning to one of the leftist liberals, they make fun of South Park properly. Because I found it too objectionable. Am I laughingly sensitive? First of all, America's America is the only country in the world, which is physically capable. <br /> <br /> The second, and frustrating, the initial weather strike (somnam ?? Why do they need a name?) in some Asian countries. This feedback is to look at it as a warning. Like "my God, imagine the tragedy that might happen". Because, you know, it happened in Asia. It might happen to white Americans, and * that would be sad *. <br /> <br /> Then, after, hit a big meteorite Paris. Our cast is fired on the ground, because it means we have less time than our boys. Not very bad in America. Not to mention that many people have died. <br /> <br /> Then Michael Clarke has Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted Ever a black man has been so token. Within a group of hardcore drillers, his job seems to be standing behind, sometimes saying "Hey, you're the man." Really Why did they even bring him? It's not like its petite - that shuttle! Once he does not lift any equipment, do not run a space ship or help to fix any such solution. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosnomit (Peter Stormer, another superb actor plays a futile role), who often think of being drunk, and instead of fixing them, hits things with spans because "How do we get to Russia? Drowning ", it is quite awesome. <br /> <br /> Everyone is cemented by the Bloor site, saving all of the green American children is celebrating the butter field and everything is fine. Because death and destruction of the rest of the world is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> you are expecting bad script, guilt, unthinkable plot (fat, middle-aged men to be 12 days training to be astronauts). ? Which seems to be disabled?). But I could not believe in the racism and genomicity described in the film, and whoever is ignorant for the human mind, is not a fanatic. <br /> <br /> This is the complaint of Chile, in a section of the West Zone Society around the world. <br /> <br /> And it's a painful film.
