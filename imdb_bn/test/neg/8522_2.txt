Messengers are a bad, generic and annoying 'horror' movie. This image has a big problem: it is not afraid. Performance and screenplay are completely stupid. It uses old techniques for frustration and smiles by creating all the supernatural events. I will not call Messenger a bad movie ... I call it an accidental comedy because it is so bad that smiles. The only good thing in this movie is that it is short, so this frog will not be with us for such a long time. There are many fine pieces of the Harah style that are sung with low budget (such as Subject 2, Lucky or May) which are sadly ignored, when this shit is successful at the box office. So, I'm not called Messengers, this poor and sadly awful film suggests.
