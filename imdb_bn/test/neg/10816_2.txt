"The Cave" is released more than once with the English film "The Descantes" directed by the Blue Marshal. Share a similar compound in both movies; Unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to that superb awesome adventure that only "cave" is terribly "immigrant". Neil Marshall thinks that the original story was very poor and instantly impressive ideas, depth, and personalized styles were added, where "The Cave" -the director Bruce Hunt just went for the most basic expansion of the painting cast on his desk. The fruit is an incredible median film that you can remember every single dreaded click and most of the violence is stopped. And we all hate it, right? The story represents a cycle of incredible cave-divers trapped between the fully-fledged Romanian underground ecosystem. Stylish Winged Animals, which can be parasites, soon attacks them and it seems impossible to escape because of landing. The first half hour is still light-moody if you are busy with yourself and listening to all the fascinating textbook conversations, the whole thing becomes very scary. Which of the events is even slightly wider and it seems to compete with each other to provide complete performance. I have already seen special effects on the anonymous B-movies, the location of the filming is not fully used and ultimately the perfect sucks! Do not recommend too much!
