This series takes a classic story and it makes garbage. Robin is somehow mysterious by an elk of the forest and is embroiled in all kinds of druidism and complete devil episodes. The story is more about avoiding the evil Sheriff than helping her poor. This is barely guardable. And above all ridicule they kill Robin at the end of the series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people might like this show as a fantasy show, but this is not Robin Hood show. If you want Robin King Richards to fight against Prince John and Sheriff and if you want Robin to be provided with the poor and the oppressed, then see the classic series or the new from the BBC.
