I was excited when they announced the film for TNT. One of my favorite stories from Donald Westlake's "Perfect Creator" is one of my favorite stories. After seeing this I was not thrilled at all that. Recently I had a chance to meet my soil again, again I was frustrated (she did not like that much, and she could not read the book). In this movie, they had torn off all the jokes in the book and turned them into soft mash. A large part of the problem was William H. Messi. I like the fine in other movies, but he plays Terry / Carey Thorp as a stammering, incompetent utility. The book takes a lot of volume for its nerves, but the funny part is almost always collected externally. Spinners follow: They leave a large part of the story (outside the embassy for more than 2 seconds), where Thops Police solves 4 homocide instead of 1. This is not funny, but it helps to establish relationships between Fred and Tharp. Finally Fred's betrayal is not nearly affected, because they seem to not stop them. He has become a great friend, especially Fred, in the book, which makes him more ridiculous. Fred was also a little bit relieved of casting, I love Adam Armin but he is not frustrated, fascinating to survive the Detective, which characterizes the character of Fred, which expresses his evidence more clearly outside the character to mess. More shocking Patricia and Edgarson were very close to the book, and James Cromwell was superb even when he saw many things like Martin Bersham. Completely annoying boat house scene was completely added to the film, Thawp was less interesting than the police founding Edgar's body after Seattle was abducted by the ship and massacre of people. The kit was okay though it was mostly rewritten, and it was nice to die because it became a bit annoying. I do not think the changes to books for the making of movies, I know that they were necessary due to length and disadvantages, but if it were good, some changes in this movie were rather fun or efficient rather than slow.
