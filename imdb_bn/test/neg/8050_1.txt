"Boy, you have to stop the tests you started !!" Somebody is saying that the green light has brightened the project !! In the middle when we were in high school, I often caught my friend in this movie. Now, midnight movie in high school on Friday night, you are not expecting much, but let's go !! And after a few years later again seeing it stand by my original opinion. Great effect but so what !! Perhaps probably made one of the worst movies. As long as you enjoy blood and watch some Hollywood vets (Stigger and Hunter), just fool you for fools. Yuck !!!
