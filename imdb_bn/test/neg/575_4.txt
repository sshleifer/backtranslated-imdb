First of all, Blath did not see Dana Capseau's daughter near enough age to play (and in fact she did not - just ten years apart). <br /> <br /> I understand it may be one of those magical, moonstruck type supernatural romance but this is beyond pale. Highly played, the terms of the script and direction are very weak. <br /> <br /> Allen DeGeneres, who actually flashes here to see this picture, is not as credible as a herdx sex hand. But still respectful In fact, the dancers and young people's skin shots together make Capo Dallas look like this watch. But no one can say if the capsule is not really in love with the young people; No scripts pull it together for us in its acting and left to wonder how we really feel.
