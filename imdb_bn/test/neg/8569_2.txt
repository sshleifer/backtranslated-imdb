I did not buy it, I did not rent it, it was on PPV and someone burned a copy of it and lent it to me, so at least I did not waste any money on it. Anybody in the dark, unnamed, for the Devil's backbone, it's a pretty lame film. It seems that there is something to do with a bunch of girls, the day that was again in the Convent, and now they all grew up and kill one after another from the kitchen sink, manage to discuss the door in the toilet, even a hotel. And this nun is so meaningless and nasty (and wet?) I do not know, it's so annoying that I stopped it by about half, I kept it away and saw something else. Really was not eager to find out, really. Oh sure, there are some lovely young ladies but have to look at, their lesbian two? I think, there is a picture on the table on a young bedroom bed and when a self-respecting horror film will not be complete without a single couple? Yes anyway If you want to see a suitable Noon movie, try "Dissolution", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and it's one with Adrian Barbeau, not with John Malcovitch), 2 out of 10.
