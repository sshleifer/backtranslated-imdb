It has officially created terrible, annoying, genuine, and humorous films. The film is about a crazy baby and all of his friends, and they occupy a 747 land. Her dreams are very intelligent and in no sense, and are done very badly. Every special effect seems to have been done without any modern technology and it has been created by a child who plays "leading role" in the film. If you see this movie, it will definitely fool you. I do not advise you to consider watching this movie, and if you do so, do not miss good fortune and brain cells that you have killed. My comments are not that even fully realized horror creation from hell. The person who wrote the comment before me did not see the same movie that I saw terribly and I have never seen. Peace be upon
