This noise, from director Oliver Stone, seems like everyone has cast in the diving soccer movie - well everyone, except William H. Messi, who could play the role of a serial to sell a Stone, Team Doctor, or "Frookake". . If you are a fan of Foul-Mudd, you can try some awesome, helpless-carrying knock-down, drag-out, barricading phrases, two face-to-face friends and pedestrians. The film is sometimes as good as the atmosphere of a vibrant background party, especially within the first two hours; It also has some MTV stylized music video shows. <br /> <br /> ** A given Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pasino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Fox, Dennis Quaid
