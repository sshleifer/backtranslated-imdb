I do not know whether this movie was like a quiche, now it seems. <br /> <br /> Some of the "Bad News Beer" films were already released in the 1980s, but I think this type of movie is already tired. <br /> <br /> A former football player is partially paralyzed and limited to wheelchairs in Vietnam. The Chicago Bears offers him a PR job but he wants to coach. At the same time, the nephew under her was taken away for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested a dozen times before and he will have to give some difficult time now ... which could be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the child is really a good child, who needs a solid male role model in his life. The same detention facility is for children's children. Yes ... even locking one for murder! I'm sure you already know what will happen so I'll try and keep this brief. <br /> <br /> Our hero has become the coach of the children's football team. <br /> <br /> He crossed the criminals' enemies and earned their respect. His team is facing a local high school team (yes right!) And they get kicked their butts Rather than prove himself a better coach than before, he claims a recovery. Will these be poor, able to improve enough for the recovery of scrapbooked children with a gold heart? The horrific execution of the football sequence destroys the possibility of tension in this movie. "Coach of the Year" should be sentenced to make my brain rough. 1/10
