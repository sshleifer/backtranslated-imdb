**** Will probably contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to get the attention (you will not be sure to get help before you die of a "failed suicide attempt"), Joey Finds that pregnant and spirited images begin to see. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < For a horror movie, there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. Halfway, however, was a really good scary scene (I did not give it away though) :) I saw this movie because I really liked the previous movie, The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused, however, that there was no relation with eye contact from the same manufacturers, except for a "mysterious mystery" movie, * whatever *; Different cast, different stories Eye2 has nothing to do with the eye: <br /> <br /> Some suspicious scenes of the movie were: Joey attempted suicide 3 times (4 times, if you are a witness that the witness says that she is trying to see Joey jumping in front of the train ), She is cruel to the attacker, who is involved in frustration, she bursts in a restaurant and the Witnesses say that she was "an attacker" and she still Has been allowed to go freely about business, not as much a psychological evaluation or assessment of the hospital (other than due to her pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The movie was not the greatest horror film, the story was rather far away (even for a fiction film: P), spooks are a few earlier and / or we have not seen anything before. However, this is an "interesting" story and once you know what "true" behind the sparks, it was an interesting package on the "Scratch" story. <br /> <br /> I rate 3 cinemas 10
