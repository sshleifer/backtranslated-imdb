In the context of the Matrix, this quarrel with a loose connection to VR is "Matrix is ​​just dead!" Reprinted with tag-line, it is in a matrix-inspired cover box (though still "die-to-die"). Because of the fonts preference, the tagline shows the world as "Bibliar". Anyway <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> It may be important to know that this character can not be featured in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a deviation at each level. Jalal Mehriri is not a terrible actor and is influenced by his martial arts. But his partner is played by Stone Ian Laurie, who is the worst actor I've ever seen in this film. Obviously he was elected to look better than Jalal. The worst movie I've seen for long periods of time.
