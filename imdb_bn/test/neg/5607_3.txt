Ragger haor fans will not be able to eat - he only played a camio in this movie and it is IT This movie has lost extra points for that scam. I think Rugger Howler has two very short scenes and 2 very short voice-overs. <br /> <br /> The female leadership of this movie looks more brilliant than these poor elements - this is great, this is a dog in the movie and she is spoiling it. The story is a lawyer who hopes that one day he was firmly committed to the cartoon of the boss of the country for the partnership. There have been several confrontations in the street with various strange people, and a child who plays cars and Napoleonic dynamite for various skits, is cast as a sided character for good measurement. <br /> <br /> A road-trip where our pressed hero is thrown into the extreme cases and he gradually made a little bit of light after the movie, he does not like Grand, Jadha. > <br /> If you want to watch a hot cock one hour and a dork boring truck for a truck only see this film.
