In short, skip this movie, it's bad. In short, this film is about a weapon factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they create bad things, so they are not so popular to speak. A new female CEO comes to clean things, and make sure the company's reputation will improve. He did this secret information with company's secret information ... Do you believe? Yet, he started burning those people who did not see them. Incredible? A peace-loving group tries to destroy the company's mainframe, because those secret weapons have a blueprint. This is a kind of mainframe vault located underneath the hidden building. Of course, the film will not be complete without crazy scientist and robot, which is an ultimate killer machine, similar to 'Allian' from Alien Films. The crazy scientist likes female CEOs. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist directs the robot to kill everyone, and protects his work, takes command chains and makes the film attractive. To participate in peace talks with the CEO and CEO of the chief executive board to escape from the robot. Below the line they avoid the robot, when these evil computers agree to blow the mainframe. They were developing a part of the factory that man discovered, part machine soldier. They can delete a person's memory and replace it with an experienced soldier. One of the peace is transformed into such a soldier and the killer will be robot hunting. I guess crazy scientist also wrote this cinema script. This looks super soldier and works as much as Robocop, though not as funny. <br /> <br /> It boils for this. People are running, a murderer is driven by a robot, hurt by it, but they do not feel disturbed, except for a little longer, and of course the female CEO is the main character of this movie, and can not be killed, that means every attack, explosion survives. , You name it. I will not bother you by the chase, avoid the end. They have lots of weapons, yes peace and they know how to use them. When they were on the roof of the building, they slaughtered the weapons of the killer robot. They step into an elevator used to clean the outer windows. And then the woman's chief executive officer knows some magic, she is complaining about coming out of the bullet on the roof, and the gun is reloaded as a magic. In this way, he can shoot arrows and give up the lift to 70 stories or less and stop the brake on the surface of the ground. And stop it all, the police are waiting for them. Robots jump after them, and the police killed. Not ridiculous? While the mainframe is under the vault, the robot pursues them, and finally the robot is so close to him that he can touch / kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist does not want to kill him. A good name for this man is to be a stupid scientist. Although he made this movie observable. At this moment, I was already dragging the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie will end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie is high at this, and that's why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. This is a demon, and I'm not talking about the Death machine.
