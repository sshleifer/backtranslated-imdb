This show can be accurately described as a TV bubble: it chewing, it has a good taste and it lasted for a long time. But, like bubble gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few chucks. <br /> <br /> There are simple questions on this show that are playing games like Hangman. Simple phrase or guess item on a short list. Caller rival, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions are very simple. Pumping some texas into the music background, which is converted into a continuous loop. It does not look old, but it has added more to the show anyway. The costume, however, does not take into account what it is, it is very personal, can be quite pleasant to look at and create some very ridiculous facial expression. I rather enjoy the British woman <br /> <br /> But this show is nothing. It is simple and incomplete, though it does not have anything else to do but it can be entertaining.
