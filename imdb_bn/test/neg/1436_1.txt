Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movie relies on people's oppression to fear the people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel afraid and awesome, this movie is not exactly this but in a better way. Now there are moments in the movie where Snider has the opportunity to protect this image from a hole but let us be honest, the movie does not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and synden no try or whatever it is to bring itself. When you watch this movie you become sick, depressed, dirty and mad. I have a feeling that this was the intention of the movie. What is less dirt?
