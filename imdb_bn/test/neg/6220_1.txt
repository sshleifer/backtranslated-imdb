After sitting through this movie, I decided that it was one of the films. I only knew that when three teen girls cried and shouted, then Omar met again, and then saw the same thing, only women like my mother did. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh So here's my comment ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + with ridiculous dancing hip thrusts and on top costume is not a good idea = complete. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Branson could not sing his way to a paper bag. And no one else can really be in this ruthlessness for this matter. <br /> <br /> 3 The songs were so random. It is clear to me that they are throwing, incredibly concrete and stupid plots, Willy Nelly. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could write a good script. <br /> <br /> I used to laugh or laugh during the movie. And I usually like movies movies. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny ... but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent I mean, you have actresses and actresses in this movie ... I'm feeling embarrassed for it as part of their career now. I'm sorry to waste my money and time on this piece of shit.
