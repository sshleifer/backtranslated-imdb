Even worse then the incredibly annoying "Emily Rose Exorcism". It has stopped slowly, and as long as the mother said to her mother, "I knew she was supposed to be", I told you so much voice. It was a terrible line, poorly spoken and it predicted the rapid death of this surprisingly bad movie. Each family member has a problem in the past with priests. Dad liked his wife or did not really have any relationship with him, with the murder of his friend, killing his friend, then showing himself a clear instant reflection. People are going to die, others are coming under occupation, and by this point most visitors do not care even longer. Apart from their staff Miguel, a character in this movie was not really a favorite, it became difficult to care for, none of them. The acting was terrible and the writing was even worse. Glad I saw it free; Although I think this bad guy paid me money for the movie.
