I bought this movie for a dollar and I could never make a mistake, seeing my big mistake. Ice-T and Rapping have enjoyed the performance of the film about Los Angeles and the World of Pimps. A boxer who killed one of the practitioners, and did a career, but retired from mental illness due to childhood and due to other boxing wars. He is hired by a pump who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work in the business for them and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with all of the boss's girlfriend and love. It is entertaining and it becomes a big comedy comedy.
