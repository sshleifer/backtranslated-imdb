SPOILER Wolfcreek meets the Texas Censo Genocide .... If you've seen them, do not waste your time with this one. Splashal Slashar movie, there is nothing new without the spiller "aspect" which simply adds fluff to a weak plot. If you do not have anything to look at, I would recommend this movie and look at this movie or look at the bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part of the dog is drinking when the dog drinks in the sheriff's office, I say it is interesting because at least he used the alcohol instead of using it instead of using it to kill the bad guy. The end that did not go to the root. Above all, lam, bad, and not worth the effort.
