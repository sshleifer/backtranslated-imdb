I'm a big fan of sledge and horror movies, when you combine them, it's my sweet spot: the terrible puzzle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although Sleaze is not too sleazy. It did not register too much in my sledge meter, because none of the girls was less attractive, even they did not try to be threatened. What they thought for lunch, or maybe they might score some cracks. <br /> <br /> Forget about the effects, they were extremists. Bad acting was contributing lameness; The effect is hard to believe when the influential and the actress are not even buying time in them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was quite bad, they could hire a couple cameramen from a pornographic movie and make it better. In fact, it may be sufficiently enough to produce a range factor to make it enjoyable. As it is, there are many dark shots where you can not see very clearly and that you can not see very well. <br /> <br /> Take a terrible factor. Just Zero. Nada Zip Zilch I saw the kids movie that was more terrible. There are no camps here. This is just a movie which frustrates frustratingly, but it also does not stop.
