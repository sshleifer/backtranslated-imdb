I pay $ 2.00 for this piece of nut, I want my money back. This is not an advertised grade lady movie which is the main reason for this actor, genuine sadness, lack of nudity (which starts with the addition of nurse) porn and still nude corpse Breathe flash, there's no one there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is probably the best thing because it has a somewhat seemingly ordered guitar rif / track. <br /> <br /> <br /> Your normal common letters, jokes, jokes, women, innocent people (who looks more like joke), Rookie Police / Ranger (The biggest difference between his teeth, in which I have a few dollars Go to the gap .. or go for a field goal) Mysterious fella and pure girl <br /> <br /> <br /> Make-up Draw helicopter As well as see a clean "make-up line" and natural skin tone Besides cche was sad, DVD cover art is definitely in Photoshop / has been extended in order to enhance said. The hello looks like the old "plopper". Dr. Nervous women around the helper are not interpreted and l suddenly like the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot twist was very predictable and bad looks were empty limbs, what they thought, ... um throwing some organs and some fake blood and you have a horror picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Attempted to use incognito doctors and helper (bicycle) and "Bingo" created a painful film to get sick. <br /> <br /> I've seen bad before ... but it's just bad. Everything about it is bad ... lack of suspicion ... lack of real horror or character development ... lack of a decent storyline ... only that was good after the end of this movie. This picture is not so bad in the section "For me" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
