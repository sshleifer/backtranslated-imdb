One day I thought to myself ... What is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered my self with a simple, "Oh, it happened already. I rent Killjoy / Killjoy 2 on DVD". Well, what to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, cut scenes of movie scenes and death scenes. A funny line that I can remember, and the performance is much worse than the first. The "set" (anywhere somewhere in the woods) and the killer known as Kiloji seems to have no light of astronomy (who looks like a leprÃªncio de Existent). This time, he is not illustrated by Angel Vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy excited coat. A different kind of crazy clown that says "baby" a lot. Somewhere between Freddie Kruger and Gray Blade ... this version of Killjoy lies. There is a pile of holes and a shield. It is underestimated evil. There is no freedom fighter in this movie, except the song's ending song ... which enjoys something in Las. Killjoy 2 is not even a movie, so exercise as an exercise. Killjoy 1 is considered to be the least bad enough to be considered as the worst movie I ever seen. Small Speaker ######### I describe one of the supernatural murder scenes. A girl is locked in a descending wooden shade (perhaps an outhouse?) When Killjoy peers through a hole. She has some small shiny teeth (as you can buy at Spencer's gifts) and she does something with them (perhaps their winds flow?!). Then he held them in their hands and said a terrible line (which can not be written in IMDB). From what I have collected in this scene (from what is shown by the film) the teeth come out and kill the girl with something interesting, but in a tragic way, and then come back to Kalje. I was the tooth if I ran. Run away from Killjoy so that he could never get his hands on my hand. Killjoy 2 Hope the last Killjoy we have to endure. Even one of the fans of the film feels very bad, I think this "film" can unite the human race and maintain world peace, if it is promised that the film and remind us about it will be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - easily because God has succeeded in moving pictures.
