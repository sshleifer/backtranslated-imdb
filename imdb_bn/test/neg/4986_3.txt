I did not like the underdog! I mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it might have been passable, but I did not like the main part. It's not like any other small film. I did not see those who wanted to watch this movie to show cartoons with kids to meet kids, I'm not even among them, so this picture did not appeal to me a little. There was some problem with me. Jason Lee did not have the right voice for Underwood, it would make him fool and genuinely intelligent. Then it was really predictable that you feel tired and crazy. This humor really makes me crazy, it's just unclear and somewhat tragic. One of the things that worried me most was that it was almost satirical or rude from Undead's face. Activated but needed a little improvement. If you have children, they can enjoy it, but if your child does not have all the ways to see it you can unlike it like me. 3.4 out of 3.4 stars
