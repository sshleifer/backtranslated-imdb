Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is fantastic but this film is better than the medieval and that being generous. The story line is constructed on a itinerary and is completely uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> Set it to Neerk's Shore, the plot seems to be ridiculous. All of the film's collections have worked well in Tuscan countryside and occasionally visible scenes in Florence and Paziatone and a film-the-sun-sync-slow-western-western film. The loveliest losses in all the world.
