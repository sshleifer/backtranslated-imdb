This movie supports self-justice! It gives freedom to a black man who kills a man who rapes a male and ultimately gets frustrated! As good as this may be, there is adultery in this film. Connegue's character is hot for the bulk character and some of the films have stereotype of the trial film (such as the important news brought to the court in the right time) which makes me sick like a film-gear replacement! I really can not believe anyone who likes this junk. This is a movie that holds so bad and false ideals that I can not enjoy my critics disciplined. When will the Americans wake up and find out that they are transforming into 24 characters through a few movies that make things a reality where only this is their hand. This cowardice attitude only makes me sick and in my eyes it represents something wrong with America!
