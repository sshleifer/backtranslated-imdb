I am absolutely positive my fellow IMDb critics can not believe. This film is all about the "real" movie, which is that they did not see "ring" or million million imitations that came about 10 years later from the film. And some of them claim to be awesome movie buffs! I do not think "Shutter" is okay. Average, I want to say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there is no real and great way to it and a critic as "the most awesome thing I have ever seen". Puh-leeeze, man. Plain this one. I swear, if I see another ghost movie where the protagonist finds out the ghosts, why he is so crazy and after them, I'm going to scream. </ br /> "original"? Give me a break. You need to get people more Or at least stop calling yourself "horror movie fans".
