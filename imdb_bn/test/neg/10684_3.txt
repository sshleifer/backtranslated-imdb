After the 1st century, the dual of guns became alarming, a charming young woman became a vampire. He is not the only undesirable, he uses his gothic, seductive personality to maintain his talent as a cold blooded killer. This is a low grade B feature that should go directly to the video. Violence is harmful and magnificent, but actually quite light. The story lines are so weak and the dialogue is so frustrating that many interest in it is hard to work on. Aileen Daly is the main character Lilith Silver. Also cast in Mark Kevin, Kevin Howarth, and Isabell Brook
