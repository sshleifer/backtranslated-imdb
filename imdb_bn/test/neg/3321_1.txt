I remember all the popularity around this movie while killing Aly. Due to being a fan of Mrs. Rice's novels, my first thought was, "How can they be suppressed without the Vampire Lestat?" <br /> <br /> Finally, I saw the movie, now I can see what they have done. If you read these books, bring out the poorer parts from the vampire lashts, cram the Marcus and Marias into one character and at the beginning of the Lestat (wolf hunting, playing his vampire, the theater of Vampire and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabriel), then the last 15 Within minutes the queen of Damdan trembled <br /> <br /> What we have opened is a very important part of Lestat's character. His internal torture to be alive, that he carefully chooses the killers as his victims, and tries to love his hatred with Louis, Armand, Gabriel and all other vampires. It is also important with the story that we opened the story "Twin Stories", which is the source of Mrs. Rice's vampire. And when I was convinced that cancer was intense for screening, they could do more, and showed us more ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the love interest in this love has spread to us between Jesse and Lestat. Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those who do not know, this is another form of hentaiya (Japanese porn comics). But in Yoney, it's about a gay man relationship, a woman. Although I'm sure that many male characters adopt "homosexuality", they move towards each other in this movie. Instead of retaliation of Lestat, he went after the young women's group. <br /> <br /> Other errors in logic and tale are huge. In the beginning, Lace started to wake up for a century long, then Marie asked how he made it with red velvet in the 1950's. Marius did not have any idea who was Elvis, and said he was sleeping through that time. He is astonished to know about Lestat 50's fashion and music, since he himself had been asleep at the same time. And never even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabriel. I think that's a huge shame. Looks like "Snow White and 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie I thought was really bad. The only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the pronunciation pushed me towards the wall, and all the deep parts of the book were removed, we were left with only an open shell, after eating the dry milk, like anchilles. <Br> <br /> If you want to watch a better modern vampire movie, get the best of the old, interview with a vampire, or even some older episodes of dark shades. Cut this one into a rest, through a heart, a cloth around the neck, and a dew of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Finally, remember, Alia: Before the death, there was a dramatic release plan to go directly to the video. That's why it's clear now. It is tragic that anyone would be remembered for this genre as a genius, instead of where he really shines. <br /> <br /> I guess the scale of 1-10.
