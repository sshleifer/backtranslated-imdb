Bruce Willis, naturally, does a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> [Warning: can be considered an "explosive"] <br /> <br /> My friend thinks that it was good, when my watch would end during the whole movie. Seeing such a great flicker as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I'm Disney's "The Kid." I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Willis is a middle-aged man with a strong and realistic attitude of positive spin in the picture of the person (he is a painting consultant). An unknown baby shows up. Yes, it is smaller than that, even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this time I reminded a poor "Quantum Leap" episode and a cross between a bad time flick. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis are trying to find out why. They thought it When they grow up, they meet Willis. It does not always tell how much Willis sends in the telephone to his time and to get involved with it, how he started the knowledge, how he came to realize to do this work, etc. <<br /> <br /> Basically, this is a very tired, unreasonable, irrelevant plot, some of which are great actors. The good news is that the "The Kid" actor is nowhere near boring as presented on TV trailers.
