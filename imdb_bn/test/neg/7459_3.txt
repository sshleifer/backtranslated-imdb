Before watching this picture, the 1998 version was my only experience in this Dickens story. I did not enjoy this picture very much, but this 1974 adaptation came in a dysfunctional fashion. <br /> <br /> The actors do not shine, the main couple Michael York and Sara Mile, especially in wooden cases. The only real character of interest for me was that of Ethni Koel's intelligent jaggers. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. This is a true lesson about how your distorted values ​​and emotional principles can destroy you. Live with open mind and take care of what other people say, if you do not, others will not accept it, **** 'em Pip said this early, but he could not hear. <br /> <br /> The girl adopted by the wonderful old lady reminds me a little of the story of the old Kashhiper House, not on the same horrible level, but how she deceived her, to create an executor of her personal deformity against the opposite sex opposite sex He poured the child. Pip's childhood does not appear much better. The ending story does not seem to fit the rest of the style. The sets seem to be cheap and I'm coming to visit. I am not surprised to see that it was actually a TV movie (which I had no idea when I retained it from the library). <br /> <br /> Live and learn. Many good movies, so little time. That's why reviews are here So you do not have to waste your time in such movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
