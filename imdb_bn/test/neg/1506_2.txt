This picture is so horrific that it's funny, fairly high, it's not 2 levels, but interesting. Acting horror, music is oppressive and a blind bit of knowledge of stories. The story revolves around a man wearing a horrible old woman dress. Death scenes have happened very badly, they are colorful. A girl gets thrown repeatedly in the chest, but does not cry, does not try or self-defense or escape. He managed to remain permanently despite being stabbed repeatedly. Another death scene involving a rope is extremely delightful. No thought seems to have been made in the plot. GRAINY can wizardly move from one area to another (such as a shoot where the page is only hidden under the pages where it is standing, even before someone stands in front of 10 seconds), people inappropriately kiss unnecessary moments (if you are retreating by a horse dog But you will kiss and kiss someone) and at the end the double twist is almost laughable Seems to be, because it looks like it only has left people confused. I would suggest people to watch this movie if they like horror films like Troll 2, The Dredged or Blood Gnome, but if you expect a horror film then do not lose it, you will be disappointed
