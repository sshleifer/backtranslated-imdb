It is a poorly written and badly managed small film, pure and simple. What was interesting and keeping me watching was in some quantities, production values. It would seem to have a bad script and shot on the video appearing on the bad side, it has a terrible production value. When the spectators see a movie that is horrible and is shot in the video, then it expects. But in this case, they spend some money and it shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of spending money amount, they could spend a little more impressive set design, but it would have been worse for some better to see a better execution story. But even then again, the new Hollywood producers hope we will never do the hollywood.
