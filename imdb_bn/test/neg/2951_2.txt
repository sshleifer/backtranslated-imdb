We were waiting in line to watch Jennifer Anastan's wonderful movie, when some women came with this cheap spider, Haven from Manna in a 20-dollar bill advertisement. "See this movie!" He said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Now, this should indicate our first. I mean, how many cinema directors are directors in the movie and begging people to lobby in the lobby? "Is this a Christian film?" I really do not care, one way or the other. I love Jesus Any shame "No!" He defensively said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is BAD. very bad. And it is not only the obvious Christian agenda, but also because of the terrible dialogue, that works in wood and overexaggerated, and in the obvious lack of an editor. The film is very long way. If it is one and a half hours, maybe (maybe maybe) I will not visit the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm actually lying. See, one hour after this garbage we snuck in Swimpan. At least with Swimman we know it's junk before watching movies. We know to bind ourselves. And the Swiman has hot half nude people. The only half-naked thing in this movie is the starry disappointment, among which there are a few hidden hidden offers. And actress noon got? It is called a personality. <br /> <br /> <br /> People were asked to pay a tribute to the sale of tickets in the lobby that if I liked my Big Fat Greek Wedding, then I * Manna * Manna * (My emphasis, not me ) Love Right Better, "If you like GLITTER, you love Henven from Manna." And Mariah might actually outperform any outcomes of clowns from this flickering. If it is not insulted, then I do not know what. <br /> <br /> I'm busy enough. See indie film, but do not see bad ones. This is definitely one of the worst one. Henna needs some divine intervention from the manna.
