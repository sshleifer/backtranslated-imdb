Most positive comments posted here are verbose as movies! To appreciate one word and annoying film it takes to carry a long wind, think one. Some have called the "fascinating" film, which means slow and vulgar to the plot, but a Dutch critic has nailed the head: this is an important event, which is set in the first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a rocker, which predicts, talks about non-stop and irrespective of what is going on. So just about all other characters! <br /> <br /> The only silent dream sequence in this film - the 1930s Soviet Propaganda Snippets - and it's the most interesting part of it. This movie tells you something about how viewable it is. <br /> <br /> Most painting machines in extreme bonding scenarios - such as seeing a crack among blind people - become old and fast.
