I should have gone without watching movies after reading the review here. I saw the whole film on Fast Forwarding and finished in 25 minutes. Although its low budget movie can make it even better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch immediately. And why this is so much better at bad weather when the movie is named "crash landing". <br /> <br />, without any acting, all the letters where moving or working like kids. Do not forget to comment on the <br /> <br /> and Joker - the main hijacker who would have been better if this movie was a full-time comedy.
