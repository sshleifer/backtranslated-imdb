Cameron Croe's very weird screenplay (following his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" heels) has gone a lot less inspiration and stupid gogs. At least the "Fast Times" slipstick was a clear part of the satire and sensitivity (good courtesy, Courtesy of Amy Hacklerling and Crowe's unworthy tendency to hold character-perfect teenage words); Here, Chris Pen (Sian's Brother, Dance) Hit of Off, who created life for the straight arrow, and filmmakers think he is ridiculous. Jenny Wright has some good moments like Mal-Worker, but Elan Mitchell-Smith is suffering from a young man who seems to be a chef-hacker with a former soldier. Quizzes, confused nongres, have a full soundtrack with a glossy shin and pop-rock tunes, but hope to avoid letters. Supporter players Le Thompson, Rick Maranis, Lee Wing, and Sherylin Fan played the stupid role. * ****
