I knew the law through television in the early 90's and I liked it ... <br /> <br /> What do you like about it? Cranky drawing style? Neutral artistic action involved? Communication between dead and deadpan in characters? The entire layout of the surrounding future world? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />, Was hopelessly over-strained with the transport of the original content of a new film. If you are not familiar with the original series, then you will not understand anything for the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is unreliable and steam characters do not develop during filming. <br /> <br /> The attempt to improve the story by implementing some poor interpretive conversations in the main characters is not a single attempt to cover its flaws as a storyteller, it is simply incomprehensible to the main idea. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron could be an attractive woman, but she can not make the character of ion unaware. Although the string action associated with the scenes, its lack of physical speed only destroys action sequences in the film. As a result, a great amount of photo cut to cover her physical leanness. <br /> <br /> Forget about everything else, it is not worth talking <br /> <br /> <br /> I give 1 point for MS. The pictures show his boobs and 1 point for excellent architectural images. That's it.
