This is the slowest "film silent" film I've ever seen. Very weak scripts only allow Jack Slants and Rod Steiger to provide extraordinary good, which is made for a playback hearing. Both Paul and Stigger are truly serious actors, who can play their respective roles with power, emotions and drama. The story itself is an incredibly slow dynamic, mostly taking place in a living room. Visitors provide a lasting line to keep the audience moving slowly from being attentive, because the director must move the actors around a Wrightmatic Circle. This step is not taken until the last 10 minutes of the film. If you look for more depth in criminal drama, it's not for you!
