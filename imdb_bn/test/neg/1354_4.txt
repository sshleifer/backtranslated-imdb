I believe that the whole book can be written about ODC for the rebuilding of this movie based on a classic movie. When Hollywood first started talking about this kind of enterprise, the response was always negative, because many beginnings with the original strong strong ankle went wrong, and in the same way the elections were started. Actresses can perform extraordinary tasks, but in a part that is not suitable, and sadly enough, a director who does not understand or appreciate a heavy source, is driven by his hand. <br /> <br /> It seems like there is no focus or direction, or if the direction that is taken can be good for the original. This is called an update, let us delete the story of humor, graduation dialogue, and any interesting premises. Most of all, prove that women have come a long way, the problem is that we can not really get to see (actually seeing this movie) where women are really going. <br /> <br /> Meg Ryan, who played a leading role, has proved fatal to the film because even after 20 years of working in movies, he seems to have tallened himself, where girls do not really see the change. Her mother proved to be a solid rider at the age of 30, in any way, she had learned, learned, and realized that her relationship with other stereotypes was born in "The Wizard of Oz" like Dorothea. It may not be a choice that women will celebrate nowadays, but it was a fun journey and fun part, it was cats, stupid, sometimes crystal routines that raised the film in the glorious region. Here, we are down on the earth with a cold. By changing Sylvia's nature, the film has lost most of its spark, and it is not the fault of anti-Bening in any way. I could not help but expressed appreciation for how he tried to save this sinking ship and he got the sinking feeling when he fought with the awesome lines he operated. Thankfully, I looked at some of his finest parties and entertained myself and reminded myself how talented this woman was. His Sylvia is intelligent but faulty, and he may have a great creation. Unfortunately Mrs is not paying attention to his own work and has lost control of one character, which can turn the film into a new direction. <br /> <br /> Yet these were not their greatest condemnation. Basically, we're doing one of the best performances by a woman perhaps by Joan Crowford. With its crystal legend, conniving lines, stimulating moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. He had links between men and women, and through him we knew what was the whole disaster. He provides tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, extreme femme fatale. We are knowing a woman intelligent and acclaimed, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy our heroine to save. Eva Mendes, like him, is fantastic, because of poor writing, this level is two dimensional, and again, some bad casting. <br /> <br /> More torture of movies, such as those who play a terrible role for mensing, dedicated mother who lives for kids and rather annoying lesbian turn by Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the film, such as Bate Middle, who is a little unknown in his makeup, what he can do is show the spark. His acidic delivery reminds the contemporary angle that the film can accept. His words have been revived and created a lot of arrogance in the film, and it is really exciting to see that it can really fly, then he has gone. She is in the movie in six minutes, and she fades away in the middle of the hole. Here is a movie which raised the level of our expectations and really disappointed us, a film that could join successful "sex in the city" who made tremendous transformation on the big screen because it respects the element of its source and does not compromise . It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It really updated what it has been successful before. The "current woman" will have to go back to her current resurrection and reiterate herself, like this, like "hul" this year, it is related to the more appropriate actors, the really good authors, and most of all, who really make real films really fame.
