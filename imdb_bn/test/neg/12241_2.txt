I saw a preview for this movie on TV when I think it might be a fun movie. I was roasted. Although I'm not completely against movies that make fun of others Some are actually funny as the first scary movie. This was not a lot that was made of late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And if you are anything like me then try to choose each film instead of focusing on how you are doing. Even this movie was dry to adult adult laugh. Make yourself a favor and you do not rent money and time and save this movie
