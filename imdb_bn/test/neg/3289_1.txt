I finally managed to sit through a full episode of this show. I was very tired, too. Clearly. I always have to stop it before I think it was bad. Looking at a full episode convinces me that it's really bad. I could not tell you what could happen, but I do not think I laugh at all. For those who think of this new, married to the family or the children ... did you actually see that show? They are well written and well played and most important, funny! This show is not funny. If you ever watched this first time you might think so. I can not see anyone else. I echoed all the previous feelings of arrested development ... etc. Perhaps my own fault for being frustrated with the television and not seeing it, is my own fault, so that the stupid people can actually dictate what the wind is.
