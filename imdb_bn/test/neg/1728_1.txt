<br /> <br /> Originally, Dr. Crowford (Dennis Hooper) predicted that a meteorite would hit Earth, I found myself increasingly angry. "Energy that does not believe in" so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Loay (Peter Nirata) is his fate reporter for a trashy tableide who gets a tip from a friend, thinking he was running on the hill. He set out for the investigation. <br /> <br /> While trying to seek shelter in a secret shelter, Jake spent a lot of time to kill people or to kill an inch of their life. Dr. He spent the rest of his time at Crowford, who gave Doctor the right to decide to live this satellite. <br /> <br /> I wish Jake to be a big favor in the future. And turn a gun on yourself. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this Turkish.
