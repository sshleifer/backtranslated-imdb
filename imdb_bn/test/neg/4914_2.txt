I often wonder how such movies are made, and the most threatening part is that people actually pay for watching them. <br /> <br /> It seems like Aksar has created the story as a director, when he likes twists and turns added, how ridiculous they are. This script does not exist with "Joe Shen Rai Chenthai Hi, Wahf Fashion Hot Hai" and "Yeh Varses High Madam" (yes right) with inactive dialogue. <br /> <br /> Each letter was shallow and backward. The acting was horrific. Constuums (terrible case for lycra for Udita and a stockman Emran), were localized (many houses that were used for internally even a vaguely similar to a Victorian palace), screenplay etc., just one word-garbage. <br /> <br /> See for those who like Hashmi and her movies. For me, I've never seen one and a half hours ago. The only freedom fighter was the music which was a bit honest.
