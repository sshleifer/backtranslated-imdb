Another 'nature run amock' horrible flick that Nest is failing due to really low budget. Acting is okay, and the setting is great, but in any case the whole picture seemed to me a little dust. The effect of Gore is not good I saw but a cheesy sort of way is funny. Roaches bite people that regularly cockroaches themselves. Nest reminds me of a lot of good films called Slugs. If you like Nest, the slugs must look ten times as good. Lisa Langlois, starring Elizabeth, was also in a film called "Decision of the Run of Amak", in a film called Deadly Ice (Uk the Rat), which you thought was a killer rats. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy such horror films you will want to give it a watch, but you will be better off watching the slugs which are much more interesting and secondary.
