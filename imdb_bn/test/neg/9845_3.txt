"Pucca" is one of the most dangerous Indians that manages to circulate and gives bad name to the Indies. Pubic twin sisters are telling a stupid secret story that killed their parents, moved away from the car accident and then hit the streets while shopping in the happy shop, some people were seen by the Gao Gogh and no soldiers deployed at the post of the army. Want it (yes, right!). A clear attempt for the arrival of the age, "Ripp" is almost complete loss because the players go beyond the character of the spectacularly and out of character, eventually tearing the credibility found anywhere. Not recommended for anyone.
