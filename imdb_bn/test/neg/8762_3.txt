There is not much to say about this, perhaps it is probably the worst event in the first cyclone of the Zambian film (I see the other, the reform of the Jumboes [1936], before the end of the month). With them, for all the stars starring John Carradine to build an army in the Third Reich job, they do not see much! James Basket (Uncle Ramus!) From South of the South [1946] starred his leader, who performed the role of Caradine's husband. Black Comic Montan reconsidered the role of his 'Fraby Cat' Chauffeur from the Kingdom of the Zombies (1941) of the Moroccan Kingdom, as the owner of the house named Madame Sully-Wayan Caradine. Unfortunately for Carradine, its maximum credit ?? Zombification his wife ?? He brings all kinds of trouble: His relatives can not look at his remote residence / lab for his sudden death (which means he makes a funeral service fraud!) But he proves to be really disobedient and angry, eventually 'persuaded' his fellow zombies To rise against their master !! Cowboy was also associated with Star Bob Steele (Howard Hawkes was famous for his bit in the Big Sleep [1 9 46]), who is presenting a US secret agent as a Nazi body as Sheriff! Thankfully, Director Sekley had a better fortune with his next successive effort, The Day of the Triphides (1962).
