This one is the old "good turn well" yarn cutting is a poor effort, which we have seen many times before. It actually reminds me of the 'players' of the American series, though there is no good. Omar Apps is totally disgusting to the ankles as hard people, such as Rebecca, who is misled by being a funny person. Dans' performance was good, and you can see from this performance, why he acted in Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD Squad is a movie which is very exciting and is located in the gray area of ​​comedy. Occasionally it takes serious but other times it tries to be ridiculous but unfortunately fails. The film has about half of the feeling of finishing - as it stretches in the 90 minute mark. <br /> <br /> You'll be disappointed.
