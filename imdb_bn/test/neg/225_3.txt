After reading flowers for love in a drama class, I was looking forward to seeing how Sam Shepard's great drama was translated into the screen. A lot of my frustration, it was nowhere near as recreational as the sport. The film began to pull, music was inappropriate for the movie's voice, and all the raw power of the game seems to have come out of this film version. It is embarrassing to come out of Shepard's role as well as to play the role of Eddie. Be your own ... next time it is taking place in your area or simply reading the book instead.
