I like underdogs. So, after 12 years of seeing Star Trek V for the first time, and I thought it was maliciously bad, I gave it a second watch, I hope I want some release which I missed for the first time. <br /> <br /> The text is half-baked, and even though the first quality of the role can be firmly firmly placed on its feet (nevertheless shakily), the more we get it sillier in the plot. The last quarter of the film is just ridiculous. What was even worse than original Cast Pov was that it was the first ST movie released afterwards, after the return of television to the next generation and the average part of Next Generation has been embarrassing * - with special effects! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, because I can think of watching it because you will appreciate more of the other movies. <br /> <br /> * Unless it is an episode with Trori's mother.
