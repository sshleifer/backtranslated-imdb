I think I've won the "contract" contest for this movie, since I've got 50 movies for 20 movies as part of the "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection, which means I paid for a chance to show something like 50 Cent "Black Fest" version of a movie released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a basic "revenge" flick, "black fist" is not very bad, although it is probably interrupted by a low budget. One of my official "thumb rules" to watch the movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and screenplay, the film automatically gets at least three stars. That is certainly the case here; There are some appearances in Losan and some charisma, and perhaps he's got a better film career. <br /> <br /> Road Fighting Danceography (visible reason for film) will not really affect any person that has ever been trapped in martial arts school or even schoolboy war. I've spent almost two years learning just about basic kung fu, but even I will never read here for the "stamp" kick in front of display, arm draggers and round-house fans. But the atmosphere is good - crowds of dust, blood and screams, and the actors keep some feelings in the battle scene. <br /> <br /> Less credible plot. Dosne's character "Leroy Fisk", portrayed as a street smart, sharp young man, who finds work as a pick-up militant in illegal, unauthorized street mills. Yet, is he surprised when the police is surprised? Forgive me, but I was raised in small town Iowa and even I * knew (seeing Charles Hardon's "hard times" with Charles Branson) that the police must pay for such action and those who want to fight get the fixers to match them, and That fixer was worth the money. So you will have to deliberately see the suspension of your critical faculty to take this film as your "Critical Black Brother" movie. (Most non-black fighters face the same deal in most cases, yes?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> The director must not have budgets to take pictures of some scenes, so he had to fill the gap with a slightly ridiculous exposition scene ("I know him, I wore him, and then I killed him" the scene just does not work) voice-over And with montages weird and unconvincing Is. It seems to be specially portrayed as a forthcoming thought which is true with the true romance angle. "Fisks" wife seems to have to burn her drive to retaliate when she is a little ironic. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Calling a long drive for a short day on the beach. "But it closes things in a reasonable way satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stall This movie created itself as a real budget and the same cast, slicker set and costume itself as a hero, then people would appreciate it as the next rocky, which shows you how to laugh about the situation and opportunity with the filmmaker's dream. <br /> <br /> Valuable for watching for a variety of appropriate shots and lines and Dobni Kolman embarrassed himself in his own role Ray to see the value.
