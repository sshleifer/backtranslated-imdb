In 1970, at the age of 19, I came out and heard that when it came and reading reviews here was so funny, I finally hired it. I did not laugh at once - a very strange flick - and I usually love Rayner. That's why I have not seen it as fun for my life life. I did not have one chocolate. And I love the comedy! Oh well, at least now I know what all shout was. My idea of ​​a comedy is not. Rent a Navigator or The Love Nest by Buster Keaton - Comedy Classic Now! If you rent it - rent a backup so that you do not damage your entire evening. 10 score out
