Bulletproof is a clearly disposable film. The types of bullets are good guys and riddled with bad guys, where splatted all over the place, so you are not really supposed to see them as humans. Yawns in the line from Wayans and Sandler are indeed widespread. They work hard, but lazy and absurd, personality itself does not make a good movie. Jimmy Ear plays a nifty villain but he was always on the redneck edge that he prepared. A TV ad repeat clip in my favorite scene that reveals that American qualities can be expressed by 2 cars in every garage in the world. Alongside it is a friend movie with brain guns. Pass this one.
