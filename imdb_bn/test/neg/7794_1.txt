Could the writers who can create such "jokes" have found such empty lives that they have to be involved in their sad sounds like them? <br /> <br /> Why are the talented and brilliantly busy Philips crossing this trash? I can not stand the Hispanic girl standing, whose pronunciation seems very fake and is so illusory and annoying, as the African-American girl with acute voices. <br /> <br /> Jokes are often fools, the Jewish man yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere, it was very terrible for the love of a special episode with the slider. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that many people will work in search of love office and only one person? Of course all women are tight-fitting tops and talents are up to make up for their lack of tones. <br /> <br /> I found Holly fun in her old show and I am always complimentary busy but this show was stupid, empty and there was nothing for it.
