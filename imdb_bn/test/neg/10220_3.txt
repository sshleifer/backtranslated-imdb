Sometimes the filmmaker for the first time, full of fullness, associated with two or more limbs from fellow filmmakers, who goes into the style of the head, which is astray, uncertain and dramatically frustrating, personal aspect of the story, very personal side, smudged the purpose of telling a good story Gets Gaglia entered a horrific program at the age of 13, which was largely brainwashed by "terrible" tricks of psychoanalytic psycho-f *** sessions, which could go for days, and the attitude of rehabilitation leaders, most of the Nazi cringes finally fled at the age of 15. Goes. I am glad he came out, although he can now go for real rehabilitation for his filmmaking skills, if you want to learn something for a while, say the structure, the right light, the fluid camera movement, the hottest with the actors and the other basics that have been lost forever. <br /> <br /> This is more frustrating because Goglia is talking about something that should be shown more. To the public (recently a newsweek article was mentioned about the rehabilitation of similar AA communities).

The closest to the character that someone would think of, the bronze teenager Toni Sirira (Galagher), who is accepted from his mother in New Jersey's rehabilitation, must be the closest to Gaglia, it is actually much more than one dimensional. There are very small back-stories (we can see black and white in a short house, a short phikak-out) and there is little connection with his mother (mother), which has more potential than ever to go away from the cold stone.

This is not just the unsupported letter, most of which are reduced to stereotypes, which are violent D.A.R.E. Rip-offs (perhaps some of them, a black-eyed black young man, passive-aggressive counselor, even older sisters, who were knocked down by the siblings and jointly discontinued and thrown in the program, had more time to develop more if more ). Gagliya was so indifferent to her multiple role in the $ 30,000 budget that she could not have any potential talent for her. He mostly uses shadow, mostly shadow which shows urine-coated), he woke his own DVX camera held in his hand as it seems to be a dark castle city, sometimes a character shoots only in the frame frame, Indie is the worst possible selection from Soft-Rockers and with Nicholas Best (inspiration?)
