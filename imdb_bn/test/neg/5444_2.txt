Bad acting and poorly managed, "Congo" failed to recreate the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is, the book was not that big. Nevertheless, the first issue of the film is the character of Tim Curry; The second problem is that the talking arm has been added; Although the main problem, cast members do not make realistic characters. I'm sure this movie will not make you feel like a killer gorilla anywhere in the world. Also starring Laura Lynch (Happy Birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Arnie Hodson, Grant Hesslow, Joe Do Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I'm guessing their resume does not want to force this movie.
