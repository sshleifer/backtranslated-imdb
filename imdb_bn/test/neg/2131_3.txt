I hope I had something positive to say about Devil Fish, but I can not really come up with anything. I can not even come in many "bad, good" moments with so many. Devil fish is just plain old bad. The plot is completely derivative (ja, someone?), Acting wood, reluctant characters, special effects out of bad, and scores boring. Add to the seemingly uninterrupted part of Lamberto Bava and you have a movie stinker. I think, the biggest sin in the movie is the lack of budget. It does not seem that there was a lot of work to do with Bawa. Is there a complete collapse of the Italian film industry by 1984 ?? Especially as far as the film shades The funds found in Bawaab were probably too low. Like the movie, the devil did not have the chance to just be good, depending on the particular effect of the fish. This is not the only Italian movie to enjoy this fate. In the mid-80s, several Italian films have been created, whose ideas and concepts are much more than expected due to their budget constraints. However, due to the many weaknesses in the film and referring to them, I could not bring myself less than 3/10 of the value of Devil Fish. I've even considered it rating higher, but I do not realize it's a movie because it's bad. Why do not I rate it low? Well that's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, there is something about Devil Fish that I enjoy inappropriate. It can be as easy as my budget of low budget, cheesy, Italian movies. Maybe my taste in the movie is terrible, but I enjoy what I enjoy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I rate the Devil's Fish 4/5 rate on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a good job to make fun of the movie's many flaws. Tom Servo notes, "Just because you can perform, you mean it should not be done", when a very astute observation comment comes very first ?? There are many weaknesses found in the devil fish yet others show up.
