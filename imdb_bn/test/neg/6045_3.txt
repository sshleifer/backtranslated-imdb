I watched this movie a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it during the lunch session and it was an interesting description in my menu box so I decided to look it up. Seriously a movie suitable for late night TV ... You know, before Canaan, but before the sort of infractions. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is rare on the web, even with many spiders, read my headline if I need refresh. <br /> <br /> I think the story is absolutely impressive. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a trustworthy portal ... It would have started well for the cool cool imagination but after 15-20 minutes it would be reduced. <br /> <br /> Custom is not memorable performance, Queen of poor quality who has raised her breast ... does not carry the spider considering the spider. Along with poor sound effects. Although a custom low budget movie tried to cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> During the job, 4 electronic users were shocked at the secret nuclear generator. They fiddle with buttons and open a portal. 2 worker falls into the portal and closes it ... scrambling to know what's going on, helping the party still help us while watching the other side of their surroundings. <br /> <br /> Help does not come so they open the portal and follow the meeting in parallel levels. They encounter a nation of soldiers in WW Wolf spiders. After death and they live back. <br /> <br /> Now it's annoying ... they hide, say a little bit, trying to create another portal and then attack the hive. After losing 22 power plants, they opened the portal and the turn to return to our world ... 200 million years ago <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
