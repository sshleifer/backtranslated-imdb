One of the reviewers wrote here: "Good acting, good special effects, great <br /> <br /> Location even better." What I can say is "vogue." This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian - I know many people are very conservative. So, what I'm going to say is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The image is not favorable by "Christian content." I do not eat it because it is Christian. I'm going to give it a 2/10 because it's an awesome movie. Writing is bad - at the top, promotion in many ways, and most "preacher" stuff is irrelevant to the story. It just makes for bad scriptwriting. I agree with <br /> <br /> <br /> Playwriting beliefs are irrelevant - a good script that flows well, keeps track and is trustworthy. Acting was the best amateur. But hey, when you act as amateur, you'll find amateur acting. Dirk Been may be "Survivor", but that show <br /> <br /> ZERO requires the ability of acting. Bad taste playing on his name and fame to sell the unit. Those who can perform the unknown cast and you will have a much better film. The impact was violent. It was embarrassing to see the hail and the next fall of the stars. And what was so great about the end? It did not make any sense. Yes, I know <br /> <br /> The team was going for Sheei, but it missed the mark a great time. I bought this image and hopefully much more based on reviews <br /> <br /> Wrong info on their website And, even though I was hoping, when I saw "Christian" movies, I found what I found - under the budget, badly written, artificially made, and pieces of ka-ka have been created badly. Maybe, at some point till finally, the plate was well-written with a last-minute movie, and Gibson's "Passion ..." was well-formed. 2/10 stars.
