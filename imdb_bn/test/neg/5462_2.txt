I have to agree with a lot of other critics. One thing that can be stimulated and stirred on the opposite double standards, unfortunately failed. <br /> <br /> Rape is the crime of violence and forcible insulting control, the scenes here are mostly sad. It was a good idea to cover the shortcomings of what was happening and imagine the audience's imagination. Police laughed with the police and police officers, and the police canceled their complaint. No pain, no hesitation in joining. I do not know if it was bad acting and bad direction but nobody missed the point completely. For half of it, ED is desperately searching for its attackers, kind. They were skipping most of the sex scenes - another extraordinary failure of themselves, and he first met Colin Freils when he first went to the police. The story can be made up of good conversations and occasionally flashbacks - and the higher acting and presence saved by Colin Freils - the only reason I see this movie - is that she comes to any project. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation in this movie, it was crap.
