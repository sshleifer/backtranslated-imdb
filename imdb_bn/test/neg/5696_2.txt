So it's a space movie. But it's less budget. You ask, "What about the impact?" The effect is good at times, and occasionally really, really bad. I mean bad And notice I started with the effect. Here is a story, but it seems to me what is the wrong order. I do not mean a tarantino style wrong order. I mean, it is called a complete nonsensical arrangement. Most of it is about a mother (in the future, because you know, this is the science-fi) as told by her daughter, which is basically described in detail from her perspective. For the first time you hear the sound of Paul Derrore like a computer, if you read it, then understand how tolerant it can be for the constant description. This story is so constant and consistent that the screenwriters rarely have a word for the first hour. <br /> <br /> Here's a lesson for you and movie makers: If you did not do 2001 and have some action (this one does), then please hire a good war choreographer. Otherwise, your fights will be good, well, there are keys to the Batspace. And notice the title that it has the word "war". Wig <br /> <br /> I think it can be a classic scenario in trying to make a film without any idea. And some effects. My biggest surprise is seeing the IMDB as a $ 1.8 million pricing list. When you compare it like something like PRIMER, which will do well with thousands of budgets, you will realize the low budget movie, all of the story. I did not expect much - but I was still frustrated. Ten big out of two
