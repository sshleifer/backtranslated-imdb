I'm not sure who gets more fun, who is reviewed or film director I could no longer read this comment or see the movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see low budget Western films which work with interest and interest, but art dico letting, pastel color garage, images that seem to fall asleep because the script is so annoying and the camera is visible in every two scenes. Coming to the camera, it is definitely not my definition "among the best Western films produced in a new millennium "<br /> <br /> <br /> Please tell, if you have friends of friends in the movie!
