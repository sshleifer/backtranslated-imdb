If you are a member of this family then it will actually be a blue Christmas. I loved the original movie, and this one was not worthy of being its sequel. Indeed, for all purposes and purposes, this is not its signal. Only a character from the original cast back. Imagine, this character was a happy cousin Eddie, but he was not the only hero of the movie. Cherry Chase is the fake relatives who performed Janny antics as well as her niche. This film needed a chewy cheeses to succeed and he was not there. As far as I'm concerned, the film is not a "holiday" movie, unless it is titled 'Clark Griswald'.
