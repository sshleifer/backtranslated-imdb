When I was young, I thought of seeing a clip from this movie on HBO and was afraid to live forever from me. When I found it, I saw it. I was not interested. The movie was not scary. <br /> <br /> Surrounding an elderly woman running the plot. He feeds this terrible stupid person under the 12th century fortress. He constantly beats poor people every day and feeds him. Well, that day he will die. Then, after a few months, a family came. Father, mother, and their blind girl. The father was involved in a tragic accident that killed his son and blinded his daughter. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, she sounds, is breaking things, and not everyone is worried about anything. Everything. As long as a few people turned dead. Apparently, the animals inside the house are free and kill people. For the last few months this thing is impossible without food or water! Every time I saw an animal, it gave me a creep. The victims of lethal killings blame their father for death. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image has 3 stars out of 10. Awesome or horrible!
