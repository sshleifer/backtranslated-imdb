Vile Killer is almost never in this picture - lucky! He plays 30 seconds screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie, I could not tell you how he played "role" !! ?? All right ... they suck in the dark underground tunnel and suck it in the first hour. Drama films depicted in dark underground tunnels easily suck the maximum number of people in the first 30 minutes of an hour. Then you start thinking, "Why am I seeing it?" To make use of a dark underground laboratory for film making, I think a director / author must be easy enough. Just film people screaming in the dark tunnels and you have instant "mystery". But that's where this movie goes no more! We all wonder how it goes during the night, but there is nothing dark in this picture but more dark. The story is even worse Clearly, there is an underlying story in this movie that I learned "later" after watching the film. But the movie uses such poor dialage that it did not clearly come out during screening. I still do not understand what the instructor / director meant to say. A confused sister in Russia arrested underground children? Why? Are they at the same time as our time-character? Are they ghosts <br /> <br /> This is a complete horror movie that led me to write my first IMDB review so others can avoid it.
