<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dramatic scene is a joke. At each step you can see a mile coming away. The last is frustrating and there is no mystery. The best part of the movie is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This is not the only reason for a low vote because it is a TV movie and I believe the budget will start to fall. <Br /> I believe that the young female fans of Luke Parry will still see this film but he did a better job. Again this is horrible. Very terrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
