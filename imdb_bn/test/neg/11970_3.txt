JÃ©rak Heizar Mike (David Zelina sees this college gentleman as direct as a mobile phone that you want to die directly) and his College Chronicles hangs hypoglycemic diabetic Sam (Caleb Rohrink) on a wooden cross beside this framework, which is a legendary ghost story. They've got Podged near Sam, who mostly go into shock and target a swing punch at Mike across the estate of his girlfriend Patty (Christina Shadlon), to punish the poor man for his punishment. Somehow, the soul of Sam goes to the poor who leave the poor in the streets to destroy everyone who come from the cross, and they appear "in the turmoil". Mike and Gang uninitiated dorks brought Sam back down, but they took a swinging blade across their throats to the first. Until Mac and his animal heads play golf, play volleyball and biker on the beach, Scherkro comes to finish their little comedy. Sam's alternative brother Jack (Matthew Lynhard) is considered to look for him, but instead of agreeing with new love interest, Beth (Samant Asling) agreed to sleep with him. So when he received the cellphone's message from Mike, how did Jack get scared about how he hanged Sam away from the beach with Sam and Sand? Beth's ungrateful father is a doctor and he agrees to see Sam's situation after he is about to take the dead young man to a hospital in an emergency. Returning to the beach to face Mike due to his negligence. (Jack's commitment is not to be trained in Ram, UFC warrior did not play by Shyamrock), Jack and Beth face the same stroke-stupid murderer, others closed. Coach Ramsey, who was a partner in the past violence, was scared of the killer-scare, he had to face a few suicidal suicides because he told the remnants of the party what they had said against them. <br /> <br /> The child, boobs, and blood .. This glimpse is followed by basic slasher guidelines. Yet, these specs carry plain character, acting, dialogue and general molecular features of the overall plot. Especially in violence, it shows signs of lower budget especially in violence, because most of the real actions are off-screen instead of showing it closed, closed and private. What is seen on the screen is that most of the time after the revenge of the murder: a colleague keeps his throat, another group (holding the wall of the volleyball net) goes through his chest, after a woman's blood, a woman may be hit on the head. Rock, a chick who was hit by the SSV, hit him dead. Etc. There are some dubbing problems where it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not match the speed of their lips. Especially strange ridiculous sequences where Ed (Treviss Parker), wannabe rock star, their friends are singing a cow, they all are quite impressed.
