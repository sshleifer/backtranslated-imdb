This movie is the last stroke that I have pushed towards the end of the films I have shown this week and has forced me to join the IMDb and has spread some caution to the public. It was absolutely horrible. The film was drawn and painfully annoying. Sound, influence, and quality of the images also came from Willow (1988) or even from Canaan the Barbarian (1982). Battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This is the biggest protected reconstruction of the "ever-mediated war in the British Isles". There was not even a coherent structure, only a few people were walking through the spears and horses. Especially in the last battle, Douglas' scenes were just terrible, as was most of the film's performance.
