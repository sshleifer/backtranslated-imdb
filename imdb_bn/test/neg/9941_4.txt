I have read a number of reviews which ask, "Why was this picture created"? I myself thought this question seemed to be dragging the middle of the hour and twenty minutes in the middle, just picking steam till the end, when it was not actually doing anything like this. So, "Why has this photo been created"? I think it's a great question for those watching those who are hystegig and supervisor. This reviewer Knut Erik Jensen is proud to give this powerful image of hope, fraternity and inspiration with these male singers, but I do not think Jensen has enough to bring a gripping story to the table. Let me write this question to you, "What more do you need in a documentary about audience members than a straight forward story to maintain interest?" My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed. Heftig and Begeistret had a good documentary, but it was far from great. Jensen did an awesome job with topic stories and dedication. It was very nice to hear the song, but over time, those songs were overwhelming, overwhelming and somewhat unstable. From the opening scene where our men sang in their hearts in the dark in the snow, I knew that I was bound, but like the movie, I lost interest. Why? Jensen did not take audience members in our next section. He kept at the playground level and eventually hit the overall tune of the film. Was there a movie about this song or about the men in the singer? The world can never know. <br /> <br /> Again, I want to say that Jensen did a great job of finding a fun story about this group of men, who had hardly seen hard times and how they coped with him music, but it was like all A bunch of men who have ever produced the most annoying men. Jensen gave us fantastic music, but it was the subject matter, which I knew nothing about at the end of the movie. In the mix we had a 97-year-old man, who got his driver's license, our biggest song was a classic American song singing a tub, our older men who were intimate between young people, we created some excitement among young people, singers and veteran singers, And we were even cleaned for only 11 years that was a former drug addiction. What is the development of all the interesting stories at Jensen? No, he left them on the table. It was clear that these singers were willing to say more about it (see the political person who missed his political days), but Jensen was moving away from that heartfelt moment and came back to the interesting places that could be singing curiosity directly. To me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, I want to introduce stories and stories about these people. They were all impressive, but Jensen began to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By not ignoring the main points of this documentary Jensen failed to create any tension at the end. Without ending up, I think Jensen was coloring on the line. Rather than being brave outside the line, he did not choose to create a moment of sympathy, emotions, nervousness, or sadness. Jensen takes points from point A to point, and asks us to get involved in shape or shape. I can see how the national image was a huge success in Norway, but anyone else (like ME) needed more. I wanted to feel for these guys. They wanted to know whether they were going to do good work during the trip, or just loved themselves in their own cities. There was no story, mostly for the development of things. When you look at modern documentaries (oddly, this movie was created in 2001), you want to play it like any Hollywood feature film. You want mystery, realism, and the drama, you do not get anything like this with Hafeez and the Benazist. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to ask again, "Why was this picture created"? My final answer was how Alex, Jason, wanted to show how much troubled times and variable economies can still cause happiness in the coldest places in the world. I think Jensen wanted to show human dedication and to combine a few simple ones like music. With that, this picture of Jason appears perfectly, but he did not make a good documentary. When you create a movie of this nature, I think you must keep an eye on the group, examine the singer's participants and listen to each story that will hold your heart. While trying to leave the room at rocket speed, my only thing was to capture this movie. Again, I do not want to say the negative word for this movie because the music was nice and the male singing comes with the feeling of honesty, but I need more. With the documentary film community becoming becoming a big head, one heftig and begeistret expect a little more than what is handed us over. I want to see the reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Grade: ** ***** Outside
