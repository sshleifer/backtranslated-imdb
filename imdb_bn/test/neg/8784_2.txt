Would it surprise me that my ears and eyes are almost wildly burning and listening to this scary movie? My eyes bled from watching almost horrible animations and insipid, plotless, empty stories. My ears almost hear the sound that they heard that they sang with a chorus of monkeys. Then my brain melted almost due to the complete lack of this intelligence. It's the way each step follows the formula. Speaking animals is one thing, but a penguin that can fly only with "dreams can come true". Please believe anything more about children's intelligence. Next to rock-a-doodle, it's the worst of blues.
