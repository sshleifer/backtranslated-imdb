I'm missing from the main (long math / mostly Martha) fan of this movie, and the movie that makes everything great and enjoyable is enjoyable. I gradually speed up, build characters and miss small gestures on their style, the impact of light and mood and move on the dialog. I do not think myself enough for the story. Martha / Kate is more exclusive, and Mario / Nick is not a shoe. In most cases, a thing which basically makes a scene great, it does not work here. Small changes take away tension. My opinion will go to you and see the original. It will be worth the subtitle inconvenience.
