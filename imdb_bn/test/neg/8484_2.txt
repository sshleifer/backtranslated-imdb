Spinners <br /> <br /> I like movies. I have seen many movies. I have never seen a movie that I actually hated. The son of the mask destroyed it. The mask boy is so bad that I'm not usually going to make a comment that I usually do. Actually, I'm not even going to write too much. I think all of you know that this movie is horrific horror. And poor jammy kennedy. He was awesome on Scrum, but now this picture! Also, the film takes a SMO-CN film and turns it into folly kids' movies which children will not even like. This film consists of very rude humor. Nose-like She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes white stuffs outside her nose. There is an Exorcist parody. Yes, a child film has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults would love it. Quite obviously, it has made the film more cheer and crude. <br /> <br /> The basic, stupid plot here. Team Avery's dog gets amazing locks mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. The team is paying more attention to the baby with special power, cartoon dogs become a Willie Quote ripoff. Then Loki took the child with amazing power and the team and Loki had a really impressive animated battle. Wearing a mask of the team It's all happy to end. Very bad this movie is awesome. <br /> <br /> Overall, the mask was a fantastic Jim Carie Cinema. This is not, basically. Please, do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake in renting this. I do not want you to make the same exact mistakes. I was terribly afraid that I could not write any detailed comment, but what should I really comment on? 2/10 I want to give it a, but let's, it's basically a small film. <br /> <br /> Recommended movie: Mask.
