Face me up, but my tongue was in my throat when we torn the 'shooting' into this piece. As a bad sister with Mummy Daresty jealous, I did my best at team curriculum on Rocky. I'm sad that does not come across this ... Ah well, a friend compares it with 'rock bottom budget shots' with a white hot spoon. I will be content with that. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised, no one mentioned the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt competition. This is the longest wet T-shirt contest in the history of the movie. And the only where the competitors were wearing cotton-polyester shirts of industrial strength, which denied all efforts to get them wet and transparent. <br /> <br /> And did anyone catch the cameras as the director of the papfen fighter with our hero? By line 'are we still filming?' Definitely audible? Jizz, bad movie heaven for this real photo ...
