I did not like this movie. To me, it was not very sensible. It was difficult to determine what was actually happening. I was not afraid that it was scary. I think it was stupid, even weird, but not well. Radha Mitchell is the main character of the film, which was released in 2003. Also, the 2006 "Silent Hill" which I hated was also. This is also confusing and meaningless "Viewers" is not bad, but I think it is less than average. There is nothing special about this here. This script is very brainy and there is something that is not there in the movie. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress, if she can work more with him. "Viewers" My Polls 4/10
