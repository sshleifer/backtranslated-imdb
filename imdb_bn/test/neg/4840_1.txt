The only reason for renting this movie is that Wallkare has played very poorly in the film. Of course there is a first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that oaters are not easy to make, especially by foreign directors. Sergio Leone probably met him, but his films were not anything indefinitely even for our American mentality and panic ache. Clint Eastwood and Henry Fondar helped the American actor. Now I can see why they changed the original headline from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bouty". That itself did not have any basic understanding of producers and directors than a visible pursuit of visible and violent themes. I think American directors try to create a Polish movie if they fail to worry about this process.
