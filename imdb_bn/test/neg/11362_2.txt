This is the inefficient reason to create low-budget independent movies, which act like so many self-conscious actors with genuine genius. There is there to see all the world of talent talent weakened by this legacy wannabees. In the case of point: Flight of living death (or, I soon find it, living dead light). There is nothing wrong with paying someone's heroes respect. I've done it myself many years, many times. In fact, the XLibrous book is in Knight Rider, M. Co-written with Kelly, "The six writers whose inspiration inspired me: Richard Matheaneson, Harlan Ellison, Sheryl Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, HP Boyfriend, and Robert E. Howard." It was a motion picture, I was the director who Will not be inspired to inspire me. George Romero was very high in that list. It's nothing less than a shock to say that the title of this movie is not inspired by Romero.
