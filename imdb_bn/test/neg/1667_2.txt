Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodrow and some could not play Woodrow F. Call better than that. He was not only the first and the best, he was the only person who could illustrate his grief and confusion. It was a bad letting down and I was surprised I even made it myself. I can even start how Woodroe is sad how they are. I must understand that by the time he was old, but everyone knows that he will not have to downgrade him down. The first movie was the best and only that I would ever see. I hope no director is planning to continue or restorate the wonderful classic without Tommy or Dual. Without them, time and meaningless waste for movie directors and colleagues. If you plan to make any other Lonoie Divov movie, do not waste time on my mine and billions of people. The film continues the first one in the soil. Thank you.
