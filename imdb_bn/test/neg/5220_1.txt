This is by the worst movie I have ever seen. What they thought Already stop my promotion! We all see Walker's Texas Ranger and do not accept it to our friends. Terrible acting and a very terrible plot. The story is closed when the movie is closed and the actors start promoting to the audience. The director believes in two messed well. It looked like crap! When I saw the title in my local blockbuster, it looked interesting. They should be careful about it that it was a work / adventure religious instead of false advertising. For the first time I stopped a movie and could not finish it.
