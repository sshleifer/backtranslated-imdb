Good effort to deal with the unusual issues of May-December romance However, the treatment is completely unrealistic. Sure, the 60-year-old men can fall for young women and they usually share with adult women, with whom they share common interests and values ​​and opinions ... are not neurotic, unknown strangers near minors Of course there are exceptions, and they come near called Podophil! Sorry RGV, but it is not believable that an intelligent and accomplished sex converts a comfortable family life and will create a joke for his colleagues ... For 18-year-old all it is not a real thought on his head and an emotional institution from an unstable escapee Behavior like Amitabh's character is provoked by sex and you do not have to have a PhD in psychology to leave the young girl undoubtedly and to solve the problems of parents. <br /> <br /> <br /> A steep steep, thought of suicide, as he comes around as nearly comes by behaving with a common teenage son with a Jihie nearby. <br /> <br /> A positive note: The actor has done well, and cinematography is good.
