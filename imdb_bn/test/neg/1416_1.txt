Is such a bad movie with actors possible? They were forced to do it? There is nothing to plot with an idea of ​​how things will turn out if a joke ran for the President. They do not even try to give that impression. When you were watching the comment from the famous liberals in DC politics (the first five minutes), you think the film closes the road and about 1) computer voting errors; 2) Regular bad corporate cases that cover it with the most single pair of lines in history Wants to keep, and 3) a neurotic but very beautiful woman programmer who is the ruler on this topic Patike tried to say. He soon caught the computer company's evil X-Files Master-lord, who - instead of killing him - to treat his drug as unbelievable. But, when he gets the DC, he does not tell her. Actually, the film varies from the B-Film Drama to the evolutionary B-Film-love-drama. So far, we are far from the original starting point of the movie, which most people close it. I almost did. It could be just an intimate love drama, but not! It's not! This kind of "Oh, I'm so annoying, I'm always fooling, so please love me for it" - Love plays. There is nothing to slow down slow, political plot of the film, the X-file plot of the movie, or the comedy plot of the film. All the plots fail on all levels, whose meaningless dials remind you of every annoying bit. The part of love should be the result of decision making during drinking water "Hey, love should be dynamic between the presidential candidate and the beautiful woman programmer, yes, it will work! Stop it there!" <<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Louis Black is cast and plays a role where he does not come with a single Louis Black line. Lewis Black Rug is expected in a film that is never seen in the movie, which it never does. And Christopher Walken was fired into the hospital with despair, to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the West Coast's most assisted President. Christopher Walken is being cast like Lewis Black in roles that are constantly fighting for the movement of the casual and Westing-Isch, but like the Titanic, it likes to see a great blue whale who died on a beach beach. Then write down the bottom of the whole movie: it psychologically raises a very moral question: Robin Williams should be promoted to the post of President, because he knew that he was selected due to computer, a little error? American Dream and All Good Live as she turned down the live TV president, such as Lassie dogs. The president's natural patriot glamor and we are so smart-we-made-history-atmosphere that has cultivated over half a million years of vesting sickness. <br /> <br /> Director and Screen Writer, Barry Levinson is now on the personal list of authors and directors, which I will be away from forever. This movie will be seen as a faulty production process, where people (spending Barry Levinson) can spend their money due to their personal relationships and spend due to their expertise. This is a project that was created to satisfy the wishes of the weakly skilled people for the success of the career, and the previously mentioned great actors were deceived to participate in it. That could only be explained. <br /> <br /> Voting errors on computers were due to Dubbes, Colgos and Mills in Double Characters. It was, of course, what it could be like when you write a script and can not tell the computer from a dishwashing machine.
