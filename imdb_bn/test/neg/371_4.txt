As other critics have mentioned, this film is a cross between the stories we've seen before (as stolen). Especially, it looks like Clint Eastwood in the High Plane Drifter inserted in Mad Mac. Remove the Clint cigar and replace it with cigarettes; Remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voil√†, an updated drifter. In this film, the "hero" is even more "savior" than the higher planter drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, there is a wound on his left side, and his entrance has come from an application for "salvation" by the previous residents - a beautiful transparent reference of a "second coming". I saw a hot, wet morning movie. Sleep was impossible and at 4:30 when there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. Although almost curious, with almost comic character characters, the movie is still somewhat entertaining ... at least at 4:30.
