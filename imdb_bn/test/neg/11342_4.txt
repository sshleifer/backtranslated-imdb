Thunder Eli banned Fairian from the NASCAR track after the death of another driver. Stanley Adams wants to give him his teammates, but other drivers are not around to surround him. <br /> <br /> The enthusiastic fashions for the job are an automated stunt show owned by John Murray, who is trying to try to capitalize on Peanut and Fabian's bad representatives. He got to take it, but the anti-Finisello Moore's daughter gives another reason to get stuck elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is struggling to return to the NASCAR circuit, as well as Annette and his current girl friend Dian Macbayne. Personally, I'll take Macben, all of them in the ant. <br /> <br /> Thunder Eli is helping NASCAR Racing with footage footage and footage footage of Southern NASA tracks. Instead of throwing out the real causes of Fabien's problems and the main reasons for its unrealistic recovery, it was not helped by a silly story. <br /> <br /> Now fans of NASA can go for it.
