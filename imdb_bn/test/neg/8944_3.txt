The basic talkie feature based on a popular stage game. A murder has been made and a bunch of people is a killer who sees a s√©ance hire a medium. If the lights are out there is another murder ... so some of this room <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the cast overacts a ridiculous degree. They work like the stage (like where you have to do more things) and it looks stupid at the screen. Most embarrassing is Bella Lugosi ("Dracula" two years ago) who actually overdoes it as a police inspector. The static side does not help by Todd Browning (who was always neglected). <br /> <br /> Only the completists for Browning and Lugosi. I give it a 3.
