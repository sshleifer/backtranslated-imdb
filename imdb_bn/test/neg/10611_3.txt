This comment must be expressed with a type of admission: I think I have a soft spot for the original 60 -70 TV series. I think the movie makers blown it from the time they entered here: In the supposed rebuilding, the audience would look at the hip, athletic link (Clarence Williams III), or cooler, and it would reflect Michael Kole's reflection and so forth. Instead, we see Giovanni Ribisi as a poor-rich white rich boy, who just like his own role (in the office I worked on, I screamed myself by making a fake movie poster) throwing different actors as office staff members; Guess who I throw as the son of the company president dorky?). Danes are just as new Julie, but there are a lot of characters to do any work, as there are just sort of stories, throwing in the traditional. So it's quite surprising, in addition to that.
