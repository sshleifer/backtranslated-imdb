Even if there is a story to tell, this movie can be valuable with its low budget. It's a pretty good start, and fairly compelling and trustworthy. Though there was not much character development, actors and characters were interesting. My favorite scene was when they all were eating their ration. Some people hated it, and some did not think it was too bad. The story starts very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it sank in a little fright, which is usually the death penalty for most scientists. Suddenly no scientific basis on which scientific basis Any real credible last play for the villain? No real explanation of what's happening. In general, if a movie is using the F word for all other words, it is usually spiral from there. I still do not believe to get offended or not. I often wondered what people are inspired to do bad science fai? Is not there a wonderful story in the superb universe? People do not seem to waste their time and everyone else when they get things like them. Why can we get so much middle class science? Are not any female actors / characters? Not everything? These makings may be another "hunter" but alas far away. <br /> <br /> My final comment - poor budget and finally a budget for building a real campfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My suggestion for any low budget advertising film production companies. Make sure that you've got your good story before you begin and edit the bad effects - it's good that we see things that look fake or ridiculously vague.
