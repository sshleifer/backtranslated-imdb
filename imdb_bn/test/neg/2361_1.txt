I can not believe how this torture was able to hold the heart and mind of the cross section of the "bright young people" of its era, but I am sure I do not want it. In my opinion it is a mistake, bad acting, weakly scripts, pretentiously guided pieces of mustache. Briefing briefings of a fabulous reality is no humorous death. The situation is uncertain overwhelming which already make the raunchy characters even more incredible and disgusting. The romance is neutral, the last dissatisfied and the only point of view of the movie destroys the drug message, and the simple plot ('Winnell and Me,' 'Fear and Lothings') is examined for ultimate testing with the unintended motion of the film. This movie is an intelligent visual attack without any hint of skill or initiative. I condemn it in the hope of history and stay there.
