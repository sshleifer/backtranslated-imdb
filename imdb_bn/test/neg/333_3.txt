I doubtfully gave this image a high 9/10 rating, which felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review. I am suspicious because it is less like a review but more like a promo statement Perhaps a filmmaker, or one of his friends, wrote "review"? Naughty, naughty <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on the Sky TV channel's propeller channel. It can be really awkward. The special effects used were rarely very good for the budget, and some of the performances were not bad, but most of the acting was really awful, but good work was done to try, because I hope most of them were <br /> <br /> Either, the filmmaker tried really well to try his mobile phone over his weight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . This movie is not 9/10, but it is valuable to remember a cheerful, because of low budget and fairness, due to credit for its production.
