I did not give up most of the film because it is actually a good cast, but the film itself (So, enter the abnormal term starting with six letters in the alphabet) -If I feel bad that it was the lowest vote for three votes. <br /> <br /> A very hypothetical plot .... Two non-dual musicians have no meaning and there are not enough money problems. However, when a friend releases a full penny (which belongs to drug dealers) in their care, it definitely spends it and then "fun" starts. <br /> <br /> There is no original idea in this whole picture.
