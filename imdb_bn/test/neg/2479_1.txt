Really, really ... this is what the audience (America's one!) Is so happy that it is completely outside of me. What we can learn from this series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each casino costs about 2-3 billion rupees per year, a satellite for its security team and a very high hi-tech high-resolution camera. Let the FBI cut their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security worker must have the natural ones more voluptuous breasts. Tits appear all the time otherwise they will lose their work. <br /> <br /> If the employee is male, then he must get a nipple, then go to the step. <br /> <br /> 4. Only Hollywood's other procession can cut the ideas of another show and apply them in their own way, and these cones can call "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Each protection with bigger tits than 39D is considered immortal and does not die. <br /> <br /> I really want to get the chance to vote with minus values. 10/10 for it!
