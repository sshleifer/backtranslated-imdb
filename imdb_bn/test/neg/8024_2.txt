It's funny ... One day before I saw this movie I'm seeing a documentary of Lenny Rifenstall, so it's relatively automatic ... ... there is absolutely no one else. <br /> <br /> The movie is weak in every aspect ... not sure Simona ...) and unusual ..., confused editing and always leaves the taste of unfinished shots, the music does not fit, the story does not flick, it's annoying And the film came out for a long time ... Oh, and the letters are not shown very well, you can not actually tell a lot about girls (except what you see). The movie also tried to shock with a clear curse (which is pretty funny :) <br /> So ... 2/10
