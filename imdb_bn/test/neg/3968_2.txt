This image was sourced from my friends mam who worked in a charity shop. He gave it to us along with another unknown cassette tapes load. The film itself is a bit trash. There are a few notable bits, when her girlfriend inserts her head, but still laughs laughing, but the film is generally soft. When I saw the "Island" trailer, I could not really help to understand the duplication. Could the clones be the inspiration of that picture? Not everyone will be bothered to see this movie because it is lazy and annoying. At the age of 16, we enjoyed so much that we named our band after this. Another sign is this film is a little sticky, does the back shot of the video actually not appear in the movie? Weird
