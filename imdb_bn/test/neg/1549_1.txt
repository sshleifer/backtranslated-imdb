For some time this event was 24/7. Thereafter, apparently there is a second consecutive season or any continuation of these two horrific and proud people who are often pictured. All other comments hold the summary of these two selfish, violent, airheads. <br /> <br /> I said, these two women have a soul and they have made some Faucian dargahs more than they suspect, so that they may get their dirty snouts. A television series Fate can protect mankind from any other exposure to the Galilee Girls!
