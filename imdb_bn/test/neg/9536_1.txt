How nice! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was tempted to place my brain bullets and finish my life. It is really difficult to describe what this movie really is. I honestly do not know what kind of damage people will have to pay. The film seems to be shot in video or 16 mm. I usually have no problem with the SOV movie, the shoddily 16mm film is made, but this was just awful. And where did they find this "actress"? I saw some bad acting, but this cake takes place. Check out the first 5 minutes and see what you'll understand. BCI Entertainment This god should be boycotted for distribution of horror fungus. The most unsatisfactory movie of this movie was sometimes dissatisfied with me. I want my 74 minutes back! If you sit in the first 5 minutes and do not kill your TV without shooting your TV, then give a shot. After all, do you have to lose?
