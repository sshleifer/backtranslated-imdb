This movie is the worst one I've ever seen (with silly shores or with nothing). I could not believe that a movie could really be bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This temptation to hit the stop button during this movie was huge (actually, in my VCR There was a thief in the trash button but I wanted to impose it.) Enjoy yourself a lot, and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like growing grass or watching golf on TV.
