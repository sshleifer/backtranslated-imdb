Jack Brooks (Trevor Mathews) is a college student with some serious anger problem. When his family was a child with a giant, he was brutally murdered, and now he is out of his anger all over and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his professor (Robert England) began to show signs of gimmick, he must learn that he must control his anger and instead of bad it has to be used well and after the deadly night, his nightmare Fight with animals that are to be fought. <br /> <br /> has indeed achieved its rating rating, but the key was cool about it. It does not focus on CGI graphics crappy b. In fact, 0% of the image was CGI. The monsters actually gathered together slowly, and there was a lack of story though it was a bit cluttered ... if only for one time.
