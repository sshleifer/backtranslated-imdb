Do not see a balanced point. The director should not reveal his opinion as true. The film has been facing some criticism from Fujimari but it always gives the last word to him and his family. Some critics of Fujimori realized that this movie seems to be the only reason for being able to give both opinions. But that is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film only shows up in the genocide of Fujimori accused. And it credits him for the masterminding of the assassination of the embassy of Japan Embassy of the MRTA rebels. It is well documented that the CIA has planned. The site published by Cartes Magazine and other newspapers also has a well-known CIA strategy video. <br /> <br /> This well-known information was not used as such, it gives us some possible decisions: the director likes to fend for him and deliberately and falsely credit him; The director does not want to note that CTA and Fujimori work together; Or the director was not in Peru and was not present in Peru, it was out of ignorance. <br /> <br /> It is explained by other commentators that Fujimori still does not excuse the lack of accurate, accurate and balanced explanations in Peru. <br /> <br /> Also, I heard the highest statistics given in Fujimori for the film's actual support. Most of the major election agencies have much less statistics. Another issue is to mention that the leader of the leader of Seddero was kept secret by secret police secret information and a police force invented the secret network. There was complete autonomy from Ketin Vidal and Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> Fujimori's first government experienced the development of overall economic trends (GDP), but funding was done by signing the agreement of various industries for this development. That was not beneficial for long-term countries. Also, the misery among the poor increased during Fujimori's regime. The second period was suffering from the economy and there was nothing to privatize and after the second expiration of Fujimari, the economy went to collapse. <br /> <br /> In the case of investing in Fujimeri's infrastructure, they fall into the paternalistic pattern. They were created to increase support for Fujimori, but it was not meant for a long time. This structure requires continuous maintenance but Fujimori does not provide political power for citizens to demand more investment. In fact, the rule of Fujimori was able to destroy most of the political organizations, like the unions and the grassroots groups, and the informal formation of unorganized labor was immense. Finally, the director spent most of the time, instead of filing a huge corruption case for Fujimari, the film spoke to Fujimori (media, business owners, military, etc.) that was so broad, it was impossible that Fujimori was not aware of it. .
