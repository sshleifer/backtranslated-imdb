This is a flick which you can safely avoid. Child plot and poor performance from Cameron (he would not really play this serious role - they would not agree with him) He also faced the most obscure face, facing the Chelsea Angels, and was something extraordinary about that. Mary ... Pope can not be a good president of the United States, and in contrast, my point is that there are actresses / actresses who are suitable for a particular character and Cameron is most inappropriate for this serious housewife - a dozen other actresses' a lot You have to work well. The film itself is rather unbelievable and the teenager in his plot (I've spelled it right in Jovin?) I have seen a comment from other critics who gave The Box a 10 rating, who gave the film his opinion on other critics. Rating 1 or 2 and can not spell. What do I mean to spell with a movie review? Does that mean that the spellers can fully appreciate this movie? Dr. Professor Dr.
