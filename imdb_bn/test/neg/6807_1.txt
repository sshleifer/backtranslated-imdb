To be completely unreliable and to move to 'adult' movies, Mr. Hughes gave us this film about a young married couple. True, it has every cliche in the book, the miraculous fantastic stuff and all of them, but more importantly - it got Elizabeth McGowron. <br /> <br /> <br /> He sometimes lends a weight to it that elevates stupid elements. Kevin Bacon (and her hair) is quite good as her husband, but McGowan stole the movie with the true true moment of her integrity. Hughes' film has done so well in other Hughes movies - the favorite uncle of whom you laugh at the age of 9, but at the age of 15 will tell them and you want to find some new stuff. But I'm going back to McGower's performance, because it's really going on. Mr. Hughes is one of the most appealing movies in my life, some of the most wonderful things that can happen when the real actor (some extraordinary, breakfast club) and when his material prevents genuine talent. Only if he believes that it will not be tarted with stupid fantasy stuff.
