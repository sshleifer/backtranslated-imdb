"Shuttle" was more interesting / interesting than a boring movie, but in the worst fantasy way it could imagine half an hour later. This story is lost, can you tell it a story? ... half an hour later. All subsequent scenarios are completely out of proportion. Driver is a superman because he survived every attack of gun knife. Even after his dash, he was able to keep him in the box. But a box in the garage was a coincidence. After the film ended I was really sick and confused. If the story is even better then it can be such a great one. My opinion will even make a good story for a child. And why arrest the girl with water and food. I ended up with about half the plot count counting through. And when the movie reached almost the unbearably ill-over-the-top final bout, I completely gave up (I said "well throwing"). The worst thing about the shuttle is that it can not be worse than the writer / director Anderson learn from this lesson and Next time we will offer you a great thriller. Think well he will be in a different style . I've got my fingers. But from now on I'll be the first to comment before seeing the cinema of the future. Wastefulness.
