Love says the noble title. During the promotion of the film, another hug talks about inside vs. exotic beauty. Well beauty in this case - you have made an internal or external decision - at least dressed (or moderately clothed / wrapped) ganana Aman while making the film, who called director Raj Kapoor "genius a volcano". One can not blame him for promoting his own film - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom Shashi Kapoor is in love with the hero. She does not want her voice just her voice. The acting is frustrating and even four reasons are due to some good songs with Lata Mangeshkar. The rest of the course is bunkum. To Avoid - Save Your Money Exterior Beauty Versus Beauty !!! You do not have to be Einstein to concentrate on the Director
