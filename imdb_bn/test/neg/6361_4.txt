Originally the first two Critters were already idiotic movies but a good and entertaining way. This movie is more like a B-movie, it is stupid but for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that does not follow the plot of the first two films. Basically all the characters are new and this time there is no monster hunter (well, since no good, the monster hunter of this movie is too late) and for this the budget has gone down again. To save more costs, the film shot back with Part 4, which would be as bad as imaging, because it directly followed this movie and created by the same people involved at the same time. <Br /> <br /> This is a common B-Genre movie, it does not actually have any originality or entertainment. It makes a real void sequel "Critters 3", you can easily remove it. Although this is supposed to be worse for the movie, it is not good at all. The film simply flattens as a science-fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to notice how these kinds of criminals have suddenly changed. They often doubled their normal size without their explanation for this period, and in the earlier case, they are more like this film Gremlins. <br /> <br /> This movie is only made attractive because this Leonardo DiCaprio feature film debut He was about 17 years old and certainly like a child, which he is still doing. I liked watching this well-known actor in their first role. It's fun to see how they work and see how their styles have improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio got just good, but he is already supplying his line in the same way. <br /> <br /> is really a very stupid and hairy movie. <br /> <br /> / 10
