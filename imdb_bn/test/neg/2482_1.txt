Wow ... not well. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that people dug this trash. Most television shows are bad, and it's a little more trending - they're getting worse, but Las Vegas certainly takes it home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So this show sucks that their fault No They just can not help it. Producer and writer blame. I can not believe they shot it and were really proud of their work.
