I also went wrong with Geoffrey Rush's 2003 Swimming Upstream. It was bad that I saw many student movies. The script was forced, the acting subpar and the edit was annoying. It was so slow that I forced myself to live. But I always give a chance to a movie, so I enjoy the end too. Obviously there was a memo about this movie, because my friend and I were the only one in the theater. Why did not someone send me this memo?!? That's why I'm posting, it's a warning to others, thinking carefully to others. I hope you really got this page, and looking at the wrong way did not fall into the trap of "Swiming upstream". If you are reading this, then cast and crew are sorry. I know you worked hard to do this. I know what movie you are going to make ... try it!
