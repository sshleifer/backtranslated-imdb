Just end up watching this movie. I could not imagine watching it in VHS, because the scenes where my subtitles were required to hear through pronunciation or sound effect, the view itself was in English. Actually, the film is quite interesting. Some CG effects were very clear insertions, but the effects of prosthetics / animal were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which was quite good) made for many. Actually, the actor was generally bad, but I can not tell how much the director can be blamed, never before did an actor show. Exception, I think, was M Gomes (Uxia). He steals every part of the part he participated, not only because of a beautiful face, but there was something like his performance that no one else had. A lot of writing could have been good - the plot was still unknowingly, and lots of love story was written, but personally I could work without much dialogue.
