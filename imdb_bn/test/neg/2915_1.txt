Remember the Kung Fu movies we used on the night and Saturday night late on Friday and Saturday, when our kids were worried, we were charged? Well, this movie is just like one of those movies. The biggest demand for Paties Kansit's fame is the love interest of Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2", and why this performance never grew up: It's a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> "Lethal Arms 2," I thought he was beautiful. It is quite clever to watch some more movies, including "Love music, love to dance", which has been left out more, which I was not clearly impressed. But, as much as I was attractive to my eyes, my soul began to look at me because she played another cheap, prophetic role and did it very badly. <br /> <br /> Kansit in this movie is a comedian who works in his French clubs (and is good), who is not spending it in his own country, so he is carrying his own ear), who reduced his fortune, But the worst French government wants to throw him out due to an expired visa (or maybe his job is captured). But he married this Casanova (Fris), who is as good as his fate, and the prophecy starts ... awesome! Is there any way to give this movie a negative rating? 1 out of 10 got more ratings!
