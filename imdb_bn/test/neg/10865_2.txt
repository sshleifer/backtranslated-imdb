OK, so the writer / director Larry Bishop has some important links, and the right people in Hollywood know to make their own movies and fill the cast with the catchy names. Good for him! Now what he really needs is the inspiration and genius, instead of actually coming up with a suitable example, he is very embarrassed and wrote down the violin shit here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It's a violent and frustrating fan-age effort to pay tribute to 60's notorious bicker-flicks, and in general, the recent release of Greenhouse Cinema. With "Hell Raid", Larry Bishop inspires his set-up in an embarrassing way and there are many obvious reasons for this. Tell him the story? Or at least a very interesting one ?? But the richly decorated plot twists, unwanted and too much feminine-unreasonable sludge, tries to cover it with the strong desire of cold and excessive silly conversation and huge ambitions of stupid violence. The plot seems to be complex, but it can actually be summarized in a sentence. Among the two rival Bike gangs, the old Vendetta is again expanded with the arrival of a new member; Can be a long lost son of the double crossing winters back in 1976, or such a boy! The rest, for the appointment of an old timer member, is going to force gang members to adapt to his nymphomaniac informant girl, all the complete dull and confusing padding components. Another major problem of "Hell Raid" is the very disgusting and apparently insatiable pride of Larry Bishop. He certainly would not have been able to reward himself with the role of a tough and relentless gang leader, because it was just as unbelievably motivated and narrow minded; Especially when the movie has so much more and more experienced stars. The supposed bishop has played some of the 60's Bike exploitation films (such as "The Seven Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it's a long time ago and he's not as good as an actor as honesty. Perhaps the only living dream of a bishop was a character that always outsource his enemies and for which every hot babe would like to have sex, and only wrote a full screenplay around it. Cast veterans such as Dennis Hooper and Michael Madsen are not really bothered to leave a possible impression and I can not say that I blame them. This whole product is tall and kind and I can not bring myself to recommend, despite the many beautiful babes around the silly breasts and naked nuts in the park.
