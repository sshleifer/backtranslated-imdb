Okay so there is no story with a 30-minute story. There are no conversations, no subtitles, no actual characters yet. You see three of the entire film (which are alive) and there are two very rare reasons. The main guy has no passion and mutilates just corpses for no apparent reason. That's the whole movie I love watching very poor movies, especially America is not very common in Real Gore to modern movies. So yeah gore effect was pretty cool. But it really is not really annoying. Why everyone thinks so annoying? There are no characters here, there are only 3 living people and 3 bodies. No one has any personality or back story. You see three corpses hacked and you will not be able to identify with it unless you identify yourself with death and how it can happen very well (the man loses his job and is going to jail soon after.) Be worried about the visitor's care and care they Have to care to be identified with. For example a good horror movie you should really care about the main character. Here's just a man and a corpse. It is only as deep as a lotus made from a single rain drop. They do not give any reason to care about anyone in the movie. It's a guy hacking up a few body, then he has sex with a body. Now with a sex scene here is a strange thing about it, she is sure to wear gloves but does not use a condom. So he could not have been less careful about having sexual relations with some weird STD bodies, until there is no problem in his hand becoming dirty, now it is really logical. I really dislike the movie, I liked it very much that it was very important, but when it's over, there is no reason to see it again, there is no reason to care, and it's not a very compelling movie. I can say if you can find it for 10 dollars but you can also get it but it is not worth it if it is more than that.
