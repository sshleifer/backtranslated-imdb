This image is an insult to play based on it. The character of the cloud has gone beyond recognition without a painful performance, which is not even unclear as the original plot. Shame, shame, shame They also spent a total number of key changes in the context of singing songs. It awakens the film's air and makes the audience aware of the reason for this idea that the author of this screen game gives Hood a wife, making Shila a wealthy rich girl, identifying the cloud as a cowboy, killing burgers and sending her instead to Vietnam. If someone is not familiar with the original plot, then I'm not a bad movie to reassure you, but if you never want to see the original or if I am a genius fan of the classic game. It would be better to avoid film entirely. One must really stick to one or the other.
