I would be wrong and shocked to advise you to see Killjoy 2, you must have better things, wash the car, throw stones at the stream, but at the same time it is probably not as close to horror as you probably think. This is almost a true movie, which can handle the most direct-DVD slashes. Cartage 2 helps Trent Hagar as an extraordinary mockery of the title of Mental Retardation, he plays himself with such a scary abandonment that he is often taking tips on behalf of the movie, but of course, it is big shoes in more than one person. Tammy Sullon offers the most entertaining directorial camio from Roger Karamane to the creatures from the Hunted Sea, and the whole thing is often destroyed by extreme, sugary ends. All the places and almost good fun.
