Based on a Ray Bradbury story; A professional photographer (Brian Carwin) returns to a small desert town in his smallest desert, where most people want him to be away. A lonely boy (Jonathan Caracco) leaned towards the attention; And the two witnesses desert an alien conspiracy in the rocky areas of the desert. Aliens turned themselves into images of people of dude. Curvin must be brought out of town and will fall in love with the little boy's mother (Elizabeth Penn). Acting is quite shallow; The story line is worse than some others; This movie makes you feel that you got a decent shot at the end. Support cast included: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mikey Jones.
