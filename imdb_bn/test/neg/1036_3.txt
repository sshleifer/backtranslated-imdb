Probably it was to tone out the smoke; It was probably a drag-out method - I'm not really sure, but it was not by a "bad" movie, but I really did call it "effective" ("I understand it is more arbitrary than their common use.) <br /> <br /> /> So, basically, here is the agreement that a series of teenage boys' deaths stop an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town. Finding a witch. Ladies and gentlemen, crazy ladies are involved, this is a crime drama and horror mix, because all the suspects and dead bodies are being displayed in different cities when bloody violence occurs. <br /> <br /> Enough is good But to me, most of it falls flat ... Oh, that was the moment ... A boy walking on a beautiful nude seductress was quite good, and he is a father Beat the character where the scene was a bitter commentary (even if the effect failed, his skin was considered to be a drudgery, as he was whipping him with red red hair). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end.

It definitely can be a poor role because I definitely need to check out his work done. Most Italian gazelle whatever hits-miss-miss, so I'm waiting to wait what this guy can do before writing to him. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
