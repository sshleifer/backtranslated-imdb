The only reason I give the second star is for the first half of the movie. It was a good imitation of the story. I enjoy watching some legendary characters added to add some color to a well-known story. But the second half was horrible !!! Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this movie only include violence and forget about what God has done for the Israelites. At the end of the film, Scott thought that he had received messages from a big monster instead of talking and listening to God. This custom was some big problem with the deviations from scriptures. And big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! This shocking obscene nude is full of lies about all these things against Moses who illustrate them as Moses. This was shown by Moses, who had to shout to speak to God. Wrong scriptures God spoke to Moses all the time and not just after a tantrum in a mood. They got the right to accuse people, but Jesus was speaking in Sinai that he spoke to Moses among the audience who could listen and believe in the audience. (Chapter 19). They forgot the pillar of fire and cloud, which led them to day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole of Joshua? Religious peace loving Jew, until the threat does not come against Moses? Wrong (he was known as a great warrior) told Moses's army that God spoke about the great statement that he had helped them enough and now they were themselves? Wrong (they only woke up Moses with his help in God's help in showing up in his own view), and what was the excuse to see the ark of the covenant? Instead of overlays with gold, this movie was in a tight budget and small gold chips were attached! Oh yes, it was not a "molytic calf". Someone came out of Egypt with a large amount of gold from Egypt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Glad to see the audience. Oh yeah - Manna was not the only thing sent from heaven - do not forget the birds for meat. Also, the Bible refers to bringing his wife and children to the right place and said that the Gitta returned to her own country. It does not say that the family of Moses gave up his family. <br /> <br /> Well, if you do not know anything about the real story, then read the journey for yourself. If you know the real story you will hate this version
