You can remember that I saw three triangle trash and the first movie could be only remotely viewable. The part had two low-grade sewage and two of these installments then slightly better, but still removed from my backyard on Monday last for a steaming pile. The court does not understand why the Chandpuris killed poor elderly lady and even in 1921, I think some people will see a bunch of oily boys where a sweet little woman once lived. Secondly, it was kind in comparison to what was seen in the first movie of this movie. It's just old clothes and a burlap sack. Let's face it, series garbage and almost should be forgotten. The shit!
