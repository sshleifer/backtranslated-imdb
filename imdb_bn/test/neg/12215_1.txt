Negative numbers are not bad how bad this movie is! Wooden acting has been rehashed dozens of times that have been combined with a story line. Everyone in this movie should present an overactive anonymity. You would think that an original story might evolve from the general idea. The youths at the prep school carried out Pearl Harbor bombings. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are published makes it fun. Common characters included Jolie Jock and Nerd (included glasses). I could not have been more reluctant in wooden dialogue and clich√© characters After the movie was over, I had to throw a DVD in the trash. Stay away from this ugly! You will not get 90 minutes in your life!
