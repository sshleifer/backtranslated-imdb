This may be perhaps the worst movie, there is a league with movies such as "Howard the Post", "Plan 9 Out of Space", and "Ishtar". I do not understand why I decided to watch this movie, because it was the waste of my life. I do not understand why it would love the movie, regardless of their humor. I have seen the worst of acting, like writing. Characters are all stupid, and the whole movie is not a funny scene. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor - this film proves it. There is nothing worth mentioning about this movie. Do not hire it, do not see it, do not even seem attractive. It's bad enough I saw it.
