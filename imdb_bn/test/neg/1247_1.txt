I hope this movie hopes that it will provide some great entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. I've got a documentary type to look at an average saying life those cards happened to be really good. Do I want to see romance with his wife? No, do I want to see everything in my life except this insect? No Well you get to do with this film. This type of acting is good for a piece of low budget. The film does not break the mold or tries to do something original. It's simply walking his way through sleeping scripts. The last is frustrating and does not really look deep into Ungar's mind. Instead it focuses on what was already obvious. He had a drugged-out card player with an average life, opposite of any other average tide in Vegas. The film focuses on the aspects of her life, which is uncommon than the UN. In the whole picture, poker scenes add about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's success in winning WSOP 3 times seems to be life after thought. The 10-year-old film can do better to handle it. Or perhaps it was a shit starting from the beginning of the script which destroyed this mope of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a gambling watch round about film. It has at least styles.
