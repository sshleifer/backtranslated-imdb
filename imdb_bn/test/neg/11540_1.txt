This will be the most annoying movie I ever surrounded through. It's awesome and funny, no excitement, it's terrible to be played by Hulce because Hulos can not pull the appropriate accent required for this movie. The story is stupid and I'm not sure if you want to be boring to death, do not recommend this bad word for someone.
