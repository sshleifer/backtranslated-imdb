As an alternative to reading the report, I hired a DVD in a video store. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One <br /> <br /> <br />, around, quite bad - most of the 'hot shot' most stereoautopses are violent unjustified public agents, every thought they know more than others. There may be some truth in it, but it's actually a bad Hollywood stereoateip smell. <br /> <br /> IMDB user community ratings and comments seem to be more accurate than the mistakes and I have started to look at the ratings before I rent any time. <br /> <br /> I want it to be mine.
