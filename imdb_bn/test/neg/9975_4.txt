I was expecting an exciting, high-tension film to be silent "kill for birth". Instead, it has received some wonderful atmospheric cinematography by two good piece of action set pieces (one at the beginning and one at the beginning) and Robert De Grass (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a wonderful credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is quite annoying. Lawrence Tearney has gone through his psycho kick, but it is a hard working statistics, which is how the audience expected from viewers to make a mechanical slow (after an "deleting") (an uploaded movie but less than good). The character of Claire Trevor is too stupid and unsupported to appeal to an audience, and the action (as it exists) inside the cursed room in San Francisco remains so strongly, that the film becomes truly claustrophobic rather than thrilling. This is one of the films that support supporter - especially Elisa Cook, Jr. (One of the few explicit groups of explicit clear scripts for his character's homeostatic inch tear) and Isabel Zellal - works out of leadership. It does not help almost half a century after the painting of psychoacrers in Alfred Hittak and Anthony Perin's "Psycho" screen. Tienni is so gross and clear that she "trunk" tattoo on her forehead. Also, there is no indication in the film why the source novel is called "Dudleyer than the man" - but perhaps James Gunn has made the female characters strong and more attractive than the film. "Bourne to Kill" is frustrating from Robert Weiss, who has already received some quality films under his belt and will be in a star-studded career.
