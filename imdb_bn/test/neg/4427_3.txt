We know the early Jackie Chan film that has no traces of Chan personality. This is the complete Chan of the kind of traditional revenge that is cloned and re-cloned by numerous producers and studios through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. This is a very serious story that does not show the humor and warmth of Jackie Chan's superstardom silently. It is clear that it does not restore its own view that we never knew him because his profession was very difficult. It's a good looking but pretty indefinite film as a movie on its own merits. I was watching this through marathon of martial arts all day and saw that with any other film I saw Jackie that day I did not see it. Actually I do not think the film is really annoying with any other good variation other than being interested in Jackie Chan's beginning.
