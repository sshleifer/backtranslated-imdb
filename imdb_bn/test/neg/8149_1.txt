Claims it with little respect, I'd like to give statements that this movie was awesome. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and production value was certainly not a great deal. I would recommend this movie to someone who likes good hard smiles and then they have more painful experience of two hours of their life. I'm surprised I even found this movie $ 1 DVD Rake where it was set up correctly. I thought it was going to be good and I could discover some extraordinary independent movies - I was wrong. I have not seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin could not take a bad picture. I am happy that I have seen this movie because finally I can tell people that I have ever seen the worst movies and have been sure.
