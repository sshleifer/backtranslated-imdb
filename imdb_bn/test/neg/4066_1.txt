You will see this. Even after the incident, I could not laugh about the stupidity that I saw in this movie. This movie can have one million personal mistakes and stupidity. Acting is bad. The story is so expected and flat. The effect is like 50 years old. The supposed thriller is not anywhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and laugh a lot later. We had a great time after the movie. Really I and my friend walked around the 40 minute long bus journey of this movie as we saw the next Oscar winner. Sadly, we were just talking about the bad things we saw.
