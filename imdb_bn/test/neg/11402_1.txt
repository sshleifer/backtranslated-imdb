I just do not want to see one of the movies I got it in a sneak-east, but surprisingly, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still surprised that I saw the whole movie ..) I wonder why I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Here at the bottom, the author of this movie (a book of illustrated jeffert) thought it was too bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in the selection for people to cast.
