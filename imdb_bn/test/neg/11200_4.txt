I got out of my way to get this picture, and I was fortunate to get it in VHS. As the big gloria gram fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. That's another, I can not really say a lot to suggest this picture. The plot is expected (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is that Sterling Hayden is facing severe problems with his own department. Mrs. Acheram is always fun to watch (if you like her), but her song dubbing makes this picture a great deal of pain. She works in a dive, so let's use her own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I will agree with an earlier critic; The heavy borrows from the big hit end. The point of detracting from the end. I saw a bad movie with Mrs. Aethem (MacAo), but I will never give him a chance to watch on the screen. If you are getting a movie night and looking for a second feature film, it's your movie. Enjoy the picture.
