Oh boy Such movies really bothered me. If this film is considered to be close to the truth, I think that shortly before the start of WWII, Rommel knew Hitler. In the film, Rommel points out how Hitler had changed before. Well, I can not imagine that Romel does not know anything about Hitler's government policy, so he must be blamed for German oppression. Remember, I have a movie problem which ultimately caused Romle's life to be tragic. Did she like her and feel bad for us? I can not do it I can not buy this theory that if more deserving generals are allowed to fight, the allies get more trouble to win it. If more skilled people were in charge, WWII could not start in the first place. From the point of view of the film, the movie is moved from place to place and most of the time it seems to be a special name like history that stars actors play a historic role. Leo g There are some good scenes with Carroll James Mason, and I've all spoken in English without this ridiculous utterance. But others that are not very important.
