It seems like a normal thing to play with Clive in the 90's. Some do manage to do so with great talent. Harvey did not hood. On paper, the film seems interesting: The weak plot has been preserved by comedy, dark humor and a very "deckle" style. Director Hadamar, unfortunately, killed his camera angle and his direction with a lack of complete list. Each joke is embarrassing as a response to the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be amazed at what they are doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could have been a stereotypical funny mindless comedy ending up being a catridral.
