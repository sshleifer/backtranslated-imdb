What is this ?! This was my first reaction to this (actually, my first reaction was more oath). This is not the Star Wars! Star Wars Space Battle, There is no one in this movie. Star Wars Force, this movie only has a chaotic witch with a magic ring. The Battle of Star Wars Lightbab, this movie did not qualify for any significant battle. Star fight ridiculous, this is not the movie. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has horses !!! In addition to all these, how did Lucas get the insane idea to play a major role in the five-year-old baby! Big, big disappointments Do you like Star Wars? Do not look at this! 10 out of 1
