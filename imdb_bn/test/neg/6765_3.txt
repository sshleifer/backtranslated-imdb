We chose to watch this movie as an alternative to Polar Express shown in our local IMX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not tricky. Snowman looked at, at times, demonic. At other times, he was simply a zombie. He did not show any expression or emotion most of the time, and his lips were only unclear blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Santa, at the beginning of the state, says that a movie about the attitude of giving it. A movie about Santa and a snowman announcing war on each other? I was all for a little parody, but this was not fun or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that Snowman flute is different from his voice. The worst is that you never see or hear that Snowman plays his bumper ... even in Santa "do not thank you". <br /> <br /> The only interesting part of the movie was "Outtakes". Very bad they do not use them in movies. It has been good.
