This film is about three young idealistic people, two of which join Naxalite movement and Bla Bla. It is really trying to determine another beautiful film about some rich people, which they can sleep next time; Farmers and Naxals and political struggles of the era only act as a beautiful backdrop. In literally, we do not talk to villagers, do not learn the names of anybody, thus they play the same role as 'natives' in old Hollywood movies. The film is also neutral, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - apart from the bedroom. We are obviously supposed to appreciate its artwork, which means that only a good song and dance routine, which of course can not save the film, can at least reduce the annoyance. <br /> <br /> My friend Japan was disturbed by the immorality of the whole story, not the bedroom bed, but the complete isolation of the story. The message is that pursuing the ideal pursuing is not pursuing.
