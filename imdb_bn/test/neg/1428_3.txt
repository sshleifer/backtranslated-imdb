Strangeland is a terrible horror / technology thriller. De Siender played Caroline Hendricks, a hateful computer freak who prays to young girls through chat rooms. His ridiculous view of pain and suffering is both confused and completely innocent. The ideas presented in this movie have nothing to do with reality, it is sitting like a lot more like D. Schneider and tried to think strange things to affect the fearsome fans and perhaps some of its old fans, but the end result is just terrible. Unfortunately, for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this film looks very good and immediately caught interest in me, which I was tempted to see. I assure you that you do not have a quality horror movie. It is such an annoying yet annoying endeavor that what can be seen in the minds of the people, how Carlton Hendrix behaves in this movie. The sad part is that nobody does this stuff themselves. Marilyn Frickin 'Monson did not even go so far, and Soundtrack was one of her songs, making it clear that the film did not have the meaning of having fun in her composer (it would hit herself at Snyder)), trying to raise herself more than her career like a Die Schneider.
