Sometimes, from the worst director to another film, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad but it's a great reason. May not be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a weird thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? Very little as a movie, at least a little more as entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what transvestite is and it does it through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot). Talking to the doctor (Timothy Pharel) who knows about these things. Doctor detective tells two stories and that we, and apparently scientist, see. The doctor pulled out these stories because of the deadline for a transvestite, suicide, and news headlines about sexual changes. The first and the longest story, Glenn (Ed Wood himself), who is about to get married and Barbara (Dolores Fuller) about her marriage, but she never told him that she wanted to get glenna as a woman when she was called Glenda. The film says the same thing, especially a transvestite is not gay. The film almost says that transvestite is not a bad thing, but being gay, because it tells us the truth that transvestite is not gay. The second story is about a transvestite that actually wants sex change and does not want to wear clothes just like a woman, but it is very small and less interesting. <br /> <br /> This picture makes some bad, and therefore ridiculous. How the story is presented is the first thing, the same thing is said in the same way and its conclusions are all the others. It does not end where. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fooler seems to read his line straight from a little screen. He said that every thing is fun. The whole conversation actually gave me a lot of smiles. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence where someone can enter the house. The door is open in half and we see something hanging over the wall, not completely straightened. Then the door, which seems to be the same shot, though we do not know it is a small open and suddenly hanging straight on the wall. Ed Wood did not intend to leave such errors of continuity in his movie. It could be a good thing, basically it's just another smile for the modern audience. I think you realize it's a bad movie and I think you have a good chance to laugh at the ridiculous mistakes.
