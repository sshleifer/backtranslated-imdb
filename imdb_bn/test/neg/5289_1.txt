I've started to see it because I thought it was really a shitty. When I saw that the only thrill available from this movie was able to find out what my name was, so I could look at it. I finished it and thought of ending my life that anyone has made this movie. <br /> <br /> For those who have commented as a good script and great acting in this movie, the words for your knowledge are for me, because you probably were in the movie because you probably have no friends. You probably wanted your life all the time that you were lost in making this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a serious movie. An old guy that gets stabbed and it does not even hit him. And when everyone dies, they die. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people killed and killed them and gave them food and wanted to keep their 80-year-old man in his body. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found "hemoglobinas" or you made it spell because it thought the movie was very intelligent and probably helped reach out to the old crowd. <br /> <br /> I really thought that they decided to cast the girls in college for that random scene to find fake Kupa. <br /> <br /> If you try to watch this movie, perhaps you will have your bathtub up and enter your hair dryer and prepare to jump. <br /> <br /> It must be seen !!! .... Anybody who believes in it may not be too bad for it because it will help you realize that there are people there (the maker of this movie) who is more kind and there is no place in life.
