I like science-fiction films and even low ratings, made on TV, application bins, movies I still can see interesting. Well, I found it in a door box and it was able to bring a group of friends to a movie night. <br /> <br /> I literally * embarrassed * that I came with this movie. <Br> <br /> Starting from the beginning, acting is bad, the story is soft and the plot is almost non-existent. These movies lead precisely to what it really is: a soft-core graphical movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was started in a women's prison where all the women in the prisoner work, which is working in any of my work. The first film is not that serious: the attractive women in a prison are forced to do physical work. Yes right Anyway. : P. Once "plot" continues, it is spread by uninterrupted scenes of sex. Halfway through the film, my friends and I see seeing off, was so stupid. The next day, I thought I'd give the film a second chance and look at the rest. I saw another 15 minutes later and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent, science-fiction or even a science-fiction giant film, do not see Lethal Target! If you want to see a low budget, soft-core porn which is light in the plot, see the Leatheal target.
