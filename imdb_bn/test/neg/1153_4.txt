If good intentions are good enough to create good movies, then I would have set more than 4 different tokids, pundas, obvious "focus" rates. Messi has done his best, but the previous poster commented, Miller's short story is very often requested by us to suspend unrest. Perhaps the novelist gives us more backgrounds on our Newman, so we realize that despite the fact that someone is not intelligent, it can be so dense to understand the attitude of people around him. I agree with other critics that if this time American citizens in America were not aware of how high a citizen was, then the film could open an eye. I grew up in fifty years, and there is no mistake with church picnics in the commercial beach of my "Lute" shepherds in Lutheran church, whose sign specifically indicates that no Jew or black will be admitted. For today's youth, it is difficult to understand that it was ideal, not just in the south. At the end of 1964, when I graduated from Baltimore's ethnic group (but sexually abducted) from high school, my black classmates could not attend the traditional "Father's and Son's Banquet" because it was held at any advantage Black was not received. Sadly, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. The topic of "focus" is important, and despite the characteristic characteristics of racism in modern America, we can not really make the previous generation's attitude really boring. ("The greatest generation"). So, perhaps this film is somewhat valuable to deal with the wave of the fierce sensation of fifty waves from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brock. But in the end, like "Farms to Heaven", the good aim of filmmakers has been ridiculously ridiculous for their social programs.
