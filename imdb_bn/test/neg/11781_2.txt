This is one of the most stupid movies, not a smart mind, but a fool. This 96 1/2 minute sleep addiction material. Perhaps Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The best and fun part of the film's last 30 seconds, but sitting entirely through the movie is very rare. On the other hand, if you are a deadly hard gym varney / Ernest fan, like me, you have to add your collection to your collection. It's a short, boring moment, though they are less and far away. The fact that this movie is so hard to find, it creates a collector item and must be present for your minimum collection. I was lucky to find this film online in a dirt cheap price a few years ago. I believe I paid 1.99 plus shipping for him. And I could find it anywhere. Although it is close to a real horror film, it must be the Jim Verney fan and Erneste Movie collector, like the graduation of the decade of the decade. But I give this movie 2 but only because I have never seen it before 1)
