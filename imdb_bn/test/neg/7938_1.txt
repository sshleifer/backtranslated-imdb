I'm the huge fan of the original Atal on Printer 13. Ice cream scene makes me panic at this moment. I am 33 years old and still I feel scared as a child. When I heard they were restoring it, I thought it could be good, but when I saw the movie, it's not 100% the same movie. This is not a rebuild. This is a bad idea of ​​theft. It is completely destroyed. Cast, Maria Belo, Lawrence Fishbarn, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Barney, John Leguizamo and Dera De Mateo are all great actors, even they could not save the film. It was just wrong. Even the setting was completely opposite. And how did anyone in that city notice that the next battle is going on? Why not help to show up soon? Stupid There is no knowledge
