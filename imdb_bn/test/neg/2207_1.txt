I will again cut my eyeballs with a razor blade for watching this movie. I have seen from beginning to end that it can not be worse .... but it has ended. Authors and producers should be put on the television to pour such blasphemy. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood and work on the McDonald's floor and empty the trash. Anyone who thinks of this movie should be hungry even remotely hung. They are embarrassing for humanity. We think we are putting their lives on line for anyone who generates such kind of rubbish in soldiers. I'm embarrassed to tell me American.
