This movie is about a guy who likes to blow himself up in gas pots. <br /> <br /> She loves her mother too. So, to keep the money coming, he takes his work to Broadway. See <br /> <br />! CODY POWER JARRETT BLOW is still up to its biggest gas container! 7.30pm tonight! <br /> <br /> <br /> One day his mother died and Jarret went away. He kidnaps the audience in the theater and stands on his huge gas cylinder. <br /> <br /> Losing control, he screams at all "It's the IAA MA, the top of the sylinder!" <br /> <br /> <br /> This word has become so deaf that it spreads Jarrett's Adroms, so that the cylinders drop them into acids. <br /> <br /> This is not the Warner Bros. film it's all cracked up.
