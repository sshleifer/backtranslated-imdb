"Fate" Walter directs Sparrow to possess a mysterious novel, which combines its life with neutral harmony and connection. This number is close to around 23 numbers. This story has been published in real life and stories, Sparrow has to find out its connection with the book and how the story ends. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers a corrupt offer that is brought back to a poor execution order. The film failed at many different levels which is quite frustrating because it is so much more probable. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with shameless sequences and comedic conversations that killed the film's mood. It seems that the picriter was a good idea, he did not know how it could be developed to extend it for a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was low, the twist was quite clear and the last was horrific. <br /> <br /> Joel Shuvaart is responsible for the worst movies of all time and she has released some of her phone booths and some other films but the number 23 reminds me that she is still able to make a stinker. She has drenched movie style but she just could not get a better focus. She moved to a clunky and slow motion film. The fact that he actually moved away from reality, what has happened in the book has quickly become annoying. In the film titled "Number 23", the actual book is stunned by a terrible intelligence story and the audience who described it as tears of tears. When Carrey is finally done with the book, we get stuck watching observers to try to solve the mystery. At this time, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. Before the movie is finally over, we wait to reach the end of the film's fateful and unclear explanation. <br /> <br /> Most played and pretty forgotten acting Jim Carey was definitely sleeping through his performance and he does not even seem to be trying. She was completely above the scene in some scenes or only very wooden. There was a complete burqa to listen to his description and he did not give any life inside his character. Virginia Madison achieved the best with limited role, but she needs to choose the best scripts. Logan Larman like Danny Houston was pretty cool. Overall, 23 is a terrific thriller that laughs more than suspense or thrills. Ratings 3/10
