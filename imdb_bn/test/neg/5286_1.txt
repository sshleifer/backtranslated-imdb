This movie is one of the worst B-movies I have ever seen. There are no twists at all in the plot. Although acting decent, the story is terrible. There are many mistakes in the film, and it was annoying to see. Anyone in horror movies, slasher movies, or even B movies, I do not recommend this to anyone. Most movies focus on uninterrupted killings, in a manner that is not worth the thought. This film can be very well liked by a miserly rimak of the Zippers crepe, which is not too great for a movie. Those who want to spend a day at home, see the weakly made movies, someone takes this cake.
