A masterclass about how a movie does not manage Incorrectly, often after missing the script. Ray has made many bad decisions that make this film an exciting viewing experience. Sadly, this film sometimes does not cross the old shapes, almost misogynistic gay camps, where women are more industrious, it's old and middle-aged and young, looking for zero and sex forever. The director could not pitch the film's voice or performance level. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a great deal of acting. Diane Wist slips into the disguise of her graduation in a Brazilian over by attempting to give a comic performance to the old General Jane Barkin Flowers of her bullet over. Even though there are very few real comedy here, you want to please him. The whole thing looks like a very low rental version of Merchant Ivory's Li Divorce, which can be very honest, is not very good.
