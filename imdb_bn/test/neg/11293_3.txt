Well, for the first time I did not see the "silence of the sheep." But, I think if I had seen this piece before, I would have been sick. Not from terrible violence, but from all other deficiencies. Anthony Hopkins was just as good as Hanib and I really believed he was attentive, because he played himself, but from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was full of clich√© from "silence", which I lost in point where others smiled at the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, I have heard that the movie will be terrible and if the director wants to find people ... he did ... but, only 2 order? I mean, if you want it to be great and I mean, you're going to stop this movie, so scary ... you need more than two ordering ... I have always seen that a movie is made that the cinematic jewelry Ultimate can give you another Take place and time, or go upstairs (which mostly ends in a bad taste) However, this picture sits on my chair and sometimes falls asleep. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julian Moore are the stars of the movie? Well, without the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel like ... who stupidly cared for the Italian police officer? I do not definatley So, the film is really a guy left with a big hole that dies anyhow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, once you jump and probably will be grossed out twice. Depending on your level. <br /> <br /> Think about how much money this movie will make ... Perhaps another hanbill will be made and probably the video will not remain until the film falls. You will see it .. Wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Do not spend big money in this movie.
