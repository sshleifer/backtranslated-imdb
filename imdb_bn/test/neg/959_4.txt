Interesting plot but painfully dull. The lack of scripts ... lack of acting. To me this image compares to "Made for TV" type movies. I was lucky to have a fall in my popcorn movie. I saw this picture with my family. It's fairly safe to see with your kids. (Only 1 half sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... see this movie. Very 80-ish If you like this Christmas, you like the combination of christmas, buzz, super glue and depressed people. Or maybe you like me ... and have high quality to act in movies. However, I did not like the start and end of the movie! Mark.
