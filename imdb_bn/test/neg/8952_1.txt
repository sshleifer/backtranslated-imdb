This TV show is probably the most painful display on TV today. Awesome predictable, slow motion photography, sticky story lines use porn. Chuck Norris is a hate that should never be allowed to be portrayed in the film. The way he chooses to make a public service every episode is really annoying. Its performance makes it cringe with a man embarrassing that it is so bad. Although I will give some credits to the series ... It is sometimes entertaining but there is no difference for it. With all the negative aspects of this series, I still like it on reality TV, it may not be worth more than that.
