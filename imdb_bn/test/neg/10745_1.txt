Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the title of the show "Hello of the Masters". And since it may be, it should be assumed as an opportunity to show your horrific chops, why you are claiming to be the "master" of this genre. Apparently you misunderstood the exercise. Apparently you thought it was your chance (or worse, your duty) to educate the American people in your political beliefs. And your efforts are overwhelming, respectful, and all come down on theorem. <br /> <br /> The only reason you have identified a small number as a high score because their political views match you and they are such a person <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Out of my horror, such as obvious (not delicate) and irrational (taunts) messages. And certainly others were "Horse Masters" when there was great disappointment or where I was generally confused why the director (Willon Malone?) Will be considered as a "master" genre ... you are unable to rest for the rest of the entire point of the series is absent . <br /> <br /> So the next time ... can you just keep yourself in your promotional politics?
