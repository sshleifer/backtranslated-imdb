Verily, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw Spider's child, and not this world. Hack I've even seen 200 Motels Discovering Freaks and Geeks series and being surprised by Linda Cardlene's acting ability, I've reviewed the reviews here and it's a worth try. This is the last time I will rely on the review of IMDB. I did not understand that while writing the MRNS AMDb review, they were waiting for their answers on AM radio. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that the word can not only express the anger of the opposite situation. Seriously See this movie if you think Will Farell is really fun, if you think that Adam Sandler is a comedic genius. Watch this movie but please do not sleep!
