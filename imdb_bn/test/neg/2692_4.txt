Last week I saw Macbeth's production of Royal Shakespeare Company. It was 25 years old, without any sword, there were no films, no furniture without chairs. It was a writing. Acting was super - Bright trained all actors On the contrary that performance ... yawn yawn yawn Alpasino was sad, heavy as a brother-in-law and could not defeat New York's pronunciation despite a long spell. Interrupted ... ... in between ... the line .... The whole thing was unhappy, even the "sunny" scenes were so happy even, let's laugh a lonely smile. This is supposed to be fun. They try to make it tragic It was not just boring. I give four points for dresses, scenery and Jeremy Irons, who is good at playing a neutral, depressed, deep voice guy (can he be anything else ???)
