So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a man in a hotel, Merion believes that this is his long lost brother, Brian, but when he comes to her, she tells someone else with the same mouth. Marion managed to get his fingerprints and took the police and when the identity was confirmed that his brother Brian and Bob went to New York after finding their position. They hold Brian, but he still does not know what they are talking about, but all couples really want to know that Brian 8 year old 9 year old boy Joe ... ... and even when he sees Joke, they do not know. Plots thickens and they themselves feel that one day they have someone else as well. Only perfect killers have been tested to make people, why they would bother Bob and Merion in the same building as each other. Personally Gregory Harrison plays two parts of his stardom, but I did not have any flaws with other actors, they became bored. 3 out of 10, a mystery yes but it is.
