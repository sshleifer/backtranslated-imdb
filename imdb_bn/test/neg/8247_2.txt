I sat through 2 hours of pure annoyance. I see IMDB here, though it is not at the top of the list, it is the top 250. I was a little unexpected. Although, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's ability to play, they have not yet saved the movie. I'm not sure what I really liked about the movie. Maybe because I have a math debate. Maybe I'm too much for talking dreary for 2 hours. Although I like "American Beauty", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I feel anything in this movie, please email me. I'm brilliant why over the top 250. And do not say "because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
