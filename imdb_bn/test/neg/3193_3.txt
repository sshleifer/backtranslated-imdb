Incoming point-of-view may come as a good idea in some movies. Here it is total mess. <br /> <br /> But the total mess begins with the story: a video clip vomit wants to draw a light comedy with a deadly silent-looking female character. She is gorgeous and can prevent any male dive and sucks crawl and her toes. He seems to be more materialistic, as his butter does not dissolve. <br /> <br /> The film goes away from its own ugly: smart / funny / beautiful appearance. Phalocretinism at its Best Just white trash, please.
