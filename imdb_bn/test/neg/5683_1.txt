Before watching the "BatsSpace" in the Hollywood video on DVD, I have never heard of the blue budget "Outerwear" Blue Johnson. A few minutes into the movie, I understand that this is not a bad thing. Most of the videos are directly related to it in saif-fi movies, it is mainly influenced by excessive adulterous special effects and failing to create a story that is proving to be a steady paradigm of stimulating scientist-ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of a religious word text is persecuted, then followed by a description by the main character's girl in a spoken role. To me it is a film mask with a smoke screen-like militant ugly visual and zero character emphasis. Here some people are ready to take this film seriously and it has newly embraced the new age message hook line and hybridization. These favorable reviews can certainly come from the same kind of people who can confuse themselves thinking that things like "the world of warfare" were a brilliant movie, or the cigarette was just as good as the coke. <br /> <br /> Those who were lazy lazy performances by Chasey Covert Art (in small doses, interacting with long long blocks of people), unexpected computer animated effects (extra large scale), and teasing talking computers. You will not get excitement, emotional stimuli, memorable dialogue, or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Batspace" is incomplete steam and the continuous annoyance of the description proves it. Real science is not about fiction, hell, real film making, characters and their dialogues, special effects, and dull predictions. It is directly below directly with the video scientist like "Clone" and "Rikon 2022". If you are curious about the "Weird Horizon" and "Alien Visitor", then look at its shit at all. If you enjoy telling good stories and hate the fake lens flares, you are better off with a real movie.
