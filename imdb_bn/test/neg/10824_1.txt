How unfortunate, still lucky, two films of Pot-Holling-Da Guah and Dynasty - will be reached at the same time. Sadly, on 7 July, the release of London's underground tube / metro terrorism took place in the UK for The Descent, which killed nearly 60 people and injured hundreds - especially for a good night / weekend pop out of movies, notably a deep, dark, A scary-as-shell film about women stuck in clustrophobic underground caving system To eat The two films have almost the same elements - a half-dozen or so characters, previously lost in undefined caveing ​​systems, out of which nobody is aware, they are trapped. Lots of water, caves, dangers ... then finally some harmful human-like or human species decide to hunt them. Where both of them are so different, the cave is untrue, completely incredible, horror, more alien-esquiera science-fantasy adventure than the drama. Lesser budgeted British films (portrayed in South England, although set in the appalacians) Five pairs of pants are horrific, heartbreaking shockers, so the stomach turning people come out of screening at the start of the shock. It stops girls from an old age - there is no idea what you can actually expect - certainly not! Reproduction has also blazed in the way of nature, which is like a lively awakened cave, like the Christmas Santa Groot of wonderful astronomy, with the Cathedral-sized room after the spectacular room in the magnificent blue light ... who knows where the cover torches, especially the granite-javed hiraguli (each tissue More from Putra than America / Gary Anderson / Thunderbird Degrading) are discussed with the light. Excellent quantities of equipment are also being carried out, yet this impossible voiceover actor has forgotten to pack a piece of apparently dangerous danger, drama, or any horrible movie - it is strictly PG rating. And in this example, the actors came out exactly the way they expect them - after getting acquainted with each character, I quickly wrote a list, finding only Piper Period in sequence. In contrast to Shakespeare's cave script, it will write a double-numbered, chimpanzee room in a week, in a week ... Take a general exchange between 'good friend' white and black lead; "How many days have we gone to this state?" - "too much" (Maurice shouts a yeast). I swear, you could hear at the clarity of my golden London audience gasp. The most awesome thing about the cave is that there is a clear opening for 'Siegel' - 'Guha 2: Overground' or whatever. Be afraid, do not be afraid ... or rather take hold of the line and be really scared, very scary. RR
