The concept of bringing Dracula in contemporary times is not bad - in the end, it can revive the series again by injecting a new story element in the series, which ended with the long continuation of all the great films of Hammer. However, because the present day became insane in the early 1970's, the results were quite intelligent and it looked more like love than the first byte (a deliberate comedy). Christopher Lee's 70's hip lingo and electric guitar charger and a picture filled with ridiculous rock music just looks stupid. To make things even worse, the performance here is more and more - with the intense and stupid performance of "Johnny Alacard". I made Van Helsing's grandson "Dakula" in the "Alicard" background and found that it was not found to anyone! Wow, what's cute! <br /> <br /> So the movie was so bad, why did it still achieve the respectable score of 4? Well, when Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drake (Christopher Lee) come up with the story of the expected showdown, it's exciting and very well ended. In addition, and I know it will be very sexist, but if I want to see the bad movie, at least Stephanie Becham's character has really dressed her a lot of beautiful clothes, which can express her broad expression .... "talent". So at least it was a beautiful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> This picture ends up with the term "last rest can rest in peace", though it is not the Hammer Dakular final. With Lee Shortly afterwards he returned for "The Satanic Rights of Dracula" and it was much worse than the crime of giant film.
