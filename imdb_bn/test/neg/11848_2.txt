Oh Way ... Jurassic Park got Karamen-ized. Naturally the plot is thin thin, 1 pound tall dinosaur which weighs 150 pounds and leaves bigger track than it is, unknown science which uses dinosaurs to check and keep poultry trucks, chickens, big dogs (I have seen chicken trucks all Shoe box size). And that is a film that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster. All male actor immerses (seems to have a tropical hug in the desert, leaving items to easily kill the rapper) and female actors think everyone is coming from Freddrick modeling of Halloween. Rapper itself is the worst thing in the Hoppoblin's (from the same name film), it seems to be a plastic model for doll doll versions of their hands and "motion" shots. If you want to sit around a good movie and jerk MST3K style, this is gold. If you want to make the appropriate film and act well ... do not see a Roger Corman film. Acting gets a 4 out of 10, some players try at this stage. The story gets 10 out of 2, it goes bad like a drunken story telling session. 2 out of 10 special effects found, I saw bad, but not many.
