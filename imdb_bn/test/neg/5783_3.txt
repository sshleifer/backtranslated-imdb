I'm good, pretty, a movie of action movies. And I am a huge fan of Elite military units like the Navy Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Bieh. Sorry anyone would allow me to really enjoy this movie. I bought the DVD when it recently gave it another chance. Here is a quick list of the problems of this movie: 1. It is a poor man top gun, for example, with a virtual music video of the SEAL team playing golf with soundtrack of "Boys Back Back In Town", which ends with Charlie, Shane returned to his tower car Getting an inane chase to get. <br /> <br /> 2. Shane is trying to become famous before it starts with hot shots, when it's a Charlie Shaw cinemas very easy. I've heard reports that Shane was a child on the set and it influenced role and direction and left actors in the film. <br /> <br /> 3 Although BAENL is the head of the seal team, Shane rarely obeys him. Any SEAL showing the lack of discipline of the Shi'en character, or those who endanger the team, can not create it by training Bidice, but only gives it to a team. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are arms trained cross. Nevertheless, "portray" how to use a silk "US Stinger's Missile" in one part of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in this movie. Initially the attack entry, Bill Paxton as "God", and at that time the footage was supposed to be Beirut. Overall though this movie is damaged one.
