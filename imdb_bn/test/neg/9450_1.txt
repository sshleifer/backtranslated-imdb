Dreamland started moderately interesting but Tedium went somewhere without the city. With no name actor and ridiculous effect is a low rental matter, is not recommended for any reason. It can be said that the best thing is that they actually depicted it on the location of the Nevada desert. In this, I can not think of one thing better without this stinker. The conclusion should be somewhat unlikely, but the rest of the others may be flat. Oh, I've thought about another good point about this cheese, even though it just climbed within one hour, but it welcomed it much earlier. When the girl wanders in the desert during the night, it seems to be going on forever and worse. The terrible attempt at least is not effective. The story is an effort to sense an evening zone style but fails badly. See "Retroactive" for a good science fiction B-movie.
