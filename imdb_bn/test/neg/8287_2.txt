A high school track star falls dead after a nation winner; Soon, her elder sister (Patch McKenzie) returned home and found that her sister's track team members disappeared. Who could be the killer? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Give it a lift with an acute performance. Even the mention of Gore is not significant. The whole thing is from the beginning to the longest, the film is set up by setting a track mileage set discos and E.J. "Blondie," as a character named "Blony" once in the movie Hello, Dolly, "Blondie." It may mean that we do not want to take the film seriously, but in any case it's a jerk. <br /> <br /> It is a routine slasher junk that "Friday 13th" movies look like works <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
