Martha Plimpton has done some prestigious films, she has worked with Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but Molly Ringwald said she could not expand her limited, Tombstone application in the same class. The just released film was an extension of its last '80s / early' 90s that was trying to find a screen-person that was recognizable to movie viewers and it represented another failure. Interviewer plays an annoying young man, who had received his 21st birthday and worse than that - was actually abandoned as a child of his parents! He has gone out to find his biological mother and father, but the viewer has no source why he will even want (simple curiosity will give him the determination?). Unreasonable material given to sitcom handling; It starts on the wrong foot and never recover. The insertion gives a thrust, surly performance, but Hector Elizando and Mary Kay Place as well as his adoptive parents. * **** to 1/2
