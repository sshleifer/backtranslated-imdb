In the 1950s and 60s, in the 70s and 80s, many war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, which glorified the "Partition" heroes? Citizens fighting against guerrilla warfare against German invaders German forces Hajuruddin Cravak, who is commonly known in Eastern Europe, has given several commands in the "partition" stories; Unfortunately, only a few of them were exported to Europe and the rest of America. "Battle of the Eagles" Partition is a rare, low-budget appearance of the formation and exploitation of air force. <br /> <br /> Marshall Tito ordered that a partition air force should be formed to combat the German Lufthof, the sky on Yugoslavia. A group of ex-pilots join forces with two small bipels and attack enemy bases and coal; For a few months, more pilots and planes join the post, eventually forming a weak air force. Maybe it's history, or is it novel? Whatever it is, it is not convincing, but a cast of great actors tries to ensure it. <br /> <br /> This film opens firmly with the firmly open-ended German air raids. The plot nuts and bolts almost come together, and for a short time the audiences are treated with a patriotic series of illustrations. Then the action began, and this title quickly became another low budget, the numbers became courageous. All Characters Known Clich√©s: Major Dragon (played by a well-meaning Fine Fahrer) is our ideal patriot, heroic leading man. While blasting the planes with the machine-gun, he exploded and there is also an aerial conflicts with Kleburg (Radko Polal), which is fully anticipated with even the expected results equally and with pure climax. The rest of the partners are familiar: Lajubisa Samarjik ("Netravara War") is a jar, a hotshot playboy; Bata Giovjinovic ("Hell River") is the Ves, an experienced traveler who came out of his structure now needs his country; And Rados Bjyk ("The World's Thrust Day") is Dalibour, the son of a young man, who gradually resigns, eventually becomes a war criminal pilot. Characters and their stories are known to no war fans, and Krvavac tries to build on these stereotypes. Cast does a fair job, and despite two-dimensional scripts, each player is interesting and fun to watch. Is there some great moments, especially, in the genre ?? When he will take his first flight as a gunman, and later, after the pilot dies, he will be forced to land the plane. This plot is only a string of air attack against Germany and the next reactionary activities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the small images are so cheap and falsely that real air photography and The movements in the toy vehicles are violent and ridiculous. Some scenes of stuffing and bomb blasts suddenly appear to be real, when the dogs traces associated with scale models are completed with the workforce pilots, only simple, kind. Sometimes smoke pumps from "machine-guns" are so large that the smoke consumes the entire model plane. Worse, the editor often fights the shots on the actual footage. Although the planets generally have the right perspective, they are surrounded by a confusing glove which prevents any attempt to reality. This action is set incredibly familiar and annoying score by all Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Eagles war" is very badly affected by the language of the English language. 28 minute footage missing at the beginning ?? From 130 minutes to just 102 minutes to finish the film. The missing parts were unexpectedly unpredictable and the cutting looks very tight. Music signals are cut suddenly and scenes are abandoned before the solutions are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story goes away, and only some bad scenes of necessary steps may try to save it from total ambiguity. Then, do dubbing ?? All scenes around the partition are dubbed in English (rather weakening, however), but there are several long scenes in Germany without the use of subtitles. The German alphabet's order may become more prominent instead of the important scenes that move around the partitions. <br /> <br /> Plus, Crawvak handles the footage very well. There is not a moment where the audience sounds like they are on a soundstage. In particular, the German Lufthof bases expand, with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and leather flying jackets complete with spare parts. Scenes are not afraid to shoot scenes with fresh and green, and Krvavac's extremely wide cones or simply are not afraid to serve a battle or long track. At the beginning of the photo a partition unit of German assault has occurred, as there is a discipline where the enemies of Jar and Dalib escaped from the base. <br /> <br /> This is in the home video, "Eagles War" is just a few stories about the Yugoslav Division. There is nothing to separate from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and rigorous edification keep it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this one until you find a full-length copy.
