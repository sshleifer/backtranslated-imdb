Now do not make me wrong, I love good movies and after watching Thin Red Line (and loving it) I was eager to track the two owners of Terrence Malcos, and only saw the days of heaven, I had to look for interest <br/> <br / > <br /> <br /> I saw many rabs about beautiful photography, but I saw this movie in old voice tape which it looks terrible. I can say that photography was great, because it was the only subject of interest in this movie. Because the replacement murderers have fallen asleep during a movie. This picture was so long (and it was not!), The edit was sticky and confused, the story was not existent, the voice was an incompatible ramble, the letters developed poorly, and the whole thing was continuous. I know how to make a malic film was uncertain. As a result, he shot a hex of the footage and tried to break it together for almost two years. This screen is very clear. Everybody looks crushed to see, every time a scene seems to be getting some motion (or some character development), but it will be annoying in people's annoying scenes. It was like someone tried to cut the story from the stock footage of the farmers. Some good points are at the end of the music and the Chase scene, but there is not enough close to maintain interest. I usually have to pass a bad film without very speechless, but when it is rated highly highly anything should be said. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a farmer like this ...?
