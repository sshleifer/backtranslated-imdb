Do you think you saw the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person designing the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. The cover makes it look like a good, scary horror mystery thriller. But not We have to do knightscram instead. A movie that is a "sweeeoooowww !!" It makes noise flashes across screens every time. The biggest name of the whole film is probably Caspar Van Deeven, who is rarely a partner. <br /> <br /> I voted for only because I could not cast a low vote. I can vote for something like negative five thousand, believe me, I will. So, for now, I'm going to pay only 5 out of 1/2 * 5 in night.
