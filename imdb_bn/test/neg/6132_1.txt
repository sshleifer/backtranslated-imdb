Here's a fantastic idea for a movie - A series of weather crashes happened in a small town and the city was gradually caught by a deputy camera dash cam in the city. Leave it to Albert Poon to screw it up! This glimpse does not get in 100 feet! Holy chains, what a bomb ... it's still the worst! The crazy thing here is the germ of a creative concept - an outbreak from a dashing pov tells the whole. I heard a while ago, I run on car broken cars, people, and infected types of windshield breaks and chaos around the car. Will that be cool? Instead, we lead in driving around a full time circle of wood area, sometimes running in three infected types who stand here. The last bit is literally a 15-minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, only the voice heard the offscreen. stay away!!! In a slightly relaxed note, I think I'm calling for my piano to finish formally ... I've only taken 20 vague films to do my best work.
