When I came out of this first film, I saw this movie in the theater, I'm sorry to say, and it was one of only a few movies I ever wanted to start. I did not have any problems with the drug ingredients and I could see how these warnings might be strong. The problem was, with filmmaker James Woods and Sian Young, I've painted at least the loving character, which I have never seen in the film. I hated this pair and they could not take less care if they were submerged directly below the inevitable. They did not have a surprise in this film. Every turn of events was so painful that I felt I could write my own writing; Although I think I want to do a good job Later, I heard the nightmares about the events of events like Shan Young and James Odds on some kind of stock event. Surprise me when it arose from some bad feelings and disadvantages of terrible acting. However, I've seen BOST as the worst movie ever I've ever paid.
