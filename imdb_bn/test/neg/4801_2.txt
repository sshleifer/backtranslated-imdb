This is a kind of movie that I am surprised to wonder why someone will do it from the beginning. Such movies that I do not understand how people make sense, how can the rental shop keep the DVD on its roof. This type of movie I blame myself for renting. <br /> <br /> There are good class-B movies, and I do not reject the section. When they are good, they hold interest in the verb, their letters are well written and work well enough so that you can take care of them. The effects of some of these films support the movie in many cases and you may prefer them for their originality. Almost 'nothing' is true in Coronado. The context and the script are in the comics level - just a cliche The effects are inexpensive - and I do not think the movie is low budget - you can do a lot with less budget but you need some talent. There are many continuity and other directions errors, like ten other films. You are not taking care of the characters, you are not laughing and at the end of the film you think that parody was deliberate or not. The only value I could find is visible, there are some good positions, many good film prices. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale The worst film of the year so far.
