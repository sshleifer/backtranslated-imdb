To be honest, after Cotton Club and Unfinished, it was shameful to meet Lane and Guy in this film because it was BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogue was very shallow and insincere. It was a good shot, but, again, it's a big budget movie. It was very predictable, for a chick flicker. I even knew from the beginning that he was finally going to die, the only thing I did not know was how. Very politically correct. Very frustrating. The only thing of visual value was the scene and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want it, see National Geographic. I love Len, but I have never seen him in this movie. As long as he counts, he is a good actor, but there was a movie like him, so I am not surprised. I want to bring back one and a half hours.
