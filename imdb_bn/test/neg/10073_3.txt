How tragic it is when a wonderful movie, as "Jurassic Park", is slow and hackneyed throughout its territorial jurisdiction. Jupassic Park does not give any idea of ​​the third series, characters, stories or most of the script, and instead relies on the non-stop dinosaur action which is exciting and very interesting to watch. 7 years after the progress of CGI, dinosaurs seem to be incredibly murky compared to the 1993 technology, it only showed the film for summer, depending on your name. The role of a Peterdictil did not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> See "Shake" again. <br /> <br />
