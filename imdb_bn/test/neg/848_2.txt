First seen 3/17/2002 - 2 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): There are many intimate relationships with innocent, sex-filled masters and slaves. Compared to the story of this movie, it took more care about sex and used the story of sex stories. The original Italian language ridiculous dubbing in the version I have seen with ridiculous completion, where anti-slave statements were tried (or I would say a line). This is a waste of time for everyone who watch this trash.
