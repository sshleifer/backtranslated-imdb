This is really abysmal. After listening to the good things to me, I received a copy of "Disco Beaver Off-Out Space", and I must say, it was so incredible and bad, it would fool you and make sure that it was made. <Br> <br /> I mean, what was it? Is it usually the late 70's humorous? I do not think so. It's just so bad, and believe me, I do not want to say "it's too bad". If you only watch TV, it's a collection of extremely sketchy skits. Certainly, this is an H.B.E. The program was, and it may seem that it is terrifying to groundbreaking. It has some beautiful girls, and there are some old NHL footage of the NY Islands, which I'm not happy to see, although I'm a living NY Rangers fan. But they even upgraded because they try to get two hockey players "dancing" and even worse than some two ice cream players, even the two hockey player's video tapes look like this. Having sex Oh, how funny! In a nutshell, there is a hockey player named "Haka Player", like NY Island goalkeeper Chico Richek, but he has hit it after the Ranger Jersey! Well, maybe that was deliberate, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is "Disco Beaver" is so terribly terrible, so incredibly bad, you must see it and waste almost an hour of deceit in your life. You probably wonder how these garbage makers think they are fun here, and you would not be surprised that these skits might not even come around the worst Saturday night knight. Incredible Just incredible.
