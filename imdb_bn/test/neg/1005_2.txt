Three mysterious three are involved in war with mysterious men. Three businessmen will take revenge, which will later proceed towards murder. It is believed that the story is about the violence that can happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this plot. Details are ignored for moving forward stories. The acting was disrespectful. When you saw this movie on DVD, the color balance was horrible. Small budget and tight schedules were clear. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot in the final gunfight, and the last was simply incredible.
