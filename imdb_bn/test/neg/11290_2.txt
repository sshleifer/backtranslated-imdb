I acknowledge that I was cheated by the title and summary behind the box. So I was waiting for it to pop in VCR ... and I'm waiting ... and waiting for something good. But of course, it's not. The makers of this film have to be dragged to the chair and will have to look for "private private protection." Maybe they have to learn something.
