When I heard that they were making it, I was very happy to think that the first picture was good, a little bit <br /> <br /> But I remembered that I saw something before the Disney Siegel disaster (I You see a Little Mareed 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway I saw it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing about it is the animations spanking. It really has that special Polish "right" Disney film. <br /> <br /> The rest of it is frustrating. The storyline is important all over the place. Some moments about it in a moment, then completely change to another story and then change to another completely different story. It reminds me of how the Family Guy was like 3 different episodes, became a movie. <br /> <br /> I probably smiled once. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />> 4/10
