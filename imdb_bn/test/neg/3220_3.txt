A few weeks ago, at the movie theater, I saw the tag "The Latin Godfather" tag in a movie poster (2004) by El Padro√±o. How much have we been hanged, I thought, Latin is just because he is a Mexican? I remind you that a Latin comes from Latino or related to Latium, so the real man in Godfather's movie is Latin more than the Mexican Godfather, and for this reason: We call the people of Latin America because we speak Spanish language that is based in Latin, which is already in Rome Born in Italy. So, to put a tag on a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather" is not simply unconscious, of course, if we try to relate it to the original Godfather, copying the title is a little appreciated and uncertain. Now about the movie, I only hate the quirk from 1 to 10, guess 3 is the highest.
