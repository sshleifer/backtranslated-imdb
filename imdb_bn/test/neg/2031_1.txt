In the United States, the quarters show a letter sent by Bob to his friend Mike, Billy and John, and Bob and Mike bravely killed him with a piece of wood and wood. Mike felt sorry and decided to tell what his mother said, but John and Billy threatened him with the sad consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe "wind" is the worst movie of my life. The horror screenplay is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write summaries, because there is no story or plot, only the sequence of isolated scenes. Amateur direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible. It is unbelievable how the producers invested in such trash, distributors publish this sham around the world and visitors like me buy this DVD. I waited till the last scene because I was interested in seeing how bad this picture might be and I was impressed, because my lowest expectation was worse than imagination. In the end, I ask why IMDB does not offer zero resolution in the voting system, because the garbage is really worthy of this vote. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Foreca Invisible" ("Invisible Force")
