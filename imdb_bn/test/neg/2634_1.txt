This has got to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've hated it so much that I wanted to come here and complained about it was bad. Generally bad movies are not a big deal, but if you hate it, it's about something .. you really hate it. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, then perhaps you would enjoy baby jeans, I thought that I would not find a movie that was bad then one .. I guess not.
