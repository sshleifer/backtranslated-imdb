This is a film that killed the western "spaghetti". It does not lose anything in translation, it's also the total chaotic mess of the edit. Its parts have been edited and re-edited for the English version. In any case, it makes little or no knowledge, time. It compares "Trinity" and Eastwood with "Man with No Name" John Ford / John Wein. Nothing in this picture is real. Somewhere a start, a middle, and (finally) one end. Without end, everything is not exactly the same. Robert Wood seems to be enough personality. Cast the rest, especially women, should prefer the good profession.
