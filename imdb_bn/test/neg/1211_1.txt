I wrote spoiler alert, but really a lot that can not be spoiled. Like it spoiled drunk meat. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of actors or special effects, but because of the perfect numbers, both real and physical. After all, MIG is not actually a MIG. They are the mirrors, and they are French. And how does Hackdog prevent his father from fighting "MIGS" without any case? And why would Chappi try to go on his plane without a G-suite? And how could Doug defeat easily with the enemy pilot S? Anyway, I did not like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 signals, the lastest since the end of 1995. Now it's scary.
