This western / musical / comedy is not one of the superiority of what I have seen. I found it very slowly. It is simply plotted with the inevitable end. I got it too. I could not wait for Randolph Scott's headlines and Lloyd bridges too big. But for my money the best of the Edgar Buchanan group. Buchanan appeared in many Westerners of his day, often giving humor, as he did in the film. I like Ann Diora as Rita. However, I can not remember a lot for recommending this movie. This film is based on a novel by Ernest Hackack, who wrote a novel StageCach, which was a lunatic in a movie in 1939, and was re-created in 1966 and again in 1986. I remember the 1932 version of the stagecake, which is one of the best movies. For the town of Abneni, my vote was 3/10
