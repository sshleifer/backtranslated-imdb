I have waited too long to see this picture. As far as I know that it was never released in Australia, I finally found a copy of the net and ordered it through it. My order finally arrived a few weeks after the confirmation and finally was ready to sit in front of my TV to see a movie which was so interesting and controversial and was portrayed in a movie that has many good movies in the world. What a disappointment In the first few minutes, I realized I had ordered a B grade, but I was still full of expectations. I had my son (18) believing that to see it with me, when I would share with a good underlying statement and / or story line to find a valuable movie. He stood on about half way and said that he could not stand to see it, it was so much expected and amateur. I agree but have finally seen. Acting was objectionable even for B grade standards. Stereootiping is also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur Lacicin, who thus cited them by crafting the film. There is no doubt that some ethnic ancestors still exist in different parts of the world, but not only the United States, but at this age and age, I suspect that they will be presented to all these ridiculous aliens. The film had to be doubled to date, since the worst scenes of the horrific scenes were to try, I would expect something from the first attempt to create 'indie' in the first film of high school student. I want to highlight this film in the hands of experienced writers and filmmakers, this is an old story, but it can still pack a punch even if it is professionally confronted. So frustrated with so long wait and high expectations. Soundtrack is probably the only thing I enjoy.
