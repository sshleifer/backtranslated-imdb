I've read a lot of comments about how this image takes the book. I do not think any of them actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and Apes was the killer and hunter. We now know differently and this movie portrays apps in more modern philosophy. I've never seen a Tarzan film that came close to Edgar's point of view. Perhaps one day tell the story of the genius of the Hollywood beliefs and honored writers. So, if you do not read the book and enjoy a good story about the feeling and the flick of wild animals, perhaps a good tears, see the movie. I hope John Carter gets more honor than Tarzan on Tuesday. We miss, Edgar!
