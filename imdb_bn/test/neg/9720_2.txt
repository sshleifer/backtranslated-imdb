The story was distraught, the act was not a colonizer that you can do the cat. More of a serial pilot than an actual movie. I wanted to like this movie but could not find anything about it. Whatever the missing boys were so liked here is probably missing here. Altho tried it hard. Plot hooks were set up little about what could happen in a part of Dawson Creek with dark clothes and the story's arrow is not going anywhere. It's very frustrating for me. The last scene special effects powered facilities and how the villain in the story planned his whole plan. He (or he) tried the kids, was talking about speechless. Stay tuned with the films stuck with the films of this genre, when they had another idea.
