Two notable things about "I will not play" are: it won Academy Award as the best two-rail short film of 1944; And it is managed by the leading people of the silent era by Crane Wilbur. The plot of this run of the mill is irrelevant, but there is a lack of spark in the conversation, though the performance is even better and there is nothing bad in most of the 1940 war-based Hollywood movies (in other words, it's awful). Of course, the moments when "I will not play" are fun - the complete artificial look and line delivery of the genius Paige is valuable - but one is laughing in the picture, not with her.
