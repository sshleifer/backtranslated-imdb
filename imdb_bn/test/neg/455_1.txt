Wonderful rating no surprise other than how fast response ABC According to the published report (Variety) the show got the worst rating in the history of ABC television network. <br /> <br /> I am quoting: ABC's Music Talent Competition "The One" canceled on Tuesday night- <br /> <br /> <br /> This article says that The program "decreased between 18-18 adults and 3.08 million viewers of 1.1 ratings / 3 percent." <br /> <br /> This is also the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and all series under ABC history. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw these ads that I knew it would fail. We do not need another American idol clone. But ABC may offer a suitable opportunity for this event to be successful.
