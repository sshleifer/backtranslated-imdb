Disgust Even the popular popular Diane Lane could not even save the film, and if Raukek's face was removed, then seeing the most exciting thing about the film. One has heard a lot of "gossip" about the leakage in his body, so like an accident on the road side, we were only looking for slow and debris. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional hurried person, in any way kicked wild and uncontrolled punk / twig and in this movie we wonder why this man is with this stupid person, join the person alone. Then able to go after the witness that the crime was not even committed. She will pop them right and there. But then, we did not have a movie, so? And why is the fact even the extortion agree? There was more holes in this flick than my colander. The acting was horrific, the whole movie was predictable until the minute, even the end. And it can make a great movie. But if you have about 90 minutes of death and do not use any brain cells in the process, then this film is like a doctor's order.
