I hate this picture. Simply tell, this movie is so bad that I often want to disregard it and do not want to mention it again. But on the other hand, I can not prevent a good bashing. And if Ivan is one thing for the Almighty spectator, then it is the best criticism. <br /> <br /> This picture (a series of very interesting Bruce Almighty) started by reproducing the audience to Evan. The best character backstarter in the original film. That's right. This film shows no Jim Carey or Jennifer Anisten. Even a small camio look. When you know that your movie is bad, the person who agreed for the access vendor: There will not be a short walk in nature's call. But the way they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. While sitting in my empty theater near the lack of comedies, I wondered how much money I took for the protection of Freeman. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a roles that take 20 minutes to 100 minutes of film. God simply pops up in saying to build the Ark as Evan says. Sure, I know that Morgan Freeman will not see this movie in a year and Shawkank thinks his role as Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where were I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes when you realize that you have thought of a plot rather than the author of the platform, it is very difficult to keep an eye on the plot. However, Evan (Steve Carroll) left his job as a news engineer for a Congressman's job. Yes ... with no infections in between. He never gave his wife back and said, "I think I want to be a congressman." It only happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with bigger infections. As a congressman, he became a partner for a proposed bill of John Goodman's character when suddenly God told Ivan to build the ship. "Oh, how are you?" Bit. Just "I want you to build a ship." Evidence of bad writing: Evan determines that God gives an affectionate source for building a ship when Genuine holds a symbol of the word 6:14 when he is walking his son watching television watching baseball. <br /> <br /> Originally the plot of Ivan Mighty There are some random supporting cast members who do their best to create a comedy but they are not very good because they do not have any screen time. It's just a family of mill family created in a match of your movie. Oh and there is a compulsory scenario where the father will have to cancel the hiking plan with his kids because he is busy working. They run disappointing but they understand, as this happened in the film all the other time. Just once I want to see the little baby turn around his father and kicked him in chains, "You are a real busy person to cancel your plan, I'm going to start emo now." There is also a drama that you can expect from a father with his family (wife, in fact ... there is no problem helping three kids build a ship) that she has become crazy and she claims that God wants to build her Big boats But do not worry. His family decided to stay with him. Oops, I just ruined the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this picture is that no less comedy is going on. I know that this PG film has decided to rate the rate of getting a huge crowd response, but I do not think that I am among the minorities, when I think the funeral of the family is just kicking in the nut and animals, Maybe I'm wrong and the quality of family humor has been reduced. And if it is, then bring me more adult comedy so that I do not have to sit through this nasty (no more purpose). <br /> <br /> The last addition of Chess Suddenly, the film took a dramatic turn to fill the CGI which makes me feel the terrible waste of CGI. I bet it was very expensive. Finally, after waiting for all this, we were told why the believers wanted to build the ship. Son oh boy why i hate I'll leave the details but it was like watching or reading the mystery of the killing and the murderer was turned into a person who went behind the main character of a character and there was no line. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there is a nice touch at the very end. The song is playing with the song "Gana Make You Suit (Evevard Dance Noise)" with credit and then we are cast as "dance". I do not get it. They failed 100 minutes to create a comedy and then they wrap it with a thriller. I swear that I did not fear Steve Carroll's dance ... well not. There you have it. Ivan is the greatest film of all time. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a conspicuous experience. Along with Guillermo's Girl Lorraine Graham, I am annoyed by all the talented actors present in this bore festival (Carroll, Freeman and Goodman). I still can not prove that he can come out of paper paper bags. But most of the time, I am surprised by the power of my will, I can not walk out of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * **** Outside
