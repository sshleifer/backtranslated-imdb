Very little positive that can really be said about this film. Walter Piszdon is a real inconsistent protagonist and even Morson when he tries to be "secret" like a villain, we want to believe, drink too much and hurt his wife for a while. Margaret Liton, such as a wife / secret sergeant, is a bit more believable, but it is still hard to believe that any hood of their salt can not be seen in less than a minute with their sheets. The plot about a Boolean Hest, stupid, and action grips drags instead. David Tamlinson plays Algie in the same way that David Tomminson thought to play all his roles, this is the only light of a completely neutral relationship.
