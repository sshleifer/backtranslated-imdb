I was really surprised to find a movie based on Far Cry. The story here is not something I would consider as a strong point in the game universe. Generally there is no worry like Bill Fashion, the story of the movie is rarely based on the game. Now I realize that there is a certain freedom to move media from one form to another, but it seems that he does not really try to connect. Not only that, but the sequence of acting and action is so intense that it feels like you have a whole project, it's a big joke. It is said a million times ago but why can not one acquire the right to create more gifted videos?
