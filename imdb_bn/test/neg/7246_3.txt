I saw this movie TCM this morning. Very bad acting, low budget and poor intrigue feeling when I felt the movie. The only brightness of the film was young old Rita Moreno, (23 years old), aged 50, playing a young Indian scowl with love for an elderly man. He reminded Luiza (1962) of the previous version of Su-Lyon, only more harmless Lolita. He got up like a little boy in the 1950s, almost completely thinking that you would give him a chewing gum, he is willing to give her something in the old age, as he hinders him, as he hinders him. At the age of 50, a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl was willing to do something for her and to be his wife, would be insane to not benefit from her. It is very bad that the censorship board did not allow the expansion of a character like Ritter Moreno again when the film was released. The only reason I gave this movie to 3 instead of 1, in Rita Moreno's film.
