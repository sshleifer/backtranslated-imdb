The BBC and the Arts and Entertainment Network have to be ashamed to blunt this unfortunate production of the world. The acting is the worst and painful with the exception of leaving Robert Hardy as General Tyler. The costumes are at the top and there are some really bad features - Wear designer clothes for feathers for women's clothing? Surely, in the beginning of the 19th century, every woman in the bath was not a shepherd on her head. The production values ​​are poor and the film pensing thinks it's rushing at the last minute and slightly edited. Above all, a tragic film that forced me to see the end. This is a shame because the producers apparently spent a lot of money in shooting and dressing. Compared to the remarkable "sensitivity and sensitivity" or "Pride and Prejudice" of Amma Thompson or 1995's "Prayer and Prejudice" in 1995, this production of 'Northen Abbey' must have turned Jane Austen into her grave.
