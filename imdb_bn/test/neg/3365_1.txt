This is the worst movie I ever seen, some times Featuring sticky, badly shining sets, ridiculous acting, infantile plot and shoddy, drawn from the action sequence, this film is so bad, its delightful. For about ten minutes. Then you will be able to reach the remote or power socket to finish this movie. Although it's full production and the collective tongue of the acting crew entered into the cheek (please God), but I think Jack Frost 2 is unknown for more than an hour. If you were not enough after this time you will be involved in drug abuse.
