If this is possible, I could give this less than 1 rating. The whole picture was to be left on the floor of the cutting house floor. What time, money and efforts are kindly wasteful! Let's see ... you combine the most beautiful cast to find out (which is certainly the ratio of the amount of talent you deserve) ... you can thug up thinnest plots together ... and viola! A disgusting piece of trash that should be ashamed of the director and / or producer on their name. How much can be a terrific section? And do not use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen a lot less budget movie .... In fact, the best of all time classics were low budget. If you do not have the talent and consciousness to create a horror film, but do not do the same for God !!!
