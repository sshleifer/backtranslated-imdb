Oh, yawn. Another chick shakes where all of the men are dry and women will enjoy even the abuse they enjoy. The only difference is that everybody in this movie is a pistachio or brain. I do not have the right to send a man to prison for a massacre why I hate this picture for the moral issue. An immoral act more than its misuse and deviousness. The bad writing of this movie shows all situational ethics. I saw it in CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If this is the best of Britain, the British film industry is astonished by the hardships. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this film was David Tenant, he played his character so frustrating that he could spit on me to speak with Scottish accent next person. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim, but in the end David's character becomes immoral as terrible as the tenant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In the case of brain section parents do not clearly see any mistake with psychological Brendan. The English police have been so incapable that they can not afford the traffic ticket. The British Police Commission has to file a lawsuit against the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> This movie is not powered by electricity to run your DVD.
