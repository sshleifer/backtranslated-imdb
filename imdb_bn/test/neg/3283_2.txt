If you do not see "home war", then let me tell you what you are saying. It was a show about racial diversity and sex which was only fun and fun in the 60's. Where the acceptance of America's race, sex, religion, etc. has increased ... This show seems to debate about that progress. This is a chasing step in America's evolution. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the program's joker is that the white girl is dating a black child from the school. It is quite pleasant to see the kind of relationship you can not see in any mall in America. I have lived in both small towns and big cities, so do not give me any kind of red state, blue state excuse. This is not just a joke, but the father, who is not a racist, has found this annoying and has asked his wife to divide her with her husband again and again, who opposes her, "She can hear racist sounds, but she is just stupid" character <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, the second is the joke that one of the boys, and may soon be metro-sex, hesitated in its sexual adaptation. The audience is taught that he is not gay, but the father does not believe, so he constantly avoids his son, perhaps his son will fear him, because all gay men are stupid wild men, who do not control their desires. Once the father always shows every one, his son comes to accept something, but usually avoid him in the following episode. <br /> <br /> This show is the only way I can cure myself in my eyes. If the continuous exposure is "unexpected event" of this life, it is somewhat open to the father's eye, but with such a joke - and besides this there may be something wonderful, I am sure We will be happy to come to these episodes - Episode 13, "Father Voting Against Women Voters", and Episode 14, "A Muslim with My Muslim Neighbors". <br /> <br /> Please fox this show. We're living in a different world that becomes one bigger in your execs.
