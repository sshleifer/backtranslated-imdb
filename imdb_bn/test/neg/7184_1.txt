I'm not sure what to do about this movie yet. I think the boy was afraid to become blind and started to imagine all kinds of strange things. It does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother, however, unreasonable irritability in the film. You will be blind if you see this movie, so you do not have to see this test in vain. Skip this steaming pile and select for something else at the video store ..... anything else.
