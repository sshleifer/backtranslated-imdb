If you are one of those people who do not like science fiction due to the concept of real farsightedness and a very trustworthy perspective, you can stay as far away from Stuart Gordon's space truckers as well! It's really a weird place to stuff with adventure, wonderful characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous plot-twists. In all the truth ?? Perhaps I did not care for this picture if it did not have Gordon's name in credit. This guy comes very close to being awesome in style, such as unknown milestones? Her exercise ?? And like 're-animators'. Apparently, Stewart Gordon likes his humor as much as possible! He once went completely comedy-top (with re-animators), but there was effective with little difference in odd comedy. Is there no such thing for the space truckers? Most gags do not lead anywhere and the exclusively exaggerated atmosphere works only in small doses. In the end, all that remains is a sometimes fun but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hooper and Charles Dance (or at least a half-Charles Dancing) are always happy to see and still amazed Barbara Crumpton have a small role in the end of the film. Crompton Stewart was the regular heroine of Gordon in the previous horror films. Space truckers story silly as they are coming. Dennis Hooper played himself self-made Loner with his work distracted. For an organization called Interpark, who will not you be in the dry transit across the galaxy? He sees his change in flight when bringing his man-made on earth. They are meant to float in the space-pirates and to erase the half-universe of their cargo! Stuart Gordon is returning to making the awesome again after this little escapade. From the space truckers, he has already made a fantastic 'king of the ants' and is absolutely bright 'Dagon'
