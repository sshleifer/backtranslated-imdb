JEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS Forward Spoilers .... I have a word: "Pesticides kill pest and moronicides kill morons ..." This movie "Scratch" kills morons. Most of the people who died in this movie are actually killed, going to abandoned homes, going after ghosts etc ... <br /> <br /> On the strictly cinematic outlook, this movie really feels bad. Three story lines are parallel and suddenly shown, we learn they are separated by at least a few days. This is a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Also, "The Thrills" are so cheap, they are ridiculous. Even "Nightmares on Elm Street" did not shrink so much that someone is being attacked by his own sweater ... it's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay at home and you will not have a rage against filmmakers ..
