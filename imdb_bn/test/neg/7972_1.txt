Kristy Swanson plays an elite Hitman who seems to be keen to kill a TV reporter for a group of bad aristocrats, but once she plays with the kids to play with the kids, she sees that the whole project has been junked and the TV reporter's life was preserved. The people who wanted to kill this reporter are now victims of not being followed by their recruitment. Hitman's life has become stronger now. This is the original origin of the film as the supreme waste of the Supreme Court. <br /> <br /> <br /> Time is more than that. We see Swansea's character kill beet, ants and bigger people than that. And he always goes up to a step forward from the killer group, for any reason, keeping a woman with this super hitman away from a woman, beating these men, thinks that the movie is so gay. When you win Swansea's character, it is probably predictable, thus making the film boring and inactive. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson was a modest actress, who was always sexy and easy at her small day and eye-eyed. Excessive approval is not one of his best efforts.
