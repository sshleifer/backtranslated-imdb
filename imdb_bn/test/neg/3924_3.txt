There is nothing specially unique or interesting about Flickr Flickr - Science of low budget. The origins of his generation (the film is based on Leo Tolstoy's novel), the plot of this film and the overall themes are not in great or original way, the science is always weak, and unfortunately, the film also fails to comply with the order of compulsory action. <br /> <br /> The plot starts on Mars with a man-made space flight, and although the original plot rolling up to the ground floor, most of the interesting scenes are rooted. Unfortunately, our intercontinental traveler gives way to the touch-down, their preoccupied inter-personal relationships, cosmicism and ideas about life, and everything interesting about the film, to Martian revolutionaries, the only remote coherent plot related to environmental issues. Cheating is very strong on the web. <br /> <br /> There is nothing too extraordinary about the production quality of the movie. It's passable. And most of the acting, though slow, okay. Cameron Mitchell is actually quite good and plays a favorite character. I guess from my perspective, the best quality of this film, in its fashion sense. Martyrs have a very nice document! If this picture was a dot, it could be a lot more interesting. Well good
