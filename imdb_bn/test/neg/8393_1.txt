If it is an art and article film, but not enough art, the article is not to be mentioned. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller then there is not enough enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> A teenage play, not enough drama, and as far as teenagers are concerned, there are not enough nofx and there are too many nano rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming film, but there is no Tony Haq, so I think it has been cheated: it's not Tony Hawk biopic. <br /> <br /> If it is an action movie then there is a lack of explosion in it, which has added some interest to it, or at least the sleepers have to jump on their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be dead inside, but this is not a zombie movie. Actually, if it is a movie, there is not enough plot. If it is not a movie, then it has been a long time since a music video. <br /> <br /> If this is a music video, well ... this is an album I will not buy
