*** Spokilators! *** I sometimes wonder how to explain the mysteries behind amazing films (and therefore destruction) I think that the creators think of them. The original "Heelryer" of 1987 was a perfect work and probably one of the most horrific films ever made. The 1988 series "Hellbond" was also an amazing movie, although I personally did not personally like how viewers got background information on snowballs, mainly in the biggest Harrah-Villains of all time. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was already a mess, whose makers believed that it was adding a dimension of humor to the former impossible unclear lead-cenobite pinhead (usually the stupidity of 90) and thus the greatest destruction of its abnormalities. This fourth part is a little more atmospheric than the "Heelier: Bloody" (1996) third, but it discovers even more stupid and completely unnecessary 'background information' about snowbittles and is open to hell to open these gates. br /> <br /> Seriously - we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes opened the door to hell? I do not think so, and this movie is not the only mystery of the silly destruction of these sibobites. The "blood pressure" setting goes back in three different periods. The film began at the 22nd Century Space Station, when the scientist said. Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) always tried to close the door of Hell. When the government forces interrupted his mission, he had to explain the reason. In the 18th century, the ancestor of Paris's businessman was a tuimoker who covered a secret intelligence with a treasure trove. The princess of hell take on the body of an enchanted monster, beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person who created this to destroy the entrance of hell, this would be cursed by the trimmer's bleeding, and his ancestors would be overthrown by the Cenobites ... What happened in the 18th century, this film is present, and the 22nd century is really a mess. . I acknowledge that the 18th Century is a wonderful atmosphere and it is the best part of the film, but it is the smallest part of it. Present and future set parts are quite weak, and filled with stupid and ineligible elements. Undoubtedly the strong ones are horrible make-up and gor-effects, violent Valentina Vargas is a Danish and Pinehead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing some turmoil, is a marting villain. This is an aggressive idea for fans of Hellers, however, Pinhad should be defeated by a ridiculous discussion. Overall, "plasma" is not a complete disaster, but it is definitely an incomplete signal in a series that was brilliantly started. Even the director Kevin Yaho apparently felt embarrassed because he liked to give credit to Alan Smith. Overall, it's only recommendable for Pinhade-Phantics, and most of them are probably going to be annoyed by the loss of their favorite giant other. All others are advised to be the first to brighten, and to prevent the second part of the "heliester" franchisee and avoid all others. Makeup effects of "blood pressure" are as weird as hell, but almost everything is frustrating. My rating: 3.5 / 10
