I have 10 plus year-old computer games with special effects! Plots are sticky and very expected. Most actors seem to be overwhelmed with any experience! Everyone has a Scottish accent. It's like watching the crete of 'squats' from Star Trek without personality or charm. Uninterrupted view of people to install tents! Tent with all of the supposed high tech equipment! The camera was not sure about the actors they were looking for. If you live or you do not care! It looks like someone has made up the backyard and garage using less end equipment! Nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. Do not waste your time!
