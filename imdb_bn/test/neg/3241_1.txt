No sound can describe how terrible this film is. Like a director, it is literally a roll of film *************************************************************** ************************************************************************************************************ Bad In some stupid scenes, Akshay Kumar is a hologram (yes a hoogram), Akshay Kumar pulled a gun somewhere to carry a Bose in the city, Rajat Vedi was hit by a bad animated skeleton, Rajat Vedi and Siddhartha double sharp Monisha Korella (how they were direct to this Think?). Also I want to point out that animation is absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement when Kapal's motorbike and receives glasses. It seems to be shopping in Microsoft Paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are Sunny Deol. This makes people so powerful that he even feels God fear. In one scene, he literally opened a prison door and broke it. Chuck Norris' round-house has nothing! He is even so powerful, that he can go to London from India within 10 minutes! Overall, this movie is probably the worst movie in the universe. If you have watched it, it is for Hilariity which ensues throughout the watch (BTW is supposed to be serious in this movie)
