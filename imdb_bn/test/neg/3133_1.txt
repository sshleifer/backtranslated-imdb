Great. Another foreign film that I did not think. On top of this, we have to have more campaigns about killing people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why should I be involved in this small disguised orderly commercial advertisements? Some of this image was not found empty. Despite some hindrances, one can get rid of a man without courage. It does not have the courage to commit suicide. That's the action of a coward. He shares this "wish" with his wife simply because he inflicts with his same illness. Like the story of Jill Kimmant, despite his problems, if it was a movie about a man's courage, it made a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you are interested, check out the film about the former skier, Jill Kinmont, who was unable to ski after the accident.
