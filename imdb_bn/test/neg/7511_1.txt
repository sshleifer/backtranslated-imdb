I saw this movie in a movie-club in Germany in 1970. Most participants were teaching me from local private schools. I watched some of the guards before filming in France, and although they were not my favorites, at least I could understand them. Being able to speak French ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, for me, like movies, there must be a clear kind of films. This is not for me. I think I'm not in the film "no". Pictures still hunt me from the film. To this day, I refuse to eat rabbit meat I love for French. Those who saw the picture can understand why. Yes, came through the theme of materialism, but cancer, vandalism, and other scenes of destruction and fear made me sick. I'm sure I'm not sure when I'm out before I finish, but I certainly felt like this. I promised myself that I would never see a big film, and I never knew and never knew. <br /> <br /> My rating: None. It was the most hateful film I saw. Others may be more inefficient, stupid, or stupid. I have forgotten them, the scene of this scene will forever lose me.
