I'm just going to write more because it requires. However, the top-rated summary is very pronounceable for this movie. Most of you know who it is from the beginning. Despite the tactics of the plot and the 'talent' of activism, a twist is trying hard to find shock and despair, despite the efforts of 'talent' - you do not have to think 'hoodunat' in this mystery. <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more bad I think I have to write a lot for the comment, but the rules rule. I'm feeling really bad to say this, but I've always rated any movie rating ... I think. It makes me wonder what I'm saving the vote of 1 and 2. Anyway, I thought this picture deserves 3, because I believe there were some talent in the film. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a great job. She was crying and bored, and I thought she had given that emotion to him well. The actor who played the character of 'Drama' also did a good job for his little part. <br /> <br /> Many actors did a 'right' job. But the main actor, David's last name (terrible with the name) - was quite bad. I think he must be performing dramatically for 'The Young and the Best' or 'The Day of Live'. If you try, you can only take photos of the common lab coat, playing a doctor with multiple personalities in 'General Hospital'. It does not help that movie is even shot as Soap in the day. However, I'm sure I can shoot the same camera with this camera; Although obvious and without performing soap's word. <br /> <br /> For the first time I thought that the meaning of renting this movie was spoiled. However, I will not see it again, unless I pay a lot.
