If you asked me 1 month ago how I have probably gone to this movie, then when I come out with a fan and SuperFopers, I often visit the film site with any fan. The DVD was released and yes hooked up. It's a tough site to stay, but the good ones are usually like the good family they usually stay together. There are no stories of this company / comedy forces. On the street corners, universities, anywhere and anywhere they watch movies and after a few years they tremble on it to develop a great fan base and decide to turn off the websites that help them and are made for fans , But the worst thing about it .... They did not say anything to them. They just decided that they are better than us, they do not want new fans to go where they helped them ... you know the same fans that they had begun many years ago. Still smart crew, they released the best movie with super truppers and got everyone's attention and thank God for that, then they got mixed up with everything else. The way to good mainstream ways for you, just think that when you feel better in your material and that you have left any new devotees you are crapped to the original ones. The fan does not make you out of the other way. Never burn your bridge
