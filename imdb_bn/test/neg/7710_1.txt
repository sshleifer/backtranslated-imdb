Hello people, even where to start ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bending your back in the zombie, shooting on the chest and seeing that it does not work, they shot in the chest and some feel that a baby falls into a desk. W / blood coming out of his mouth is okay, walking like a football field is not wrong, suddenly, the Junkie football team is doing whatever anywhere in the middle of the field, it looks like they are not seen at that point. <br /> <br /> I could go for a few hours, but you will get points ... baby writing and dialog, bad directions, awesome special effects, really sad and persuasive tale (zombie infested campus, viral host Then lose it .... Twice), I can get the only plus that this one is not included in the actual game du clip "Action Scenes" color. <br /> <br /> ID says your money will be lost No Id be more bothered about minimal waste of time, I saw it on cable, and I would like to come back to life in 2 hours
