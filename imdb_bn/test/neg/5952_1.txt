I can not believe that I actually set up my season with 'season pass', apparently they had a good preview or something .. although I can not imagine it. About five minutes later I thought to myself ... why I see it .. It is not a reality, but I have seen the worst performance of television ever. I am the real addictive of reality TV and nothing is real about this. Acting .. (If you can call it) horror .. .. only 5% are decent people who only show the show of girls are meant to draw visitors .. although they will be very nice to save this train debris .. If they have more lines They probably will change my talent probably they have no talent. Apparently with very cheap 'actors' it is a very low budget production. There is no way they could get another job done. Someone can direct people to this food job. Perhaps they could do it. Oh and way, parake p. Eye. There is no other place in the Tijo or Teovo Season Pass list. Of course I've ever seen the worst show.
