Although I enjoyed Steve Carroll's work, Ivan is like the Almighty, much like the Overdodo movie, I hope he's got worse than him. <br /> <br /> It became a Chess family film, which uses the comedian famous for improving their image, but eventually failed to deliver them. <br /> <br /> Normal Carroll's Dirty Histress is almost absent from the movie, and although he bothered me several times, yet there was nothing about the sunny Ivan in his <br /> <br /> His 3 children , Although it was probably important for the character of the Bible, which was really meaningless in the film and the terrible actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Although Carroll's career may be profitable from this movie, there is no reason to see it. <br /> <br /> If her family is somewhat less, then more about Carroll, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL cast, it can actually be a lot more entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for some chocolate here and there.
