After all, I would like to say that generally I'm not usually a big fan of Wearoff movie. I do not like that I do not like them much. There is something I have enjoyed ... Wewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), an American Werewolf (1981, John Landes) in London ... and something that I think is OK but there is nothing special ... the wolf man Some examples are: 1941, George Wagner), The Hailing (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Troops (2002, Blue Marshal) ... But overall, the Wearoff sub-section is not my favorite. But this was one of my 50 movie sets, so I thought I gave it a watch and how it looked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> . Dr. Cameron discovered ways to transform humans into animals, especially wolves, but was ridiculed and mocked by the larger scientific community. Forced to a prestigious position, he takes revenge on those who ridicule him and plots him in his old country palace, where he lives with limited psychological skills his daughter Lanira (lovely Anna Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glen Strange). Using his serum, Dr. Cameron transformed Petro into a VeroPole and sent him to kill his old rival. Finally, Verobol lost control of Petro and both mad doctors and his creatures died. <br /> <br /> This photo played a little as a murder / crime drama, a journalist shooter of Lenora (Genie Downs), investigating the doctor's strange behavior and murder trap. The story seems to borrow many material from other big pictures that came before it. Reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) create a giant that drives Amok and kills an innocent child. Dr. Jail and Mr. Hyde's philosophy (1931, Robane Mammulian or 1941, Victor Fleming Edition) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Wagner) also thinks. And in my view this is one of the problems of the film - it has been added to the middle of some great films as a welding. It does not add more to the style. <br /> <br /> True, there are some redemption qualities. George Zucker's acting was convincing and Lorenzo showed that the misconceptions about his / her pain were good for me to show his madness. Some reasonable characters have been developed, at least in the case of their character. But Glenn Strange's character is not always credible and seems to be a humorous delusional or not, I'm not sure - it does not match the film completely. <br /> <br /> I like most of the IMDB users based on ratings of 4/10, but it still has the average movies below. If you are a fan of VeroLife movies or the 1940s horror films, you probably do not have the possibility of appealing.
