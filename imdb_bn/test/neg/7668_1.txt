This picture is an absolute dishonor! I enjoyed the main airport completely, and I can not believe how the same person can create this new year. First of all, acting is bad. The original actors had previously done quality (non-disaster) films, but it used an actor who already had a disaster film circuit (Blackley, Kennedy, Wagner). Also, George Kennedy's character Patroni appears to be very publicized. He now leads the film, but his character is not strong enough to carry it: he has lost the common and humor of the airport (1970), and the character is just boring now. Did I mention the plot? Is it trustworthy to send missiles after Concord? No !!! There are many loose ends; The plot has no relevance to the scene. The scene of the hot air balloon land on the runway, such as the scene of the thief at the Charles de Gaulle airport. Both could be interesting - if they were to do something with real stories. There are many unanswered questions: Why did Patroni open the window and set the fliers on another plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (There must be another stupid and costly way, why there is no investigation after the missile has been leaked at Concord? Why is the back direction so bad? (It seems that the cartoon follows the missile Concord, though it works well when the plane landed in Paris) Why Petroni thinks That he is on a flight simulator? (When he takes Concorde) why the passengers are afraid of the cabin Nobody welcomes the hero, if he ends up so poor, if he can not say it at the end, no one who has given him a one-dimensional consequence does not notice it. The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coaches, the person who is playing the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with bladder problems Only simple silly scenes where Susan Blakley is on the roof of her maintenance, and when Wagner says that he still loves her, she is very horrified. In conclusion, this film should have been finalized of previ three airport films: instead it is a stupid, subtle, time-consuming, money, power, celluloid and "genius" totally stupid waste! !!!!!! When Patroni asked the French pilot, "Has he ever fallen on his stomach?" This film certainly flatulence on the stomach floor, and its pointy nose flat ...
