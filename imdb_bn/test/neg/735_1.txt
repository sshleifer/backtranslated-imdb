Terrible, awesome, terrible The actor is bad, the music is ridiculous and the painting is kind. I rent the DVD and ultimately had to force myself to see it. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Read this book, it's great and you should not have these stupid photos and ridiculous dreams are catherine. <br /> <br /> I think I did not see such a bad movie.
