This is one of the most ridiculous bad films I've ever seen. I was not serious about anyone who wrote the above review. Probably he was connected with making it. It's not going for anything. No doubt, acting hard, direction is hopeless. Music score (?) Is playing three trite notes ad nauseam. The plot (?) Will take five minutes to write. When asked for a homework project, a 10-year-old dialogue is what will be the dialogue. The only (little) freedom fighter actress is acting herself, who is grimace, trembling and sipping well and thus sometimes fun. The only reason for the edge of your seat was that you were suffering from weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
