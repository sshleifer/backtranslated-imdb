This movie is on the level of "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" which always hit the garbage screen. If this person does not belong to Adam Sandler's gay friends, then the end of the script should end where it should end: something big like a toilet paper in the movie Exec. I hate this movie, it wants me to hurt people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly I will take a step forward. 2. When I logged into IMDb and the trash pieces actually saw this movie rating 6.9, it was a sad part. This is a rule of all obstacles in our society which will see horror movies which are only a few and a half hours in which Dick, Fert, and weed joke have little to no originality. After watching this rating, I want to tell everyone "Tyler Perry House of Pains" to enjoy this movie. You'll see some high quality humor on the same level of these hateful hate.
