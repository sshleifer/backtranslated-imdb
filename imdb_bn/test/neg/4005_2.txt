I had really good production value in this movie. Lack of acting, I think it should be marked as a primary document. It may have got no money to make it. I feel bad that Jackie Robinson had a rough side in the Major League. <br /> <br /> I believe he is much better than the white players of his day. He will be really great to break the color barrier during the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They might be interested in this project Actors can be limited by quality. Maybe no money to get good people
