I did not expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It is supposed to be a comedy, but I actually laughed where only four or five scenes, and I think that rather poor. There is no real plot here, I always thought that any scenes can be kept in the movies because there is no connection between them. But the worst thing was Kim Frank's "acting". During the whole film, she faces her face, as if she wanted to play some annoyed guy, but I believe that it is not a matter. I gave four ratios to everyone, I saw a bad movie, but I will not spend this money again.
