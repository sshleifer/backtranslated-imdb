You know, one day the boys were sitting around the office and said, "How can we earn more money?" They have made every possible transition of toys that could make them with their current character. So they decide, let's steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, a preview, and we can create all new characters and sell them as toys. Eventually they did something of the puppet master 3, but who care? Since they chose a point before the first movie, when Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls roam and roam under a wooden head and the doll wants to know whether it is a dead family member or something. Does not matter. So the puppet master's descendant story begins. It's long, it's annoying, does not keep an eye on a body. The most interesting part, they encourage the source of these new characters in the film, but they do not give any source of luck. So, once the earnings from new toys are closed, they can collect the new (and the fourth straight road) successive series, which is said to be "Seal in the fate of the puppet master 8 deck retro doll!" Keep breath!
