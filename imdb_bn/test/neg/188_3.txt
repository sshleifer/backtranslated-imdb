Lucios Camadas Burgen is like an early Victorian beauty, Shaun Conanie is a devil desert kidnapped! How can you make a mistake? How? Oh, count me the way !!! Earthy, primitive Shan Connery, a fragile, elegant beauty suppression like Candace is just right people. . . Well, underwhelming the role. Because, instead of talking about the real things ("You are a woman, I am a man!"), She must make a fool about "God's will" and "the wind will send fate around the desert." "Nine male organizations and John Milies, one of the more familiarly known for the brutal military worship, is a great way to overcome the lovers of her desert, such as candles can kiss, because of any insight (or interest) within the human relations. Nature observation Instead of a beautiful landscape scene with two superb people T is taken, we are endlessly treated, and Brian Keith's variants thrive in his Waller-shaped helicopters and give ridiculous speeches to Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but check out his new rifle, or see the heroic death of a big beer Seeing the lecture, because love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery is the same It does not excite me in the screen ... If it really goes on, it's strange that Millionaire makes the most of the character and story line, which has no solution, two small children in Kandes have got more screen time than they did in the desert. There is no comedy in the incident, there is no chemistry, there is no blur. Unless you think that it is a few weeks of traveling around the horse's horse, her hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sleep a word on soft cushion and said, "We will flee." The little girl got face-to-face, a beetle was missing, replied, "But mother, I was sleeping!" That's what one line up story really is missing from. No hazards, suspense, or original story lines, sizzle in a peasant lady among the captives. He (and his children) both are so grateful and careful that nobody believes in his work about his fate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If he is excused from his crime about the captivity of his captivity (or he is happy with Shan Connor's surgery) and his abduction, the story raises some tension. But Milius has created this strange idea that the audience did exactly what he did, and Tedy Roosevelt worked on whether he would get the opportunity to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. Finally, the beautiful lady and her children do not think her insulted. . . And since they are in the center of the story so the whole thing looks rather dry and endless. . . Like the burning sands of burning.
