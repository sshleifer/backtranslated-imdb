I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual shit a few years ago, and it is now a return to the local film club. It probably uses each of the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (initialized version) to appear as an intellectual, perhaps the director might think himself. You get your run-of-the-mill slow motion, brown colored scales, slow pans, blanks, facial expressions through bombarded environments, excessive symbolic imagery, and the necessary tragic ends. <br /> <br /> This is a complete failure, usually an uncanny perfect characteristic of Russian art films. Director, Alexander Sokurov, has excellent command of technology, but he lacks the eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This movie is a Sokurov.
