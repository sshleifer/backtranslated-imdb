*** SPEAKER ALERTS *** New year has discrete and confusing fiery drama that has a terrible plan to burn a major vacation resort before the day. Following the Blue Mountains Valley View Estates in Australia, the man is determined to burn his project in the fire to collect Julian Fen, Guy Dalman, who is insured for ten million dollars. This project has to happen before January 1 January, before the end of the insurance policy. <br /> <br /> With the mind of his work maker and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Schert has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, plans to burn his building resort and is probably planning to set him up as a guy. Anderson became somewhat suspicious when the insurance investigator Sophie McCann, Wondi Hughes Fen and the insurance company told him about some of the harmful steps in the glory alliance. It proves that the proud aliens are actually owned, or 60% by Fen himself! It has been explained that these firefighters of Fai Fen are being used to collect insurance of $ 10 million, which are at least twice the value of the entire Valley View estates. <br /> <br /> We were later killed in a blank swim crash to find out what was happening to the suspected fries surrounding the Sophie McCann Valley View Estates. Lloyd's Iron Glory Alliance's London-based insurance writer George Engels James Mason has shown that Fenne keeps his own aggressor under control and keeps him under control. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Anderson has both been acquainted with Fen and in England, less than the ones who do not want to clear the Valley views estates, just like the fan, it can be understood only by the writer and the director within the last few seconds of the movie. Anderson was going to his girlfriend, when he was coming to rescue Anderson. We got this wildlife scene with the help of Hawaii Anderson, as well as the wildlife scene in the site of the construction of the Valley View, where the fire was flowing on the crest when it came to the office of fire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was such that the fan was Scottish-free and only his orthopedic and fragile Hechenmann, the arsonist, who was merely instrumental in the crimes of Fenne, was the only person who paid them.
