Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Canineball Holocaust is a citizen. Uninterrupted acting, disastrous dialogue, half-baked plot and its companion piece are actually much more in the way of the animal carnage, which was actually done. Contrary to Holocaust, Farx is a straight forward film. It is not posed to be an incognito documentary. The movie is very sharp and crisp compared to the Holocaust grains, which helps in production. Unfortunately, we are again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the locals and basically bring them what they get. There is really nothing in this movie that makes your time valuable. I was fairly noticeable about my review of Holocaust due to actual attempts in the statement and style, but there is no reason to look after it in the case of the phyrks, until you only move away from blood and beef.
