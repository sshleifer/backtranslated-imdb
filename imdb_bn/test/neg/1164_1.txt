This is the worst movie I've ever seen and believe I've sen many bad movies. I love cheeesy horror but this was just terrible. There was not a scene in this movie where I was scared. All actors would have been available at a bus stop 20 minutes before they were shot. I want to give my 99 cents back to Blockbuster. Acting was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Before the liberation war, someone showed the film screen and knew that it was terrible. I would be embarrassed to add my name with this monstrosity. Do not hire this movie. If you do so, do not bring it back so that another poor soul can never forget the mistake of renting it.
