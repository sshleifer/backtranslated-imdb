It's a long time ago I would have seen such a bad movie. I need to say that making a good and / or realistic movie about wind disaster is really difficult, but this film was a waste of time and money. I also think that this is an unauthorized way that is trying to achieve bad reputation in Airbus. First, the cockpit is very much like airbus copypiece, the second you got a stick, the third one uses the computer to control the radar / elevator / allele with "wire fly". When I watched this movie, I thought the film was aimed at using Boeing if it was not able to fly on computerized airplanes like Airbus, instead they have a direct connection to the steering and the radar. Say: Bad Story, Horror Acting Most actors), the worst movie comedy ...
