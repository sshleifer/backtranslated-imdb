I can not believe anyone who is giving this picture a better rating. Without terrible acting, slim (undetermined?) Intrigue line and slooooooooooow motion, this movie will be seen whether you are really trying to sleep. The authors and directors of the brain must have ever fried the eggs that have been concocted to something as abominable as this. Based on plot summary for DVD cases, the premises are really promising. But in the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you really want to see that Area 51 idea is taken, see the re-creation of "the eyes of the hills". The dreamland will soon be pale away as all the kind of beautiful films. Next !!!
