I was ready for a bad movie, and it's a bad movie, so I think I should not complain. TwentySomething Tom (son poster boy Robert Stadlberg) is so much of a problem that he is coming or is it going. I did not live for beautiful girls: Sirius Mavi (Anna Brugman); No-nosense angie (Emma Daubus); Sarah Bowman as the star of the movie! And then there is Tom's soul mate, wild eyelid Margarete (John Pallaske). He reminded me of Betrice Dal and Gina Garson. If you have to remember, these fine memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I mean ridiculous, by Berlin standards. I'm surprised when I liked this movie when I was a child of age. I guess I would not have. Look at the Idi statue of Olive School and Max Schroeder, "Do not Hand Marie" starred as street musician, does not feel any pain.
