A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film Theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. The theorist wrote that the 'strong women' power played 'Rajji' and stood up for their people (although they did not even value it). <br /> <br /> I thought <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , And the married white boy gradually pale. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, no matter why Russ Russell tries, this film can not really disguise a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. In addition to its repetitive class and gender politics, the old black and white films seem relatively comparatively revolutionary.
