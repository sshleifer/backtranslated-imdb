All right, first I want to say that it was made by a limited budgeted friend. With that feeling, it should not really compare the features of Blockbuster and my rating will be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving this opportunity, it still violates the rules of making some basic films that both viewers and amateur directors have crashed me. Think <br />: Blair Witch is a car but is actually boring. Think of it: Think you have dropped your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded it in the park at night, recorded yourself one hour, then your friends see it. <br /> <br /> The most horrible part (possible spirit alert ... if the spying is possible here), then the image gets rewinded at one moment and you can think that you have to see it all again. SARYARY <br /> <br /> On one side of the ciline, it's a beautiful idea to go for a low budget - a movie-tonight movie. But the idea is to run a fine line between really good and really bad, and just say it was not really good. There was only a lot of part where nothing happened. At first I thought that the director was planning - you were frustrated in the sense of security and then really scary things should start happening. But ... no. <br /> <br /> I tried to find the best thing to say about it (and there was plenty of time for me to remember), and I would say the music was cool. And I would really give female lead credit for really standing up to myself, fearing for a long time. But that's it. Acting actor of "infected" people seemed to be joking about zombie films. Or they got their motivation from the bug wearing the "MIG" from his adgroup suit. Chances are, if you are looking for some strange reason to watch this movie then it is on DVD or Tevot, so when you are waiting for something to do, it can proceed quickly. <br /> <br /> I hate to be a bit critical, but at the same time I saw many similar movies and these were never painful. It could be appropriate if they cut half of it and add some scary stuff. Maybe that director will be cutting ...
