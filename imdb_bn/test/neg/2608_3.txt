It was a moment, but overall when I saw this cartoon as a child, I was annoyed with my mind. The only thing I had to show was that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime It's one of my least favorite anime, I remember another that in space there is a huge ship that was not created in any sense, but it was more enjoyable because of the places it was. I remember these people with clothes like birds, which were a little weird, but were even more entertaining. I really do not like the car racing, although not yet and still not that I did not see any reason for this show, although today I'm a warm animated fan. Characters were also somewhat overwhelming and then there were horrible scenes where there was practically no action which was probably used to cut animation costs and pad the show. The gadget in the car was cool though and then provided some entertainment for me. Overall, I think this program is new animate and rather unexpected than in some era, but this is just a personal opinion. I'm sure many other critics love cool shows.
