Zeoy101 ?? Actually, it would be one of the most silly efforts to attract the attention of people of my age. It is about some preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends that attend boarding school. Annoying !!! She does all what ever whine and complains and works like a spoiled donkey. I think this show came in 2005, I was 13 years old, even then I thought it was in vain. The only part I liked when the boys hid a camera in girls' kid's hide. That's it. Anyway, I do not understand why Nickel-Oh my bad-friend feels sorry for this "sorry" sympathetic to the need to syndicate this poor excuse. This decade is becoming a joke severe every year and it gets worse and worse. What's with this generation? <br /> <br /> However, RIP Nikloding 1979-1998? / 2005?
