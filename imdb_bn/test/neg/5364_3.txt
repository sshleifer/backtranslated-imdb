So this show first came when I love unusual fan and I love ghost hunters I decided to try it. I can barely sit through one episode. The show is so obviously obvious. I mean, a giant power is involved in trying to kill someone or kill the family in every single episode. Another big mistake is that these guys have never ruined a bit. When I see Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to oppose it, and if they do not, then it is a proof. At this show they find a part of a voice or video evidence and they are quick to call it a ghost It completely destroys their credibility unlike the TAPS and Ghost Hunters who are actually doing what they are doing. Sincerely you are interested in unusual and want to see a show ghost hunters watch about it.
