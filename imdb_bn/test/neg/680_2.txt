The director looks good, difficult people. We all have problems with the same problem of their parents. They strayed from each other. They like each other. They misunderstand each other. And among the most annoying families out of Long Island, probably the poor listeners have to sit through one minute or so. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting choices in this documentary - the music is inactive, the filming is fuzzy, and the story is the same story that plays in every street in every American city. I do not mean very harsh words - Seldom a sweet, well-motivated documentary has been made. Director is such a person with whom you want to be a friend. You just wanted to strive as many of the material he presented as keeping his parents alive their marriage.
