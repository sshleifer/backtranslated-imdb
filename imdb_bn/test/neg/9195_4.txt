As far as I respect the firefighters for them. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. Acting was okay but Jacqueline Phoenix had a poor casting choice to say the least. <br /> <br /> I was most annoyed about this picture which was the beginning of the worst movie. Direction and continuity was very bad! <br /> <br /> ** Spinner ** For example, after the Phoenix character read several stories and seriously injured, he can simply move his captain to speak on the radio. Then, miraculously, he managed to crawl across a huge space covered by huge pieces of leakage and fire, using only one long-length piece to open a multi-scale intuitive wall ???? <br /> <br /> Anyone noticed that throughout the film, whenever you look at Jockeys' shots and rescue people, there is little or no building smoke. I think the smoke should be very thick inside the fire wood. <br /> <br /> I was tired of the search and rescue team, "I need some tools here !!!". <Br /> <br /> I really thought I would enjoy this picture but I found it a weak attempt to represent the true life of a firefighter. The intention was but I honestly believe that this picture can be so good. I could not imagine that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with the film and he was willing to keep it in the theater. It should be spent more time editing and should ensure that the film has a good flow. <br /> <br /> The special effects of some scenes were great, but frustrating among others and almost ridiculous. Jerry Brookhammer is like a movie <br /> <br /> Please criticize me but I can not see such a big deal about this movie. At least it was not as bad as "The Who Ten Years", which in recent months was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I really hope there's no leather 50!
