This movie is very disappointing to read the book. Rafael Sabatini wrote that it was a clear cut story in the Caribbean piracy and it created a huge speed. Also, it has been very easy to do All actions take place on ships and a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screen writer took the title from Sabatini and dropped the rest of the book. Even the name of the main character was changed and his screen personality was completely different from the person described in the novel. It's a tragic loss for those who love a good sea story.
