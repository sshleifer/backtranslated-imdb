This movie is, at least, overrated for speaking. It's not as good as a comedy and it's not as good as a "serious" movie. Pacing is very sedentary for the past, and there is too much hair slapstick for the next. Some original smiles of Bid Spencer's response shots become incomplete by his brother's behavior. Dubbing nice but full-screen framing is great. (* 1/2)
