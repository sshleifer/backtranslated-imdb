If you like the soap series you can choose this movie. I recommend this movie to Dutch Soap-series fans like GSTS, WestenWind or even America's Stuff the Bold and the Beautiful. If you do not like that stuff: stay away from this movie. It is the same quality of visual style, acting, direction and writing. The film was a big hit in the home area, but was not sold anywhere outside of Holland and Belgium. It is quite strange for such commercial movies. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's something ...
