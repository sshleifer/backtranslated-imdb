Appreciating Steven Sigal's intentions, and his performance in this movie is similar to many of his other, if you ignore that he thinks he is a brilliant scientist. My problem was with the two items in the plot, which led to the suspension of suspicion beyond my isolation point. <br /> <br /> First of all, how carefully the engineering changes on a dirty antibody, whose germity must be, such as carefully researched and engineered by a large lab, high growth of the mountain is cured by drinking tea from a flower? And the grandfather family only knows something about who knows something about this? <br /> <br /> Second, and it really takes a cake: collecting enough symptoms to correct the whole city, do you expect that the army will grab this helicopter and throw a flower bag in all the small townships? No, instead they decided to split flowers across the city and force the sick to leave and gather them again. Due to the belief that at least on the basis of atheist belief, the power of the drug depends on one person and the flowers are gathered on its own. <br /> <br /> Add to the nature and title of the villain cardboard and you may think that my vote in this movie is actually high.
