Silver City (2+ over 5 stars) For many years, I feel safe as a big fan of John Salais's work that it is the worst movie. That said, the movie is just * terrible * ... just too uncertain. Cylops throws in the familiar elements from his previous films (known anti-corruption, illegal immigration, sold outside collective ideology) but fail to unite them in a new or meaningful way. Even the conversations (usually the strongest point of the syles) are frustrating around this time. Clich√©d sounds and almost every scene is bound. The movie sounds like a episode from a TV series and it did not make it before the third season. There are lots of stars in hand ... and they try their best to make their bit parts alive ... but this time the object is not right at this time. During a filming of a campaign a governor-optimist (a poor and obvious George W. Bush stand-in) is a dead body fish from a lake. An investigator who is deliberately hired to try and alert people who may set up to disrespect the candidate ... but soon discovered that there was more deep and dark (and more hidden) hidden information discovered. Psyche's past-themed movies have done much better in the past ("Lone Star", "Matwan", "Sequence Seven Return", "Men with guns"). It is embarrassing that he once went very well and came with some water. A good line delivered by Richard Dreyfas: "Danny, you've lost, it's already out of doubt. So try and be good, okay?"
