The prize is interesting and Cast can do it best, but the script and director efforts are so poor that it is no surprise that the film was buried - which is suitable for the screenplay. I saw it, I could not determine which bad, screenplay, or direction. Actors are at the top, the industry is like a Disney movie, music is safe, and the feeling is so sweet that it gives visitors a cavity. It is a bad attempt to imitate "wrong marriage and a funeral". If anyone wants to see a comedy with pancakes as a pancake and how the poor side can turn the story of the cessation of cavity, it is good to see.
