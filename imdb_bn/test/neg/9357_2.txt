I was tired of this movie. I was walking twice because the movie segment was so flexible and depressing. The film contains elements of things in the sea (pornography, murder, suicide, adultery, hatred, gang war). The graphic nature of violence in this movie was particularly annoying. The LDS Church has done great misbehavior by expressing loyalty as a missionary attitude, commitment, spirituality and neglected and unconditional. <Br <br /> <br /> I had the biggest objection to this movie, it is the exact opposite of a good movie. <br /> <br /> The army of God of Duchar was right. His Briseman City was pretty good. This film was best for casting, casting, acting, and drama. But in spite of being inspired or raised, it was awful. Actually, this movie has so much spoiled that I'm sorry, I went. With the purchase of tickets I lost interest again to support Duchess in the LDS-themed movie.
