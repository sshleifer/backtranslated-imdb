Jeff Powerse (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a policeman with the abusive history of criminals, was assigned to an Elite Secret LAPD department. Jeff is not sitting well with newspaper reporter girlfriend, Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a story in the team. Soon Jeff's conscience makes him better that he disagrees with Dan Von (Scott Glenn, "Hunt for Red October" and "Backdrop"), the leader of the unit. <br /> <br /> I dare not be surprised that a cookie-cutter plot, which is a rough routine, brave, cop-action / drama that can be dared to point to Point B from point to point. It's OK to act as the acting actors. But there is no real reason to see the film. Six previous Mark came. There was a very sad recreational car to look like six previous Mark Linters of this film in Leicester (Class 1 of 1984, Class of Little Toked to Little Tokyo). <br /> <br /> Candy: Chelsea Field is briefly helpless <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
