Lina MacLeodle is a bright, single young woman who falls in love with an unexpected love for Eugget, a highly qualified Bachelor with a tendency to earn money. They get married, but almost once the person's addiction is thrown into lies, gambling and debt. Despite his flaws, he can not resist his charming approach, until he suspects that he may think of killing him. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, beautiful, interesting cast, a good script and probably the single lousiest in movie history to end. OK, that's probably going too far, but not by many. Many films change a book (Great Exhibitions, The Shining etc.), but the last two scenes do not turn out to be very scary hair, but the entire previous plot completely makes sense. This story is about a woman, whose husband is guided by her greed and moral deficiency - and for what she knows - to kill him. It should end (like reading the book before Francis Isles / Anthony Berkeley) and tried to kill him. The studio does not force the hitch to be restored, because the first example of the positive list of preview listeners is. Hit Connie and what she was told was done (this was Hollywood's only third film), knowing that if she plays this game, sooner or later she will get creative control of her movies, which she was published by the best artwork of fifty. But that still left us with a turkey in the end. It's a shame because it's a really cool movie about a really cool theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife? The script is excellent, with a lot of off-riding moments (like when Lina's father dies and Johnny thinks he is crying about it), Grant's (who has not played a villain) and done a fine-tuned performance across fine photography, the famous Glass of Milk shots. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally I liked his confusion and weaknesses in the role of wife before her in Rebecca. I want to give this movie a high rate, but I can not really finish it; When movies are created for money, it is not love, which I guess, that's the theme of the movie oddly. Quick view for Hitachi's Cinema as a post post as a man.
