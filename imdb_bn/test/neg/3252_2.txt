This image should not have been made! It's bad, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Begin to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is certainly not Rodney Dangerfield. Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who was essential for the first film with Danzerfeld. It seems that all three of them (s) knew a script stigger when they saw it. Chen Chase, who did not get good ideas for going out of it, was stuck around but in my opinion it was exotic for both films. This picture is quite simply not fun. No it has any other favorite qualities. This thing relies heavily on anti-semitism to work and it works to do harm. I hate this thing. All the time a waste.
