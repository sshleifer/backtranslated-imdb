I just saw a terrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A critics of four Ward Film Review (www.fwfr.com) wrote it, "Jajjajjaj from A." This story is about the English colonial quarrel that comes to Malaysia for "civilization civilization" and ends with falling in love with its sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a local Malaysian prostitution which is spontaneous in English, serving English colonists and teaching them their native language to come back ... The good movie never makes it clear, but I can only give her money or something. Not saying, the film works much more attention in the "sleeping" part than the "dictionary" part of the description of Job Description. Things for our young heroes become complicated when the forbidden love relationship integrates its culture, its soap opera by domestic situation, and its complete unimaginable stupidity to any major decision-making across the film. So yes, the film has some big flaws, but on the other hand, it's the first two things I've hired for: a beautiful photography exterior location and more beautiful pictures that carry the sleeping language and exotic ladies, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this painful movie was his best and most remarkable of him. She is not a great actress, and has not passed completely for Malaysia, and it is obvious that she uses double nudity twice, but who carries? Jessica Ela is more like a rare face and an image that is not only sexy, but Vividly Violin concert or Rembrandt painting is as beautiful <br /> <br /> (PS forgives all your feminists who frustrate women objectifying, "male sight, etc .., but I hope you understand that I mean no insult.)
