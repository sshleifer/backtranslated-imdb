I am deeply disturbed by some posts I'm reading on the message board for this post, people say it's actually a good movie! This movie is not a good movie in the Ubay Bolle seratum today, there is no way hell in it! Far Cree played a poorly played, poor direction, and a clichéd mess full of an uninspired story with a cruel script. This is the first pure action movie of the Bowle, and news flash people, action movies are not very difficult because the basic steps you want to make are the explosion and gunfight around an explosive plot, and hey Mr. Boll has been successful. That's doing. House of the Dead, Allen in the Dark and Bloodline, all the horrific games adapted to Bowle films are far worse (they do not have any redemption qualities). Far Cry Two things that make it the best: Two good leads and well-ordered action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Waghier is a strong female lead. Usually great Udo Kier clichéd villain throw passable and supporter as bad is quite bad. At the end of the film, there was a series of continuous series of surprisingly exciting series that appeared as a shock considering the camera behind the bowl. Unfortunately, the rest of the film seems incredibly cheap, bad CGI, lame one liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst lead to a sexual scene is I think I have never seen the scene. Only two people are not familiar with each other for six hours, but what they need to do to keep the army warm in the army by kissing their fellow soldiers. She just told her to stop her clothes. Then he took her off and climbed in bed because she was afraid of the phthalithia. However, in short, it is a bad movie. It's a stupid action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are completely annoyed. Someone might make it popping and making it worse than watching, but I personally want to see classic action films like Die Hard or Pride, and stay away from this derivative mess. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
