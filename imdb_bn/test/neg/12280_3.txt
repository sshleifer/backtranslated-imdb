Basically two good guys in the plotless action film (Fong and Roundtree) stand against two bad boys (Mitchell and Pierce). Perhaps the most inspiring step in the 80's, probably the small part of the roundtree, much shouting from his "shaft" day and Cameron Mitchell added another shameful role in his career, to sit next to his ridiculous celebration "Kill the toolbox" (this person once He was a respected actor, now he is complaining about wearing his hair and bleeding his carpet) Stack Pierce friend works with some dignity. As for violence, do not worry: It's too bad most of the blame. (* 1/2)
