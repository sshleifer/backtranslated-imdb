Some dark and windy night, fog from the coast, doubt and doubt, two brothers who hate hatred, suspicious disappearance, night shoes silently wash a burning cigarette butt and ultimately have a mysterious connection. , A scandalous heroine who has threatened a lot of self-doubt - but which one? - Men around him. Words like we could have a good 80 minutes silent Instead, with Vincent's mineralel and two A-list Leads, Catherine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Underwire, has become almost two-hour Metini MelloDroma, long-standing threats in perfectly decorated, dressed and cast casts. When you watch your watch halfway through a movie and see with a drowning heart that you have to go for an hour, there is a problem between you and the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mineral does not reveal on the basis of Rococ Hawthouse method in one of his first non-musical films, as he knew later. Yet, it is basically a simple story of greed, murder, and emotion that becomes an endless Catherine Hepburn car. Hepburn cautions carefully how to show our care, love, concern, seriousness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terrorism. Robert Taylor is more or less along the road. <br /> <br /> The Hipburn movie begins with Tombs Anne Hamilton, a young woman with despair, who helped her father with her father. Their maid is determined to get her married. When Dr. Hamilton decided to sell Alana Garrow (Robert Taylor) an important formula, it fell in love with the first look. Garroway Garroway Distance Controller is smooth, handsome, dynamic inventor, which was vital to the war, and which has turned him into a tough charging millionaire manufacturer. He called the captain of the industry, one of his many Washington friends.

She learns quickly and eagerly. They are both definitely and happy in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. Fork is almost gnaw. Ann understands that she does not know anything about her husband's family. His employees or friends seem to be prone to talk about him. When she learns that Allan's mother was sitting in the piano on the pyonate, or had died in an old family in Middleburgh's house, or her brother Michael, who had disappeared, Allan became very quiet ... and sometimes got angry. He always apologizes. But wait a second time. Did her mother really play the piano? He really did not die in bed? Did Michael not get the money from the family firm and Alan sent him? Against these fine hotel suites, horse-stabilized and home-fed farmland homes are home to middle-class manicured countries. Everyone else in the movie except the workers dress up. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black-white picture, Mineralie can not help but our crystal and china can provide dining tables with delicious and elegant furniture and lots of gowns. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, when everyone is finally known, when the horse is riding on a horse with a high horse, then the other side of the horse is followed by a well-planned mountain path, when he is threatened with boulders and Death by its followers eventually died by horses, it is a relief. Even Michael Actor Robert Mitcheon is unable to bring many excitement to the film. There may be a small B-movie in the lower hand, instead of it a list is just an exaggerated melody, very big for its bones.
