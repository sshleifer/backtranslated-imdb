I could read that Darwin was an important experience in Galapagos Islands, where there he saw a wide range of living organisms, and wrote the intermediate theory of evolution. Not according to this movie - it was inspired in British countryside. All right, and John Stays would say - OK. I do not think Darwin was a deep personal conflict and a person suffering from dark resurrection and suffering. According to this picture he was. Sadly, he apparently got sick of his daughter by becoming ill, but I do not think he would consider losing his family members, which would have an impact on the scientific skills of the people. Well, not according to ... you get the picture. I think science is not even worse than being advertised, and in some cases the film seems to have tried to disappoint the theory of evolution, it seems that it came from a person who was emotionally unstable, which is just plain to me. I was in the spirit of Charles Darwin scientific investigation, calm and quiet, and always reasonable thinking. This film has made a dramatic drama and sensitized the scientific quest for clear leadership. It's like a Canterbury Tail. I will not recommend it.
