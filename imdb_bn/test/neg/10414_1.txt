I attracted this picture by the line of his offbeat, low-key, real life story. That is, a prominent man from the Big Bose flopped back to his father's house with more floppy brothers. It might just have been a problem but there is a problem. And the name of the problem is KC Afilek. <br /> <br /> The cats around the Casey Affleck in this picture. His acting mantra "must always be done as little effort as possible". Or "Why can you mutter when you speak?" Or maybe "Camera rolls as soon as you keep yourself in a coma". Talking to the lips while moving? Barely Facial expression? None. Facial muscle? Helpless Something? There is nothing. Something? Zip
