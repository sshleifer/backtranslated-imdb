In the late half of 1987, I stayed in London for three months while the show was in the air for almost two years. It was an ongoing joke. <br /> <br /> Why? Because it was an all-white cast. In the first few years each cast member and was extra white. <br /> <br /> Where I stayed on the street, there were more than 800 houses and my best knowledge was that I was only three or four white faces in that street. We were in the corner of the Indian and Turkish "quadrilateral" and even if you excluded those two nations, then the Asian and Afro-Caribbean exorbitant 22 white people. Plus, of course there are very few white people who lived in this area, most of them were Scott - the word "cocaine" was never heard. <br /> <br /> It was not racist rant, a simple statement of truth. Before writing this soap to the BBC, their research could not be bored to cross London, otherwise they were found only white actors and decided to delete it. <br /> <br /> As I say, the eastern end is the end, we are considered as a comedy show. :-)
