The-on-number, Oscar-hungry live, late singer Ray Charles. There is one - just one - great scene in * ray *. This happened during the flashback of Charles Young after the boys became completely blind. The sharecropper entered the house, which he shared with his mother, he was roaming around the chair and spreading on the floor. She cries out for her mother; He should make a person "stand on his own feet" with his philosophy, quietly observing the kitchen and watching the boy, waiting to see if the boy can return to his own property. The boys are proven to challenge that using a hairstyle and a memory of a stove kettle, a nearby fireplace, grass grass in the house outside the house, a blurred cricket glove across the plaque board. Floor. <br /> <br /> The movie pauses here; It is wide; Breathe it - even if for 40 seconds. The scene is a lot more important than Taylor's Hackford, I do not mention music by "Shrigol", which is certainly excellent. I'm referring to sound effects (big bombs, before any other flashbacks) and inactive dialog ("I'm telling you friend, rays," etc.). On the visual side, Hackford blooms evenly and vainly: sepia-colored filters on camera lenses during flashbacks; Camera-crane, etc., all the virtual advantages of virtual-dwesh 360 * What is a horrible cinematic style * Ra *! - In the last decade or more "important" films (Storichus * Aviator * stylistically similar to this movie), a style is always common. This hostage is employed in clich√©-ridden screenplay obfuscate. Some of us will not be fooled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please, Foxx is similar to Ray Ray Charles: Charles, Charles , And Charles, like Twiesch's Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not displeasing Mr. Fox with the Oscars; He deserves it. (Since this was a very weak field this year, anyway.) But if Fox could really understand Charles, it's a wonderful one. Actor has achieved a great moment when he strongly advises to try a memorial that is shooting his band-mate: He only expresses dissatisfaction with the life of the blind and dark because of a brief moment. It seems that, among Charles, music wants to make the struggle between Charles in the midst of bright release and heroin abolition, with the blindness of the battlefield between these two obligations. But the great movie will not take time: it swims in victory with victory, sometimes does not pause for any insight in humans. There is a stretch to find a dramatic tension; One must provide drama for the movie. One, in other words, has to imagine such a good movie. <br /> <br /> Running towards a glorious conclusion, * Ray * presented a number of excellent ideas for a movie, then on its first day: "Chitlin Circuit"; Her brave musical inventions for the Atlantic label; Heroin problems in heroin; Inevitable artistic relative compromise on unavoidable success; The importance of human rights towards civil rights struggle (touching this film, oh, about 3 minutes of screen time), and more. The filmmakers are very lazy to focus on any of these elements. After two and a half hours to overcome a person overwhelmingly we may like others, but this type of film is not a great act of art. This type of approach does not provide deep insight into the subject matter of the film - and insight should not be the real goal of a film? If I wanted Ray Charles's laundry list, I would have just made him Google. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars - for extra 2 star songs strictly.
