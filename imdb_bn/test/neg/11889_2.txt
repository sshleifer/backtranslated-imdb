This film has so little IMDb ratings that are not surprising. In Annan's post, do we really need a reminder of America's emotional attachment to religion? The subject has been so politically charged that viewers will not be entertained by such films only, but they will only respond secretly. Without digging the DVD, I could sit quietly with thousands of pieces of this cinematic memorabilia of corporate corruption. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Makes the film suitable. In "Purpose", I did not get any meaningful message. What I found was a story that embodied the capitalist power and material traits of wealth. Two main characters, disturbed in their gloves, do very little real work. Instead, they team up, they play golf, they avoid their coolness, they make the word "hip" directly through the MTV-culture dialogue: "Make my world rock", and "come back to the party; it's an order" John smug, self-important, shallow, and a lot of smirks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And on this occasion Barbie doll pups are held on hand when the future of the millionaires needs some rest after this heavy duty partnership. And with the need for time-bound images and conversations such as a story, you can imagine how the film will be fifteen years? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The film was a lot more enjoyable, much more entertaining, if they had called those weird characters and the annoying story, and only for the time of film, only the viewers of the little flat areas were flown out.
