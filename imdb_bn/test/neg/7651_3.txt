When my parents rented this movie, I was hoping for a very funny movie because Randy Quayed is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not all funny and it's a bit annoying. You can see the surprises coming a mile away and it is long run for a movie, which is supposed to be only eight minutes long. So I can honestly say that this is not a movie that is not in my favorite list. It can work for some people, but it does not work with me, but with slow build-up, it proves that it makes me busy in the whole movie. Randy Coed has been lost and the rest cast is a list of very fancy actors and actresses. There was a feasibility similar to welding in the context of the film, but all of it seems very unnecessary to include explosive and deadly elements. Guessed, a sequence of dreams to jump on the child's bed, and it suddenly became a blood cyclone and acted very well and worked very well in a movie that was considered as a pure thrown instead of comedy list. As its first section.
