Pluses: Mary Boland is always as lovely on the edge (I do not tire in her upper crust zaniness, especially "women" and "pride and prejudice"). W.C. Fields' brief introduction is interesting, although the famous Pool Table view welcomes little because it seems to be going for ten minutes. Madacope antics of the film, usually the time, great. Also, requesting the ownership of Alison Schipworth's stunning hotel stops; I love watching her more (she reminds me of Marie Dresler, a highly praised person). <br /> <br /> Minisas: Gracie Allen. Until the emergence of Adam Sandler, the annoying, unexpected presence that has become annoying. The unknown source gets tired of tinged with an accent that gets falsetto nasal its first scene old. This is the first time I have seen Barnes-Allen films and when I try to enjoy at least one film with every major comedy star (as a great classic comedy buff), it is definitely a group that I will not call again. Its time and material are completely closed. A maddeningly middle-class genius. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: an OK comedy, but few of Gaga and so far. And just an hour long, you can expect that it is not a grade Hollywood comedy. Balanced and Fields fans only want to see who can see all their work.
