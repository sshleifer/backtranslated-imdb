I got almost halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just flat on the annoying and totally unrealistic out. I can become unreal in many movies, but when it does not seem to be a crime drama thing. The evidence collection and interviewing process was just normal oddball. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then got bored with that and turned it off and returned it. The main character, directed by Allen Barkin, was not just credible. PETA Wilson played very well in this movie, but his character was there and there was no one to stop it from working for his acting opponents.
