Peter Hunt started as a very gifted film editor and operated his first stage while managing James Bond's film "On His Majority of Secret Service" (considered to be the best of many bond fans series). Other titles in his film include the epic Scale Adventure movie, "Gold" and "Shaute at the Devil", both adapted by Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gliwice Travels" is one of the oddities in the list of her movies. Hunt's style and skill manager likes to handle such a film. Half-live action / semi-animated retelling of the classic joke of Jonathan Swift, when the film was created, was still in the twentieth century, and it does not work just in all the facts. And Hunt (with her natural eye for faster action), or star Richard Harris (who can generally enjoy the most humble roles) is not a great thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lemuel Golfer (Richard Harris) is an outstanding medical student living in Bristol in the 17th Century. His father (Norman Shelley) wants to go to London to make his fortune; But the guns prefer the concept of lower pay, but as a ship surgeon, they prefer a hack of a lot of bravery in a ship called 'Entelep'. During a journey, 'Antelope' blown off course during a storm and hit a rock. The ship sank and everyone lost, without the gasoline ?? Who washed himself in Lilipput state. When he came in the rounds, the bullet discovered that the strange place where he washed, he is incredibly small, not taller than his feet. To them, he looks like a monster. They persuaded Golvar to help small people living on an adjoining island to help them fight against other nations. But the liver does not like to be harmful for war and destruction, so he plans to escape? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spends and plays with his animated opponent. The idea of ​​combining live action and animation was not new, but it certainly did not do much. Some Disney movies, such as the South of the South, So Dry to Me Heart and Pitts Dragon, were compatible with this concept, but it was still very much in her childhood. "Galive's Travels" is not a particularly well-animated movie, but the interaction between Harris and his cartoon co-stars is done with minimal skill. Sometimes the movie seems to be true from its satirical source (there is a scene where we know that Liliput is going to fight its neighbors due to eggs!) - and it seems that the war may start on the most ridiculous things.) But in his heart, it is a children's film and very ironical overtones are very rarely dwelled. Everyone involved did the best thing during their career? "Galivar's Travels" may be filled up in an otherwise empty afternoon, but in addition to this it is a forgotten and shocking experience.
