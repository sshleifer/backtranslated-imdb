Warning: Spinners can have <br /> <br /> Waves in the background of the first "Jaws" movie were prominent as well as in the 1980s. From the radioactive monstrosities of the film stars went from hidden to the corners of the unknown and hungry animals to explore the human experience (ie sea, deep space, genetics). Though the "Jaws" movie was a milestone in this particular region, but some films match the adhesive effect of the original. "Shark Roso Nell'Ssenova" (sky devil fish or red ocean), a benevolent follower of the original "jads" formula After some brutal boats and marines were cruelly killed by some sea creatures, the initial operation of the animal was discovered, then failure to study it without dire consequences and a final push to destroy it. Although filmmakers tried to create some new life in the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is not a disaster. This film is immensely under the weight of editing, fragile acting, and cheerful fear. <br /> <br /> The most ill-suited feature of "Devil Fish" is its cookie-cutter editing. When 3 different scenes are gathered from the beginning of the film, the viewer has no idea that the film has no technical credentials. It seems that editors spend the scenes around a set musical score instead of spending the movie and then making necessary changes to the music. Furthermore, each cut is an intro and it would appear that the editors never heard of "fade", "erase", or "dissolved" words. The effects of scenes can never last forever because they spend early after the final line and a new scene begins. Uninterrupted camera tricks such as a large number of original characters share a personal moment on the beach and their time-detached image of their behavior is mixed on their body. <br /> <br /> The music is equally soft. With a slight change of animal themes "Jazz" theme is a disappointing duplicate. Although I prefer to keep my reviews apart from the effect of MSST3, Mike describes it as the most accurate Monday score of "Source Core Porn Music". Failure to create a tension in a movie that depends on him so much depends on the "Devil Fish" death. The acting is inconsequential, the relationship is boring, and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question arises that genetics has been elevated to a stage of creating a huge chimera of the sea monster to protect the interest of the ocean, then why mankind can be used more effectively? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the idea of ​​the giant, though its presence is less than the star star. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is poor enough to drown in the middle. If "gosses" are not created, then the film can be described as average because it is effective, though it is new and exciting. Sadly, as the carbon copy of Spielberg's main thriller, it is most comfortable sitting at the garbage hip of cheese.
