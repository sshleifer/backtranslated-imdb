This movie just felt the lack of direction. This plot developed so many twists in such a short period that it could lose the trueity of the true story. There were lots of conversations and it seems like the wave of writing came and it was a little scary. Exorcism began to take a rear seat in the story behind the scene and grab story (which was a little weak to begin). <br /> <br /> All, if I rent out, it will be eliminated. The rest of the horror section of your local video store and you do not have a movie for yourself before. You are very good to see the Emily Rose Exxosist.
