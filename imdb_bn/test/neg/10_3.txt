Years ago, when Darling played on Eli TV, it was always a pan and scan version, which I hated and agreed to wait for the movie to see in its exact widescreen format. So when I saw this cheap Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards opus DVD, I decided to watch it once and for all to buy it. <br /> <br /> Boy, what horror movie. It is very bad and I do not know where I'm at such a level, where and where to start to describe how terribly wrong it is. Now watching it, it is clear to any of the fans of the film that Black Edwards created his wife this star because only a number of directors hit gold with musicals (Mary Popeins, music sounds, instant music, etc.) in other songs. Also in July, Andrew was fascinated by playing himself in famous projects on stage (Camlett, My FAIR LADY etc.), because Hollywood thought it was sexy enough or interesting. So Blake creates this unmarried effort, to show his wife a wicked connection to Spiral stories / war movies / romance / slapstick comedies / musicals. Darling LILI suffers from multiple personalities, those who do not know it or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but overall it does not work at a very embarrassing point. <br /> <br /> If you think the DVD version is "cut by the director", or in this case, "we can recover whatever we do" from this notorious box office flow. In the case of DVD release, Edwards is the original viewer We have 19 scenes from the theatrical version (19 !!!!!!!!) that are more organized and still have a significant inefficient version. The film comes along with the idea that it is 25 minutes and we We still do not know what's going on or why we are seeing Lilly, what kind of spy? How strong is he? He was ever responsible for the death? Instead we are looking for a thoroughly annoying Rock Hudson, trying to woo Julie Andrews looking for a thoroughly bored. Why does it not help things with unforeseen reasons why Julie falls for Hodgon? Why he and another man    সঙ্গে জড়িত না? তার প্রাক্তন ফাঁস হয়ে যাওয়া একজনকে তার পিছনে জয়লাভ করার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছিল অথবা তার গোপন রহস্য ছড়িয়ে দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করা উচিত ছিল। এই muddled কর্ম আমাদের কিছু প্রয়োজনীয় বিপরীতে দেওয়া হবে। এটা আমাদের অলস কর্মকাণ্ডের কিছু উদ্দীপক দেওয়া হবে। There is no catcher in this story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the best (or worst) example is The scene where Andrew and Hudson follow a group that sings in the middle of the forest. Music Sound Channeling Edwards. No wonder it has been removed from the DVD. Back in the 1970s, that scene has worked on a particular level but today, that moment reeks despair. Andrews / Edwards Other movies are directly inspired by other plot elements. Continuous view of dogfights is inspired by many well-modern military. The musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" Julie's Mary Pope's personality was created to make fun, which in July became the "messy" with this striptease. Lastly, running into Hudson's flat in the eyes of Julie's bird, another "wonder" in the sound of the song. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie is a singer, born of a German father and British mother who lives in England but singing her in Paris. You do not know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. When Julie and her "uncle" are on horses. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Every scene with French police is unfortunate. Where are Peter Vendors when you really need him? The belief in the action stupid outside. When Julie and her "uncle" are heading to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots bullets round the train, almost killing Lily in this process. Bright It is also interesting about the scene in the middle of the night with two holidays on the train, but Hodson and his squadron arrive at the train later in the morning. It has a slow dynamic train. <br /> <br /> musical moment. The beginning was the best part of the whole film (and for this reason I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect has been reduced because it has been repeated in the end. Not saying overwhelming, we really need to see a stripping scene and stripping Julie Cage Suzette, stripping scene and Julie? "It's not a man's girl" It is fine despite being bleak, but there is no reason at the moment because Lily is singing in a group of soldiers wounded in a French hospital, she wonders: How many soldiers were there indirectly injured by her espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is useless and without power. Romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is very old and tired looking way (see museum scene). Looks like Julie, she is in Valium. But playing a German spy in July actually killed this ill-conceived idea. Edwards desperately wanted to suppress poppin syndrome in his wife and believed that it was a good career decision to play a traitor. As much as I like Julie, she did not wear any greya, who pulled it so beautifully in the soil. Julie is quite German, although he plays German spy in July, yet he has added closing and intelligent <br /> <br /> 37 years after the liberation war, Blake Edwards feels that it is his It still needed to work for DVD release.
