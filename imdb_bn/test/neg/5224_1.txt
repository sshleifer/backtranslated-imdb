This is probably the worst movie ever made. I talk about how horrible the people of Ed Wood were doing (Plan 9), but this movie makes the plan 9 amazing. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris has created a camio, because I have no idea. Perhaps the destruction of his movie career. In addition to Chauk Norris, there are additional features of Dinakala Soap and Mike Norris in Dhaka film ... All right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director has no resume and I do not have any idea about the plot or the filming arise. It was a horrific dynasty that would have to burn green by the Baptist minister that was the ownership of any 3rd cousin studio (which I am sure was closed). <br /> <br /> I do not really know what to say about this movie. I want to give you a plot summary but I lost There is something about Jesus and the devil ... some eternal war. The other is because there are Indians. And a bunch of weird kids who do not know how to work ... They should not be just painful and in camera. I do not know what's going on most of the time but I know the movie was fascinated. Michael Norris pushed his daughter on the street street (on his bike) ... but in the middle of the park he shot. So how can he learn to ride his bike with equal speed of flash and hit by a car or bus ... I do not know. But he died. This is actually the most fun scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but once you see Mike wielding his hand and holding him up and screaming in terror ... you can understand. She did not hit or got anything ... You just felt hurt by some cars. But, the movie is not clean. So maybe it was not completely related and he died from cancer. However ... after that the movie gets really confusing and I have no idea what is actually happening. I have no idea why I am a Christian and this film can be made. I can not see any value for this film in a religious or non-religious field. This is probably the first thing that they see 101 students making film ... it's not what you want to do. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ... you hate it for me and you recommend to see it.
