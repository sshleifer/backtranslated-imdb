The film moves along quite well but leaves a lot to be desired, acting, and editing. Most of the characters are extracted mostly from the film, and Vinnie Jones's appearance goes out of the genus 50 seconds. The comedy gangster film is a genre that should have a lot against it, a lock shop stupid vendor and shooter out, which puts everyone dead. You never know how to laugh or just sit in the shocks. The film was the right material, but in a short story, it is very easy to wear and tie it, which should be corrected somewhere along the line and once it is believed, it will become increasingly critical. It's a sad because it was a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying a scene right there, he keeps the work before the shoot and he's Clint Eastwood. Here are some more coaching and rehearsals to make a big difference with the imagery and the supply of the line with the camera.
