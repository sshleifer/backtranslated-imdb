I do not think I can add more about what has been said about this picture. However, I can offer a small memory to see the STV in the theater. In the last (horrible) scene, the camera is coming out of the camping shot and it seems that the credit will start rolling at any time, the audience began to grow together. Generally, for a film like this, at least some of the dead-hard fans will keep an eye on the final disclaimer. When people filed, I did not think there was a sunny and delightful deaf, just less chicken. <br /> <br /> I think of reading a movie review on local paper, where the critic said that it is so bad that only Trek fans will like it. What a fool Fans were most suitable to differentiate each other! <br /> <br /> Dear bad scene: Determining the goal of a venison space probe, no less than a pyrecope! The place will be much smaller borders than we think.
