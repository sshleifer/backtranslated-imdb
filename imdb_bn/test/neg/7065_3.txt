This movie starts with an attractive set design and a committed proof, but fails to deliver those movie content. Set a point in parallel universe where everything is owned by the "Blump" corporation, it expresses concern about a horrific stand-up comic, who finds success with the third hand behind him. <br /> <br /> For all possible great cheese here - gray 80's star Jude Nelson, Owen Newton, Offshore visual and weird plot digressions, gross women in skimpy undergarments, necrophilia - but it does not stop. <br /> <br /> The main problem. Each scene is excrutiatingly slow. Nelson's study-up routines are considered fun because they are not drunk. But until every performance until it is even tensively fun, it becomes just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you have the longest, wonderful trick imaginable, interesting, and weird that it's funny and weird. Imagine this two hours after a stultifying, you did not get a punch line. You just have to save yourself the trouble watching the dark chasing.
