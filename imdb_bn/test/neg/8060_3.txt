The first thing I note is the music. This is not surprising as a masterpiece waltz from Raggero Doodot's Can not Holocost Hunting Theme or A Tale of Two Sisters, but I do not let it stop in film so early. <br /> <br /> One must definitely remember that women did not have the existence of cannibalism as an organized practice in his studies of his assumptions for PhD research, a star they must think that they should consider the mistakes and be prepared for the trip accordingly. ? Or why do you believe hypothesis to be true before you are already supposed to? It is fairly unbelievably unknowable and the movie feels more unrealistic and badly scripted. <br /> <br /> This is exactly like the movie of Raggero DeDoto, completely ill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our brave but stupid adventurers They can not be started very well because they are stagnant to miss a Jawalking iguana, and their decoy pet ferret falls from the truck around it, it is dead, then fall into a mud hole, well I guess it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Well then they flip a coin to see if they see or forget the whole thing. How does that scenario even make any sense? All their firmness rest on a coin flip? After they've got time, and money, and just after getting ready. This just keeps getting worse. For the film industry, the worst act of all time and defines scripting and music. <br /> <br /> How Mike was captured by his cancer and his friend and how he entered the cottage in a clay pots with a 3 inch long latch. Their blood sucking I have seen that interesting because if you think the first cannabal is that they have entered the jungle, people who are mistaken as a common man, sitting on the ground, eating this leche ... wondering if they are the same? Actually, though this film is terrible because this script is terrible and the subject matter is irrelevant considering the subject matter. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Mike is crazy, but like the first movie, he is simply unrealistic with negative behavior with such terrible behavior. <br /> <br /> The Raggero Deodarto film easily feels that the Americans deserve what they deserve, even though no one in this movie can blame the responsible for the return of Americans. <br /> <br /> The movie seems somewhat vain. We already got the point from the first movie, so why is the sequel made? Lieutenant's name Rizo? Could it be worse? When you look at cast, you often see that they have not played in many movies, and their bios are all non-existent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Jovani Lumberdo Radice in this film in the Scandinavian gangs of New York. Now le Rijo was known and I saw she played a very small role in the 2002 film Spiderman as a Tugby captain. William Shutner reminds me of being a police man in the car from the USS Enterprise at Admiral. Irony, sometimes works irony. Shotner did not enjoy the real music until his latest album "Hesse Bain" which was really good, just like never wasted hair in the Bow of U2, and Dan Marino could never win the Superboles. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the mockery is just sad, as Christopher Reeve, Superman can not rebel. People will always be such a legend although he was such a big man, although I was happy again. <br /> <br /> At this point you can say I'm fairly bored to discuss cancer pharax. <Br /> <br /> Cancible Holocaust's message was truly savages and what was really bad about? What is the natural offering of Savatur unknown to our moral records, or what else do we do with the malicious intent? Cannibal Farrox's message seems to be careful about what you're looking for, because you can find it. I would say this for the cannabal ferrox. Gloria returned and wrote in his study that cancellation does not exist, he protects others, who are weird and can go to where the angels are scared, but this film is poor overall. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
