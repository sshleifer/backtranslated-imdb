In spite of John Travolter's statement in the interview, his career was his favorite role, "Cool Cool" was a screwed and clever "cute drink" of 1995. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this flexible entertainment movie, but eventually a movie between Travolta and Uma Thurman The film gets flattened due to the lack of conspiracy, unclear characters, and astonishing lack of chemistry.

Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> This picture suggests that each of the entertainment businesses can be a gangster or one, compared to organized crime. "Get Short", "Gangster", the film's original basis for "gangster" was a trick driver-out-water concept, but "be cool" seems to be that since then the bus was completely miserable. <Br> <br /> This picture is fascinated and absolute brightness is a "single", delivered by The Rock, whose character is a cursory actor and a multiplier, where he's "bring it" to the Gabriel Union and Kirsten Donst.

I harassed an enunciation of this movie 4/10.
