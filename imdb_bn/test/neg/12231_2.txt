For the record, I hate fool movie. Without Mail Brooks and Fighter! Because they make classic and clich√©s fun, not real movies. I think barbarous movies for comedy and film are under barrel. I especially hate things made by Jason Friedberg and Haroon Seltzer, "Movie" with the date movie, epic movie and "spots". <br /> <br /> I decided to give a look to the comx. Since there was nothing to do with the production of Fredberg and Saltzer, so I was as motive as possible. It was just like one of their movies. It was originally combined with the junkies of kindergarten in each sports cinema lam and boring images of physical injuries that were supposed to make me laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No one can laugh at these jokes. Toilet bowl Who wrote this? Is an 11 year old? I was surprised that it was the producer of the marriage crashers, which was actually quite beautiful. But the attempt of foolhardy was a fun thing like burning orphans. There was nothing to do with Friedberg and Celtzer because I was the only reason that these two stars (when it clearly deserved one).
