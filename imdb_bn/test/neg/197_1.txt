In 1965, I watched Hippie's age 22, 5 times in the play, there are 2 versions of the song, and many times I read the script. Maybe it's a different thing, the movie is okay, but it's terrible as the game takes place. <br /> <br /> The first good. The songs are well singed, and production values ​​are quite good. The effect of homosexual effects on black boys, White Boy is cute. Cloud / Berger switch was interesting. The hair is a liquid manufacture, and the constant changes in it are intrinsic but it also maintains the basic fundamental attitude. <br /> <br /> But the original spirit was very distorted. It seemed that all the producers wanted to sing some songs, and did not fit the storyline with them, despite what they did with the original motive of the game. <br /> <br /> Cloud, Sheela and Hood were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about someone outside their tribe. Claude Rila's parents destroyed the party (it was hard to believe her laughing to hurt her parents), and repeatedly stole cars. Stole clothes and carts of rock soldiers. Then he left him in the middle of the desert where he must have been shaken badly, perhaps frustrated by the ranking and probably could die on that narrow street. Good fun And Hud felt great to break his son's heart by screaming in his former times. These were not how the hippies were, nor did the game describe it, and it is directly opposite to a generation's generation. <br /> <br /> I never asked for the money of Hippi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hitting the rock's parents is a good plan for everyone else to hit their own mother. <br /> <br /> "Bay in in" has always been a spiritual subject, but here it is lost on the stupid brides, almost floating around. Even if it is part of its journey, it destroys a beautiful song. I know they are against the "floating in space" with the army. But again, it completely destroys a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />! After a while, Burger does a job that never hippies. He hits the Cloud. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ! Instead, the whole tribe sing a transformational (certainly stolen) road at the speed of the sun at sunset speed. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the film in 1979, and I like it even less. I think it was possible to take an acceptable acceptance of the ceremony, but it is not.
