I guess now the Magnificent Seven franchise should be commenting on a fourth flick; Sextles are still surprised or amazed? Do they form the fourth road? Or not classic, revisionist, not European? But in America a currents America, Violent Vigilant's 70's movie, weird trash. Is this installment bomb exploded ?? Amazingly weird and even a bit weird <br /> <br /> Now I'm annoying that these sequels are not just for their favorite fans; But fans simply do not understand the difference between the main styles and the signals. <br /> <br /> What are these signals boring? But wicked. They must have written very badly? Dirty scripts, line lines It's straightforward; In this installment, many gunmen get many women? Van Cliff's young wife requests him to release a young prisoner; He is finally there. The young man starts his life again, shoots Van Cliffe, kidnaps wife, rapes him? Then join an wrongdoer. Van Cleef, who has previously refused to deny to protect a village, now combines a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer's hacienda; Then the faulty people in charge of the village of Van Cliff set. <br /> <br /> <br /> Stefanie's ability, '70s screwy is quite active in the Western, Van Cleef's darling. Kalyan, too antipathic, Noah, a writer and Chris'sideCoic. The remaining aggressive bunch Askew (one of only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, fleshy beauty.
