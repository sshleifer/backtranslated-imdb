When I was in Grade 2, my mother did not allow me to see this movie, because she said that it was very violent. Well, just a few years later, and this is the only reason I remember the film because of my mother. Well, this year's film will be up too big, but I got this hair. It was not good at age, and it played a bit of incredible holes in the sticky, script, but some cool scenes like driving and a big gunfight. I will not be here again for this photo.
