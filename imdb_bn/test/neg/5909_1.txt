Eddie Murphy and Richard Pierre will be associated with this group to shrink dramatically by organizing organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and operated this arrogant ego trip, so there is no one to blame himself for his failure. This is a real bad movie, so completely without energy and humor that it only acts as an example of the humiliation for his audience. It is not easy to continue hitting this movie, but I will show more kindness to the audience and stop it now.
