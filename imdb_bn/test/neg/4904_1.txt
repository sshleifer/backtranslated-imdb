Secretly bad movie is controversial about a Christian, who wants to be a writer and to create casino life events. Move at a snap speed. Dull, dust, dust! Often everything about this movie is amateur and disrespectful - one notable exception: Clive Owen's performance, which is like a Rolls Royce by a slum The casino sequence's advice was provided by a professional but it was judged by the way of handling, which was completely ignored by the director. Although casino staff can be very well-known to other parts of the world, they are not as close to a fool and a wife as the characters presented in this script. Curiosities and finishes are thrown out in the attempt to provide a script that is believable in the script, but it is blurred in a list of cocktail napkins. Anyone who earns a casino business (this writer is in the last form for years!) It is their past scriptures of poverty, which was never like this absenteeism in the longest and most obvious reach of England! A rude, insulting and inconsistent end plods and plods and plods that make a movie an insulting, insulting mess. American critics liked it.
