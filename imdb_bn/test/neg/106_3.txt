Stefens (Michael Harre) runs a mental shelter. He has a different approach to insane. He manages the treatment of obsolete methods. He treats everyone like a family, there is no lock on the door of the patient and he lets his imagination be played in some jails. He worked as a soldier in Sergeant Jaffe (Hugh Fagin) and gave Harriet (Camilla Car) the mother of a puppet. Dr. Stevens is outside the judge Oliver Dr. To spend a log up with Cameron (Gene Ross) ax, it becomes a bad step once when Dr. When Stevens returned, the judge turned the tree into his shoulder. Nurse Charlotte Bell (Rosie Holotik) has arrived in the Sanatorium soon after taking the possible job. Arranged an interview with Stevens. She is filled with head nurse, Geraldine Master (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is given a trail position. He learns and becomes a good choice among the patients. However, the things finally started to start the seizure, the phone line was cut, an old lady named Mrs. Collingham (Ria McAdam) cut her tongue and started to get that strange feeling that things are not exactly right. Then, one night all intricate secretariat information is released. Produced and operated by SF. Braunrichgag is a great central concept in this film that ends in a cooler wrap, but in the end it is less budgetary constraints and a small part to sit due to slow script rather than Team Pope. There is just a lot of annoying expansion by the prisoners, there is not much to do for the last twenty minutes. The film does not have real visibility because it is entirely contained in Santarium and its place, which is basically a large blue house in the middle. There is no graphic in it, there are some splashs of blood here and there and it is much more. There is a bit of nudity, but not much like Gore. Acting is quite strong, especially Holotik and Weinick. Photography was flat and unexciting and I could not think what the music was like. The end of the bend is great, but it takes too long to get it. A movie that was probably quite likely, perhaps it was delayed by the budget. All right, I guess, but I think if the story becomes the title of 'Tiles Form the Crypt' for half an hour, it would do better.
