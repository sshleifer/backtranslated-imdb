Held up the remnant of an invaded army force with a group of cowboys for warfare through the Indians on the war criminals. It sounds like it can be an exciting west, but this one is dull, dull, dull. It's rolling around, the action scenes are unimaginable, acting pedestrians, the plane is flat, even photography is not very good. Eastwood played a former Confederate in a very early role, who does not like the idea of ​​war at the same time as Yankees. It is about the only remote attraction of the whole movie, but Eastwood did not have enough experience to stop it, and his character came across the petulant instead of anger or arrogance. A very common western. Indeed, a very low-western western. If you're a die-hard Eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career, then look for a price. Otherwise, do not bother.
