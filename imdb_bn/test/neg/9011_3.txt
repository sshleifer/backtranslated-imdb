This movie has a fairly relevant view - one of the most wildly "human" performances in science fiction films, again "Alien" - and male actors. The astronaut's wife, discovered by me, is a weak link in the group - she does not know what to do with her face in most prominent scenes, for which I blame the director Karamen. <br /> <br /> Giving a decent budget for props and special effects and playing a more concentrated and coherent screen, "Blood Seed" was pretty cool. But the production design and continuity errors and gaffes undermine the underlying cheap ness proceedings. For example, when I saw comotose astronauts based on the "test table" width of an ironing board, I broke the Giggs, probably the crew did not want to call. And the giant's costume requires some serious work; The cover covered in the floor is not just frightening or believable. Still, the firmness was strong enough that I eventually broke into pieces and saw how the plot would solve itself, and the objectives of the alien were quite hesitant that the first thing that I could think of as an enigma. And the assassination scene shot a murderous scientist with a little bit of miniaturization with plot development, where the alien claimed to enrich some of the deceased person's personality. <br /> <br /> Do it. It's very cheap, fast and light-eyed, if you're not very hard or do not expect too much. What else to say?
