As a local Chinese, I can not accept the idea that some people will die for a 'good world'. I said, 'good earth' because it is a falsehood that the Chinese people have been inspired for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I think most Western listeners do not know Q Shihuang (the first emperor means), the king is the most notorious relic in ancient China. Tiancias (The word Chinese is spoken by the King, which means 'land and man') is utterly false from his mouth. From then on, one after the other, all the kings of ancient China had said the same thing, but some of them said what they said. <br /> <br /> Another issue is that Qin Xinzhu's empire was about 20 years before it was destroyed by humans. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scene of this movie, but it can not accept the idea that people will die for torture.
