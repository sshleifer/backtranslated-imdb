The first 50's hungry "B" crime thriller, the story is drill, wooden characters, Alison Hayes and Abbey Lane are the only two sexes to watch it, but a small shot, only a few frames long, their new 1950 paintings in 1950, paintman A "L" train is shown on the street in the Pool Street Bridge of the 6000 series of built cars, as they are newly distributed in the 1950s. Yechila. For fans like me, it makes a small acceptable picture. I think this kind of film, Umeer Dito, D. Oe. It is compatible with Edmund O'Brien, Harrison Ford, and other silent movies (big city crime dramas), if it is interesting, then I recognize Chicago and San Francisco with heartfelt and can recognize most of the street. Otherwise it is really a rare annoying film!
