In all the wrong situations, candy lean strangers, the situation is not funny with the fun of the Chesi voice and bad comedy, the clear effort of dry / black / dark laughter is clear and it fails to provide a good all material. <br /> <br /> I am surprised with a high crunching factor and less laughing ratio, this passage passes the first season, I personally book Scrab, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Buzz, Pooling, Pip Shows, Simpsons, Family Guy And I know what you think, these shows are not strange, so I see other good shows like Jum, G. Merghey's DarkPlaces, Book Group, Asylum and Sniff Box, which are dry / dark / dark humorous / Hysteria and above all 5/10. <br /> <br /> Girl Merghey's DarkPlace is especially cheap, captivating and weird, though it is thought out in the context and it really works to create and is very entertaining.
