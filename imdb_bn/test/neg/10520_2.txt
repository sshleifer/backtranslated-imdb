A brilliant rip off of "Air Bid", this film is really about a lot of worries about parents. All Fable of character (for example, adult coaches who do not know this game) are taken extreme - so much that they are totally incredible, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no similarity to the reality here, people and you will not develop sympathy for a character. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the good looking toy (uniform) of the disputed team in the dog's first match. Due to being chosen, it is supposed to be from the Columbus crew's franchise player Brian McBride's home, Irelandington Heights, IL.
