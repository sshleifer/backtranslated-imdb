This movie was incredibly stupid with what ever means. I fall ill for all the actors and actresses that destroy the carrier to be this stupid movie. The entire movie was made based on how unrealistic it could create, even to create something like this, it even created stupidas. Even some of the names were unreal. The movie is interesting to watch, because it was between 2 out of 10. This is probably the 3rd stupid movie ever made. I really understood that it was mostly adult actor, but it was still a small film. One of the most annoying Danny Trejo was a horror movie actor who always messed up. As far as I was concerned, another actor was quite clean.
