With the cover Matthias Hugze and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I've enjoyed some moments, just like Haq is enjoying with displeasure, but I've only really seen Matthias Haus's view. I especially enjoyed the showdown at the end. There was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "The Good, the Bad and the Auglee" and "For a Fee Dollars More" (a 3 fast-drawn showdown, with a pipe pocket watch used as a countdown timer). However, I can add more really nothing. The actor gave good performance, (except for "Assassin Dori" which was nothing beyond the comical acting) but the film lacked really depth and purpose; It is not enough to fill just half an hour and half of the time in the ideal movie, so we were surprised by the space for more than an hour, until the ball was rolling, until we stuck with the main characters. For example, the main character takes about two-fifths of the movie, about 4 times in the same strip club. <br /> <br /> The image budget lacks apparent depth and creativity. I do not think we have ever seen New Zealand's "perfect city" which was always spoken, in fact, the original characters finally reached New Angels, it was set in a factory or pipe and walkway warehouse; Very rarely will the "owner" of the entire city / builder own the "kingdom". New Angels "Super-High Security" always spoke, but only 15, probably 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm closed; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> simply add "to the list". However, if you value your time one and a half hours or $ 3.00 of your money, you can let it miss it.
