Ladies and gentlemen, allow us to introduce you to ?? Toultax! This ancient Latino-American tribe, even before the budgets, was perhaps the most deadly and blood-stained magician, yet they took some of their donkey college flogges and a hundred year old law enforcement force! But you can see it, but you do not have to have a real sledge in more than 40-minute intensive borodum, infantile shock and lazy sequences. If I did not completely clear myself: "The Dark Power" is a continuous sugar-coated and obscure part of the horrific shit of the 80 which still continues to be fun due to its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity. The purpose of the author / director Phil Smoot was definitely praiseworthy, but he ?? As well as cast and crew left ?? Lack of talent and financial means to provide even half decent things. Smoot carefully saw "Evil Dead" and other similar giant-themed movies, and anyway, should think that he can pull it off. The film is dying on an isolated Indian people in its isolated rural house; Just say a word above his whisper ?? Toltecs. Her grandson immediately rented a house in the 80's at the Aroobics babe, a bunch of college girls, including a cute black girl and racist red-handed girl. Soon they will discover why the old Indian lived like a servant, because he was actually the guardian of the soil of an ancient Teltek Graveyard. The clerical magicians bury the living, after eating the living beings alive again after thousands of years. And, honesty, have no lean meat better than that of bimbos? As already indicated, the first half of "The Dark Power" is very long and sleeping-induced. The tricky joke, unexplained conversation and the laughable footage of Lash Laroo seem to be jumping around his whip. Then, when the Tottac magicians came out of the ground, the film lost the last memoir of credibility. Instead of mood, they are making hard rock stars drunk with obscure masks and drunken gestures. A poor moment correctly is noticeable, when a person's lips spread on his forehead, but overall the killing aspect of this film is frustrating. The only remote moments are completely silly, such as the 9-year-old child (called Claytas!), Is happy with his uncle's truck or when the dirty chick chick gets the bathtub after bath and afterwards the beer is bitten. Indeed, until the Western militants of the 1940s roamed around their whip, I would suggest to exclude this film.
