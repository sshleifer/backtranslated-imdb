Slavester hanged the cat on a cat on his cat, which was with his owner Granny. Hey, I do not have enough words to give both taaty and granny letters. They are not just funny to me, and actually have created this brief to sit through it. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but he can only do so when a granny is confronted by the tremendous bid and senile old witch's tremendous horror. This animated brief will be available at Lobby Tune Golden Collection Volume 1 Disc 4 and is an optional documentary feature by Michael Baer. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
