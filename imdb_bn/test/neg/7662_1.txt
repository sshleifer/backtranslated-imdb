It took a while to understand that this final installment of the "airport" franchise was so incredible that it was not a snapstick comedy like "air". George Kennedy's warm reception missile was ridiculous in shooting a fireplace gun out of an open window. If you hold the window on two speeds, what will be your hand? If you want to lose your firmness in the gun and get a broken hand. The passengers were unwittingly ridiculous as the passengers were inside. Johnny Kennedy is coming to the latest French female Johnny Kennedy as well as Ernest Bargnin to slogane out. Does not happen. Susan Blacklie, a gifted and overwhelming actress, found no point in her resume for this. Robert Wagner was not even. This movie was so lazy that it takes surreal.
