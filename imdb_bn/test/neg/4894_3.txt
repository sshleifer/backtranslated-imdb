Tried hard work on "The Bad of the Saad Cafe", but when it came down to crank-time, it stood in its own made dust. <br /> <br /> No one can say that loud, but if Vanessa starts fighting with Red Gravle John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, then my hard-working dollar will go to Red Gray. Amalia was near her screenplay perfection and most actors intake with more detailed dedication than willing to pay any multi-million dollar contracted personality. Redgrave Amelia gave this soulful drill that was a blend of its own unique voice and a hard earned women from the south. To the average viewer, it may be considered boring, but it became hers as film progress ?? Miss Amelia transforms a roughneck to this stage beauty. This is Redgrey's performance as well as its interaction with other characters, which made this film taller ?? But not long. His performance requires the following others, but not whipped. When we set out for post-depression Southern Jobs each set exceeds the dirty cliché sent by the designers, the minor letters are felt like the poster board. The picture was needed to set up this scene, but the city's characters did not have any other purpose. Take the look of some old, wild alleged circulator Rod Steiger, for example. His views alone will question the legitimacy of this off-the-stomach-path in an observer town. The main two players surrounded Amelia are battling with the charm for a pretty peak-sighted moment, but due to the lack of instructions ?? It just faded. The most irrational of the two (though the high quality of both the posts in the suspected Sanati line) is Cork Hubber, who shows Amelier's "cousin" on a random night. His character is never defined, he has no real purpose and his loyalty is uncertain. Apart from compelling our viewers in our film, he does not play an important role in questioning his honesty and honesty. Can you easily create a character by pressing your tongue, flicking your ears, and punching your chest and head? Finally, there is another end to strange ?? Keith Carradine The character of the painful man's poem creates the character, but the lack of his lack of ammunition between him and Amilia intensifies his motive. These were the characters, as they cliché as south ?? Some stood ahead and tried to create pieces of an absurdist, and I could not argue that they failed. <br /> <br /> "Sad Cafe" Ballad "failed to rise above mediocrity cinematography and description, this was Amilia, and needed other souls in her life. Was the audience comfortable level with the arrival of her intelligent cousin ?? Could not help, but wondered whether or not the self confident person tried to stop it from the warm heart. The strings are not fully understood, but we take her small shots and amilia together with small things, that is the idea that the transformation of a bonus café from a recluse merchant. The problem is that Dell takes us at the dramatic level level between Cole and Redgrow No, do people represent crazy people or family members of Amelia? The responsibility brought them two from Lynch-Esquien's relationship, and then our pool becomes even more deep with the addition of the carinaine as "love interest" in the Airliere. Using a flashback technique in a flashback, we see two marriages, but never lose their love ?? Which draws amilia anger against their love in the crazy world. Amelia is so angry? Why did not the connection between the carDine and the Redgrow? Why was this picture? With the lack of focus on the connection of this character, there is no sense in the last scene between the two? Throw in the choice of cork and it gets fully discombobulated. Some of Kolove's beautiful dancers were in the scene, when there was the inability to move their letters from Point A to point points. I lost my care for focus, interest, and characters when I did not understand the final question? "Why"? <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Ballad of the Saad Café" was started, but it ended with a very small crack of firecrackers. My emotional feelings of this movie swung up and down, swung up and down, and finally finally stay further down due to the lack of understanding of purpose-purpose objectives. Redgrave did an extraordinary job as Amelia, and while the other characters (outside the random stinger) tried their best, I just could not understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the end was finally ended, I was indifferent. Director Calo was feeling a lack of connectivity that could understand the dynamic relationship between our main players. Colo has created some beautiful scenes where the scenery may face overlap, which allows you to focus on Amelia ?? Or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The film stars out of anger, discovery, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, out acting. Except comparative connectors, it is transformed from the differential time film into the front parts of the camera with the performer. It was a shame, because the "Saad Cafe" was promised, it could not just supply. <br /> <br /> Grade: ** ½ out *****
