This was last weekend SciFi, and I was checking it out. After all ... it was science fiction, with Vampire and Erika Eleniak What could be wrong with this B-movie? <br /> <br /> It should start: <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> This movie also does not fulfill its expectations. The most money they spent was the communication lens for the Vampire. <br /> <br /> The welding was horrible. Yes, there was a smart move led by Udo Carr as the Demeter's captain ... but the director obviously could not remember his line to Kier. Casting aluminum in a vampire movie is also a smart move, because it means that a bunch of horny boys is going to buy / rent / record this flick to be inspired by a vampire. However, the director, writer and producer also destroyed one. They have received some money from poor, uncomfortable souls who are enjoying watching them with vampire films with hot women ... but no one can remember this film in two or three years. <br /> <br /> Thirdly: small things to strengthen just laziness in this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross "crucified" and when Minna is confined to the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that his "chest" is nothing more than a pillow. <br /> <br /> And another thing: why would they look at George Hamilton-type Dracula rather than look horribly? Did George Hamilton hold us on to the future? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Even with a TiVo remote in your hands
