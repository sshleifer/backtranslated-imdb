Well to start I straighten up straight as black as black, and I can tell you it is very tragic when black people sucks a "black movie". I can not say that I have ever seen this movie badly directed or bad story line. <br /> <br /> Snoop my Doug and all but he was not feeling this movie, I did not want to know, how much movie they used to say in this bucket of this crown, but I hope it is enough to wash the flavor. <br /> <br /> I'm supporting a boring movie, but it was a bad, really really bad. It blurts out every aspect, no real plot, beautiful story, impressive, and the best person was white! <br /> <br /> I almost want to return to the door on my way to the theater, half the crowd and left before it ends, I still wish I was too much. Save yourself some pain and go to see something else, something else ...
