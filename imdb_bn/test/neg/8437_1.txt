This movie is as if it started as a comedy. It is almost displayed that the actors are particularly read the order of the airport, the cou card is closed off. William Smith played the role of "Carib," a hunter, which is quite frantic and disturbed. Smith seems to always play some of the fame as "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975), and "The Fisko Kid" (1979), although the famous role in this film seems ridiculous. It is one of the movies where the wonderful things happen only to fill the screen time, such as the sequence of sequence and the long stupid motorcycle race in the beginning sequence. I give this picture 1/10. I liked to see this movie "Mystery Science Theater", it would be ridiculous.
