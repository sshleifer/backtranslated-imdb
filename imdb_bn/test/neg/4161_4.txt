We are in a very distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages ​​mix with each other (though English rely on everyone else), nations have gathered, human cloning is true, and all regions seem to have been divided into two areas: For the sake of legitimacy and one is not valid ... a brave new world (in the style of Aladus Haksley) where people genetically share Era, and the blood relationship is strictly prohibited (due to health code that title ?? 46). In such an environment, there are two souls that do not fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emotions removes ... cold, all code 46 transmitters. Cold and annoyance Even Samant Morton and Tim Robbins are not present (both play their role nicely), or some scenes can do something to preserve the visual and sound power movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
