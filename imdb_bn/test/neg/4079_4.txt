Ivan Almaty (2007) ** Steve Carroll, Morgan Freeman, Lorraine Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennet, John Goodman, Bhanda Saiks, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (cameo: John Stewart ) Tiv to start his work as a new Congressional rap with "Carroll's Corolla Enquiren Ivan Backster" from "Bruce Almighty" to "Bruci Almaty" When you have been given leave to God (Freeman has restored its sacred role, Jim Carey to be wise 'calling' in order to avoid), he built an ark like Noah and hilarity ensues (or should be) ensues. The script of Steve Odekarak, Joel Cohen, and Alic Sokolov's Godforskek sitcom-is totally lingered and only Carole's tragic personality exceeds her man-made Ivan in some form of human form. The end result is many bird pop gags and lots of overall blott (costing more than $ 175 for CGI F / X). Steak shows as Cybec Evan's barbaric assistant. Voluntarily unfunny (DR Tom Shadidak)
