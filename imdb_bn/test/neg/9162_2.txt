You know old about the ruins of the train? How do you look at one? This movie is not that good. You still have to bring kids because only because you can not be alone in the theater. <br /> <br /> She managed to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee, and in this product he was given Robotics, Turns into an uncertain actor. <br /> <br /> I did not get much hope in the first place of this movie, I admit. If it is not a family movie, then I could have brought my son closer to Christmas, my wife and I did not leave. God, I want to go back to time and stop myself. I told my wife for about 10 minutes, did I think that I thought about it, but she paused me. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It's the bride Only David & # 39; s wonderful and natural work of the Cross preserves this review only from 1 star. <br /> <br /> This story is frustrating, humiliating and stupid, in this genre can be expected for a movie such as (though the recent "enthusiastic George" was fun and enjoyable). Most of the acting is poor. The decision to "update" Chipmunc's songs for today's audience is the best and painful to be unstable. It does not work. <br /> <br /> The old chips were cute, naughty and cute. These chips are stupid, somewhat meaningful, objectionable, and surprising, in vain by the needy. <br /> <br /> Again a past, respect, or completely new production, this film is completely failing. The final straw? My son can not wait to leave Spend your money instead of renting a weird George.
