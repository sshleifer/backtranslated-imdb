One of my friends decided to hire this thing, lucky it was not my money .. Although my time wasted many times. A story that can be interesting is played incredibly bad and is completely wasted by awesome editing / instructions. Maybe it can become a classic for all the strange over-acting :) (For example, Gary Bushy's character) All the super-acting characters are really the only thing that makes this movie a little interesting because they attracted your attention (everyone is definitely the wrong reason) where the movie Unfortunately itself failed. In short: the waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
