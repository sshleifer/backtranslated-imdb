My bad movie guru (and president of the Expo Film Society), spread out over us last week. He pulled out of his brown paper bag and denied the leftist glam in his own eyes and announced what he had saved for us: "The Most Dangerous Game", depicted in a budget of around $ 2.95. Of course, $ 2.95 was much delayed in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> However, there is a lot of dislike about this movie. It was a serious technical gafsa (my favorite was a 'repeat musket' which fired twice in two minutes without the facility of reloading). The hero is a wounded man who killed his injured friend Henman. <br /> <br /> More? OK - with no continuity to talk about a shuffle of plot. The film was destroyed for five minutes with a special guest star, which acts as a body part of villain's craziness and paranoia, but does not show him again. The hero becomes unconscious by henchman, but when he wakes up and meets his host, there is no mention of him. Nirab Dasi was captured, kept in custody ... and then the film (and the hero who kept him in this accident) only "forgot" about him <br /> <br /> More? Well, set cheap, and special effects are cheap (makeup an exception to it). Most of the plot descriptions are conveyed by droning, monotonic voice-over, which carries a less dramatic effect than Dini's menu recital. Most of the conversations are simply ridiculous and incomprehensible, as translated from Japanese. ("I want our conversation to be happy !!!") and color values ​​were fiercely transferred from the shot to the shot, such as cheap movie stock and problematic lighting tools were day orders. (Note - instead of camera crew, this last can be the result of a bad print). <br /> <br /> But there were a few nice moments here and there. The effect of the makeup was surprisingly good in contrast to other movies, the actors were attractive, especially mute maid daughter and countess. And despite everything, a certain strange atmosphere is available, very painful and annoying. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with this movie? I thought about it a little bit, and realized that the director / writer Pat Bout tried to write a story mainly from the old "EC" horror comics in the film. The story of the story, which is a painstaking "shock" and not big on psychical realism, is the voice of the narrative, the story of the story of the story, the story of the narrative, that the steady conversation, the development of sketch character (a comic, more than the character of a film than the physiognomy = character), internal logic ("EC" horror stories) Dependent on (which is in the captions on the panel), and the impressive makeup effects that have worked so well to the old EC artists Duplicate pieces of fragile images. <<br /> <br /> In fact, when I saw Boyt beheaded his leading man, I wanted to bet, then he quickly saw that colleague Lenny is equal to shocking statistics and artists like Craig and Jack Davis, face to face, be the real people May be present and still exist in the real world. He wants to emphasize the cartoonist views of the visuals and Used light and turned everybody into a living EC Comics character. (See: Ladies's Blank Beauty, Counting Strongest Bone Characteristics, Strange Bronze Skin and Sharp Chin, Platinum 'Long, Sister Black Henman etc) <br /> <br /> This film will explain failure. Boyette knew how 'frames' things were, but he did not know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a wonderful story in the range of a comics page, but the nuances of the film and live actor escaped him. Of course, he will not be the first person with this problem - see what Joel Schumacher's "Batman" did. But there was not a big budget to hide behind her. In any case, I imagine Boyette had gone away from the ruins of this train and spent more time worrying about "Darkness of Harrow" than the short time people who posted this message board message. He must have done what he did in the frigid boundaries, and for that you have to respect him ... even if you do not care about "Harrow".
