This was supposed to be set in the Northern Ireland "Bible Belt". Well, anyone who grew up and had children in the illustrated era, was not true! The pronunciation was everywhere - other than County Antrim / Derry. The church I have never seen is similar. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal value, but the film must certainly not be fifty-five! Initially, the elderly minister dressed in Ireland's church clothing (Alexander) and Seoul was not calling itself "Church of God". The minister is often referred to as "Rev." - they can do it in some parts of the world, but I did not hear it while living in the area. The ministers are "Mr. ......" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is very poorly researched and thrown Was - roughly ordinary of Irish movies - annoying! A film can have a great plot, but if it does not look authentic, it's trash.
