I only saw the minimum wage episode, yet I do not have any desire to see others, how can it be? At the beginning of Morgan's theater, he began to complain about his horrific situation in the minimum wage and the complaint never stopped. Ever. Thankfully for the audience, its skinny girlfriend Morgan (as if not even more annoying) is annoying as. <br /> <br /> And then at the top of it, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2,50 and then go to a restaurant when they naturally complain * dromurol * being poor. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about other episodes that may not be such a good. Someone should be forced to see this shit.
