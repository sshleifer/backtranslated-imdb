This movie is not worth watching at least in a movie. It is difficult to follow and understand the story (it started 10 minutes before 3 years ago). It's hard to know whether this movie is trying to be a comedy or it's so bad / weird that it sometimes feels like Swedish police car is just an example of American Serena and Lights. The performance of Perchbrand and Bergwist is normal, but I think Jenny Lampa is acting as a Jasmine doing a very bad job. Zara Zetterqvist works quite well, she is not seen as an actor in Swedish cinema for long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it's released on DVD or appear on the TV.
