Women and Gentlemen, we can all represent the worst Disney remix. Although the name of the movie "The Dark Cat", it should have been "The Dark Tin" or "FBI Agent". The cat did not find any real good scenes, the rickshaw character was more annoying than fun, Doug E. Doug did not get any good lines, even Dean Jones's Camio role could not save the film! The city of real good character was only two automated mechanisms, but their scenes were only brief. After all, I would say that you are considering watching this movie, but be more intelligent like the Barney Video.
