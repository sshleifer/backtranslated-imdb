This movie has been highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. Although I'm not really the fan of Adam Sandler, it's the first date in 50, where he left his normal rugby routine. Damon Weinz is a secret police member and Adam Sandler, a man who pretends to befriend him for a year. Naturally Sandler is rather angry about this betrayal. Various kings' queens cheeky and silly facials They ended up running, and of course they became big friends after understanding the big mistake (shooting Wayne in Sandler's head - he is thus bullying). I need to go If you look at it, you will work out what is going to happen. When our DVD player paused (he was 80 dollars from the supermarket o?), It was commented that the player knew that the film was annoying and refused to play it.
