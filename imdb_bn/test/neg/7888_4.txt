Leon Arrool, Oscar, Matt Lindsey and Lord Basil conducted the double role of Epping, but there was a problem liking the series "Mexican Spitfire" because they all arise for misrepresentation and they already advance towards the telegraph path. Errol Staff is funny as Lord Epping, but I would love to have much more intelligence and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
