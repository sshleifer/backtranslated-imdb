What a waste of energy and money <br/> Emilio Esteve was completely destroyed and most of the time was unused. John Lovitz was very quietly amusing but dumb. Why Harry Dean Stanton bothered? And it was just me or I could not do this thing. <br /> <br /> The story was quite existent and was really confused. My biggest problems were the response to the characters' events. Surface "dudes" are half times threatened to leave their lives like? How do you once surf them once !! Set-up in some scenes take a long way without closing enough pay to suppress us. There is nothing really or no realization in this "movie". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Do not see this when there are many good dancer movies.
