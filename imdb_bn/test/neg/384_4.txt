Dr. Lucio Flori (Lucio Phulcí) is a director of a poor film that began to feel the effect of filming many bloody scenes. He went to see if he traveled to his local brain; This proved to be a bad idea, because the contraction is actually a crazy killer who is responsible for the fatal murder. When Fulchy was given the chance of his fallen man, Loopie Nut Doctor threatened the horrible hack that he was responsible for the murder of the recent series. <br /> <br /> A fantastically gory treatment from the spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci on the ground in the cat at the cat. Chains are full of clutches, closet attacks and various bloody murders, the film must be able to spread enough clay for the hardest holes. But when someone looks around, it is seen that most of the horror scenes have been lifted from previous films (mostly Phulasi's own "Best Composition"); Remove it from the equation and one has been omitted from the concept of the Nifty fundamental plot that has been completely destroyed, some naïve, and Floris himself and David L. Terrible performance as a psychological shrinkage from Thompson. <br /> <br /> The movie is progressive, it develops in an unknown world, the 'borrowing' covers the footage in a random fashion, without any effort to work firmly in the story. See Phulasi's Touch of Death and Hats of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's Secreter Secret, you've already seen the best bit of bits in the brain. <br /> <br /> After much bloodshed, the film wraps up rather quickly, the feelings of the visitors forgotten and somewhat cheated. Check out the film, if you are a full-fledged artist, then I would suggest finding movies that have taken a 'good bit'.
