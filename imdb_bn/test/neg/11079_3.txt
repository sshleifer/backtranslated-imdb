With a sad history, a group of covers takes a writer on a 'hairy' courage with a secret cave of Kazakhstan. Remake and signals and film companies are trying to monetize a movie with no winning combination of any of the elements in this movie, in the past few years, there are only a relatively different twist in the last eight cave films, and this seems to be taking an X-file from the bend. I want to give every film a doubt, but there was very little annoyance for me. The camera work which they seem to be constantly confused may give you a headache. Not having a cover, whether it was realistic or really not realistic. From the supposedly experienced cover there is fairly unnecessary Pannick, in the last half you say two things loudly ?? Oh, just shut down and focus on preserving yourself, or I hope you all have to die eventually. This was very tiring for this decent actor for this movie. There is no medium amount and nothing special in the dial or letters. Although you are confident, you know what's going on at the end, explain all the details in the last 5 minutes. But if I had a better opinion about the film, leaving the last minute on the floor in the cutting room. It just was not necessary. I suggest to leave immediately after your doubts are confirmed and save the setup for yourself. I have long thought that the film industry will share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme. Before making the film you pay for the creation of materials, but a profit for the movie comes from the tips given by you while leaving the movie. I can not blame the film about which I do not like in his budget.
