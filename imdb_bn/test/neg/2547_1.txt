What a terrible movie! It represents the condition of the loss of the French society completely, where disciplined values ​​and primaries for the heritage have completely disappeared. The plot is dishonest, the movie is not funny and the character is completely shallow and uncertain. To say the least, the guides and painters are very poor and stupid. Catherine Dewiew was always always as a bad actress, even when she was directed by Belluel in Belle de Jare. Generally good cast rest (Vincent Lyndon, Line Renov, Jean Ian) seems completely lost in the imperfection, platituds, and unrest in the ocean. With a thoughtful figure of French and American More, I can not help parallel with the wonderful James Ivory "Le Divorce", with its best painters and star cast kept in good use. You can feel sympathy with the French by watching "Le Divorce", irrespective of their foils. "Belle Maaman" leaves you with only a boring humiliation for his moral bankruptcy and stupid designations.
