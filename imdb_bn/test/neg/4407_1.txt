It does not operate the plot, okay; It does not study a letter, fine; There is no action, okay; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But most of the time it is not happening in a long, long scene - with a sense of what they feel (ie a checkpoint tower is crushing, an Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, throwing bullets to a crawling tiger woman's shrub) but when You are trying to earn some money, not there. Bonus: You can look forward to this movie fast and it will not make any difference but it can be less annoying.
