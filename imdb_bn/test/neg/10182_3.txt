Really nice Already this movie has many reviews, but I wanted to add my own opinion. I agree with most critics that this movie has terrible acting, writing, and direction - the boy did this. However, I think there are other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is Christian faith and allowance for mutual exclusive life of external life? Does the film work as it is because you can not be just a Christian and allow for the possibility? Why? They explicitly touch this topic in the film (that is, "the Bible does not say that there are aliens." "Well, the Bible does not say that there is no.), But the actual rebellion is not answered, the Bible does not actually say that there is no. Instead of tackling the question? Or better, acknowledge that it is an infinite universe where we live and if we are infinite there The groom believes that he has created a life somewhere and has his own plans for it, perhaps how are two explanations valid for the kidnapping, what are the night-hours of relation with the abduction experience, if it is not something else, then the filmmakers already have their Mind made. <br /> <br /> 3. Filmmakers claim that those who suffered the abduction experience All of them were related to privacy, it is a big demand to create without any real proof. I do not have the argument that they are not, but if you are going to say something, you want to make it better. <Br / > <br /> 4 Why does another reporter (Greasy-haired blonde singer, another one) always has her hands in her pocket? <br /> <br /> It's difficult to take someone seriously I am playing pocket pool. I think it was Christian inquiries and inquiries of UFO incidents, but unfortunately filmmakers take much care of their "faith message" "Making a thought-provoking movie. As a Christian myself, this saddens me.
