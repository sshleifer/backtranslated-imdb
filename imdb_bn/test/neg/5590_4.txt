Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A couple of David (Janathan Shake) and Tish (Lori Huring) are in Budapest , Business commitments and a luxury hotel stay. One night, they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invites her back to their place, where they end up in a trilogy. All right, until David took some negatives and he and Tees end up being blackmail. But when some people involved in cheating are killed, things become dirty, and they are forced to enter such a land under the category of pornography and hardcore slavery to look for such women, who can keep everything. <br /> <br /> While dealing with the concept of snap movies, the original film works directly with DVDs and DVDs for the dazzling thirds (!!!) theme. It's a pornographic game, lots of tileless pieces of hot t / an action are going on. If this sounds like a good movie, you probably would like it, but you probably would like more in the porn storeroom than the video shop. <br /> <br /> It's a dark and voiceless feeling of film trying to copy the original, but while still doing a good job it still can not focus on the core. This is a nightmare story, with a dodgy narrative flow. And compared to cages, Shake comes across cross-border like wood. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than this, I think, and your DVD is better than the average of the seagulls that looks a lot this day, but really, we have not seen enough? **
