The two releasing qualities of this movie were symphotography and a story that was difficult to resist. However, the script, direction, and some scenes were just awful. I asked myself, why such a good cast made such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that this actor must believe in charity, which included the plot of film, but knew that the film was full of flaws. <br /> <br /> This image could have been so good and the audience could be as big as the audience. I think that with some problems in this film some scenes are painful to look bad, I still want to see how the clear conclusion will be solved by itself.
