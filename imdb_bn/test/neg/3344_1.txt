This movie is so real real. French movies like this are just waste time. Why watch this movie? Even, I do not know why. What? Half brothers and sisters know well? Although the sex scene is so real and clear, but the story is based on it's untrue. Then what is the use of it? Can you find life easily, half a sibling doing such things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn something from this movie? Yes: Some people are so interested in destroying such a movie, such stories, such an unknowable time. But those who prefer only one life without nihilism, lack of life, or hope, then there you ... You have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Only a valuable benefit, though: Catherine Deniv She is such a strikingly beautiful woman.
