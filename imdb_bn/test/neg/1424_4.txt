Once eloquently Ben Elton saw, it does not get faster than the style of comedy. Steve Martin's latest offer - 'The Pink Panther 2' - is currently open for bad reviews and uncomfortable box-office blames, but Mike Myers's 'The Love Gurus' thinks some fans <br /> <br /> Jerry Lewis had to feel the pain of rejection (wonderfully, when his character in this film used the word in his presence, it only feels a funny change), 'Where?' For nearly a decade he was thrown on a big screen. <br /> <br /> There are two comedies in this world war, 'Brendan Bearer 111', the richest person in the world, who wants to join the army, his patriotic duties (and he is bored with success) but he can be clinically aborted. Is. Then he decided to start his own privately funded army, the other 4-F's admission. <br /> <br /> They are trained in 'Thunderbirds', decorated with the ridiculous uniforms of 'international rescue'. Here are some good visual gags. When they burn a rocket launcher, they are pleased with themselves, until they can learn that they have destroyed a Texaco oil station! To learn the German language, Brendan has recorded a long-musical record known as 'Long Gun Song'. When these troops sit to eat, instead of being in a dirty garbage hall, they are in a spacious room decorated with a lunar eclipse. <br /> <br /> <br /> - English Butler too. <br /> <br /> This script is not by Jerry himself, but by Gerald Gardner and De Curuso, authors of several episodes have written, his best view when he blackmailed a mafia-type gangster. 'Monkees'. 'Front' is often a television sitakamera look and feel, sometimes you expect to hear often laugh-track. <br /> <br /> Wherever it happened badly, buyers were replaced instead of marriage. After the command of the top Nazi captain and the withdrawal of the Germans, they were involved in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise is nowhere!). As a commander, Jerry denies the description of such a mind-numbing disqualification distribution of a performance. He gave Brian a run for his money in the 'highest living' living area. It comes as relief when the last credit is displayed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the time was wrong - bringing Vietnam comedies was not a good idea when the Vietnam conflict was excited. Or the public was just Jerry enough (that beard probably did not help!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone took him in his hand and said: "That stinks cold. The Rise of the Bridge, Lower the River "is an excellent film compared with the composition. /> <br /> 70 is like <br, Woody Allen's new comedy icons, mail Brooks and Monty Python - phresara more bite and Allen's case, more humane style of comedy was to replace Jerry skepastikake brands. Until 1982, he will not do anything like Martin Cherchidge's glorious 'The King of Comedy', a successful show-talk show 'Jerry Longford'.
