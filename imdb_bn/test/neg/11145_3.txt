All hip! All added! I'm surprised that I missed this on the big screen. Where this film was a little detailed in the work. Everything else has failed it. Arnold has done so well in the past few years. I think commando and the last action hero has gone from our lives. Unfortunately, this film works at the lowest universal majority and reduces Arnold's sudden, dogmatic, muscular face, which only shoots guns and hits things. At the last moment (and at other times), which was expected from the beginning, we are seeing a glimmer of actors that he is more than what he has given at the beginning of his career. I was obsolete with the film because it never broke a new ground or went somewhere but where you hoped it.
