I was really frustrated after seeing Punkuo's revenge on the other night. I felt it was going to be bad, but I do not think it's bad. A murdered boy falls into the hands of an eight-year-old daughter of a wooden doll seized in the hands. From there, it is a killer way for those who get the way between dolls and small girls. We've seen such movies before, such as the Children's Play series, which is a lot better. However, it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Which previously worked under both Kevin Tenny. In any case, I encourage viewers to check the "monster night" and the original "witchboard". These titles bring the best of Kevin S. Tennessee.
