This movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for Jumboi always accept credibility from film history. There is a lot about the movie that I can tell about the movie that I can almost write about the movie. For example, there were 50 people on the plane, they died 100 and they were coming, apparently "Virus" caused hepatic complications because everyone had yellow eyes, viruses roared like a lion and not some viruses. Only reinforces the tissue because it gives epidemic strength, not to mention that these viruses compromise human hair. It is also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only in aircraft) that person kicks in the air again. Remember that if you hold a gun prisoner and loose it, always look at the bottle size of the dropper and cabinets, you never know where the poor are hiding. And if for some reason you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and (always can happen), after dozens of people are killed, just move away from the plane, watch the sunrise and make fun of flying dating. Attendant :)
