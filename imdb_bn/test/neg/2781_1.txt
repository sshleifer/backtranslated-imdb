Another stupid "movie" The image quality is correct. Very sound In the middle of music. The guy tried to make music in Halloween. <br /> <br /> For a rare period, producers / directors prefer non-anonopic girls. It takes a week to "cinema" and costs $ 10,000. Does the producer have money when they all choose to spare girls? Good question <br /> <br /> But the girls of this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actresses. Not too much But maybe the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we give 10,000 dollars to some young people who love movies and they can make a good movie. <Br> <br /> Do not lose your time to see this "thing".
