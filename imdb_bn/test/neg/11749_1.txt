Do not be afraid to tell me that this recurring version of the all-time greatest movie of all time, "Saiko" (1960), is one of the examples of poor aspect, poor performance and poor cast. The best way to describe this movie is a step-by-step to step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step step. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Okay, in the 1960s, people could not use bloody or horrific scenes as much as we are today but it does not get nominated for 4 Oscars. There was no reason to publish this color of the ghost van sant, except in 1998. What should be realistic in color should not be. Norman after washing the shower, washed his hands, the amount of blood that was used for something like red wax. Once he washed his blood, his hand turned red. <br /> <br /> Probably probably not, there was probably a good cast of Jeanette Leigh and Anthony Parkins. Pacin was very well suited for Norman and he was incredibly natural to laugh and talk to newborns. Hit wanted a handsome and well-liked actor and it just worked fine. In this version, I personally feel Vince Vaughan looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Norman's role, unfortunately, her performance was not less than terrible. A fair conversation where Norman and Marion have long conversations, there was zero expression on their face, and their voice and face did not always change. When the original scene is described as eccentrically, we can see clearly the sudden change of expression on the face of Parkinson's and even though he is not aggressively brutally angry. Vince Von has done the whole conversation here as his line of his heart has. Again, terrible acting. The same is with Anne Heche. In the original initial scene, we can see how intense and nervous Marian (Genet) is going on at Phoenix. He is happy to get the money but is afraid of life at the same time. That's what I call acting In remake, Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles timely to get the money. I do not think they will be "happy and sunny" when they have stolen only $ 400,000 and the whole state police are behind them. In the shower scene, Janet wanders around the curtains across the main screen and dies after the death. In the remake, Heche gets stabbed, almost sways, then sways in another way, his face has a stupid expression and managed to die with great effort. Again, terrible acting. <br /> <br /> There are some specially transformed changes in this film, which has nothing to do with the plot line and the current situation. In the scene of the murder of the airbust, two scenes embrace in stubs. With one naked woman and one other sheep. Many people including me are not sure whether the second scene showed sheep or cows or whatever was there. Any animal or naked woman in the world will have to do with the murder of the investigator! Changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. As well as there are some changes in the last scene. <br /> <br /> I add some (and only) positive points to this. I feel well done by Julian Moore and Lilla played a good character. And William Messi was well-versed, which should almost have played the role of Orbagast. <br /> <br /> It is a common man's knowledge that the aim of the movie remake is to make aware of the current generation movie and that there is a good classic plot line, and try and make it look better than the original. And according to what happened here, something happened here, but it is a direct opposite. Unfortunately many people like me did not get affected after seeing this movie, unless we could know about the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the root and always the best among the best ever made movies ever.
