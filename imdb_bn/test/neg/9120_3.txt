If you've already seen American American graffiti, I can not see this movie. If you did not see the original, I still do not recommend it, but it would be less painful to see it. The characters of the first photo are great, and in the end you have lost a connection with them. This movie set out to show how bad their life has been. A trick to see it! <br /> <br /> Set in the year 1964, '65, '66 and '67 on the eve of the new year, there are four stories of our first movie characters. In 64, we are John Milner (Paul Le Mate) who is now on a professional drag racer. She met Eva, a foreign girl, and although her plot really does not go anywhere, it's the four best. In 1965, we have Told (Charles Martin Smith) who is stuck in Vietnam and, more than anything, he wants. He tries to find ways to hurt himself or find stupid things. In '66, our Candy (Candy K. Clark), the girl who raised the tot in the first movie. Now he hippie smoking a pot, and really sure I was what his plot was. It was going to a concert ... nothing happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolland (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bowler (Syndi Williams) are having problems with the marriage, which ended in the fight against anti-war and police activities. <br /> <br /> None of these stories are very good. Some parts feature scripts too, very bad dialogue. I have enjoyed so much in the first film that this poor character has ended here ... why? Why are these signals created? I guess if a signal is made, then Vietnam War, Hippie and Police system will be shown, but the real thing is that the film should not be created. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish, but it is a huge headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is a regular screenplay (depending on how you look at it), and how the film should be left. Tod's plot was shot in 16 mm and its a poor looking image which is a small box size in the middle of the screen. Debbie's plot is shot on multi screen. At one stage, there may be a screen, but in most cases it is up to two to twenty screens at once. Do not try to follow the screen, since no way is going. The plot of Steve and Laurie is a strange painter style. It does not really mean anything in style, and stupid and pointless. Instead of just a fullscreen, it's a condensed widescreen which looks like fullscreen version of the widescreen. Although I do not like others, at least I understand what they were going for, it just could not understand. <br /> <br /> Music is the save of this movie, it can not save! Bob Dylan, Simon and Graffunkel, Steve Wanderer, Marvin Geye and some others have excellent songs here. They do not save the feature, they make it even better. It's still bad! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a pointless Siegel. The main no fan should avoid this awful sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** of 1/2. 110 minutes PG for language, drug use and violence
