Someone has commented that the court should be martial for what Charlie Shane's character wanted. You may be right, but that's how seal is really. I worked for a few months with a SEAL team outside Norfolk, VA. In fact, I want to say that they used our ship for a few months to set itself up in Europe. I was a mail clerk of the board and every day these people tried to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to receive the mail, we issued a pass to one person. Each day a different seal will be posed to someone else. Well, for the third time I did not tell them that until they were proved to me. They went to NUTS !!! I thought they would kick me through my cage, make fun of me, and then steal mail. Fortunately, I did not have the President (NAV), but the federal government (US Mail). I saw what I saw in Sylhet, which they wanted. They were discharged on an unlimited shore, where we had to return to the ship during a certain time. They killed a woman in France and tortured them and were seized on two seals a week, and a Simon was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and was given military surveillance in court. Is it any wonder that the seal rate is 85% more? As a seal you are in God. So this movie works as a seal and thinks it is a nice work to illustrate ... Unfortunately, it is so unbelievable to ordinary people that it stops being fake.
