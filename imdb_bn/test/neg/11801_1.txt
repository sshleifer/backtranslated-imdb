The study of St. Francisville claimed, "It is not walking in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Wilch. Where Blair Witch has made the imagination of the audience more effective through ordinary movies, the experiences of St. Francisville overworks the viewer's patience. However, it must be said that it is scheduled to be a classic of the camp. <br /> <br /> WARNING: Spoiler coming !! <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie in a local theater where the film's "unusual counselor" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the film. After knowing the upcoming information, anyone who wants to watch this movie, stop reading here. Who can not resist you, read my friends and everyone will be told. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mr. Taylor, author of the rather true story, claiming to be the truth, told viewers of this video screening that the St. Francisville test is not a documentary. shock! Amazing! If we did not know ... He told us that all the awesome discoveries created by the participants were made by film producers, all staged and predetermined. Actually, he told us that in the last 15 minutes, not only in Louisiana but also in California. Four participants were real actors (Notifications I did not say ...). One of the participants is actually a special effect technologist in ER <br /> <br /> What annoys me about this movie is all that is true. Claiming Blair Witch's project was true, Blair tried to strengthen the project, where Blair Witch was a threat. Surprisingly, no one can believe this movie right now. Filled with horrific acting and humorous lines such as "surround yourself with white light" and "I love ghosts", the St. Francisville test is everywhere in midnight film so that the crowd is properly jerk, wife, jer and chant "I love ghost!" <br /> < br> talk about false advertising. The real stories are not illustrated with spazed special effects, which seem to be that neighborhood boy scout soldiers set a spectacular house. From the Sandwich bugs (oh ... scary ...) from the boring Madison, from "Sense", which is playing four glasses on the Ozia board, two mice are found in bed, The St Francisville Experiment is a movie a bizarre hoax. Lion's Gate It would be a matter of fact to dump this item into the nearest trash compactor or it should be really true: <br /> <br /> "Saint Francisville test: A comical look in not making a movie".
