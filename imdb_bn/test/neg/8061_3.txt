One of the most notorious of the "Video Natties" taboo in the 1980's is the most highly publicized. "Make me crazy slowly" What do you expect from an Junkyard Potbollar operated by an Amberto Lenny? The inventive (still poorly rendered) local torture techniques, some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even silent than the "cannibal holocaust"), and chives are abundant chewed. Although the film's exploitation of violence is often shown in a little bondage and does not last for a long time, which reduces its effect (explains how you can do it). Dialoglenzie's natural fascination, because our male heroes show "twitter" for them and their affection for women like them. Known faces (including Lorraine D Cell, Giovanni Lomardo Rodis, Jora Caroua and Robert Curman) face up to the growing statue (completely ridiculous "save welding"), but this additional work, Luji can not save efforts.
