I have to admit, I was against this movie since the beginning but I worked hard to be neutral, I really did, but to be suspicious of the idea of ​​the resurrected character of characteristic, sophisticated, entertaining, classic British classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> People in my house watched it so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about the film. (I read them later). Expected for such an American film, the film started with a chase that was not bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are trustworthy and it only removes the mark. <br /> <br /> Yet the character was unreal, the pieces of the set could easily be split from any American scalp blockblaster. Seeing it is unfortunate and it lacks all character. <br /> <br /> It seems to be taking a squid angle with a failed initial robbery in the original film, the US version gives the expected thing and presents a psychological reason with Donald's death. Sutherland's character. It gives our US cousin a lot of opportunities for revengeful, lazy eyes against the 'bad workers', which matches it with predictable extinction. Charlize Theron (apparently beautiful! Oh beautiful! Her beautiful, injured Bambi eyes, everyone!) That was apparently annoying. His doorway was especially like Resident Evil or Grave Ryder, both of which were more entertaining and b) started well because they could not make a game a mess, which was already shiny with the British movie. Spark, you really feel anything for moments of inspiration and something. But I blame, for the sake of this, the complete inclusion of a beautiful girl I have seen in some time seems like the most ham-fisted man, and for this it is a Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> If you like these actors in any way and you agree with any comments above, do not visit this movie! If I had an opportunity to see 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after watching Ed Norton in this case, I would be disappointed. Likewise, Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I think, 'Transporter' is OK if you like things like this). <br /> <br /> Sadly, all set pieces are designed in the most transparent way possible, you have to think, 'Wow! She is smart! ',' Cao! She is cool ',' Hey! What a tough guy! Then there is the 'funny PC guy' whose crayon is 'Comic Relief', but whose comedic content can be released two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two movies like this, you can easily mislead the two as a Braine Brackhammer clone. Jerry is not terribly terrible, but he only uses clichés in excess (Everyone should know (or should). <br /> <br /> I need to clean up here. I could not handle it at all, so I could not say that it was made because of the bright ending of Michael Kine's version, but I'm sorry, this is just one of those very rare movies, which if I 'see it in a movie, I go out We managed a small protest. It is not that it is an equal number of sea oceans 14 or some (11th in the ocean was good but not disturbed with the other!) As with all the glitches in a movie, glamor, fake saas and pantomime heroism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Do not see! I do not like a little fun, but it's a criminal hectic job that is not worthy of parading myself under a classic title. Seriously show some pride! When I first heard that this movie will be made, I was completely justified in my angry and ill-reaction. Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> PS If some of the action sequences are not bad then if you like these things then add additional '1' to the symbol.
