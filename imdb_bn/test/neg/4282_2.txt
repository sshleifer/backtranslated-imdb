Animation is awesome, I must admit that. But Disney has stabilized each of our stereotypes, which we have been trying to defeat Alaskans for the last two generations. And the name, I mean, come ... sitka, kenny, tanana and dahnari (chansea takeoff of denali)?! True people who live in reality! And the real people have been named for these real places, perhaps this small little flashing struggle is being fought outside of the world to take revenge. Disney, you have come out of California and Florida, just like the rest of the states that still treat us as a foreign country. If you know how you can not stop, hire at least and / or work with people who know that you are trying to make an area of ​​Currias. Maybe it will not be so insulting! :(
