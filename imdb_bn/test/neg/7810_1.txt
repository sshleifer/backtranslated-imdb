I was curious by the character of the nasty boss because I was one of myself, and the real boss girl was interesting and it was interested in seeing even the little Ashton Kushner, but the film was so lively that I had to stop it. It was a waste of time watching. When people began to yell at the living room, it was too much to see. Painful, terrible shit movie. They had just toned it down a little bit. Is there really people who find it interesting and like it? I am free to read IMDB readers so low rates. Besides the story's story, the young man tries to propagate and also conquers for the boss. I liked that part. As well as the opening scene with the train colleagues was quiet, because I liked the character of his colleague. If you can stomach non-sensible films or you are very young, then it could be one of the stomachs.
