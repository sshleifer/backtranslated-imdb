I was duped in this observer by many friendly reviews here. Boy, Star Off the Way! It is not right to give this 9 to 10 points and to say "one of the best movies of the year". Here is the problem of big problems and the lack of thin paper in a paper. It's like slapstick on Prozac. Everything trumps along predictably and lazily. The plot is weak from the beginning - two garbage men unveiled their filthy neighbor, a murder witness and a waste disposal conspiracy - and the film is not directed to do more. There are some interesting situations and decent acting, but it is not enough to save this film for a fake film. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that does not throw its cherries on the ground, so why waste your time?
