Lillith Silver as the main "character" likes to point out - "You know about all the vampires f ** k". It is clear that this statement has been cast as Cast and crew, who created the worst picture of each other's preferred blood pressure. According to the misleading director, the vampires are swim in the white inside and a piece of meat, like a harmful curve, leaks into the lexox. Our main character Lillith with similar fangs in a bad case of winding and asthma creates a slapstick caricature of "Modern Day" Vampire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lilith is our pale hero, a vampire beauty hunter who is all a member of its favorite culture, and has been living voluntarily from the Illuminati! In spite of not including the classic killer method of stealth and precision, however, Lilith entered through an open window and then proceeded to kiss her goal before shooting with a handgun in a dry point (which apparently did not thank the bullet hole for the drilling continuation)). PC Plod was appointed to solve the murder, but he came to summer, but Lilith actually came forward looking for armed hunting with the help of ordinary vampire sender equipment, along with a vampire and a cross, garlic and a sharp piece of wood. . Meanwhile, Lilith, who has become a habit of enjoying his master, when an old Nemisis scratched him and demanded a ransom, personally demanded his delivery. You can imagine, this plan does not have to go accordingly. I'm not going to penetrate myself through the pain of the following scene, so I'll eventually skip it. A tragic incident occurred in Lilith and his "Nemesis" and after the victory of Lilith, it was revealed that some people are reported with the incompleteness of being attacked by cancer, that the two-year old boyfriend and the whole plot was a game of play. Yes, the jump in balls was really the end. In my eyes, this joke of conclusion is covered with latex cakes, and this movie does not seal the movie "Never Watch This Watch". <br /> <br /> As long as the cinematic tactics will run, the film is not only bothered to create any style. The director tried to rescue some of his friend from the bend and retrieve a few multi-angle shots, but not to save the film's requirements. <br /> <br /> You can scream "It's a B movie, it meant to be punk!". I'm not sorry though. I saw some cracking B movies such as the Dead Dead 2, and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and therefore could not hide behind this dishonor excuse. The budget was low, it is clear by the position and the lack of good actors. Maybe if the manager becomes more creative and spend less money for makeup and fake blood money, he could have done some good work in the attempt of this illness. Seedy sex scenes are not beneficial in any way and only the pornographic skills across it served to give me a few chuckles. Half of the budget women have been given top positions for the lesbian romp for romantic only. If I wanted to see a vampire, I'd buy Muffy's Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> Cast bad, the story is bad and the effects are foul murky. This picture had some feasibility, but it served the embarrassing figure of a classic classic horror character and embarrassing illustration as its only fall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh some friends then I suggest you show this interesting fact. If you are looking for a more serious vampire action flick, use blades or underwire for your harmful bloodshed.
