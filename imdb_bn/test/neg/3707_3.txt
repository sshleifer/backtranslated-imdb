Bill Reben's "Bigfoot of the Bigfoot" is one of the worst horror films ever made. Greedy Silk owner Harvey Olson (Richard Kennedy) decides that he wants Bigfoot to take all the costs. Although the local game Danger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learned that Bigfoot was living in peace with a geological campaign and set to protect the animals. There is nothing interesting in this wireless piece here. This movie is filled with extremely relentless and terrible songs and cheap special effects. Gore, no mystery-just overcrowding. Avoid this awesome junk like a plug.
