One would believe that this game is obsessed with a number of people about a man. এবং নিশ্চিত, এটি একটি মজার বিষয় - একজন ব্যক্তি কি সহজেই সাধারণ কিছু হিসাবে স্পর্শ হারান এবং আশাহীনভাবে বিভ্রান্তিকর এবং বিপথগামী হয়ে ওঠে এমন একটি সাধারণ নাম হিসাবে কিছুটা বিভ্রান্ত হয়ে পড়তে পারে? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone will make a movie at this time. Unfortunately, there is nothing to be mentioned above, do not think about trailers (or even movie) you want to believe. I want to say that this number is only a MacGuffin, but this is not the case. It's meaningless A hostage A hook for the unexpected audience. <br /> <br /> What's the movie? A dog-catcher (Carrera) who was obsessed with Chasey Noir's crime book because he thinks that it reflects his own life. There Of course, the book character - Detective phingarim (bicycle) - for any reason (number 3), and disgusted with himself trapped and kyarei started to see the number everywhere .. but it's just padding and irrelevant story. In fact, you can cut all 23 references and the main characters can be covered with cheese or anything and you have the same story. It is painfully obvious that after the story has already finished, all "23" things were written in WAY for "recall". <br /> <br /> Which should be fine .. I guess .. If the movie was not dull, dull, dull. Half of the movie, chrissakes are described for. You are not watching the movie, you are describing this movie by Jim Carrey. About one-quarter Carrie book to read, and still horribly klica until the end of the dog catcher life, "real life" forced to watch are (where nothing will happen) reported Artie film, Aqua-Ish book "" views, which you Snickering or just plain will leave frustrated. It's like a poor person, like all of the violence, "Sina City", has been narrated by Kiri and shown at a gradual pace. Wig <br /> <br /> এটি সি-মুভি স্ক্রিপ্টের একটি সহজ কেস যে কোনওভাবে একটি মুভি কাস্ট দিয়ে চিত্রিত করা হচ্ছে .. সম্ভবত "সংখ্যা 23" হুকের কারণে যা আমি মনে করি কাগজে যথেষ্ট আকর্ষণীয় প্রিমিয়াম হলিউড চিকিত্সা ওয়ারেন্ট। However, since - I've already said - as far as this film about a Swiss cheese production over 23, that one can not feel anything other than hype. I <br /> <br /> "phingaralim - the film" 3 in 10 do, because I assume that it has humiliated me goyendatake, such as "Force", or me, "Battlefield Earth" and scale down as ruthless suicide Parts should be reserved for cruelty like them. But do not be afraid, it's still a beautiful lousy flick.
