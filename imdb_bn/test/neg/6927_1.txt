I really wanted to love this picture. I read my daughter's book and we all love it. Books are incredible. This photo is far from the book. The book is awesome - this image is a horror adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, respected, kind, firm, and never do anything annoying to return to someone. Point of this book! He behaves as a "princes" regardless of circumstances. An important part of a princess-like act is not to return the brutality. Treat how you treat how well being treated. <br /> <br /> In the book, she suffered a lot and touched others life. Other people see their ability to tolerate without their greed and hunger and vengeance, and then change their behavior. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has half a dozen hot hips. He is very hungry. He gave this wild little girl one swoop on the door of Beki. When the girl sees that how arrogant she is and how she feels dogmatic, she gives it to others. He gave 3 or 4 until he continued this work - I do not think how many people <br /> <br /> <br /> Unemployed looking through the window He is so motivated by what he saw, he presented the beggar girl as his own daughter. Other people are also affected by the same way. <br /> <br /> and in the book, his father died. The man next to him is a friend of his father - he is looking for him. Her father does not lose her money after all - people are happy to find out; He took him and his family home and raised them as their daughter. And Sarah has her entire legacy. <br /> <br /> Miss Mitchin is not a chimney needle. In fact, he remains in the same post at the school. But he told the new guardian of his unexpected treatment that Sarah insulted him. And talking to Miss Misin all over - Miss Minchin is trying to calm down and slow down his treatment, he mentions Miss Minchin as cruel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For Miss Minchin. He continues his sad existence. It does not matter - Sir is a guardian who loves him - and his beloved friend, Bakey, now has a home for all his intelligence and purpose, his sister. <br /> <br /> The book is about the love and honorable behavior under the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. This is a wonderful book. This image does nothing to capture true stories and book messages. My wife was so hateful, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stop it. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I do not think any reason for my life should change this image in this extraordinary book. Perhaps the book that Sherly Temple did was influenced by the horrific screenplay. I do not know - but this film is far from the book of characters and values ​​that I can not recognize. Do not waste your time - buy books. It's unforgettable ... even for a dad!
