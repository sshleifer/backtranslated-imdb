Considering the fact that Lam B-Awesome, who considers himself very seriously, considers an older adult dear who came to rent an apartment from a room to him. When Lozar's death is said, the mother has to go out to feed her food, and this causes some family pressure and attracts some attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that the film should bring fun. While B-Movie is happy to make the crowd happy, it has some light beef and schalky animals makeup effects although it failed to do so. I saw the bad but I would not give this a rec - 4.5 / 10.
