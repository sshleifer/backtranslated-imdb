I really will give this stinker more credit 1 stars, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's worth the price of the fare around. <br /> <br /> Actually, if you want to call it, it is so low and secure that the actor of Ed Wood has expressed his life. "Sammy," the only black character, must be the husband of Mimi in real life because she has shown her other films, but has her zero-acting ability. His lines are invaluable because of its illogical delivery, although I suspected that the sympathetic character was created. His old man is made up of his other turkeys ("bounded to the limit"), with a cotton ball eyebrow and white spray painted hair, a budget, junior high school quality. <br /> <br /> I can not really feel anyone buy this video, unless people want to throw their own mystery science theater teams and need a copy of something like that. It's really without fear - it's actually fun.
