Wretched Talk about botched. Every honor except POSEIDON Avenger is bad. Salvagers Michael Caine and Carl Malden decided to ruin the ocean liner called with a truly creaky tug boat. They are challenged by its gang of ruthless tele savalas and machine gun gun hats. Participating in this part, Kainain, Malden and Poseidon surviving another group in the reconstruction of parts, created the same dangerous track as the sinking ship. Among these teams, Sheryl Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boy, Sheryl Knight and Slim Pikens Jack Warden plays a blind man. Of course, after watching this mess you were willing to have you blinded. Sally Field is particularly annoying as Kane's buds as boring. <br /> <br /> Disaster Master Erwin Allen has not only produced this, he decided to direct it.
