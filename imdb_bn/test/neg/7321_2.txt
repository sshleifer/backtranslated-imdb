I saw this movie in a video with a few friends as a part of a Teen Comedy Triple Head along with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously we are not going for quality, but for air led entertainment and gross-out gags. Generally, we got what we got, but Wild Rumi was really standing: to become scared. <br /> <br /> First of the first impression, cover: The Norwegian release cover covers the breasts and the room in the apparently "crazy" background; Does the drunk stuff stuff the bunches of drunk half-naked girls takes up pictures? - "Crazy" room pictures on the cover were not even featured. And they will do the fun things you do? - missing. <br /> <br /> This movie is labeled comedy, which is a bit weird because it is not even distant funny. Relationship drama is more correct. <br /> <br /> Soon this film is about a young couple who inherited a terrible house in L.A., and forced to go to some room to finish. These roommates keep both of the couple's relationship with patience and testing because they are so "wild". The problem, they did not. And here's the problem of this movie: The dramatic couple are so reactive and neurotic that they manage to create zero sympathy. You find yourself rooting for the opponent Rumi through the film. Add moderate acting, lam dialogue and annoyance, and you've got yourself a movie which is left unseen. <br /> <br /> See something else.
