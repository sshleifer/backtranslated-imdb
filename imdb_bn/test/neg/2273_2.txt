Oh yes, I have to agree with others who describe it as unhappy. This four-hour feature is equally bad acting, bad at this point that I believe that any actor of this product could possibly earn living as an actor. I still amazed casting. Distribute their lines without any other character displayed with any kind of engagement or emotional investment. There seems to be a true relationship with someone else, family or otherwise. The direction is also humiliating and any action scenes are ridiculous and unconvincing. Film editors were asleep? <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be authoritative for the Regency period, but the clothes look dull in the 20th century and colors (especially blue color!) and I do not believe that at the beginning of the 19th Century fabric without silk <br /> <br /> Hair: Men's beauty is obvious in the 1970's, and females play "big hair" --- especially ladies un aliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are not quite made for it but for the lack of acting ability. "Annie" playing actress feels like she is in her fifty years, when Annie Elliot is 27 years old. I mean, where were the marupo and the crew of the discussion, if we play the girl Anne credible? Whether he is entering his house with his eyes for most of his time is giving horizon. I wonder what is still conveyed. Probably? Yes, this product is tragic! <br /> <br /> <br /> Actresses who are playing Luisa are really scary. He was screaming, shouting, screaming and like a sick person (he was about twelve years old) who was 12 years old, I felt that he could find himself in the moment when he was immediately waiting for himself. Think about how this behavior attracts an adult male. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " How do they get together again? Because Louisa was not a coma; That's specific. No, there is more than that and it has not been explained in the film. <br /> <br /> I rate this product for two stars: one of the reasons it was Austen's work, and because of some other outdoor scenes. The only reason I saw the whole production was that I was sick of flu and I found it in the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the book, see the 1995 version of Amanda Route and Sieran Hinds. I would suggest this picture even though reading the book.
