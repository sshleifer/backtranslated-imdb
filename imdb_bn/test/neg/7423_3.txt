Lance used to get quality support from James Cameron. Hack, he even had his own TV show (Millenium) for a Coupla season. Why is he doing this? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, some of them You can laugh only because of their ridiculous generation, their textbook is stereotyped characters, or often related to actor directors / producers. However, this movie has no redeeming value. I did not laugh. I do not cry I just had this sick feeling in my stomach. That feeling is quickly marked as teenage. At one point, Lance Henriken was a listed supporter. He is in Terminal (he is going to BE point before showing Arnold), Alien, AllianceIi, Classic B-Movie Pumpkinhead, among many others! I wanted to send him money later. Maybe we should start a support lens fund or something. <br /> <br /> Again, to do this thing ... maybe not.
