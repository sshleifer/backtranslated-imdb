Very disappointing and incomprehensible - now and then every idea will develop a germ and will be withdrawn from the next line - it was a feeling that the film was cut and re-cut to work it - I was bored and confused all the way through, and I have a series of Speaking as a huge fan. Most jokes were irrational and tired, the medieval section was much more prolonged and the performance was very bad - in some small guest places such as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham worked more than 30 seconds more than their mainstream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
