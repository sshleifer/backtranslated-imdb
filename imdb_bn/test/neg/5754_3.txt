Hercules fell into the same category as a lot of committed television productions, which could have been really fantastic, it could only be a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I like Kevin Sobo and his supporter cast, but I do not care for the program that was taken from the equivalent of their movie. I believe if they have kept the same format for this movie then this event would have been more successful. <br /> <br /> I saw the beginning and lost interest in the way. Later on I was faced with a strange episode, but it was lucky to focus on me so that it turned into a commercial break.
