Hercules: TV-Movie Hercules - A very fat and melted version of the story about the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer makes a good effort to play this hero. Shane Aston rehashes his Sage Gamgee image, rehashes the game by thrown into a character to make a friend-photo picture of the whole character, Lupine. I say in a moment, "We are in a bad state, Mr. Fredo, I mean Hercules," Unlike Timothy Hilton's father, Timothy Dalton (a little James Bond), it's a wonderful performance, something like Paris Hilton, who just stopped me. In some interesting and fantasy stories, the original story has been cursed. Special effects also do not help. Hydra's view of the original story, Niemann lion and herpes just ... well tail. I believe that the lives and effects of Power Rangers have appeared on my mind at least twice, and the Golden Hinds seemed to have made very few computers and that My favorite part of a very cool story is to determine whether the film is Greek, Roman or American It can not be played and it has destroyed the original story; it's a classic epic. Do not get bored with the direct DVD.
