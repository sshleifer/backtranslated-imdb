Why C Thomas Howell is not this movie? A large blockbuster of Cruise (one of the Howell's co-stars) WOTW and Howell's follow up with this link. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Production Price - I'll start with good things. The look and feel of some scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. Set-ups are okay in spots and the side is not too bad. <br /> <br /> script - terrible. The movie you like to permit is a series of incognito scenes that can be kept anywhere. The scene became pale in black and was rebuilt in the same room for a second time. Very poor story (but Cruise VoetW) blames a bit, but an unrealistic screenplay stops it. Special FX - OK, I do not want to be too strict here because I imagine the budget was smaller than the lunch hour of the cruise - but the overall effect of the movie is that the effects are poorly done. Some shots are quite impressive - mainly off the bridge away, Washington, the fishing boat off shot. But the main "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are horrible. Also the quality of the camera is unclear with some shots and is completely spent on others. Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but I've reduced myself to acting on this low budget flickr - she has succumbed a long time ago "acting over" bug. Watch her performance in The Hitchcock and compare this movie. There is no comparison. He overdoes his facial expression, his pavement and legs (where he found that running style ???) and look at a final coup-de-gras scene where he lost his family picture. Epilepsy But after all saying - he still shows the best actors here. Busey and Peter Green through his one and only view (Zed's really baby now dead) are mumbles frustratingly shameful. I can not tell the truth that he said one thing - I tried to enable subtitles in that scene - but the DVD does not have subtitles. HOWELL's son, director's wife and line producer, all seem to be a real-family family affair to be made into this film. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> Direction - Not bad but not good. <br /> <br /> Score - Disgrace <br /> <br /> Overall, do not do anything to try to get a hair duck effort that will bring him back to big time. He will look at Raukake and try to discover how he has returned to the list, but if he does something like that, then he will not have a career soon. <br /> <br /> 3/10
