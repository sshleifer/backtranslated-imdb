This movie started with some promises: the big name welding, the set looks good, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time it can not say it is a serious movie or comedy. One minute they are talking about how they do not enjoy killing and later there is a battle scene for fun music and fun banners. <br /> <br /> Some actors are quite bad, mainly Patrick Swage and Piper Perabo. He got some dirty lines, such as, "When I get married, it will be for love." Wig <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is that it's annoying. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plots, really nothing. Also, a movie with the title "Dragon" in the title should have a lot more dragon than some (and kindly CGI dragon) present in this movie. <br /> <br /> No good movies can be seen on the Saifai channel?
