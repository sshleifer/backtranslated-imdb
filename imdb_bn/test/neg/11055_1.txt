Screaming was a very low budget horror movie which was shot in the video. It's portable acting, poor light, a weak story, and some of the worst giant effects I've ever seen. In this plot, a college student is being pressured to join a fascinating landlord in a religion. A parody of Scientology with a book like Religion Dynastics This was a funny shot in this group, it was not for mobile phones and was not a product of production. The giant effects seem terrible and the quality of the photo feels like home video or public service announcement. I think this one should be shot on the movie movie that anyone can see.
