Underwood is a stupid story about a young man who confirms Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas) that he has to be kidnapped. The picture is ridiculously written, the subject is strange, the conversations have moved away from the place, and tremors, the actors do not even judge it much, Archikake is annoying forever, Ian Nicholas was unknowingly, Messi was honest, but only a very nice actor and possibly completely out of the project completely embarrassing His best effort not to come, he was at least tolerant. This is a stupid film in my eyes, sometimes annoying, not entertaining, just a movie that I will not recommend to anyone. IMDb rating: 5.5, My rating: 4/10
