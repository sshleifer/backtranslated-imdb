Do not see m Magu It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny at that. He is not funny from the wolf music movie. It does not take long to think that it is not a naked gun movie! The film's plot is ridiculously stupid. There was nothing funny in the whole movie. The first few minutes of the movie were animated to look like the old Magu cartoons. I wish the movie will have to stay that way.
