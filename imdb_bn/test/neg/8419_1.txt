I watched this video because I liked Malta and this film was completely portrayed there. Very frustrating, because it fails to find any smell or beauty of the island - only hot, dry and barbarian elements. The film is utterly disgusting, annoying, completely inconsolable from beginning to end, persuasive, and inadequate of any convincing plot. You must be an emotional to follow the plot line, or its lack. It was his moment, sure; But I'm going to the dentist. <br /> <br /> Seeing this harmful mess I will bear more than one Koliosko. It was very bad, I could not actually fall asleep. There are several "Eurotrash" movies which were evidently made without adult supervision. This is one of them. Who is the bright side, Nadia Kasini? Never before have I seen a beautiful set of legs. She is the only creator of this movie. <br /> <br /> There were annoying rashes at boring credit. A needle left on someone's convenience (Malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats, bats, etc.) and then set before the dog. Oh, well - though in spite of this movie go to Malta - it's a beautiful, colorful island; History is rich and lots of fun.
