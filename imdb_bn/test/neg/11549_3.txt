Of course, I expected James Brolin to see some beefcake shots tuned in this. Unfortunately, the first was, at the beginning, and the rest of the film was very long, and finally created a little sense. <br /> <br /> The story, what's in it, is the center of Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage cats for many years commences. Nick, a successful businessman, works for the neglect of Julie, who goes to school to try to fill the void. In the context of July, he and Nick began to form their first emotional emotions in form of strong sexual fantasies, which blocked the reality for a moment, that would ruin him and make him forget his papers. At first she imagined her husband, but with the progress of the movie, she began to imagine other men and she meets with random strangers. This culminates in her acting out of her imagination with disastrous results for the wedding. Can he and his husband rebuild their relationship? Is it valuable? <br /> <br /> This may be a fun generation, but the death penalty is so pleasing why you think that they are even bored. Characters are not improved. The purpose is not explained. Background information is not provided. There is no explanation about how Julie can control herself, no explanation for how she will do in the future. The last product is a mess messy which is confusing as Julie's imagination, which is amazingly upbeat. <br /> <br /> played a mixed bag. As Julie, Donna Mills works well with her stuff, though her continuous conflict with self-pity becomes conflicts. James Brolin works such as he is reading his line from Cue Card, and even hard to buy his anger on his wife's infidelity, she shows so little emotion on the whole problem. Supporting role mostly forgot. <br /> <br /> An interesting story can be what cures healing. More kindly, because it does not even offer candle candy to the eyes.
