'This life' is really as bad as it gets. The concept of tenant, sympathetic, cruel, confused, shallow characters is considered as a reflection of the post-detention and I must admit that it is a true creation. Unfortunately, it does not give me anything to sympathize or care about and I'm considering another step toward scams on television's premium-rated phones; Wonderfully bad, cheap, reality, and 'celebrity' saturated television; And other cut and run attitudes that destroyed this medium and, indeed, most of the British society. High quality word I do not think so. In this case, 'These Life' programs are often called as dominant ones.
