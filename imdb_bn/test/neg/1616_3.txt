I bought this movie from e-Bay as part of nearly 20 awesome flickr, about a dollar piece. While watching this, my first impression was probably at the end of the 80's. Then I started thinking - the poster of the wall of the Linkin Park and everything else indicates that I'm dealing with more recent movies. Understand that, the flick became an intolerable torment. The last 3 minutes was the longest movie history - the movie refused to finish. Does such a child have "awful for children"? In that case this film definitely does it. If there is a parent, it is quite the opposite to introduce the horrors of their children, I recommend that it is suitable for about 6-8 children. The only thing Greg Ships chose was the actor who was very good at the bottom of the Drive-in Double-Billy nostalgic Retro.
