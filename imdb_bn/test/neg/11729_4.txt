Dodgy plot, dodgy script, actually dodgy everything around. The most compelling performance is like Jonah Packula Lauren, but does not even rescue this pointless and ugly movie. Uninterrupted invitations of directors are not only to suspend the suspicion of viewers, but not to adjourn the verdict. Perhaps it may be steamy and appealing, but the film is less and far away in its boyfriend's moment. These things have been well made by lots of others. Do not find your way to see it.
