Due to the terrible soundtrack I had to reduce the ratings of this movie to 4. I'm sure it was not a problem with me or tape, because some actors and soundtracks looked fantastic. But most actors have become distorted, especially for non-brightness, out of recognition, proud <br /> <br /> There are many cute cute twists that make it an enjoyable movie - it's better to end in Bosnia by mistake. But most of the humorous words are lost.
