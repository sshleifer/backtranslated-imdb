I do not really see how this movie can be enjoyed. I do not think I've seen half of the movie that boring as this self-gratifying part of the trash. It would probably have been better if the director did not spend most of the film for his artwork, which is not really significant. Another thing that I did not like is that when a character encounters, then the melting of the blood will soon emerge. I do not know how people have shed blood in Japan, but I hope their blood donor has plenty of blood.
