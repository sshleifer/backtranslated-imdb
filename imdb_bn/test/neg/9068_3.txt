Do not worry - there are no spoilers here, just a very unlikely plot. A couple decides to live in her father's love room so that they can write a book / article / newsletter in a book with a famous tragic Hollywood starlet. This whole production ran like a high school troupe like an episode of "Murdere Right". The old fog that I was selling was the only one they interviewed for the story formula. Apparently, the director thinks that the movie is taking too long, so in the end, they have stopped their camera pointing to a wonderful image of Starlet and brought the plotters to cover this stuff. Do not waste your time - even trying these and the true horror / conspiracy the classic failed in this movie.
