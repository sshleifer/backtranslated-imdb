If you want to see which movie you want to break but study it very closely. In fact, it is so bad that why people buy it. Especially note that the scenes look like opening in about 5 minutes. The reality escapes from this movie at every level. Overall impression has given the average script below to anyone, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget. It was just being destroyed with such a formula. <br /> <br /> I once hired, and swore, I saw it. If you are a human, then buy this awesome, terrible movie and burn it - as a worldwide grace. It has no intelligent plot, bad acting, and then tossed into something bad about ugly things really caps off really whole things. I would recommend a tape dry paint dry before this stupid waste! Seriously Paint will be good. I could give this negative 10 stars.
