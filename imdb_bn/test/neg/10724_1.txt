What a terrible misfire Not just the title, but a few decades ago the concept of George Fonda, George Segal was the same. Why? I wonder, someone with Jim Carberry's clout, the only star, but will produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He may take comedy on a whole new level, instead, he can safely assume as he can assume. Money, money, grosses, christmas But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess is very short legs. I felt that how I call it uncomfortable. I tried to be fun on the screen aware of the terrible attempt. And fail, sad. This can be a disgraceful, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the Enron Day post, but which can be very risky. What a shame!
