Giving me good words to my friends, I rented this movie, hoping at least the same movie, the "House Party" smile would be the same, but I was very frustrated and very bored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When watching a movie it is not a good sign to fall asleep. I do not know it did not appease to me because I do not live in "The Hood" or if I'm not black, it's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> It tries to snatch a few movies, bringing only a few smiles, but in the long run, it tragically fails. Miss it
