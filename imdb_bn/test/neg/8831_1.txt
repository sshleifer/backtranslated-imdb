I want to make it very clear that I am not all religious. I'm an atheist but I can see that Richard Darkins was once again contradictory. I also want to inform that I am not a person who always opposes anything with philosophy, but I think that while comparing science and religion, we must be philosophical and will be willing to question the main flow science. Alongside religious questions are being questioned. <br /> <br /> I think Richard Darkins never takes any time to think philosophically for faith, someone who feels long and difficult about science and religion, will understand that science is a religion itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are held in comparison to other religions, but in its roots, it is believed in a certain human being. <br /> <br /> Throughout this series, Richard insists that science is the only correct way to think about the method and evidence is strong enough for it to be believed only. If you are deeply deep-rooted in science, you will realize that it is as illogical as religion and it ultimately depends on faith, belief in evidence, trust in our affection, belief in our senses, but more than that, in other words, our repetition of belief patterns repeatedly Follow. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics are decided, because it was the most common type of repetition. That we are aware I think there is a tendency among people that they believe that there is something left in the existence of certain states or positions, we simply believe from blind faith that it is more likely to be like this. For example, we do not expect that gravity will suddenly work tomorrow, this means that I would push it away if I wanted to attract it. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is because we have long known that it is always as far as we are aware of. But this does not mean that it can not exactly turn in the opposite period or even. It does not matter if a particular state or change may have some time, but there is no reasonable reason to create an idea about it, but we can not. What would I ask you to consider a long and short amount? There is no such thing, I do not know how these supposedly wise men can decide that everything must be made from objects, words, light etc. But they should be given what they consider as a threshold! Let's talk a lot more than 1.2 billion billion years ago! Is it a long time? 99999999999999999 years think that the year is 12 million billion years incredibly short. We know that the so-called laws of science can be radically changed in the trillions of years. It is comparatively everything, only when we compare things we can say "it is long" or it's short. It's big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and the same with others. <br /> <br /> I doubt if any scientist can tell me why he believes this idea. I certainly do not see why it should be done, but that does not mean that as humanity we must stop using it. Remember, Richard Dawkins's most hypocritical comment when he said that faith is irrational, he called "the process of non-thinking". If we are describing what we are describing in our innocence and this is not the belief that we hold on some level, but I do not know what it is. Another time when he is hypocritical, he talks about religion as a bronze age, he says, "the fiction of the bronze era". I want to see how many scientific methods have changed over the years due to experience, examination and evaluation, the rules of science are becoming old and old! They may even be described as the Holy Bible of the science. He was suddenly sick of various religions that he "I am fine, he is wrong" but looking at him how uncomfortable he was to various interviewers, he saw himself so lively. To be fair to him, at least he did not try to make bombs in religious communities. I realize his hatred towards some religious beliefs of fighting the war, but I do not respect his arrogance towards his own faith. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science. That's his way. I am scientifically psychologically, but I do not think it is right to go to religious leaders with an unreasonable argument, trying to strengthen his opinion and often describe it as stupid. In spite of all his teachings, experiences and discoveries seem to fail to stay knowledge of his beliefs in order to properly question his beliefs. What I say in protest of this argument that he reads as the psychological atheists like my soul is open, he advises me to say that he is completely absent from this point. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary, the origin of all the bad. This is the religion of all evil, it is not true. There are some bad reasons that do nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> There was frustrating, narrow, confusing and flat-out garbage around the documentary series.
