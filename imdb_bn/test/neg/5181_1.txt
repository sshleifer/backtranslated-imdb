All of these movies are exorbitant AVOID beyond !! I want to return my hour and 20 minutes ago !!! <br /> <br /> Not everyone is funny, you can also laugh or even smile on this movie. Voices sounded like speakers, everyone is becoming more annoying at the end and contributing to comedy or plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!). <br /> <br /> To everyone, it's a hair-a $ 5, wetted-down-type- "out cold" is a film - but very awesome. The film targets almost two groups of a city of Poories and Richies (how stupid?), Where the two opponents are in a snowboard battle with each other. (The story is like a story about a 4 year old bed, without all the oaths and fools jokes). <br /> <br /> Movie - 1/10 - Because you can not give a low score
