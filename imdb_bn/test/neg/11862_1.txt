After all, to underline me, I'm not a great fan of political purity. Actually I like satirical or dark humorous, even it makes fun of minorities. Because, I am sure why the appearance of this racist work is not worth it, it does not make fun of the status of the life of minorities, their social status or the way of society's behavior. Moreover, it uses every stupid stereotype and bias to strengthen genomic feelings and reservations. It's really a sad, but a surprise, that other comments did not get that point, we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations
