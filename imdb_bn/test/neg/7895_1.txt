I watched this movie with my boyfriend, a warm hip-hop fan, and he was really looking forward to seeing "soul" that the movie was demanding. Boy, we were wrong. When I finish watching the movie, I feel two things: Repentance and relief. I was sorry to see this harmful piece and regret to see my relief because I saw it only free on cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gave bad name to black people, so awful I believe all the smart black people have been trying to spell that stereotypes. I am Asian, and I made this movie feel very sorry and sick. What else to say? Bad writing, even worse acting, and terrible tales. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie even if you die and have no other choice. Seriously The film can not really give anything, except if you want to see minor illegal drinking, animal killings, women's deterioration, and overall want to see anything: it really is real non-communal-difficult-hard film Ish
