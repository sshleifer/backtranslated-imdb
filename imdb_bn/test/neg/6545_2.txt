The only interesting part of this movie is the jazz and the back drop of Rega New Orleans. It tries to be one of the films that confront two battles to defeat Heroni, from the past and the current one that he fails to believe firmly. The acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised at all that this video went straight. The end result of this film does not leave any satisfied or convinced with the actor.
