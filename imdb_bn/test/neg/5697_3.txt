Generally, I would say I do not like this actor. It was not okay for acting, though it was okay. Not for the script, which was so much. Because I usually liked this movie, for the intense steps, which started to start and did not end until the final credit rolls. However, the problem with this movie, and I felt it a big problem, the awesome CGI.it looks like they ran out of the meaning and the shot could not complete the impact. Most of the effects seem to be in their eyes that they are in their very irrational form. Because it was obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they could not publish it. Indeed, the effect seems to be insulting. Do not care about creating a decent end product for consumers. If not for this, I would give a lot of rating to this movie. My vote for my panic is 3/10
