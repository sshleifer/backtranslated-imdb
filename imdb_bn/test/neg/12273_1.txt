It looked cool from the movie slieve, but after five minutes we were not sure that it was not a lesbian documentary in the Western novel, without any woman's interest. The film's quality was poor, and there was adequate gang war arrangements to hold enough interest in watching the whole movie. Both actors and filmmakers can have the love of the soul, which I can only describe as my new one and for that reason I do not want to see (or believe) the Australian made movie. I have to write more so I will say again that the actors are so bad that I'm positive, I can make a good movie with a box of 15 dollars and a trojan box. Please do not watch this movie for yourself.
