What should i say I just saw this curiosity, and it's really embarrassing ... I grew up in Brittany with the Celtic legend, and spent 5 years at Rennes, in the city, which says ... Shame that the actor is not an actor or camera, and sometimes Rene's coming. They could have at least chosen a possible city or possible forest, but nothing like Brittany or Rennes could be ... and calling a movie about Celtic legends really made the audience falsely. In addition to that description, it might be a good film, but it's a crap. Innocent scenario, silly characters and no originality. Of course avoid.
