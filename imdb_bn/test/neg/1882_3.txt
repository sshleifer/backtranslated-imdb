Unlike the terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolia, I leave feeling very disappointed with the movie theater. I started to get started in the beginning of characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationship. I even cried But in the end I had no sympathy for the characters. The final work does not seem to be compatible with the mother's character. So, though the acting was good, I thought the film was frustrating.
