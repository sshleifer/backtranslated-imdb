I would like to say that Crisinski is the only reason I also saw this movie. He is good However, the average of any other image about this image is so low that it is not worth watching and worth trying on this movie. This film has technical / aesthetic problems: selection of shots, framing, camera movements in single signals, extremely poor editing (probably due to lack of liquids in between shots), and overall terrible acting (except Crisinski) . <br /> <br /> This is a lot of dramatic and presentation) for the development of any kind of suspicious moment in this movie ... which is wonderful because it's a bank robbery, which should be at least a bit exciting. <br /> <br /> What made this picture worse, then released, and then delivered? <br /> <br /> The kind of a C film student reminds me of the Thesis project, probably not even better.
