This movie was terrible. You can not move quickly to reach the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally hit the eject button in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I ever experienced. All dein coins are worse than combined film. In the beginning, acting was terrible. I understand that the main actor was alive from the live cast, but someone would think that any TV experience gave them more talent. Other major issues were the quality of movie camps visual effects and poor film quality. In film defense, the theme of the event was very good and the story was just fine.
