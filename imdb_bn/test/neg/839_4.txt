There is a lot of money behind this generation, so its appearance is very good. This included some interesting appearances at the beginning of Gilbert Rowland, Eddie Barnes, and Christopher Lee. Some exciting gunfights, and a ridiculous bit or two - Dangano's mockery, no unnamed people, and Sabata fun, especially when the name of the failed President of the Mexican Revolution is given. <br /> <br> The problem is, there is no purpose to rid spaghetti Westerns. The main ingredient of spaghetti is Irene, which is easily mixed in the comedy; In fact, Spaghetti's source source is Kuorasawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the best black comedies of all time, and most spaghettes easily wade into the real comedy of the extremely sophisticated variety. Perhaps its best evidence is found in Trinity, which is both open spaghetti and open-snap-stick comedy. So why is there a continuation that - by its nature - mock oneself? As a result, I think the whole enterprise is basically helpless. Not one of these characters was the person I was ever caring, the story was generally general, and the production values ​​reflected only the meaning involved, not the director's emotions. Above all, it is a cashless and vain attempt to cash in the event of a mock event.
