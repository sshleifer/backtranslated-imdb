The director / lead Larry Bishop tried the way, is very difficult way with Hark Ride. The film is intense, malicious, provocative, wants to be unexpected, it bites all, perhaps a quintin tarantino / rob zombie style. But it is not intense. Feel obliged to reference The dialog fails to be tricky and fails. Humor is never fun. Try to set a nice radioactive tone, but take care of the story to make our character or story remotely successful. <br /> <br /> What's left with you is Harry and the cool girls around a bunch, old and shaped "bad boys", which seems to be an attempt to modern SÃ©rigueo Leon West. If this movie is interested in the new generation of movies in the 60's and 70's, it is for Kados. But on himself, it is rather annoying and irrelevant. I do not believe there is a place for style on the substance. But this movie is not it.
