I already heard Ali Ji at Madonna's music video "Music". I always feel funny. (Actually, he really is.) Last year I always thought of buying a VDD "Ali Ji Indahouse". After a few months, I bought it cheap and I started to see it. <br /> <br /> But the movie made me amazed. My older brother and I was hoping to be a great sunny comedy. It proves that "indiehouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really bad. It has clear sexuality content and very funny humor. It did not let me laugh, even a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Hey way, I've planned to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali Ji was really different from his TV shows - just like in negative way. Maybe he was really well worn and serious enough to make this flick. Some sex scenes do not mean that it is frustrating (because sometimes it's not too ridiculous). For the first time, I was disappointed with him. That really made me sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie above 1. Actually, I really want to rate it 0 rating. This is one of the worst movies of my life. I would not recommend anyone that would like to see the good comedy that is not very good or awesome.
