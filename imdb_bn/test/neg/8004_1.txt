If they do not use Brian Conley as a gangster and do not start the film with Christopher Bigins, then the film could be better. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were many double cross and plot twists to make the film credible. The film is responsible for 0, but I saw that it is not like 0. I gave it 1. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this film to my worst enemy, rather I will push the ribs of my eye and then some rusty scissors compared to this film watch. I'm telling you, this one hour of my life and one and a half hours I will not return. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, do not drink it. Instead, look for "big time off" or "lock, stock and two smoking barrels".
