**** Spirir Alert **** My lover, some friends, and I hired this movie as part of a really marathon movie. We knew sort of what we were getting. But the lack of intrigue, direction, and special effects was really expected for a great (or passable) battle scene among our two main characters ... the poorly supplied Swimming Cobras and super violent giant comodo (which people eat like ice cream) ... We'd like to get it to the end, but due to the possible budget or time constraints it had to be reduced? It's ridiculously bad for its release quality, with a lot of details detailing by other readers. If you recommend this movie you will cry yourself in onion cut.
