Irwin Allen reflects his talent: He is the producer and director of this cartoon "epic" about a nuclear submarine and his effort director to reduce the radiation radiation surrounding his earth. Despite an eclectic shield of potentially exciting stories, fails to take off.

Good for a few stray laughs, but Alan does not know the difference between strong, strong adventure and campy messy. After a popular TV series. ** **** to
