Tripe this guaud-terrible piece is all over. The script is bad, the plot bad, the acting is bad. It has a number of decent actors (Charles Darning, for example), but the director could not find anything from them. The plot line feels Santa, feeling and thinking that to try to bring his father back together with his father, he does not need a little girl all over the country. It's a swimming parlor in the swimming swimming pool (played "Isaac" from the love boat) on the shoulder, the world's largest LF (played by Bruce Willnach - is a very funny person, but no actor), a harsh factory owner who has been working on Christmas Eve Employees work overtime, and a secluded nation where someone tries to win Santa's ski. If the plot seems bad, it's bad on a small screen. If you come to this movie later, watch, do not walk, on your television and unplug it. You can blow up your television to remove any remaining infections. If you see it for more than 10 minutes, then you have to burn your television and install a whole new line of wire organization.
