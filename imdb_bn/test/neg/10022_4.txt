1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movie. "Friday 13th" and "burning" might be the best, but "do not go into the drowning woods" and it was like many other stingy-like ones. But in all fairness, "Priy" is not bad at all, "do not go to the woods" but it's still not cool. One thing is that it's just boring and not very good, but better than "DGITW" and this movie is actually some interesting looking female, its three female lead was stunning. What happened to an unqualified wildlife footage seems to be only vain and used as a director, which is used only for some time to fill the space. <br /> <br /> So, what was this movie? Well, after a few moments of laughter he started to laugh - to go away from Chile Chilla-walking, when the final girl was a fascinated moon-walking, I did not look glugles and there was some good killer scene - my favorite girl died with a sleeping bag; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said ,
