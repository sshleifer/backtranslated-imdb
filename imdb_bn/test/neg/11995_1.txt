A movie's total and curiosity taunts. The film, like 'Dark Power', will also be embarrassed to release Tromba. The script, direction, acting, and verb sequence are so scary that it will not help to be almost painful and thinking to look at. It can only cost well during running 75 minutes. The above critic must be related to the director, because I can see it to evaluate the junk, some people may think it's a b-movie fun or 'better than bad', but to enjoy it only, but when the main actor (and most Experienced actress member) can not express his lines faithfully, you know that you have a very, very bad movie Eche. Avoid all costs.
