Another horror movie about hockey. If I did not see the hockey and saw the Hollywood version, I hated the game. This movie does not look great on that in Canada. I can laugh at it and do not take it very seriously. This movie is terrible, as well as everything you can do in 80's movies. Finally, do not even watch on TV. 4/10
