Years ago, I used to see deliberately bad movies. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture ring is true. Fits any facial expression or action. I did not hear such inappropriate music for a film. In the final scene, I was going to drive a car to run that ridiculous baby - sometimes the worst child actor. <br /> <br /> I only heard one name - Wilford Breamley. He was very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> Check out this movie, there is no limit! You have been warned !!!
