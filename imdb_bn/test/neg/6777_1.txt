When I could not sleep, I saw this cartoon on television one night. It does little help. I looked at the roof and saw myself trying to forget that face. I would not be happy to see this cartoon again, only because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, do not make me wrong - I love fairy tale and nursery rhymes as anyone. But this twisted and awesome rendition is easily annoying. It's mainly cruel smiles, and exaggerated features that make me scared, and I still have nightmares due to it. Please, I request you not to let your children see it. Far away, Far is very scary. Please, I pray you, keep away.
