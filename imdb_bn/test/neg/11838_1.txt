This movie is not worth 1/10. This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swore that at least 30 minutes of the film was copied through Carnosaur 1, 2, and 3. The whole movie "Rockstar" was based on the film and it was a kind of trick to copy "really exciting, action packed, dinosaur". I liked the movie series and kept it in a movie that is coping with the coming of America without making a model that is not even capable or willing. I recommend you first watch the carnosaur movie (all) and recommend it, and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
