I had a good time at first 45 minutes. Or so, but then suddenly it was all down the hill. The mystery may be somewhat slim and the joke somewhat starts to be the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> But the problem with this picture is being cleverly trying to make fun, such as the Tarantino and God the old stuff. Sometimes the Teretino is getting a little more excited, the film is too late for ten years. Best for teens, and I'm sure many of them find Johan's funny character, which he is for the first 30 minutes. The other problem with me is that the story is over, you tried to find a recovery point. Probably it was not restored because the lack of passion to try to be tricks funny Also, like many movies, sure, good actors who do not think it can afford good conversations are not claimed, or simply close the script.
