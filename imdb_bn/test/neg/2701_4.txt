As far as I have seen, I saw every single Gene Rollin film, and it always bothered me because it is a highly acclaimed euro-trash monument and is very popular among many regular critics on this beautiful website; Those whose opinions I always value and generally agree with. Obviously everyone always marks some of the frustrating and stylistic film trademarks in my completely lost work. Rollin's movies are unimaginably annoying, they all have the same basic idea (lesbian vampire settings in different settings), incredibly funny conversations, wonderful gothic settings are always unused and production prices are cheaper than bus ticket prices. I actually gave up in Rollin's Repertoire (especially after tolerating "The Iron Rose") until I found "Hunting Night". Lazily, this film does not feature any hairy lesbian vampires and stands as a terrific horror movie with terrible killings and macarre plot twists. And what is the verdict? Yes and no! On one hand, it was the pleasure of seeing it so far (and only that I saw without dozing off)? It is the most compelling and innovative Rollin 'film so far? On the other hand, it still has a Moroccan movie to compensate for neutral plot and neutrality in a casual sexual order. Gene Rolin tries to try to create an atmosphere of privacy and confidential environment with the majority of information and the lack of strange characters, but he will not really be able to keep the truth secret. Curiously beautiful lead actress Brigata Lahayee and beautiful evil musical guideline is the only element that hides you on the screen. During the night while driving back to Paris, a young man had to stop for a confused and rarely dressed girl, who ran away from the wood. His name is Elizabeth, but still he can not remember anything about himself and about what he was running away from. His case of memory is so bad he even forgot him constantly. The next day, he kidnaps an old man again and takes him to a horrific apartment complex where more than one person is detained in the same malicious mental state. Elizabeth knows nothing, but she needs to escape from here. Obviously I will not express sanity, but I can assure you that it is a fool, irrational and remote Clearly, Rollin also realized it, because the explanation was kept very short and fast. There are lots of strange weird and intelligent sequences, sex footage is horrifying and emotionally depicted without, the effects of nasty make-up are thrown cheaper and randomly without the intentions. Saying, the score is becoming fun and Brigitte Lahiye's perfect body shiny addicted.
