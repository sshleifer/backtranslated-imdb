I enjoy different types and attributes films. Whether your ideal ideal Hollywood action movie or your Oscar season tear-maker, movies that meet a certain standard will often be enjoyable for me. <br /> <br /> Soap Gerley, I got nothing but confusion. First of all, we meet Maya, a massage parlor worker who attracts all the customers of the parlor. A virgin named Harry comes one day and they fall in love. Then, there are some plasters and crowns that do not seem to lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> While many have commented on an Asian prostitution controversy that is being exploited by white people, remember that this image was created by an Asian director who wanted to bring light on this issue. But whether he is successful or not, no matter, no matter why the movie is not enjoyable. <br /> <br /> For me, soap girls failed to meet the expected standards from the movie. With loose plot and medieval acting, it was difficult for me to engage in emotion with this film. Bad, it seems that if the director wants to create a play, when the tone falls further towards comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like a movie that fails to stop me from the movie's magic, will always leave me uninteresting. Throughout the film, I could not help but think, "Is it really?" The question that will be answered before creating a movie. If not, then an empty push to give viewers attention to what you will finish. <br /> <br /> Grade: D + <br /> <br />
