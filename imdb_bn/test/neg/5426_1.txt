O my God, this stupid. Completely vain, objectionable, and annoying. The authors really have a problem like getting joe and cheez, we all want them too! Normally, there are many plot clashes on the show, wow, what's the idea. Also, you can not separate Zoey 101 episodes from each other because the same thing happens every time. Quinn absorbs Dustin for some strange things, Nikola is strange and stupid, Joey is just like him, after all Chess Slabs, but he fails to notice that weirdly, and Logan is a blur. Repeat. Quinn absorbs Dustin for some strange things, Nikola is strange and stupid, Joey is just like him, after all Chess Slabs, but he fails to notice that weirdly, and Logan is a blur. Repeat. It's like a shampoo bottle. And the movie ends, omg again So nothing in vain is frustrating. It is specially designed so that the movie can fit in any two episodes of the show and after the plot of the film, the show will remain completely unchanged.
