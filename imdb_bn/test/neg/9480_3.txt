Oh yes, I admit I was guilty by seeing this piece of trash. I can not say that I was forced by the aliens who took a gun on my head, tied me with a chair and made it impossible to stop my eyes and then turned this horrific excuse for a movie. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through folk events here. Acting humiliation of humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - Character development is horrific - you are so rare that the characters that appear in the movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They know their average comic book. - The edit is soft and unknown. Less key to camera work. - The conversation is the worst in cinematic history only. - Instructions: Well, I did not say it was a hitcoat. <br /> <br /> To add these events, sometimes there was no talent involved. The director should now smoke cracks to forgive himself for this poison in the world. <br /> <br /> The following line: Passport is one of the worst movies ever made in Paris. Permanent!
