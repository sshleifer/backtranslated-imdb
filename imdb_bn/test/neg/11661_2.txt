Kamal Hassan's acting and moderated version of Mrs. Dffiger's Hindi Rimak is a slightly violent version and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan is still struggling with the Hindu dialogue all these years, and can not manage even a single scene is endless. People have been in the age and it will give a rest. Hassan does not bring anything new to the role, Dustin Hoffman does to Tutsis, or the Marathi actor Makkindranath Kambli plays with Mavishi (aunt) in Maori Mavishi (Muru's aunt, comedy play). <Br <br /> <br /> If Diwali is not the kid playing with kid? Most of the romantic 'Cross-Connection' of Aash - Aamir, Parse and then the original story of Johnny Walker is invaluable. Tabu swan scenes were unnecessary. The family is North Indian, but on the night of curve, it will be reminded by 'Maharashtrian' chachi. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See original Miss Doubtfire - Clear Crunching with crisp and fun, in contrast to Chichi 420.
