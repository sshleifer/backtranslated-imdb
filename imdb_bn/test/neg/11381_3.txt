"Ghost Gold" Lamberto Bava's Best Movie, as well as his worst. I guess that statement needs some little explanation. This is its best because it is well-known, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but its worst because it is indeed a huge isolation for all the real fans of the worst of an inferior, unreasonable film and bout's past effort. Let's face it: Many fans, I was definitely involved, were not interested in the title of the film's famous names and even boring sounding judgments. The only inspiration here was Lamberto Bava, who brought us a lot of slow and funny splatter movies in the past. His return to "Ghoosh Sona" is accompanied by a bit of the film "The Torture", and although there is definitely not a good film, at least in the lines of his fans' expectations, excessive sludge, blood and sadism. "Ghost Sona" is also talking about a weak and intolerable soft horror movie, even the mainstream ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on the sensitivity, and this badly affects already already limited number of already awesome and tropical atmospheres. There may be one or two possible good ideas in the basic premises, but the film is fairly incomprehensible and much more clinched. John Hannah and Laura Harring star as a happy couple, living in a remote farm in South Africa and horse breeding for living. Joy and happiness are not likely to improve, so naturally some tragedies are bound to happen, and it does. Mark died in a car accident, but the obscure stasi continued to contact with the clay spirit where he remained on the farm. She even gets pregnant with her child, but soon after the birth of Martin's birth mysterious events began to happen. It seems as if Marc's troubled and selfish demon hold her child and uses him to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, most of the events and sub-plots are unproductive and / or logical maid remains unknown like Thunder's entire background. There are only a few steps, and only truly horrible moments are borrowed from classic movies such as "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (Green Goo, self-moving furniture?). Terrible entertainment "ghost gold" is purely a painful misfire to speak, but it should be said, it is a beautiful and enchanting looking failure. Cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really innovative and counseling. Moody score is sometimes managed to create an evil environment although there is nothing to any significance that is happening on a screen. There are several beautiful images of South African wildlife for appreciation, but if it shows your interest then I think you have stopped seeing the National Geographic. Here's a lot of recommendations. Supporters of an atmosphere-driven ghost story have a lot of options to choose from and the hard-working physician has been advised to see "Demons", "Macbre" or "The Black in the Dark" (again).
