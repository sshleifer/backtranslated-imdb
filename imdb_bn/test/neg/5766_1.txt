I found that the film was given two stars more than some people. They will not be completely dark for acting, direction and other flaws in the industry. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I could not force myself to sit through the whole movie, it was just too bad. <br /> <br /> Three of the first characters, not including "diggers", were just awesome actors, and I mean! Maybe the manager does not care, or he might be a bad manager. It was like watching a bad school play. The film was originally portrayed with a video camera (not a real movie), and the light settings were not very good. In addition, the word man (if he was one) had been a novice or drunk as the word was casual. In the kitchen first scene (AWFUL acting btw) the term was quite bad from the dialog. For example, when the woman moved her head while talking, you could hear her voice invisible and return. When they turn their head, the volume seems to be trying to fix post-production in a bit. In addition, you had the annoying sound running from camera sources or other sources of kitchen. <br /> <br /> This is the first 5 minutes or so of the screamer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was not in your mobile phone unless your movies have very little value or just bad taste. You are warned! SB.
