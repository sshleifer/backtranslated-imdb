Karves Barnesen has conducted a horrific film about chemical weapons to release in a sports competition and to move towards mad monsters. We found that the staff at the radio station accepted the report. <br /> <br />'s moments are mostly but it's like a live-time horror movie with breast and blood. Here are some really good ideas, but they just do not work. In fact, the film's ideas are better operated in a film called Pantulup which works mostly in many cases without giving us anything and creating excitement. This shows our stuff and it seems just cheap. Looking back at the favorite favorite picture, Pontifull will be seen again.
