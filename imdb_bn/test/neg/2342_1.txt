To me, this film is a very long-march Teen Party movie, which includes all the usual clich√©s and annoying stereotyped characters (Men, Jokes, Popular Girls, Slaye Boys etc.) but with an underlying anti-drug / drink theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an unpleasant chance to watch this picture, keep an eye on all references to liability and keep it real (how do you say it again) I think only calm this movie, if they can play on TV But it will burn in the fire. That, or DVD, it was in the explosion ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10000 - See Animal House instead.
