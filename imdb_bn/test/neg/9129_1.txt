Dear reader, check out! This movie is not really a movie, though its makers have the illusions to call it. If you are not careful about its content here it goes: The movie is simply a sequence of images that flows continuously and is trying to send a specific feeling, idea. They can be called, so, symbols. The image is accompanied by a soundtrack, the purpose it is creating the atmosphere. However, the pictures that the director chose can only send feelings to the American audience, because they are an unusual American icon in numbers. Although the film was intended to reveal the concept of "civil war", it was not only due to general chaos, but it also failed to work as a very long and tedious cause and I felt strongly that there are not many views in which "war" . Finally, I was frustrated by a documentary that is not a documentary, a movie that is not a film, a "something" whose only strong position is the extraordinary use of image processing technology.
