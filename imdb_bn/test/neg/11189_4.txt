I'm a big fan of spiritual art, but Bunuwel (with some ideas from Dali) has kept me cold. Bunuel was long-lived against the Catholic Church and was glad to try to insult the Catholics in fairly stupid ways. This is the silliest one; Just like what you expect from a smart-alike cute 18-year-old movie. The last few minutes of the movie, there is nothing to do with anything else, the final ultimate nose-thumb of religion <br /> <br /> If you read this slow, sometimes ridiculous film "scholars", it is about how the Church and society are guilty of sexual abuse. If it is indeed a point, then Bunyel expresses it in the highest circular fashion. The central male character is a nasty barbarian who loves to kick the dog and push the blind men down the street and those who make billboard advertising mentally in strange sexual fantasies. This behavior is the fault of the church (for interrupting its romantic barriers), or is he just a jolt? I voted for the next. I think that Bunuwel should have many personal hangouts and the Catholics have to blame. <br /> <br /> In a few moments you can cry, "Oh! Prehistory!": A cow bed, a giraffa is a window (a poor model), a man jerking a feather pillow, while flushing a toilet we seething Lava (or a mud pit ... B / W is difficult to say) Falling down to see the picture falling. The rest forgot self-indulgence Unfortunately, Bunuel was pursuing the same bogey-man through his career remnant (Viridiana, intelligent skin ...). If you are interested in seeing the spirituality on the screen, then see Gene Kotteca's basic work.
