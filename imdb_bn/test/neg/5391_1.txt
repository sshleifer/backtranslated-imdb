I have liked many people here, who bought this movie in my local WM for "$ 11.00 two cheap" - Binat. I love cheesy b horror and sci-fi movies, and this one definitely fits that category. Most of what here is what everyone said is dead. Yes it was bad, but that was expected. My "main" problem with this movie was that it was basically Borring. I mean seriously yawn-o-ram. The performance was bad, the clothing (the K-Mart Scalter team was approximately 1982) was bad and the edit was horrific. No continuity Mr Skelter died in a blast extreme ... Oh, though he faced multiple explosions throughout this step. I think the last one has taken his toll on him. Apparently this "military" group (cough) took his horse on his horse before ... it would change from red to black throughout this festive festival. Even for a B movie, make yourself a favor and skip it. This is my only good job now to add to my DVD collection. Hope someone will not be able to see my movie collection. Lip down, big time.
