The only known sign of the Vampires of John Carpenter, this film is held in Thailand and involves a community of bad vampires who kill people and are involved in a community of good vampires. Although there is an interesting concept to set up a vampire movie in Thailand, the author does not think much about foreign people. This image can be easily set to Los Angeles. Which brings me to the next point, which seems like a lot like this Blood Lite. We got rock soundtrack, martial art battle scene, a dance club vampire and, of course, sharp objects are going through many vampires. We do not have budgets and talents. Yes, the hero was a good martial artist, his performance was not very good, and for him the good work of wire work and many resurgent war sequences, probably many. The problem is that they do not have the same effect on one of the blad films. Perhaps it seems that the film "saw it" However, the biggest problem for me is that filmmakers did not take enough time to establish a relationship between leadership. , Played by Buff and Bland Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. She gets hijacked in the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. At this moment we have no interest in his welfare and there is no reason to believe that his lover is willing to risk his neck to protect him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With your time, like renting a blade movie.
