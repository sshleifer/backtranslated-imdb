If you want a fantastic April Fool's joke, please show everyone this movie to anyone. However, it is important that you do not criticize the film in any way, rather it is an artistic victory and how they talk about "do not make it better films". Many of your victims use a lot of disconnected and obsolete scenes (such as an intelligent dog being punished for a clear reason, a cow standing on the bed, a statue of a statue, or Jesus is definitely raping a woman), "Brightness "," juxtaposed "or" transcendent "- acting all the time as the film actually makes perfect sense and an hour of your life Not screwed waste Also (and if) they say that they do not understand directly and think that cow coworkers were all artists, then make sure to face direct face and shocking shocks. Then, to make them mess more, show all the comments on their IMDB, almost everyone (without causing problems like Almas and Roupart), this movie focuses on genuine and artistic! When you are done with this little sheet, they probably think that they would make an appointment with stupid and psychological. <br /> <br /> My only possible reason to see this horrific mess of this movie !!! Or, you can show them to the prisoners to talk to the prisoners in Guant√°namo! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, Dog's famous painting Poker or Velvet Alves painting is a famous painter.
