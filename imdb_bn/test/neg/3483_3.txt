This movie is a big stereotype. Acting (except Philbin and Harrison) makes horror and horrible scripts just make things worse. "Local" characters should be considered ridiculous as another matter, and should agree with another review that "Caucasian" characters are made. 3 of 3 stars 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf view. (**** between 1/2 *) for the right of Hawaii see "Alha Summer" (**) and / or "Parked Parked" (***), especially BP which I saw and bright.
