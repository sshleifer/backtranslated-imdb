If you search for a movie with beautiful shots of Mount Everest, you can enjoy this movie. Just move on to the mountain's opinion. <br /> <br /> However, if you believe in me that life is precious and not destroyed, this film will release a bad taste in you. Face 6 people have died, 5 people from Sherpa and a member of the Japanese team, so one person can try to Sky Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> There is a question about the continuation of this campaign. His personal goal was still worth the cost of life, and he answered a brilliant "yes" answer. <br /> <br /> Part of skiing in the last 15 minutes. He skis for a short time, then he left the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow.
