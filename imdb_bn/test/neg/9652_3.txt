Oh this is a movie of frustration. I do not believe it is operated by Wajda. There is virtually no plot and 90% of the film has people walking in and out of the screen, Catten trying to communicate with each other weakly while talking about genocide. The most interesting part ends up, but until that time I only care about trying to suppress my job. <br /> <br /> The whole film is depicted with a handheld camera, which is supposed to express the "personal instinct" feeling, but there is nothing personal or immediate in most of the movie. Instead, the camera constant jerking made me seasick. To be fair, there are some great shots (not intended for a curse), but nothing that lets you go "Wow!" <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Catalin genocide, the movie will be gone. You scratching your head. If you are familiar, you may even scratch your head, although it is probably due to various reasons. Basically, the film again and again restores the fact that it was Soviet, who killed thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point was repeated repeatedly, though some of the audiences believed in this fundamental historical truth. However, the film never tried to explain what they were killing. Thousands of other Soviet power camp camps were not damaged and were freed in 1941. It has not been explained enough that how many people have died, even though this number is thrown in 20,000 times. <Br /> <br /> Actress is only sufficient to perform with significant performance with Kamoroska (old lady) and tea (L. Zerzi), but they can work for roughly 10-15 minutes. Of course the whole movie is not enough to carry. Other actors seem to have been selected more for their matinee beauty instead of their acting ability, but I will not mention their names. Not that they are certainly not an Oscar material, so the claim that this film was "Luca" was only ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film's tune is also wrong. On one hand it tried as an appropriate historical drama, on the other hand it used the Soviet anti-social resorts for social campaigning, such as a Russian soldier, breaking the Polish flag and using it to clean its boots. Then there are some confusing scenes that do not affect the plot, such as climbing a couple on the roof or liquidation of Cracow University. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this film more interesting, such as adding political angle to stories, or showing German graves, showing Anna's travels to Krakow, Germany, from Soviet-occupied areas. These aspects can be the main part of the film, but instead they get reduced in a few minutes. In the end, we rarely find fitting, confusing, annoying scenes of one of WWII's greatest tragedies about Polls reactions. Not very obligatory and Wajda is not worthy of it.
