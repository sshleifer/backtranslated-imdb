I know that many reviews on IMDB are extremely extreme, because critics are critical of the film by breaking into a hit or film. I'm not supportive of these reviews, and so I'm not giving this movie a great review. The worst kind of art-house science-fantasy dresses like Hollywood blockbuster. Trailers attract you as you think of a conspiracy plot, but actually a small part of the deliberately annoying series which is never resolved correctly. I like movies that challenge viewers and do not need to lure me, so my complaint against this movie is not very bright. No - the film is just terrible. As the credit roll you will feel the actual rage on Cameron Diaz's wooden performance and a faltering plot line will ruin your time. To avoid.
