It was very upset - it touched the jump from the place - and the "thief" was clear. This is a poor man (not high school mention) "Zero Less" I will pass this movie because it is too short to add. There are many problems to be solved, and it's OK - but it's a surprise to you how it's going on. The voice-over is needed because the movie does not work on its own. Avoid this movie and see something else about the rich teen angust. I'm sure sure to see lots of others Do not waste your time on this.
