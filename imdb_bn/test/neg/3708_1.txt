It is a sin to be made, but then we will never see the best "dummy scene" pictured. Ahhh low budget Bigfoot flicks beauty, you see the beauty you see more, if that does not mess up your brain first. As I said earlier, this is the best dummy scene! Can not express the word, you have to see it for yourself. Like a wonderful line such as "Smells like dirt", "man man ..." (you know when you see it) the creature is a blah, blah! The words and shots where you get the shot where you will cry (with the smile) you will restart it. There is a car Chase, Snowmobile Chase, a Disco song as well as a Bigfoot guy song. It does not stop, when looking at credit, a friend targets "clothing provided by K-Mart". If you ask, how could you even get up to credit and then see them? I can explain this as a kind of shock in the brain, you are so mentally tired that you can not move away and I guess you know who was behind the mess. All that is said to be, if you want to punish this mentally, especially if you see it. It's a keeper!
