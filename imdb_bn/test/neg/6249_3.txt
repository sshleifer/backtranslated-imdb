Jim Weinowski announced for the first time that he was doing a series of new series for my favorite series, "Slam Party Party Genocide" series, I was delighted. I have literally been waiting for a new installment for years. So, the production starts and shoots are very small bits and pieces and the actors involved are released until the cover is covered. Then, declare a title change. And this new Article will not be titled "Slamara Party Genocide Fourth," but instead of "Cheerleader Genocide". I was a little disappointed, but having a different title was too short for a movie that I have been waiting so long. I was still very sticky and at the edge of my seat to see it. Maybe a month ago, some very good copies of the movie were released to some very lucky viewers, who had seen this film, a few months before the release date. Some reviews on the net are raised and judged by them, I became afraid of Jim Wynner's "cheerleader genocide". <br /> <br /> Tonight I saw this movie in full time and I I'm still scratching my head. I read in another review, "Cheerleader genocide" is not a new installment in the series "slum party genocide", but a slash jumped on its own. And that's a bad one. <br /> <br /> Before the film's specific direction, I can first tell a huge fan of Jim Wynner's films. I always think about him being a true Shibir genius, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his movies have been made in the shoe budget, and most of it does not have the top acting, but they are kidding. They are the stars: When you want to get a good time when you watch the campi movies, you watch it. From "Sorridge House Genocide II" to "Hard to Die," to "Shopping Mall", Jim has produced products on multiple occasions. <br/> <br /> "Cheerleader genocide" (my opinion) One reason I was excited that I did not reflect the reflection of any movie I made to this director / writer. Past First of all, the production was very cheap and the film was actually shot on video tapes, which I have never seen before in the gym. The actors were moderate, at least speaking, and the story is almost ridiculous. The murderer is too stupid and reminds you of your old grandfather, rather than a runaway madness <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> This is a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about, folks. But some boob shots seen here seem to have been around for the time being. There is a very long shower scene, where there is cheerleading coach, which seems to be going forever, and it reflects a fountain scene in Jim's "Sorrity House Massacre II". The girl even rapes herself in the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cherylder genocide" can be said very rarely, at least. The opening scene is literally something we've seen in all the past slasher flicks of HundREDS. A guy and a girl, when made on the edge of their relationship settlement ... you guess it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, we're talking about potential coup cards here. He recalled some events that his character was tolerated by the murderer shown to police twenty years ago, when the original "Slumber Party Party Genocide" footage was played. Why is the footage used since the original movie, if it is not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. Two explosions in this movie have been seen that I am almost sure that other films have been recycled. <br /> <br /> This movie does not just repeat Fuji from past movies, but it recycles scores to other movies as well. Some of the songs used in "Humans of the Deep" (which were recycled before "The Conqueror") will be heard throughout the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I liked some serious concerns about Mr Wennerski's career. Has the audience's delighted person in the past films finally lost his drunkenness? Only time will tell. Oh, and do not forget her new film. A new installment in the movie "Sorthy House Genocide", now titled "Final Examination." I think I'm seeing a pattern here ...
