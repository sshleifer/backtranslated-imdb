This movie is stupid and very small as a funny movie. Unhappy 'predecessor' is not satisfied with staying in the west; So they hire drunk wagon master (John Candy) to drive east. Vision gags were not enough fun to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets your nerves very fast; But then I honestly do not like to do anything to him. Ed Louters are ridiculous like abstract villains. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Kandy. He died a heart disease 10 days before the end of the film. Candy's character is seen in the final scene of a stand-in and digital enhancement. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping, belly smiling in her career. This movie was not only his best qualification. <br /> <br /> You will also recognize this movie: William Sanderson, Gilad Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Green, and Rodney A. Grant.
