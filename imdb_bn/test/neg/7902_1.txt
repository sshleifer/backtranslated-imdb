Wow this is really stereotypical, terrible trash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> I'll be more aware when I watch the movie of late night. <br /> <br /> I saw the worst movie in this life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie of existence (though it may be), but I do not think that I've seen something stupid and it disrespected my life. It makes the awesome look of the awesome movie series. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would like to give a 0 if I give it to me
