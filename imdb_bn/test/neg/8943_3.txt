OK, so this is awful? I get horror - but I'm not awesome. Black and white artistic but too much black overkill ... said about the enough light. Story - A series killer ....... Around this much. It has been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ... but I do not hope. My question is, when will the audience tie the audacious conflict? I think the director will act something different - to illustrate the killing of children. Well done earlier. So I think he had to go to the standard of shock .... All right ... the audience laughed ..... sick ... .... the worst ... and arise from my seat, I felt all these things. So the director has succeeded? Yes! Shuffle clothes! He wanted to feel these things and I did. What do I do with feeling now? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? Francis was "gifted" with Xavier's extraordinary talent ... can he ever apply for the film, I say, the courage to come out of the dark? After seeing this picture, I was left out in the dark, my soul was attacked .... Is this about crafts? There are so many movies - they tell me that the money was made. So what's up with the people who want to see all this deploring visuals? What's going on in this world that people will be frightened frightened? I will see this again .....
