So merciful even not funny. From the first scene of the movie, I knew I was for a bad time. Regards I only saw this movie on TV. The story line was terrible, not to mention acting. It was awesome. As such, this incredible and unusual thing happened in this step. The lady whips a strap down the door and the guy whips a little little and he just hands on the key. I get good, realistic. The makers are lazy attempts to create a future city, even deep in my dislike for the film. To say the truth, the only good thing in this movie was the war, which itself was quite tall. While watching this movie, I can ask myself "When will it stop!"
