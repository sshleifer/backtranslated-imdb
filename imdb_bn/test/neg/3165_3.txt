This love story does not contain much conflict between an American journalist and Eurasian lady doctor, because they are mainly Westernized (studying in London), or no fireworks, because they are rather obstructed. The little interest managed to raise the story will push them further down through their wooden conversations. They are supposed to be two cosmic intellectuals, but a Hollywood hack is kept in the mouth in their mouths, such as talk, who is not one of himself. The film is also suffering from a tremendous lack of reality - the whole lonely beach of Hong Kong is filled with crowd by one million Chinese refugees? And a potentially successful American journalist does not know who does a hysterectomy of her 40s? Hollywood ideas. Finally "song". After listening to it about 20 times throughout the film, starting with the credits right, it reduces some of its psychological effects, sorry to say.
