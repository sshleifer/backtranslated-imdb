This movie was terrible ... Some might think that this movie was like coming back to "good old days" when Team Thomson was not even in it. And to do something worse, they use clips from old trance movies. That's just terrible. No Transcer movie is complete without Tim Thomson. I love the movie of Phoolmun, and I was 4 years old so I have been watching them. I've been through everything I've done and this movie almost lost me. Now I have got few lines to fill so I will continue to run. New way to send Jack back to time as well as fools in their way of breeding new transर्स. What happened in the TCL chamber And finally! What happened at the end of Transners 5, where Lina said and I quote "Jack gave me something special" and his stomach and some other broad look. I do not know ... maybe there's Babe. There were many places to go there, but in the bedroom of Phulmun
