Acting was terrible. Special effects, when exceptional, affect the movie. The writing was unfortunate, and the dialogue was unbelievable. And the stupid little love story in Leip Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> The worst crime of "Armageddon" was the lack of scientific reality. "Asteroid Texas Size," says Billy Bob Thornton. ER, that's 800 miles wide! Until the lunatic shower in New York destroyed Nashua, some people are not seeing asteroids? Suuuuure NASA join an astronaut and hire a drilling team for their training in a week? Yes right Does anyone bring a sidebar to the space shuttle with them? Yes, that's realistic. And Bruce Willis blows the asteroid with an additional three seconds. How to do Disney-eski! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I rooted for asteroids!
