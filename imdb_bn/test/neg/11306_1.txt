I saw growing up Magoo enjoyed cartoon. And I enjoy Leslie Nilsson's comic skills. So, I thought, to make this marriage a fun child. <br /> <br /> I could not be more wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. I do not remember a single fun moment. This two or three times (in hundreds of films for several years) I wanted my money back. You will disappoint this movie because you will not be able to use that time in a good way. A comedy, must be drawn into the plot viewers and serve as the framework for gags. This is not the plot. It's just lying there, gasping like a false fish.
