It is a little less sick than the first two films, but otherwise it is business as usual: unsupported part of the sick, lazy and sick movies. Charles returned to Brunson, when his friend's neighbor was terrorized and murdered. Crime, you see, the South Belmont area is up 11% ... so what will be done? A strong police presence? Tougher fisherman? What is the word of Haresh? No, the only solution to send a loose cannon like a bronze to take bloody revenge ?? Or, as the author it has, justice: this time he is the Chief of Police Chief Ed Lauter killer machine. <br /> <br /> Writer bends backwards to Kersey's hero, sent to shameless police in the area only to seize a weapon of an elderly resident who kept it for the surgery and praised the crowd from watching the cursor stole his camera and thief on the right Provide a view to shoot. Death penalty for theft? That's okay. Everyone in the film is feeling that this is a solution and a dishonesty of characters in the ciphers who are only encouraged to censor or come back behind them, they are frustrated. <br /> <br /> Of course, these villains, however, will not the film ruin the whole audience towards the cursor and his stupid answer instead of sticking to his mind? Tragically enough residents do not threaten the revenge of the gang, and do not blame Karsey for any violence, which kills a character correctly because of the involvement of the cursor. At the end of the film, they all took guns from their Saak Drawer and were involved in lethal massacre, sometimes thought of not refraining from thinking of killing anything else. <br /> <br /> Do not help volatile shallow performance? Bronson has literally a facial expression full of it and can not even reflect on the correct word. New height of stupidity reached here ?? A machine gun? A rocket launcher?! ?? And the new level of misogyny: whether by film rape, explosion or throat-slashing, every female character contrives dissecrate sight; And they set them up in a very fashionable fashion, such as a victim who is a criminal, involved in a gang-controlled neighborhood asking a foreigner, or other shopping alone that night. This drake, pure and simple, stupid garbage can be put together without the style or sense.
