I mean, you just love the Italian film industry. Someone came with Post-Dudesday Action Movie ("Road Warrior") and the Italians were busy busy for several years. Then another successful successful barbaric movie ("Canaan") came with and the Italians were busy ... Ah, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites Amberto Lenisy's "The Barbarians" Paul Twin played) its series was made. And this is the second, perhaps the worst (or best, depending on your perspective) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it will not get wrong hands so it has to be done. The old man sends his daughter to it, and after a few complications, it, along with his Tongue and the girl, comes back to the castle, in which some of the unjust (of course, the old "companion" of the bowl) has fallen. Nowhere the warrior forgets about this plot, and for some fun, some monster snake-worship wipes away (before sacrificing some virgins). Before the end of the madness the madness is over and our heroes perform their duties by killing a wise teacher, invent hanggliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br />: Terrible acting by all the participants (especially O'Conffe), incredibly ridiculous "special effects" (you only have to worship the snake war scene, which is "deaf of the demon"), badly battling scenes, numerous Continuity error (two different hanggliders fly during its time) Climate war, keep an eye on it, just an example) and the overall absence of the concept of history (cave, "civilized" Groom, castle-maker, all were cast in a film). <br /> <br /> If you are satisfied with bad movies like me, it is one of the series, you probably end up ROTFL. For records: The third part of Malta-Filmed is actually quite frequent. Perhaps it is perhaps the most entertaining movie considering Joe Joa'mato's other efforts, because she certainly failed to provide visible or erotic movies. . But I firmly have the opinion that it was completely accidentally. <br /> <br />
