I really love Harrison Ford so I'm very interested to rent this movie only after minutes to be frustrated. Mr. Ford started walking in the hot water to find a place to urinate. Her companion was very good and had good lines. The story makes me curious but wrong - Big Mittal - Because they are marked by a driver's license or passport before driving a commercial flight in America, I have left many plots in my mind. <br /> <br /> I could have been less careful about these people. In fact, the sub-plot of the International Affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lover of Miami's first class flying time. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the director of Sydney Pollack who gave us classic Tutsi and other films. This one time and energy waste.
