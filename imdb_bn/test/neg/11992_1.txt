Mr. "Reject" again hits, transforms a classic game into a cheap pattern. Poor performance; Poor guidance; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cree game was great, it's a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots of "points and shoots". We did not have anything compared to the movie. We had some "point and shoot" things but ... I do not know how I can interpret it, but if you have seen any other "Uwe Fell" movie, If you do not believe me, then go to the "Online Petition" website and check for one for "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> That movie made my eyes bloody, someone close it once. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
