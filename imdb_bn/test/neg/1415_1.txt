I am very surprised that this movie has achieved even a brilliant review, I found this movie horror right. The conspirators around the plot to determine whether it is a comedy or a thriller then realize that it can not achieve it. So it threw the towel and continues with its illogical plot highlighted with a strange smiling scene with Laura Linini, a injection, and cuffed coffee, which makes the audience wander strangely in their seats and looks at each other? Basically it is frustrating for the fans of Robin Williams and is really frustrating, and it thinks that someone blackmailed Laura Linnie to add this part of the trash to her otherwise respectable resume. I wanted to go after 10 minutes and I wanted to, even when it was free, I wanted to give me some time for my loss. The computer's glit / twist was silly in this movie, and be careful about what you will not win in any election. I voted for direct DVD
