A clear comment is a couple of comments. Herschel Gordon Lewis contributed to the brief introduction of Dr. Gorer (UCO's Body Shop) video, where he met J. Yes. Touched its collaborative efforts. "Pat" Patterson, Director and Star Doctor GORE Patterson wrote the "Gore Effect" for the Grusem Twosome and several other Lewis films in the late 60's. Lewis commented that 2000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" film (referring to adequate blood volume), "fifteen gallons" of Louis-Patterson productions. Lewis did not describe Dr. Gore as the film "Gallon Gallon" - he is speaking only about Patterson and the films he has collected. Lewis acknowledged (somewhere else) that he even rebuilt his role in seeing the role of the doctor even before seeing Patterson's film! So take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This can be a "incomplete" movie, but like some incomplete novels, it's a "finished." It just missing some connective tissues. <br /> <br /> At Patterson's specific level there is a sense of presence and laughter, which helps to make this simple shot a bit more frequent. There is a very bare-bodied plot - even the blove-fist is more complicated - and an intensely repetitive musical score from William Guild. Nudity and lots of skin. The whole middle of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman". This is intense for the bloodthirsty, and humorous condensation. <br /> <br /> Patterson is on the street on his head, but he tries hard to tell his story creatively, if Frankstein Clive is creative, then it can be used. But the best thing to see in this movie (the best weird DVD, if possible) is that it is a perfect Nashville shoulder feature, Bill Hicks's "Heart Disease Every Minute" This is not true!
