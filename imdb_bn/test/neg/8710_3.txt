I have seen this series from curiosity, whether they want to meet and perhaps meet all these modern technologies, starred in the 1956 Seichil Beem's classic epic, Charlton Hesson, Eul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwie. Of course, I was given below. Yes, all of their Bible characters were correct, but they did not give any of our spectacular theater scenes, which kept your interest throughout the first movie. If you are taking the mini series, your "Reviving" scenes, "Burning Bush", "Red Sea", sharing "Ferah's Army", and "Cithious Pyramid" to be built. On today's technology such as "Lord of the Rings" or Matrix on the blockbuster film scale. Obviously, they do not want to leave the last impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much more needed in this problem.
