Well, the killings are not terrible, but it comes off. Production prices are worthwhile and the main actors work well (Rosario plays a role other than Dawson), but the story is just sad. Alomor Leonard was not so stupid in the book, I do not know, because I did not read it, but I think the book is considered to be a little ridiculous. The movie has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you will shout on the screen, "Oh, come on! Fool!" In short, and without any spoilers, everyone works well in conspiracy, makes no sense in any way. A very frustrating and unreasonable movie, for which it may have been sitting on the shelf.
