Jonathan Demem is a character-based director who saw him pulling Brian de Palma (which means, Apping Hitchcock), when he fails to do a lot of secret work in this secret, almost convincing. From a novel by Murray Teigh Bloom, working from a screenplay by David Shaber, Alan J. Pakulara tried to hit somewhere between the stage-participating thrillers of Paranoia plays and hitcock. Roy Skida has expressed his condolences to kill his wife as his retired secret agent who is now busy trying to sink the bad guy to kill him. Immediately takes off, but the script is full of flimsy threads and no tension dies quickly out. Niagara waterfalls have a visual fascinating look, but Dame gets less than the outside of its cast and even less than the tone of the story. ** **** to
