"Bauwieff" is a very bad game: no characters, no stories, no real dialogue, bad fights ... this is probably the worst movie in the history of cinema. It's deadly annoying, time lost. I'm really sorry for Christopher Lambert, who will not visually choose any role. If someone advises you to see "Bauful", trust me: run like crazy.
