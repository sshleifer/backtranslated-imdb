Well, where we start, this film has many possibilities about this big big role. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible plot. This movie can not be met with what I hope, the good person makes it alive, I mean that some people do not want to be successful. The end was shrimp-friendly and very close, which was never thought of, you have made the plot mistake, bad intentions are going to come out successfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I'm really no doubt about this movie for some quick Vegas cash, about it. Save your money to watch a good movie.
