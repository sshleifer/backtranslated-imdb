Oh, boy, this is another comet-hit-the-Earth film. With Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and their rap stars, in another stupid flickr of a year or two, you will think that people will be burnt to this idea. Obviously, I hired it, hopefully it can not be horrific: Dennis Hooper was after this and he is a good actor, okay? I have forgotten something important: Peter and Towel, Robert De Niro and several other celebrated actors, Hooper has a tendency to appear in horror movies. Not only that, but he forgot how work classes are ready for them. Tychus hopes its performance is so terrible that you appear in some scenes of Divine or Edith Mosses. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to say about this garbage, keep an eye on the effects of the world's film, deep impact and then expand Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Forget about each other. This one is really bottom of the heap.
