Avida lives and encourages words to play a game, but I personally think this movie was overblown by her ambition and her title does not do justice. It collects a set of weird characters assembled by the incredible link. Besides, lastly everything is connected, my opinion, a little annoying. It was a set of pictures that remains ... an interesting, but it was not enough to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I believe this picture will be considered as a comedy, but I certainly did not notice! The meaningless and impressive nature of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on one and it is no longer tolerable. I want to say, I have fought hard to see it till the end, and still not sure it was valuable ...
