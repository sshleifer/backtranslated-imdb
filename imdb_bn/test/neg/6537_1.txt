Despite a lot of positive reviews, it is very slow film, which corrects three essential good actors, which you will never hear. This is really no where else goes on the road movie. The camera often gets out of focus and the constant panning in long long scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> Remember three characters interesting but interesting. Cast also sets what tired sound will be an intergalactic record for the use of "dude". (Even Howard Staron has abandoned this tired pasudo pronoun). <br /> <br /> Three main actors and a supporter actor showed great promise. They are clearly comfortable and bravely allowing themselves to be painted as shallow and even stupid. All of the character actors think they are lucky amateur who are generously volunteering to speak some lines. Indeed they all fit their role physically. <br /> <br /> All is a dull 90 minutes which feels more like eternity. It's always one of my ten bad films.
