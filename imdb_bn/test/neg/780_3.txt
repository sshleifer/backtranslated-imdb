Surprisingly, my "box" has very little talk about, so it will be quite short. I can not read Richard Mattheson's novel "Button, Button" from which this film is based, but considering what I have seen in this "adaptation", there can be no similarity with the work of such a legend. "The box" is about a family who discovers a strange contraction that has a bit of room in their house. Frank Langele explains and explains how they will be given a million dollars if they push the button - only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone ...? Spirir ?? They push it? Spinners end ?? This whole idea was interesting on itself, however, as it was able to stretch the movie a bit tightly to the staggate knock-off, which pad it to a pretty end, with a pretty deep message. Although I try to be as fair as possible, I still want to say that this is not my cup cup and it bothers me. I guess it's the same director as "Danny Darko" which I think when I saw it years ago. "Box" did a good job as a small film, but since it was so consensively adapted, I can not recommend it ...
