Well played, yes. Very well, I want to say, even though I do not speak cigarettes. Excellent cinematography But the script is lam, really hair. A predictable soap opera, which knows everything that's going to happen to you. OK, maybe not as expected, but it's no good? This is a movie you've already seen and forgotten the day after. <br /> <br /> I got a note from IMDB that my comments were not long enough. It's really sad, because I have no idea what to say about this movie, which actually says a lot about it, do not you think? Things .. It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie with BÃ©rio, or Rif Raf, shot ten years ago (or the extraordinary child shot recently). It is very sad that it is a very bad movie.
