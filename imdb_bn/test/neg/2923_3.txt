A very frustrating movie from Oliver Stone, which is her latest episode "J.F.K." On the contrary, failing to provoke a real emotion. About "talk radio" talk-back host 'Barry Champlain', a very loud, opinionated person who drives many people to mind and still attracts the audience, most of whom think that you just want to behave in a negative way with him and Want to abuse. His boss (Alec Beldwin) in the movie is very good in his character saying that he is a big seller of shoes dealers. And Barry (Eric Bogosian), as the cause of death threats in the face of death threats, the final outcome is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie which is usually something powerful to say. However, "talk radio" fails to make a serious comment and maintains a frustrating, unmatched film. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
