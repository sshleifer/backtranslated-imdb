Really? This is necessary? How can anyone make such a film? Annoying !!! Seteven Seagal with fun hair and fat like an elephant. All-time stunts, car torture with a boring soundtrack. Not to mention the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a lucky telephone answered some, no one asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see in the future. They must be fun. Steven Segal passes out after a car repression, and I know that he can not work. It was very terrible. Nothing that can save that film. <br /> <br /> I've lost 90 minutes of my life! see you
