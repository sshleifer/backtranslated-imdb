I did not see the original movie of any other comment, so my viewpoint is about this film. I have found the message of this movie: If you think only about yourself, all the world will be right, everything will be done, your loved ones will love you more, your friends will respect and more like you, your employers You will want more, you will have to give more and even your own children and your parents will love you more <br /> <br /> <br /> I am condemning this message And think completely false. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not a mother that does not laugh at that scene. <br /> <br /> Overall a very frustrating movie plot. I do not find myself rooting for someone in this movie. I thought that they were all psychological self-confident that I did not take care of what happened to them and it was not a movie that people wanted to see.
