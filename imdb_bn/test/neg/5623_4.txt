For the crime of the French thriller Roger Everi (co-authored by "Paul Fry") with Quintin Tarantino on crime, go to your own (exec.product at this time of QT). <br /> <br /> <br /> Ary Stoltz Z, a safe cracker is awesome, who went on request from an old friend from France in the United States. There he formed a group with the Hippies Hippies, who can not think with little or no plan, they can close a bank vault of a gold bullion on a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Robbery went wrong so much that Tantono has developed so well in "Reservoir Dog", only "Jilling Murder" alone is enough to survive on this energy Not so, so Everi dropped into a pretty handicap. Julie Delpy Joe, a daughter of a daughter, who entertains ZK at her arrival in Paris. <br /> <br /> I think our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but sadly this step did not deeply help to deepen its shallow plot. Was needed. There was no story about this concept, which was nothing more than that, an idea. Even in the Seiji Dive of Paris, the spiritual journey is uncertain. I think some people have to admit that in a bunch of gangsters, the story of shooting each other on top of a buttoned jewelery was never a story, unless you add complex characters and spontaneous conversations. "Reservoir Dog" It was not "killing Jill". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In short, Has been there. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
