This picture was bad. I believe Elton (or it's Mike) Wang has played his role. However it is not that Wong was stupid Green and looks middle. He is hit on the head and plays a man who suffered brain damage. He recovers and gets revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one capable of seeing this movie, but he can not do much. But what he is doing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Less than anyone. Also, the film has some sugar in the rubber air which controls the Wong people. This film is not worth the rent or purchase.
