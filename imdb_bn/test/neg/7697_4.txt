I watched this short film DVD for Reddy Scott's film The Doelst. Scott did not have any role before the movie, it just got started. <br /> <br /> The boy and bike are not an example of other works of Ridley Scott, it does not match. The film shows a boy, powered by Tony Scott, cycling Guess what That's all beautiful. The boys revolve around, go in vain, misleading conversations. The film was shot in black and white and it was directed by Ridley Scott, so I hope some cool cinematography or visible-looking set. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This image is not even good for the first try. However, I recommend that any fan of redley sketts be tested at least once.
