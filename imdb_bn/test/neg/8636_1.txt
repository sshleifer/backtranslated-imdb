This Hollywood version, leaving a real piece of garbage. The bright original "Spurlos", or a cheap humiliation in English titles, is called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the general, extraordinary Hollywood fashion mark, usually due to the shimmering, corporate seed counters, who do not have supernatural ideas about artistic, they only seek the "successful formula" and gain the profits they want to apply to everything. Similar to the horrifying "scarlet letter" created in 1995, which encircled the original story of McDonaldland's crowd, it turned out to be a deviation, not even a single flexibility, but a heap of Goup that had a similar shape but looks, even Not even the remote soul is similar. Gary Oldman is less interested in keeping an eye on anything except the movie. There is nothing for this dog, even the very talented Jeff Bridges is an embarrassing thing. The Great Tragedy should not be "Film of the Year", but it can be one or more of the most tragic events of life and allows the reader to draw the meaning and insights of human condition. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a rental and avoiding this extraordinary garbage and highlighted the original Dutch / French collaboration in 1988, do yourself a great favor. This is a great movie. It's a terrific mess.
