The plot is simple: An American couple in Thailand is on vacation. As they are attacked by the 'Almighty' Chinese vampires, and the girl is abducted by a big master of purple. It's okay so far. The girl's companion went to find her. And now horror starts. He comes on a semi-vampire or something a weird group (they only drink animal blood). This vampire has been in conflict with the bad people for nearly 800 years. However, with the help of 'good vampires' the man started searching for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the scene of the battle is starting, which war without any karate movie? Another thing I noticed is that the vampire is very ugly. I mean ... a vampire an old fashion guy (he's alive for ever ...), he got the style. There are modern vampires, but in this movie, vampires ... are weird Like, let's bicycle, they're all skinned and they destroy everything on their way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie is a low budget. The script is annoying and the actors are not very talented. The music is quite good, but the effects are not that cool. <br /> <br /> This is not great for enriching the movie, but if you have a free afternoon see it and tell me if I am right or not.
