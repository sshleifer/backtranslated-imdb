Being Western's special fan, I initially saw it because I wanted to see Luceille in something other than the role of "I Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here in 1868 he starred in the Arizona territories of Salon, Christine Larson, who is going to marry an unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Zogar). OK - there was nothing better than that; He does not fly me away. It was a success for me that I was different from what I used to see him - he became very famous from this terrible physical comedy, though the film became famous for all time, although the film tried to maintain a mock humorous feeling throughout life. (A common ridiculous line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows them!") I could not find the stories that are compelling, although I am grateful that Indian agents are shown as victims of Indian agents. There are common shootout actions and many horses - otherwise your common west. As Christine - We can guess from the beginning that how will her planned marriage end? It's just a question that will go there. If you like the West, it will be a fantastic example that is a bit of fun and fun. If you are not big in this style, it will be lacking. I'm not big in style. 3/10
