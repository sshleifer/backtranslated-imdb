I'm usually the big fan of Casino (Scarface, Supperico, Devil's Advocate) But since a woman's perfume she mostly plays the same role and many shout. This movie had no loving character in the warm winter. Bondo playing McConnie is the least preferred brand brand bunch. He has reached a real man somewhere. How old was the pasino frustrating and how did Rene Russo my righteousness? The only high light in this harmful world is Hot Hooker with the perfect lipstick and it has a total of 10 lines. Even the reliable Jeremy Piven was completely unlike the whole. <br /> <br /> Note the film authors, usually a little less favorite (notable exception Scarface) until they usually work. After the movie was closed and I was the only one at Brandon Airport, please crash an aircraft to the airport and kill Brandon.
