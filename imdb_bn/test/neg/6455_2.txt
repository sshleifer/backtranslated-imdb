Yes, this review may have spoilers, but thank you for it. Most of the time I've seen this worst movie. I was hoping to see the same reaction on this board, but vaguely, there are many people in this film and especially for the spaces. Someone will punish me for saying it, but I can find that Kevin Spassy's role is limited to the praise of the world. I felt Kevin had to see a moderate version of the role of "American Beauty". His character is ridiculously restrained in his film, by throwing his assistant in all manner of his ridiculous humiliation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I suspect that this special scene sounds funny, but at the moment I was ready to hit the stop button (in about 20 minutes in the film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Resevoir dog"? Hello, "I think I once saw it in a movie," as if he had cut ears of Spacy. But does he use to spend him? An envelope! All right, she'll cut her paper! It should be one of the worst scenes of all time in Hollywood, and it makes it even more terrible even if it tries to continue with the direct face of the actor and director. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I do not see the end of this movie (my DVD is finally locked halfway before), but anyone who wants to say this can leave me a line which I am I miss the wonderful wrap and understand everything. Well, I do not care what happened at the end, because it is such a bad thing and can not ever be created for top-level dialogue. I also got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie.
