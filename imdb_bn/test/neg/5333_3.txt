This 'documentary' does not give any light on what would be like backstage during the hard dock life tour. Please, I was not there, but seeing this movie I did not feel like me. And for such a movie, it is not a compliment. I saw it all the time, I thought, "They're going to leave?" When it's complete, you think the only one that has got some insights on DMX, and this is basically because she only talks about her dog. Waste time <br /> <br /> 3/10
