Unfortunately, this film is dry under a good film of water through many signals. Universal made many serial giant films in the 1940s, which was a pale imitation of the original. Intelligent mimicologist Emotep has been dragged down to Frankenstein's mummy wrapping, who has not seen any signs of intelligent life. This picture is entertaining at the spot but if you have seen Mami (1932) you will be disappointed.
