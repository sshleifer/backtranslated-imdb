I love the perfect character by playing Lor Linc in 'Act of Love', and she is very good at 'Man of the Year'. <br /> <br /> But wow Robin Williams does not give much of a performance, it was a few small exceptions. Laura Linna may not have a wrong voice, but her editing was raped in her role, or it was simply a sad act by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think Barry Levinson is old. Such poor performance, such as uneven result management will be faulty. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldbell are great in supporting the role. Goldbull acted in a cruel way with selfishness, and Wakeen's entertainment entertainment director's director, and the commentator of the film is astonishing. <br /> <br /> The story is, the presentation seems to be a very good picture, and many actions are heartfelt. Pensing, stories and aspects have become weak compared to 'Head Office'.
