I made the mistake of seeing a late star (1974) many nights many years ago. It's one of the stupid movies I've ever seen <br /> 1. Bad acting <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing <br /> <br /> 3 Scientifically stupid plot. (A whole planet is being destroyed because its chamber becomes unstable or makes the path worse: Instead of having a large, easily avoided object, you must track thousands of small, but equally lethal and more difficult objects.) <Br /> <br /> 4 Completely unreal characters. A painted beach ball as a place alien? The authors must be doing too many drugs. It's astonishing that most actors in "Dark Star" did not do anything else. Most of those who did something else did not play again after Dark Star. So, his acting resume, Dark Star is a star of a starring career!
