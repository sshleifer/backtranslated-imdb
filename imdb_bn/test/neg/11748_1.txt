First, the complete concept of a classic restoration as "psycho" is nothing less than Ludicro. Many times and efforts have been destroyed here. I'm sure they are smart enough, they can not improve the core, so they must respect Alfred Hitchcock on their minds. However, the idea that started as a well-established tribute led to a terrible master. This movie is poorly produced, bad, and unnecessary at the beginning. After 40 years the original classic has stood well on his own. The possibility of returning from the grave to the hit and trash pieces is unlikely to come later, but if I can sleep with them, then just open at a glance. Do not waste your time.
