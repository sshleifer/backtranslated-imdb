This fourth attempt has been made from this director (I've met whom I have met and found most of the matches in the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-Movie Protrospektiv) and, perhaps, the worst. It was with the Bronze Executioner (1989), which was earlier, it is a major example from the end of the euro-style era's tail - the main reason it shows the depth of reducing the rebel style before this time! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact we are surrounded by a plot - I'm not kidding, folks - a killer phone! Fantastic but delightful Charlotte Levius - his third film Piratas (1986) and The Golden Child (1986) - a model, apparently, ended a thing; He expects his architect lover to call him behind, but while ringing the phone, he gets the sounds outside (as well as some nasty) as well as what he gets. He has made friends with a new tenant in his apartment block, who is easily aware of an unusual activity (William burger) who clearly explains that the negative energy that has been revealed can reveal through household appliances during family family's arguments. A deadly force (I swear I'm not making it)! <br /> <br /> In the highlights ... er ... The bottom part of the film is: Nasty Bartender whose heroine calls several times from the place of Ding (Chain of events only to break Luis through his Penses again, Angling (1962) ) Style!), Display display display of displays of displays, niron photographer friend kisses before frying equipment, quiz Thank you for reporting the strange incident to the Late Lucius ("And what is the taster, am I surprised?"), Killing deaf assassins by the embankment of coins coming out of the telephone booth, and the pacemaker he has fitted with Berger's own bloody death (on the phone) Affecting the doctor's heart bursting)! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> How much does it cost, for that - despite the inclusion of heavier-metal numbered dated soundtracks - is not enough to score by pre-Goblin Claudio Simaneeti
