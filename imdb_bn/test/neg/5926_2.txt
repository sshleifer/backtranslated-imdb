I want to say, not very good. Polly Bergen Fine In This Picture The rest are so I am gay and honestly, there are many clichés for this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching it and then closed it, then decided that it would be fun to make the rest of the film fun. But everyone said, the basic idea of ​​the film is good. It could actually be prety well if it was rewritten with less integrated lines and well-played. All I will not recommend it. Additon this coo coo thinking line is so hairy. The fun in the above hair salons is funny because its so bad. It's very sad when they try to get a gay sister in the room with them.
