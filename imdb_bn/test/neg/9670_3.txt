When I saw the shootfighter 1 and tear the blood buckets, I was open to another heart of heart massage with open arms, and I was ready for chiropractics in a cage. But nooooooo, it was like the first movie version of Barney, which was with Kood's kids with Loma. At least say Yeung still kicks booty, although he will make movies like Blood Pressure and Caddyshack.
