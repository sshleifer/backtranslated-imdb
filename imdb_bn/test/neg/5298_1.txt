Trvotta and Tharman deserve a good movie. All these aspects are not very secondary, single fresh ideas. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous view of this photo. After all their criminal activities and even killing people, black rappers performed on a gang stage are becoming almost positive heroes like Mickey Mouse and giving away prizes at the ceremony. Probably match with this real life. But it is quite normal to be seen as a "happy ending" of my imagination. "What's wrong with shooting two bad Ukrainian politically if not politically correct?" - This program must be done! It reminds me that Hollywood writers have a big problem in the good and evil isolation, even if it is supposed to be a "black comedy".
