There might be a lot of potential in this movie. Certainly, with today's technology, you will expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects, of course they need to act. This picture is both poor! <br /> <br /> First of all, I am disturbed about this, without following their Bible: Why can not the artist take the license of the movie? If you want to know about Moses's story, read the Bible. I have seen very few movies that follow the real true story. <br /> <br /> <br /> You must compare it to the 1956 version to see this image. It is that sadly failed. Hesson and Brainer were in attendance. They became their role. You can not see it here <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare it, stand on your own, this movie has run very fast. In a scene where the part should be developed, it's not. It becomes annoying. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: avoid it and see the other. As another camp, it's good movie away and away.
