After reading this story a while ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again This is one of my favorite Nicholas Spark books. I think the relationship that makes the story is about. This was the least reason for me in the film because I think relationships in the film have been poorly expressed. I have no idea how to change the original characters (Teams and Allan characters). The film did not take off the relationship between John and Saavanah. Perhaps you could not read the book of this movie, but it was very neutral compared to the book. I was a great choice for Channing, but I felt that he was going out to see all the young adults coming out to see it, so I thought it was more attentive to them. I cut the whole point of the last book, so I was also dissatisfied with it. I hope the movie was like a notebook or was walking in the way of remembering and how they captured the book. I think I was out on Friday night and like 10 bucks on a sad love story, I was not expecting to see the story.
