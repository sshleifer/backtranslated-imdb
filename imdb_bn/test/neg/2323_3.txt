I saw this first night in the last 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it's a sunny horror moment enough, it's worth watching. First of all, was the boy deliberately suppressing the child? He even said to Costello a la la west, "You are fascinated by me!" As Costello does not take a double. God only knows what happens if the babysitter is in Hong Kong? This kid motivated him in the hitbit! Then there are the main male dancers. He is completely inactive. Laughing while he did not leave any talent with any talent on the grave grave and did not look good in his life. Two romantic lead zeros, waste. Abbott gets singing one line and that is dubbed by another singer. Geez, I think he could not even tune! Castello drives to be charming in his awesome numbers and I think small children may like it, but there is nothing to recommend it. But oh that seductive boys boy! That attitude blown me alone! Besides, the family takes someone out of the street without any references to children of the children! Today, the little girl will be taken away from them!
