I was looking forward to seeing "Wiri Spindale" because Shafar's "Fall" happened across. Unfortunately, I found "WS", which could be a terrible, inconsistent, annoying group of platypops, which could possibly be a mixture of Schaefer's signature, story, description, and poem. This film describes the sex and other experiences of Manhattan's marriage through self-described flashbacks. Like a beads on a string, spherical fur has apparently combined each little sexual life experience, neglecting the likes of the necklace beauty. The result is a misleading story about a big boy who fails to express sympathy and disconnects the viewer, dissatisfied, and whoever finishes the mechanical feeling-he gets worse later. A middle indie for Schaeffer and behind a step.
