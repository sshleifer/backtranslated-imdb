The film was frustrating. I saw him at Broadway on Broadway and he was outstanding. Perhaps he himself is running at the end of his musical career, his frustration is the role of his spirit, which he does, like his own, is re-discovered and moved. The belt singer always belts, always flat and lacking to show his ability as an actress. For entertaining, this performance was going to die for a strong lead and a strong cast, so others might be memorable in the absence of the bait. Another criticism: Whenever he starts singing, he laughs directly at the camera! I know it's musical dramatic, but please kindly leave it - the middle can not perform like Liza or Streisand, out of character and out of context.
