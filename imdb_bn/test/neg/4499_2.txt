Like frisbee, like a tortoise with another furry that goes like a wart hag. Bird suits look more like human beings like birds of war look like humans. Ship a ping pong ball space. Getting board of space ships, including naughty boys who know how to do everything. More tiring music More "Gamera children's friends" stuff. I remember when Godzilla and Rodan came out. The movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to humans. Now they have a parody of the stupid costume with very little behind them. Adult is all ridiculous and moronic. Like American sitcoms, kids are bosses (in fact they can not think of their way to a paper bag). These giant films must be Japanese means of sharing these little snouts. However, after all, after watching these three films (check out the stock footage over the same plot), the final conclusion they are annoying. If you do not see this one, do not bother.
