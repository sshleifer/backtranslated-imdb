TPB's love but it was a link episode. The series or movie did not have the same feelings. Looked like it was done together soon. I did not enjoy it. The so-called acting was awful. As they cast, they knew that there was a money-grab of an episode to get to the market quickly. I hope our next Easter will not be special because it will be for me. The author of this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show. This aspect has become very popular and for Christmas's very weak efforts, I think cast and crew are bad. As I said, I love TPB but it goes to trash.
