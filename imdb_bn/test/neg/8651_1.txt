This movie is not something valuable. I mean, you want to see such stuff, flip the Hollywood movie! This is completely an insult to the Bollywood name. Neil en Nikki sucked seriously! This movie will never be seen. As an actor, it appears that the genie skipped a generation skipped. Tony could not wear less and Uday Chopra was obviously chosen because he was the director's deprived son. (All that was funny was stupid) songs, and I hope the director will not spend a lot of money on him ...... the lower line, I hate the movie. Do not allow your kids to see it and if you have it in your house then discard it as a stupid movie! If you must, buy the CD. (As I said, the songs are.) At least it's better than the movie.
