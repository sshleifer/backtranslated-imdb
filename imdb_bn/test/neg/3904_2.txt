After losing 2 hours to watch this movie on late night television, I returned and I read again some elements of IMDB, reminding me why I saw it in the first place. The only thing I can remember on the Haydesite is that this section usually applies to me. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails at every stage and actually damages me to see what has been described as a comedy on IMDB. I do not think a couple more than chuckles. There is more laughter for any episode of law and order than the Last Man. Sincerely <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many characters seem to have no basis for me, and therefore very unlikely / incredible <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If it was not for almost void bikini shot, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or tap it and bikini shot fast forward. Although it does not cost even $ 1 to rent.
