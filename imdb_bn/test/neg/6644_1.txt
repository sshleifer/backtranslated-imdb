Due to the stitching of this movie, I have not seen Elizabeth Shie on this day. Bad acting, badly designed and ethnically abusive, it happened in Chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . Spinner's official . . . Spinner: Her "Blues" alone was more painful than her stupid acting and article - 'Nobody spends without singing blues' - was as bad as the post. Children were babbling their character incredibly and before the end of the movie I wish them all to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I would say, there is a special thing about this movie; There is a lot to blame me for the film, but what did this piece of trip, Chapper, Phantom Menes and Catwoman could not get sick in my stomach.
