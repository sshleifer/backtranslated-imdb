I've heard a lot about Bouwif, maybe I'm from Romania and a good part of the film is here to film my country. And I expect so much from this film. Finally, I was frustrated. It's not terrible to say to other users, but it's definitely bad. This is about the 6th century castle and a monster killer who came to kill Lambert. Lambert is good, because he has played all his roles, but the rest of the letters suck, and the action is not very good. Plus maybe the only thing that can save this movie, special effects are too bad, the giant looks terrible (horror, but not terrible). Oh and other bad things: music. Trying to film, and managed to create atmosphere for the 6th century. But all the action sequences are presented in rock music, which is very very bad. I mean the work of rock in a movie completely like the Church's Angels - where is the perfect way to shoot your action. But here, that was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Votes: 10 out of 4
