A rogue island is broken on a remote island ship. Then they are holding there with a small group of prisoners by an insane count; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> Amateur actors try to sleep through movies, while a boring strong score is in the background continuously. The various bits of action are all pictured incredibly unenergetic; The picture is completely neutral. It just seems to pull over and over. And at the end you're not too bad, you'll be pressing to take care of that point. As an example of Gothic horrors of 60, it is strictly an example of a contract basement. I can sadly recommend this one really.
