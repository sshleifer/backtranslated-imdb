Dr. Marnie Banner (Magna Kopochka) is a terrific diverse woman. When one of his colleagues discovers a renewal formula, Marne thinks it's a great opportunity. When he refused the drug due to possible side effects, he killed his colleague as he wanted. Drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the source finds the worst in it and not long before leaving the body string behind it. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression "exciting to see the paint dry?" That sums up many Satyanik up. At the time of the film, the line in one of the characters is pronounced, "Somewhat horrible, it is impossible." I was sure whether the movie or movie itself was talking about something. I was really hopeless because I had high hopes for this one. Dangerous possibilities were, but they are not realized. In every opportunity, the most fabulous things of the plot Marney are imaginary. Writing is awesome And the part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not that appealing and can not carry the film on herself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a mess. We see movies and anything that is born in the movie no matter. After the end of the scene the camera is long tall. I can not think of a single shot that is not something different. This group of filmmakers displayed little or no way in the way of imagination or genius. <br /> <br /> I was supposed to be a satirical which could not be familiar with Italian comics, but I'm sure it would be better than that.
