Steven Seagal played many action movies. Most of them were bad but not as bad as the patriot. This is a Z-series action low budget movie. Patriotism, Operation Delta Force, War Act, The Substitute 2, Plato Run, The Base, Drive, Subotje etc. Now Steven Sigal Mark Dacosos, John Cloud Van Dam, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busse, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others have been considered bad actors. The scene was full of holes and the letters were not realistic (probably due to very bad actors) and spent with your Patriot rent at 4.25 is called Lost Money !!! I give it 5 and half out (for smiles).
