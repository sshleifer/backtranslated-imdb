I believe this movie was a terrible waste of my time, and I can see it after 5 times in class. This movie does not really show exactly what happened at this time. Can anyone really say that this letter happened really? Even if actors have only good part, they are really frustrated. She was reading the script without publishing. Quite annoying I would rather see the school of the game. So I do not want to see this movie again in my whole life. If it's time you waste and you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981, it's time to waste time.
