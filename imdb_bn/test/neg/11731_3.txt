I saw this first review in IMDB that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Parkins in this role. I wonder if he saw the original. It is difficult to review psychoanalyst if there is no point in the film revolution in the 1960s. You have a heroine that is not very favorite and is not too far in the movie and a villain who is frustrated, but you feel for him. Add some graphic violence to this and there is a blue print for some of your 80s and 90s slash films. <br /> <br /> Where is this image wrong? Let's start with the cast. Ann Hei is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Von is all wrong. One thing, she looks so young, she looks so young Secondly, he has no idea how to play roll. Her nervous smile reminds Ron Howard of playing hard guys on a sunny day. He shouted everything, I did it! Original movies, even those who know everything about it, still feel uncomfortable about Norman's influence on the soil and make him a real separate character. How about shower scenes Finally I saw the 1960 film on a big screen, then I was surprised to be afraid of this hack. Bernard Herman scores incredibly sharp and loud, and during the scene, you are more afraid of Danny Elfman than the synth interpretations. This shower scene just helps us show Anne Heche's naked body and some beautiful colored blood. Which makes the colors our choice of film. Did not work. <br /> <br /> There is something about the restoration of classic films that never seem to work. Some might see it as a great test, but in truth, if there is nothing to join in this film of Gass Van Sant, he should be alone
