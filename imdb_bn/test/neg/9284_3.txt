Martin Lawrence I am not a funny person. He has just too much on his mind and he is very crazy to play in his first gorgeous journey. He tries to joke critics, which flies to "f *** them". Then he goes on to the throat cancer smokers but rather primitive sexual jokes and it just descends from there. 3/10
