I heard that this picture was stylish and interesting, but I just found it annoying. I've been watching this for a while (and hopefully I do not misunderstand all my memories and I condemn this movie), but my memory is that filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb. An anti-gay society, and in any case, had a terrible crime. I am not completely dissenting from this perspective, and it is inappropriate for both gay gay and Bobby Francs, both real victims of the story. I can not imagine why anyone wants to claim as a martyr. I also think LRL is actually portrayed as a little more sophisticated than them - finally they were thirteen years old at home. The film puts them in a fantasy world, which seems to have been done by Maurice. <br /> <br /> I read an interview with filmmakers only, which were meant to include film anarchrines such as the phone used in push-button characters, "Add Brechtian Distance". They certainly do it, but I found it very annoying. Apparently most people consider this movie interesting, but I might have liked "stylish" and more realistic test as part of less homosexuality, in the case of Leopold & Loeb.
