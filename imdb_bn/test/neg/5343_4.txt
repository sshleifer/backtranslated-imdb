As a writer teacher, two endings do not allow me to use my students: "Then I woke up" and "Then I got driven by a truck." I'm going to add now, "Then I got a flute on the head." I used this technique to cover the lack of imagination to feel completely wrong. Transmigration The whole thing can be guided by some intelligence and crafts, however, in this movie, they can not or can not do it. I'm not saying it totally worthless, but without the stupid end, its progress is so predictable. There are also people who go to the police to get help from this man. They should immediately get him done. It's just a forgotten, unlimited horror / sci-fi film, with nothing new to offer.
