I can not remember when I've seen a bad movie. The act was exaggerated, the dialogue became painful to hear, the second rate of special effects and the overall story was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go to a movie. , And if I was alone, I could have done it for about 30 minutes, and almost twice I had saved a plot with a lot of holes, more than a dialogue between my nausea and a Swiss panier, "the size of Texas". "I can not do too much of what is a sad experience sitting through this collosal waste of good celluloid. <br /> <br /> <br />
