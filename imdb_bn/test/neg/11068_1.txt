I am a brilliant filmmaker and I enjoy various types of movies. However, I have not enjoyed any of these movies. It's probably the worst movie I ever seen. I do not think most of it was the story, the letters were not desired and the relation between the characters was incompatible and because of the end, I just dislike the movie. This is not the same category as "Cave", which, in my opinion, is the best cave film ever made. Even "clan" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was $ 3.79 for me to rent the fare and see it. Make yourself a favor and this is a clear invoice.
