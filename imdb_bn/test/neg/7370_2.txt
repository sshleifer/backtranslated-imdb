It's really shame to see many genius people involved in what's happening in a very waste of genius. The plot is clich√©. The instructions are very self-conscious and the characters are almost caricatures. The most frustrating aspect of this movie is the performance of Gerard Depardieur in the English version (this film was shot at the same time in French and English). Although he was the best actor in the film, he gave them the worst performance. I must say that Bianca Garvis is very close ... <br /> <br /> In a more positive note, I must say that new arrival will give a great performance to both the Juliet Gosselin. Unfortunately this is the only good thing I can remember about this picture ... <br /> <br /> I do not apologize for my very good English ...
