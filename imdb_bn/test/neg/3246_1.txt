Hi, this is the worst movie of my life. The day I watched this movie, I had very high fever. But still I saw many movies with much patience. And after watching the movie, I felt remorse felt. Because, I've lost 3 hours for this stupid movie. I could rather take the rest of watching this movie. And I am really surprised how actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc have played in this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Are they as the director? Why do not they sit in the house and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I request all the directors that if they request the audience via mail or media, newspapers, radio etc. it will be good for them ... if they do not, then send them a nice story . Find a good story for a film to do. Please do not cinema like I request all the directors again.
