I've probably seen Spiderman before the day I saw Duchess Wild, but I do not think there might be any excuse for this movie as bad. There was to cast, but it seemed like once they found them with a suitable cast, then they had to try and fit them into movies. The only problem was they did not fit. I did not like any characters and the story was the best sketchy. I was wondering why I spent my money in this movie.
