Fun with Dick and Jane failed to entertain so much. Loose ends with writing, for example, it seems that the main contradictions were the accusation of Jim Carrier's character Dick Harper, but the authors have never followed that particular conflict. Originally the story is weak and mostly unclear, but Carey preserves some scenes with her physical humor, but genuinely, Jim Carey was not very funny in this film, and Tea Lyon was also there for his appearance because he was not funny. This is another example of housing banking, franchise actor with a frustrating single story.
