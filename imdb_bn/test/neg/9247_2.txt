I can only name a few movies which I saw as this bad one. The movie has everything terrible: the dialogue is Konye and Clich ', in most cases, for some exceptions, poor filmmaking is nothing for the lord, and the plot is stupid (a fat lady stalks a suburban family because her daughter has not created a football team). It's too bad, it's fun to see. If you can catch it in a living, I would highly recommend it as a comedy. As a serious movie, I was afraid that I would have to rate it. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious movie fan and look for an interesting and challenging story, do not watch this movie. , Or played well. No one is found. Edit <br /> <br /> I think a group working for a lifetime must have written some dirty reviews and voted for all the negative. Do not believe them. This is a really crappy movie.
