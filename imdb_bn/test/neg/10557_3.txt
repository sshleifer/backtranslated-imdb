How so talented or at least the charismatic actor winds up in this baloney? There is nothing good about this movie, but perhaps the worst is the screenplay and direction. <br /> <br /> It is apparently the heartbeat of director Damian Niemann, because he both wrote and directed (as well as played). He seems to name himself a letter magician and the other famous magician in terms of respect. As far as I know it was the film of its first feature, and its end in the possibility. <br /> <br /> Is it hard to indicate that it is so difficult ?? But I would say the story and the character is not credible (screenplay) and the direction it does not encourage (director). Plus ?? Poker Scenes Bad to the Worst Hollywood Method (Super Hands, Hollywood Rule)! The movie's supposed twists are completely anticipated or completely incredible. Good that they could just be described as "the best few scenes" to end up in a knit type of a story!
