I'll put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box that I'll sell for $ 2 in garage sales, including all the indoor videos. This story is coming back with the success of the previous movie, which has destroyed these people in this trash. Why these creators want to destroy the fame of the last two films with this sophisticated gene. The story was so long that it was a violent seagull. I mentioned coba before because it is the same mood, that a person can kill 20 or 30 gang members without scratch. Both of these movies and cobra were bent on showing hip level falling on between their guns and big numbers of enemies. Police officers spent hours in shooting ranges, why did the gang members shoot their hips and shoot them? This movie was so bad that I wish death for one minute 4.
