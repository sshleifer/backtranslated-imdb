This plot carries a great deal of drunkenness. Although he grew up, it was partly a story of a wealthy boy who became a crew member of the cargo ship, and became a man in the process. The title of the title is taken by a young girl on a ship owned by her father. When the cargo is burnt, he and crew members are transferred to our boys' ship. However, the captain is not respected in his mission where there is smuggling on his mind and is concerned about the dying. Inevitable beginnings - Our boys fall for human beings and for that they fall. Ultimately, wickedness decreases and lovers gather together. Some interesting conversations indicate that there is no male or female - "And there is no woman." (Sappho a node here). Dorothy Dalton is not appropriately harmless and very interesting as to die. Valentino works well in a romantic, action role. Her sexy build and body facility is shown off and the role is quite an old one. She is very interesting. This is a great film but it passes time. It really shows Valentino's beauty and sexiness.
