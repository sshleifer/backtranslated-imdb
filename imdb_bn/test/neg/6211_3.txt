Let's first talk about all our stories. This is a copy of the movie "Hit" with an additional Indian flavor. A boyfriend, who is a lover's teacher and another man who is apparently a patient, and how this makes this seemingly sticky lover, with the help of a beloved teacher, creates the story. Salman Khan is a lover's guru, and Govinda Link guy. <br /> <br /> Now the artists are coming out in the role, Salman Khan has acted throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but big time is wasted. You can scream Salman all over the movie, its performance has no real role. Govinda pair (Oh, my god, she's a girl's real beauty), a 50-year-old young man in real life, and Katrina was a girl in her first 20th century. In the film, Govinda looked like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a sadness! Movies Execution is coming. This movie looks like a bad movie of a B-movie, and movie hits. Where the hit looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this film is shallow and purposeless, right or no transparency anywhere. <br /> <br /> Just forget this movie, because it is rare, generally nothing more than Bollywood's rent. Actually I can give 3/10 because it is the lowest.
