I just caught it at the showtime ... ewwwwwww, the way of a bad movie kind of is even fun One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus TV reporter Survivor was the annoying Jerry in the past season. The only ridiculous thing was that there was a house from the "secret base" fantasy island (and millions of other film and TV shows; this place is located in the LLA area). I completely come out of Mr. Roarke and Tattoo and welcome the audience. If the tattoo was eaten by snakes, I could have given this movie a 2, but oh well. People stood there and shouted for five minutes when Comodo or Cobra instead of running around for them, it was quite fun, especially because you can really say that they are just screaming in an empty place where the computer anime is later drawn into the giant . Although in my flashback scenes, they are almost like Cobra or Comodo-then in the normal form - Some unexplained solid steel holders enter into some air holes. Does a wire cage have enough? Ha ha ha! Guess they can not afford to rent a real comodo and cobra. I have to keep showtime for their series and do not remember their movie.
