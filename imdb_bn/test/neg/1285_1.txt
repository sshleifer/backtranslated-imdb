What a valuable time to waste! My 5-year-old daughter was brought from my mother's house in this house, and we saw it as a family. None of us like it This unexpected little film, fluttering incompatibility with contradictions, crosses the quality of Christian themes and horror movies, even the courage is not worth seeing. It felt a little like attempting to film a bad high school drama classes. Seeing the gorgeous actor (Chris Atkins, Gary Buses, and the company) surrounded their path through this tragic and unclear story. What I can say about this movie is that the dog is beautiful. The film should have gone straight pounds. Avoid this film - your time is spent watching well dry paint.
