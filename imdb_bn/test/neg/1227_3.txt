I'm very less encouraged to write a review until the film's quality is inspired. I was so obsessed with Kamchchar Chand that I felt the need to warn others about how bad this TV mini series was. Here are some ideas. Indians: They make fun of the Indians, they came on Saturday night Live Skit. When Macmarty wrote dialogue in his novels, he read so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McKay: Looks like Feistus from the old Ganscoche series. Acting is OK and Robert Duval's MacKay methods are okay, but the look is pure comedy Cowboy. Clara: Perhaps you can use a little dirt or sweat at its next. Air conditioning before being in Austin in summer? I do not look at the women that promised you. Do you think they did not see any episode of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Elisha Page: Again when the governor is in the office, it seems like a Saturday Night Live skit, and Skit bombed. <br /> <br /> The call of Udro: The most rugged character of the call, of course he speaks very little how can you screw that up? But hey, what's that hat? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>> <br /> Perhaps I'm premature because the miniseries is not done, but I suspect that I'll look at it anyway. <br /> <br /> I hope no one can duplicate anyone. Lonesome Dove's impressive feeling, but I have seen it and feel there is no feeling in the old west.
