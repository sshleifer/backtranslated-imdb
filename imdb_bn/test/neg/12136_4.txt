Can anyone help me, I miss the last moment and I do not want to pay for the whole movie again. I am in the train car where they came and he said, 'What is that drink now?' And smile. What is next? Now there is dialogue or action? Surely this is not just the end? I was a little distraught in film and hope it would be better. Did anyone think of Christine Scott Thomas in the UK TV series that he was not about anything? I want to know the name. Sun pine was to eat your heart out of excellent medina! Everyone else is actually a little convincing of the film, it was a 'star star cast'. Ultimately surprised me, I thought he burned his boat. If you are a fan of a star, then he's valuable.
