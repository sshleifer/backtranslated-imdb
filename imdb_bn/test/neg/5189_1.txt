About 20 minutes on the plea of ​​the hair for the film, I realized it was an annoying person who always reminds me of a link or a lot of disrespect, because they think it is fun and trying everybody to entertain. <br /> <br /> This picture is billed for playing Tracy Lord, she is not bad actress, but her line is not funny and she is not starring <br /> <br /> except some Lord, playing KC The girl, and perhaps the colonel- which weirdly came out of the place, I've never seen without it. I can not imagine why retired military colonel wants to start a snowboarding academy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingard" currently gets 3.5 points, a 2.7 of "frostby". I split these two films into each other, 1.0, "The Godfather" compared to FGF's junk. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
