Once I saw a bit of the film, and critics were interested in seeing it's full interest to see why it's two stars, so I agree. Originally, the film starts with Kemerit the Frog (Steve Whitmayer) and tells all of his favorite pet kisses that they have lost everything, and they sit on the bench (and probably think of suicides) and end up sitting. Already, in another earth (angel angel) Daniel (David Arquette, who was already in the muppets from space) 'Kismat' (Hypie Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see this movie) showed that Kemmit really needs help. In flashbacks, it has prepared Kemerit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not real and good Frank Oz), Ganjo (Dave Goelz), Fazzy Beer (also Jacobson), Pope the Prion (Bill Baratera) and all other Muppets. The Christmas holiday displays a stage for many people, and it seems to be going all well. But in reality Rachel Beeterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to stop the show or theater, and Kimitt makes everything possible to ensure that the worm is not happening. Of course, Kimet failed the last time, and Byterman told him that he was finished, and he could officially take the theater. Daniel was sent as the guardian angel of Kimrett for his effort and help, but Kimmiet is not in the mood and finally he says "I have never been born". Obviously, you can recognize it as a wonderful life, which Kimrieb as Georgie Bailey and Cusack's Spuff as Mr. Potter, and ultimately, Kimitit clearly understands how much he has meant to everyone, and goes back to find the theater as a historical landmark. Whitwether acted as Wright and Bicker Rijo; Dr. Goosez as Bonsen Hendu and Waldorf; Barrates like Dr. Teeth, Rolf the Cook and Swedish Chef; Animal and Yoda as Jackson (the only character that sounds similar to the Oz version), William H. like Glenn. Matthew Lloyd; Messi, Luke Luthej, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Zuckbrook of Scrobes, Sire Driver, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reais, Mel Brooks Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Jenny; Robin the Frog, Stator, Pops and Floyd Paper as Jerry Nelson, and Kevin Clash Sam the Eagle The most memorable moment for me is the spool of the Moulin Rouge stage, in addition to this, the well-known faces are not superb. It was nominated for the "universal thing" song for the singing and singing of music. Muppets were 47 in 100 pop culture icons. Enough!
