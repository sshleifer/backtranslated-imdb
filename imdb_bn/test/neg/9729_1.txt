How nice! I do not even know where to start with making this movie so terrible. Maybe I just want to say that during the "hot collision" between the competing and the playwright, I had to leave the theater because I was so laughable. Yes Acting was really bad that was. Although played even the worst part was not. The plot is almost completely previewed. The letters are all resorted to roughly. Dialogue and "dramatic moment" is ridiculous. Bad man is out of control, drunk in power, simple But <br /> <br /> But the actor is beautiful, so guess that it can make it even better.
