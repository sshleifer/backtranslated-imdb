San Françoisso: 1 of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget does not exist, your camera tools are old and your star Joe Elevèvez (Martin Shane's younger brother and chief of the really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from different strokes. There are probably ways to pull at least a watchable film. The quiroz brothers have no formula. <br /> <br /> Most of the first cast has been selected by Bridges and Estevez in a great effort to look like Oscari Calib's Thespian. How difficult is the play of a priest or a mother? Certainly a city in size of San Francisco has few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Obviously Chris Angelo and Bonnie Stigger, who play this role, have other talents as their landlord or waitress, they must have fine tuning. <br /> <br /> Joe Rogatt (yes the serial killer is simply "The killer") as a murderer is also terrible in a mentally ill manner, but I would almost like to allow his character to doubt in writing with a zero-style or personality. The ridiculous serial killer is a problem for a serial killer. <br /> <br /> as well as the quiroz brothers It was planned as Week ABC Family Film, there is no nudity or violence to speak, and R rating is definitely for adult style pacing, this step is mandarin like an 85-year-old woman wrapperound sunglasses and driving with her counter-signings, only occasionally horrific horrific events. It happened to Atevez's face, which he saw as his jaw below That's what I paid to San Francisco but I was not expecting. The numbing of the mind is annoying.
