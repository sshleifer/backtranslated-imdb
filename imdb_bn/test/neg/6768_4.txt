I was impressed with this movie as an eight or nine year old child. The gangster is very real and threatens me, and I could see why people were afraid of someone like Dealing. It was almost ridiculous to see it as an adult, almost fifty years old due to the unusual description and the feeling of driving cars of Thirty Gangsters. There is a certain radioactive, incompatible reality on the way to portray criminals, but the overall effect is more as a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most weird bit of fun in my memories is the scene where Mother Barker and his sons are firing with the FBI and the boys have died. The narrator said something like, "Perhaps at that moment, for the only time in his life, Mother Barker became the real mother". It is meant to be a great tragedy and a moment in the path, the mother finally understood how she had destroyed her family from her own greed, but instead, she smiles. Very few weird movies that are rarely shown anywhere on this day. Gangster movie buffs may enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.
