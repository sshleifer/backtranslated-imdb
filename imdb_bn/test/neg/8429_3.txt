"Dispinning" I can remember the best word for this movie, especially considering it's the Moving Review obtained from some other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the film is that it is partly (both sense sense). It does not just present a very selective description of the games (it focuses on the American athletes group) but it has several errors, which in most cases exaggerate the problems faced by the United States. <br /> <br /> What is more annoying is that all the mistakes and mistakes (?), the exclusion of other athletes (including some celebrated exceptions) are displayed to glorify the US athlete. For example, the audience is believed that the United States won most of the medals in the Games, when they actually won four gold medals and won only 6 of them. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen (such as we are a proud Britt, and French swilling swilling). This attitude gives very little service to the Olympic ideology that the film should celebrate. At the conclusion, I believe that this film will appeal to the part of the American audience that is looking for a quick search for national self-respect. Those who look detailed and historically accurate details of the games are advised to look elsewhere.
