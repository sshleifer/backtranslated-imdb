Coach preachy or straight sappy It's attached to bad writing / played even worse. You can drink Gatorade after school, but I did not even do it, even at the 20th Tobi Robins / Island's philosophy, transmissive moments. It is not enough enough to be ample enough to be entertaining and informative. I respect the coach and program in the inspiration of this movie, but this step is terrible. Like the one who played rugby for almost 20 years in the United States, I had a good rugby movie (even if there was a little bit of rugby). And I can tell you that the hacka performed by Haq and a bunch of islands is not frightening (when it is run by All Blacks, boys with a lot of importance, everyone saw it, now it's far away). If you want real panic, then line up from the South African bunch (the actual rugbys). This is a fake and poorly executed film about being a genuine and good person.
