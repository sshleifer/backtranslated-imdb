Savage Steve Holland wrote and operated his second film, One Crazy Summer, and was again supported by John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong. Cassack and Bobcat Goldthwaite were led by Cape Cod for the recent graduates to be the grandmother of the summer golfwight. On the way, they pursued Demi Moore by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Together, three of the three together combine to try to become a lobster restaurant, combined with a corrupted family considering a bad word "work". This movie has many fun vintets like Million Dollar Radio Contest Jog and Godzilla Skit. <br /> <br /> Like Holland's first film Better of Dede, John Cusack joined the film. Otherwise, it is a filthy film filled with a narrow circumstance and stupid characters (quirky opposing) an ugly. Moore sang a few times a nightclub with some awesome synthesizers. After some time, Goldthwaite's cats wear thin and there was no actor to appear in anything other than Armstrong Gray J Staff. Fork truck twins are instead meant to be endearing underdogs, rather than highly annoying and offensive. It's a hit or miss, more of a kitchen sync comedy which can use better script and direction. * 4/2 star 1/2
