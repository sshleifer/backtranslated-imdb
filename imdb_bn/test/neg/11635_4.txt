The first shown is 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Animation group's fast, horrible animations attempts to release many of the favorite games for TV and cartoon characters like favorites, but definetly extremely unlike the villain There are. I'm not sure why kids choose this movie because the old movie stars have many references that kids do not know very little or nothing. Despite the raves in the box compared to Disney's efforts like Allen and Lion King, try the best. Do not let this fool you - there is no comparison between the stories or the quality.
