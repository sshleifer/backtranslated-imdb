I think Tom Hendges is a good actor. My children enjoyed reading this book when I was young. I was very disappointed in the movie. Boring with a voice that gives a character fully feeling the fingernails on a wheelbarrow. There is a completely unnecessary train / roller coaster view. Some characters and scenes seem to be scary for small children who made this film. The North Pole scene with Santa and elves may have been beautiful and charming. This scene or character was absolutely no warmth or charm. It usually does not work to create a small children's book in a feature film. This movie completely grates on my nerves.
