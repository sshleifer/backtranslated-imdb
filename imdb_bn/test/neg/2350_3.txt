First of all, let me clear it. This movie is a real part of the garbage, however it is a real piece of garbage, a good piece of garbage than it could be. It could be sucked big time, but it does not ... <br /> <br /> What was not this movie, scary moment, for example was well played and had a good script. It was not very entertaining either. But the film was quiet music, fancy and hot girls. It works great as a Dracula Explosion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sound familiar? Yes, so do it! After reading through <br /> <br />, you can think that I have to give it a good vote. Because I did not because I felt sleeping at some time ...
