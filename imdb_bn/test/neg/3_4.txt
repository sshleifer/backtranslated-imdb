Wow, another Kevin Coast ner Hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Vayt Erepe, Robin Hood and even Baseball Films. He looks like the film makes specially the center of attention. The letters are almost always the same ... heroism, error, greatness, collapse, release. Yup, in the first 5 minutes of the film, we all want to be scared of its character, and it creates much more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... story? ... just a collage of different movies. You do not need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, though it had different titles. You will know what will be the way before it happens. It's like an officer and gentleman mixing with backdrop, but both are easily good movies. See backdrop to see how such a movie should be made ... and how to see a good but little underlying actor, Russell, the hero.
