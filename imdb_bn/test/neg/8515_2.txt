I'll give it a couple because it contains lots of music, otherwise it will be a. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and this is my first "Road" picture which I have seen. I was hoping well waaaaay. Robert Osborne said the best of these Road Films If this is true, then do not bother me to see others. The best thing in this movie is to have lots of songs from the first half, but it is compatible with the only production numbers with the dancing in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I do not like the movie. Hope neither Crosby came all the better, their characters were not very charming, the movie was not funny, most of the conversations were just lam fillers, there were not many activities, many were not spectacular. <<br> <br /> What I expected was not a movie. I had more "road" prospects, but there are not many things. They quickly make it in the palace and then most of the movies are there eventually. The famous "road" style I broke the fourth wall was a lot more prospect, where the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot. That was just about 4 instances in that. One of these is an example of this funny non-funny script: <br /> <br /> (Hopefully the conspiracy has been restored in crossbows) Crosby: I know all! Hopefully yes. But the people of the half way through the photo have not come. Crosby: You mean they missed my song? <br /> <br /> Those two poor fifth line, but at least they are really jokes. Most of the scripts left no joke. An example is: <br /> <br /> In the morning you remind me to throw a piece of cheese. (Indirectly calling a mouse). It's not funny, it rarely qualifies as a joke, but this is the most illogical dialogue that carries the film. Most scenes do not come close to such curiosity, using only the usual unusual dialog: <br /> <br /> Crossbie: Hey, Honda, 'Take me? Do you think you can touch me on the dog? Hopefully why did not you do this to me? Crosby: Yes but that was the reason I 'look out for us'. You do not look outside for anyone. Hopefully yes! Then why did I check? <br /> <br /> (The above came from my memory. That is not true, but it refers to me). <br /> <br /> ... Just the generic dialogue with no joke. <br /> <br /> My grade: Time wasted
