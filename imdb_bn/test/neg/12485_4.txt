Face! Antoine Monot in Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, in a copy keeps asking for it, but the author / director Christian Zübert did not listen. Zübert just can not say no matter joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns and divine Jonathan Richman of Calyxico, separated the old school of "There is something about Mary" that will satisfy a small town dropout story. In the visual aspect, Stefan (Luca Gregorovich) is not going anywhere enough to wear BMW's two-door, ambience shade in his six series. True, he * accidentally * woke up with his wild eyelashes Bohemian kid (Mary Zielcke), but then, who did not? In the liberal dosage of that mysterious substance, how does it appear to be black and white, but if you are looking for a more serious rendering about what a drug can do with you, then I'll show you "Fear and Cruelty in Las Vegas" out.
