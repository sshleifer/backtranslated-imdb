I received a screening of it at the film festival of true / false documentary in Columbia, Missouri, and I was quite disappointed. I'm expecting a cool documentary in the protest and activation around RNC, but what I found is a big flaw, bad acting, fantasy, conspiracy, badly worn stories. I heard about his neo-documentary tactics, "combining both true and false" but I was more expected to develop a fabulous story for better personality and unity between real interviews, but it was much more conspiracy theories for creating a terrible Tv movie The acting is not terrible except for Rossario, which is not surprising considering director director of screening said that most of the main characters were not trained, his excuse was that he wanted them to be real. Gives a hint, real people can not work, but actors can usually do practical work. <br /> <br /> It was not too objectionable to be too slow that it was very radical conspiracy theories, especially violent across the whole film when we saw scenes where director Kyomoz and ridiculous intelligent theories and the secret The agenda starts to get disturbed. The film plays a good role in stereotyping every single role, ridiculously trying to romanticize this street and make it so hard to stamp a big 'Good' or 'Evil' on each character. <br /> <br /> Leave it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary /
