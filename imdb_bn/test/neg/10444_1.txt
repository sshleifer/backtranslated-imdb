This is one of the worst movies of all time. There is a scene where they can be under water and they are literally walking on the earth and they added bubbles! Shark is boring and silly thing produced in this big slow computer. Antonio Sabato is awesome, I mean even worse than usual. How does this guy work? The direction is worst and there is no redeemable in the whole movie. I love shark movies and this one is just frustrated. I have seen this studio movie before and there are some stars on their way that they do bad things they do. I would rather see an unknown actor who thought about making a good story.
