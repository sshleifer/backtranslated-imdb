This movie was a big slap and switch. I hired it because of Rebecca St James, the popular Christian singer. I met him and he was amazed by what he was doing in the UFO movie. Well ......... <br /> <br /> I think he has acted in this movie to help a friend or friend of friends. My first source that this movie was never supposed to be was when I saw the special effects of facing UFOs. Chestnut! After the film's progress, I saw how the performers were plastic. It was interesting that almost all of the movie used to wear solid colors. (There are some exceptions) <br /> <br /> Rebecca was frustrating. She always found at home and did not show realistic facial expression when she came back to fold her husband. Does he never leave the house? <br /> <br /> I had to close the movie several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe in this movie's message - believe in what we believe or enjoy and go to hell. Jesus spreads a message of love and hope. His message inspires not to fear, change the love of others.
