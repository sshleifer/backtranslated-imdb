Dear Saifi Channel: How are you? How was your summer I'm fine, but I think our relationship is no longer the same and we're going separate. I do not understand why you do not love me anymore? I just finished with your SciFi Channel Original "Skeleton Man" and again, you missed the respect of my feeling by closing every great girl in this movie! I mean, I understand that you are at the moment instant instant gratification. The care you care about is creating a movie where people are overwhelmed and a suicide Indian soul / animal / legend / whatever. So you do not have time to think or try anything else - like wearing clothing for Schlitten Man who does not make him like a homosexual lover of "O Man" from Skater. Seriously, his clothes are like a satin blanket sheet and his poles are smooth behind the baby, he looks almost as a killer-for-Halloween-6-year-old man, since he marches through the desert on a homicidal rampage. So we throw you a bone, because we are not looking at the responses to the Oscars-winning performance, the character of fantasy or the reality of the situation. Because we realize that although Michael Rumer, Caspar Van Egg, and all the girls are trained in special oz agents, they all become mysteriously converted to keystone copes, when Scleton Man is not shown directly or shoot directly. And we do not expect anything entirely - bullets, explosions, electrocations, nothing - until the film is left for a minute, Scattan Man has to be killed and we have to find ways to sort our things nicely. We hope to see blood and guts. But you have done a joke to make the best actress the whole actress and to make her the only woman to survive. And quite genuinely, I think you just do it to oppose. Because this movie is as stupid as it is possible to be a "very bad-good" classic, and killing all hotties destroys everything - and forces me to reduce its ratings. What I say is, once, you take my feelings into account and let the live girls live the film. Please
