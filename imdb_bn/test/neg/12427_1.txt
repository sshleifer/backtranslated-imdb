I think it's like a few movies which I want to give as low as possible to give it a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this film in about 25 years, so I can really do not say much about it. It seems still very difficult to find videos. But I remembered my brother and in the mid-1980s, I was hurt by the poisonous 10-year-old poisonous seed in the toxic stream of Channel Television. So I have never really seen the beginning of the movie, but I have seen most of it. I think the first thing is that these couple is coming out of Campusite and they are planting to get out of the island, and then they attack an ass with an ax by an insane Scottishman! They managed to escape from him, but people were attacked by Nest Monster, the film had only one head and neck with the body. The giant can not remove the eyes and mouth too, it seems like a piecat. <br /> <br /> I mean that I have never seen anything literally before this level and it completely blown my mind completely. I saw some bad movies on TV in the early 80's but I have never seen so much uninterrupted and so amazed and built incredibly that it seemed like a man who we spent less time and effort on seeing it. I have already seen some of the trauma films and deliberately viewed the kind of "campi" thing, but it was pure and original, and it was really my first face-to-face with my amazing film production. This movie was like the last smell of the era of Drive and I got a quarrel at the right time. In fact, when we were watching it, we could not make it in the 50's and 70's. <br/> <br /> I later contacted science science theater and learned about many older movies and serials, but I have already seen it in this movie. The film is so funny that I never lost the hard-earned money with the Monty Python crew or Bill Murray or a comedian. After watching this movie, I was always trying to search for "good" films and I had many friends in it. But this was the movie and basically find it an impossible one. I've never found what it was, or Larry Buchanan closed the IMDB in the 1990s, and the internet was shut down, and the information started moving around. But this film still needs to be invented by many who can appreciate its outstanding bad qualities. Looking for it.
