I can not make it any easier, it's a terrible film. I have worked in art and made several films (small), so my standard is very nice but seriously, I absolutely hate this picture. I did not make any comments before IMDB, but I hate this picture so much that I had to literally come and warn others. It's a piece of sh *. Writer / director is a fool, who has no idea of ​​making a good film / writing and a teenage girl's writing skills. Characters are unrealistic (do not think of taking the pistol of the main female police member, but still encouraged enough for the development of the Miltonov cocktail?) And even be loved, I hated him in hell and was delighted in his death. The director does not understand how the director is trying to figure out his giant redeck, but it looked like a vague writing and convenient bullsh * without any real thought to me. I've officially seen the worst movie all year. Congratulations Shiban, you should now move with such greats as Matial Bay, "should not be allowed to waste billions of dollars for the creation of a movie" club. I hope you read this, what I really do And 163 idiots who see this picture are 10 bwahahahaahahahahahaahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahh
