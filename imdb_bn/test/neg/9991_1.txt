Every aspect of the movie is very rare to see the strike, but the "caligula" must be kept out of this title. I'm not sure what's horrible; Violence, sexual abuse, acting or plot (or its severe lack). <br /> <br /> In 25 hours, the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" roams around one and a half hour to reach the throne. And in power when he shows conviction and distortion. Acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of ice. Obviously knew that the film was legally inevitably lacking in any way, the directors decided to throw as much possible nudity and painful scenes as possible. But do not make fools, these scenes do not turn away from the scandal of this film or draw attention. The camera work is frustrating, the conversation is ridiculous that you actually need to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing the black play), just as a simple line of face to face. And then there is violence .... <br /> <br /> If you are going to prepare the film Some tortures take place in the film (not just by writing), but with the reinstatement of the audience as well as the smallest position or objectives, through violent acts. The achievement of this movie is only the purpose. One must think, how the filmmakers will appeal to the horror, nicrophilia and fraud (only a few numbers). When it ends belatedly after half an hour you have nothing from this film without some annoying images and the knowledge that you've ever seen the worst movie. <br /> <br /> you have been warned
