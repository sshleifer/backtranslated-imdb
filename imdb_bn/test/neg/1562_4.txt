Plot: Four people are caught in a lift. A businessman, an annoying person who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone, and it is a dull pressure and a feudal sample. Then her colleague, a woman who is much happier in her character. A teenage rebel who had just broken into a coke machine and his mere presence carried businessman's insanity and an old man, who stole only 100,000 DMMs ... .. <br /> <br /> how they all face their problems As time goes on, and without any success in reaching out to the outside world, such as the lights go out, and since the stars begin to snap after another. <br /> <br /> And yet, it's not very exciting. Characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how many things can be so wrong in one lift?). You do not like letters too much, you just hate one of them. And not all the twists and turns of the platform are contributing to the tension, they are just fools to fill the dialogue with a few more minutes, because the screenlists are driving the full length movie set of elevator and moving away from the ink. <br /> <br /> Let's hope "phone booths" will be a good effort ...
