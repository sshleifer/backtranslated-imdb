Thomas Edison did a great job of daughter but the WTF is !!!! I'm sorry but this movie is just terrible. The plot is that the elephant walks on a certain point and becomes electrocute. It's okay to see the quality of the photo used for toilet paper. I thought that the early Charlie Chaplin movies were terrible. Well, Thomas Edison might be an inventor, but why did he create this movie, he fed a child and it might have been better. People may say that I'm violent in Times, but you enjoy something better than what Edison says I might have created a LightBlow but why did he create this special movie. Well I can have a whole #Sound like a # hole but watch this on YouTube then you will see this hate. I still can not believe this film is completely awesome. All the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1/10
