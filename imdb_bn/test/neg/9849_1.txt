There are many things wrong with this movie where I do not know how to start. The story is not soluble at all. I guarantee the movie five minutes that the average viewer will go into his head in a confusion. <br /> <br /> I remember the movie before being bored of unconsciousness: Some of the annoying fathers have tolerated some pre-teen sisters who do not become abusive by the house but after all. In the next scene, girls are about 15 They are driving with their parents and hit a deer. The deer may be explosive, because their car stays high, one sister hurts others from burning debris. Then, girls are drifting into a boat in a lake and are going to visit Kentucky (??) and have a great plan to start a new life. The very next scene, girls are hitchhiking towards a military base. And it's a military base In fact, it is like a hog farm that has turned into a military-like look and plays a lot of confused extra "soldiers". The base commander's office is particularly great because it hangs over an AK-47 wall and a drill sergeant cap is randomly mounted on a plate (????) so that the audience can tell that it is a military office Then shows some random couples running a motorcycle and the base commander orders him to go to the "town" to buy some nude magazines and the soldiers do not think he is "pink party". So our character transforms a pickup like a "city" into a military truck and loads a box with a ammunition doll in front of the door with a nondescript "bookstore". Girls hide the girls while hiding the truck, and look for porn stages to find items like "anal attackers". I suppose that most people scare away just enough to plot. Keeping aside, the sound quality is terrible and the film is full of symbolism's fattening efforts, such as a radio propagandist talking about the visible fruit where the "whore" fulfills the main character for the first time, or how the camera links <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not worth the money in any case.
