Stephen Gillenhall (Director) reduced some of the Bong Rips for a good film, in an effort to create some ridiculous but serious film about growing marijuana art. Although Cast is not something amazing, this movie is extremely difficult to sit. The role of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillip, John Bon Jovi, Han Azarier, and Kelly Lynch could not have failed the film. To test this movie in the local video store, it would be wise to flush bills of three single bill under the toilet. <br /> <br />
