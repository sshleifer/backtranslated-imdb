"The Love Letter" is one of the movies that was really clever, but they ruined it. Focusing on the letter to destroy a letter in a small town, the film has nothing to do with it. Tom Seleck and Alice Drumand have recently starred in the super-sunny "In and Out" (a small town bothered), where they both were great, but here they look like they've got more drugs everywhere. I can not tell the people behind the camera to try here (if anything), but they certainly did not achieve anything. How sad, a possible laughter riot has been so sadly lost.
