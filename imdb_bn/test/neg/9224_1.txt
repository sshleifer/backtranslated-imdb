This is actually a spectacular bad movie, but it is an rare kind of evil that is constantly, jaw-entertaining! I would like to add other comments to this photo. <br /> <br /> "rock band" on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad kisses. See for kids <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Depending on the shot it is dirty or clean. <br /> <br /> * Speaker! The staff tiger becomes a real creature to save the goat (and the author)! <br /> <br /> Little Jimmy floats Amazon in a coffin, his staff is trapped in a tiger and is stuck permanently. Your memory Listen to the most uninterrupted sound effects: When the priest is going to find Jimmy, it is late, the guide claimed his beggar's clothes as a payment - the priest started walking on one knee. The moment of resignation and a bell sound, a church bell is not deep "BONNNGNG", but is a bell "Ding" from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> It's a complete hatred to see.
