Usually ask us to remember important historical events and usually be forgiven often during those spellings with enough interest to continue the story. Bravo's bat builds New America for control of 18th-century British and French Quebec (across Canada). This is a huge epic of fascination, but sadly, this image is a ugly - a two and a quarter of a film's tiring mess in the hands of writer Pierre Bilan (whose script is deserving of the worst rage for the season), and the screwed, stuttering and confusing instructions of Jean Bauvedin. <br /> <br /> Even a great actor - Naimei Gaudin-Wigenuke as Marie-Lap Carinen, as the Franco Les Guardian with David La Heieye, is fond of Bearer Gervais, LÃ©chier Thomas Sonorou, and the likes of Gerard Depardieu and Irina Jacob, Vincent Perez (Ridiculous in time), Tim Roth as William Pitt, James Mann as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Aija as General James Wolf . - It does not help. Such kindly actors must be narrow on their written croid lines for their character! Cover the whole mess with a musical score collected by Patrick Doyle and a long film to avoid the result. Sorry to say such bad things about an expensive project, but beware ... .Gaddy Harp
