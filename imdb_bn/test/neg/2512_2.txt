It's a pretty nicely rebuilt. Starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake because it reminds the audience that it was a small piece of pieces. The lower version is the orthography exercise. <br /> <br /> Brian Carwin plays a 'son of the city' photographer who returns to the semi-deserted desert where unused cooled stock charts spread: Lollipop sucking WB-doll Lolita, 'Old Old Cot Prospector, Assane Vet and Its Asian Wife etc .. <br /> <br /> <br /> Carewain's character is witness to the disaster of 'some' in the middle of the hill and after some strange events, strange blue rock As has been scattered. By the time the temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people begin to work strangely, things burst. Curvin's character comes out of his car outside and outside of humanity in a film. The film does not develop any space, no character development, no humor, no excitement, no intelligence. Jack Arnold's original fantasy little war paranayas made everything classic was abandoned. It only runs through its minimum hoops and then ends. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special - the interior of the ship looks like a cell phone surrounded by a rope that is kept in front of it. The camera goes to the screen to make some strings of some of the most strangely and painful cables. The script is repetitive - everybody has at least twice to say, Curvein "thrown out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in one scene. Things are finally left to load - for example all the heat and water needed for the alien? - Nobody will care about observers; If filmmakers did not care why should we? <br /> <br /> Playful enough - better than scripts, which sometimes qualify for a juristproductive quality. Although often actors think that they want to get as soon as possible - a significant example of this is Elizabeth Penn, the moments of "unexpected disappointments face-to-face". Seeing him "angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table" gesture. <br /> <br /> The errors of the carbon jeep are behind the zipper (disappearance of the sticker) and disappear, double the gas in the explosive car, a city-person is in two places at the same time - Alien Steveir PV shot at once is a reaction. Shutting down, Elizabeth Penah was locking the car twice ... Can you say that I was not arrested? The movie errors that work the greatest. It's annoying.
