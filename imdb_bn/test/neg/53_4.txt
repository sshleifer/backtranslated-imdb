I did not get it! The "Horror Star" teenager is the first fan of the fearsome fans, although their favorite statue (Conrad Radzoff) goes away, but they can dig its dead body and make disrespectful things, such as disco-dancing around the house, and this food break. That sounds like a real horror fan will do something, now it is? I'm a big fan and I very much like the Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, and Boris Karluff, I do not believe in the icon, but I do not think of their memory laugh. Wonder surprise, Konrad comes back from the dead ?? Confessions, After a Sense ?? To close the face of the earth! Mr. Radzof was not already known for his friendship, since he sometimes killed a director who expressed disagreement with his point of view and even after his death, he was suffering from a tremendous arrogance. Even in his tomb there are video messages to stabilize potential viewers, and thirteen groups will definitely experience that they enjoy the business of murder outside their film set. "Horror Star" (AKA "Fattermeyer" and "Body Graduates") is a beautiful flash of 80's beautiful link, but there are some cheesy and poor highlights. The film is basically suffering from its stupid plot, because anyone? Is not even a film school student ?? Recently, enough to be stupid enough to steal the dead body of the graveyard and it really seems that he will move with him, and there are many tiring moments for the struggle. Conrad's video lectures outside of the grave speaks extra and imposes explicit tension, but on the other, his killing system is joyfully innovative. A teenager enjoys living birth experience and another (Jeffrey Combs one of his first roles) loses his head in the joyful decapitation sequence. The order of the absolute mess, a poor girl's head is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddes von wanted to pay tribute to the horror movie and clearly see how the movie is awesome. The position and the scenery are great, but there was a lack of necessary money to pay for his film with proper continuity and editing. The performance of the overall performance of the performance, Ferdin Moin (Christopher Lee imitation) and Jeffrey Kombus have given the most memorable role. "Horror Star" can rarely be seen or even called a good film, but if you are a fan of enthusiastically creating a B-horror, then it's worth the tracking.
