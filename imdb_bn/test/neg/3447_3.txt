Writer-director Paul Chart's Coen Brothers-Wanabe relies heavily on ideas from other (better) movies, but an observer moves to create such a wonderful environment that keeps an eye out. In the Robert Forster season, never before the psychotherapeutic psychotherapist (high hectare) was killed in the desert. The film is unusual, but in an effort to keep the audience one step ahead, isolating and closing (cruel abusement with the role of Amanda Plummer). An engrossing delusional finale, many intriguing bits of business - and Forster looks great in the nude - it's a curiosity item, and nothing else. Veteran film director director Irviven Karsner produced, and probably should be directed (Paul Chart could be an alias?). * **** to 1/2
