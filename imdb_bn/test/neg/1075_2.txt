The film was good at the box office, and the creators of this mess believed that stars had such good chemistry that they put their dark screws first to the gazette. To be honest, I am surprised to see all the positive comments about this ludicrously funny comedy. Both lead letters have seven-year-old maturity and are very less attractive to spend time with. Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabr give excellent support to an experienced supporter. And, beautiful cinematography seems to have turned into Spain's rich countryside. And, there are four or five funny scenes that can be seen in both scenes and with the whole bunch of recycled and unclear clutter. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend starting with a kiss.
