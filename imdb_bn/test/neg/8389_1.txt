This movie was so bad that it looked like a movie movie. In one scene, the camera tilts very slowly and slowly down, then move to the place again. The word is crackly, and sometimes fades out again In another scenario, the camera man is visible only in a mirror. <br /> <br /> The scene was shown how to make a tent ... which believed in me, lasted for ages and the plot was completely irrelevant. Most views drag with conversations that are not completely relevant. In my opinion, the film was filled up and it was made more long. Even with these scenes it was too small. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it was a scattered head which was quite realistic.
