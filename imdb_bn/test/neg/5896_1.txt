This documentary was very amateur. It may be made by college students. It is assumed that my gradeing is as follows. Content: C, Sound Quality: F, Cinematography: F, Acting: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Bobshot: A ...... Above grade: D <br /> <br /> I got myself Cameramanstep Along with each step we move down to the street with character. My mother-in-law also changed the battery in her miracle ear and she could not hear the Muffled Dialog. Extensive post production editing and CGI will not help this bomb. These students will pass my course "barely". My advice ... Do not waste your time or money for your "time".
