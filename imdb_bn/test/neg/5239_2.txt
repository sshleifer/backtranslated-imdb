I like Christopher Lambert as an actor. He has acted in many good films (Hillandar, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can not remember that he has acted in this movie. The story is almost nothing, special effects are very bad and the actors are also. To start the film again, I have only one thing to say: this is the first time I am going to see a movie and want to go after 10 minutes.
