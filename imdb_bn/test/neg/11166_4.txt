You know what I did last summer in Korea "Following the way of the story of his American counterpart: A year after a group of high school students mistakenly killed a classmate, masked killers started taking one by one on one by one. Those who could show them at night - or did they have their "victims" still alive when they threw him into the sea? <br /> <br /> <br /> This is sure to ensure the movie of ilke and scary. No record, "I know ...", "The House on Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among others) and failed to deliver a great shock throughout the 95 minutes. > <br /> Honest from the casting cast, who seems to be the norm in Korean film, the unsolicited script communicates with Gasto and unexpected enthusiasm. Directions are always moderate, however; Camera is a strange choice of angle and the worst killer clothing ever * contributes to the fall of records. The most frustrating movie is the end of the film, where two 'wonderful twists' are clearly clear that you have been dismissed as very blatant before them! <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of the record is its brilliant start - the first job is actually fantastic and American characters show how the character should develop and mood - but besides this, it's a very poor movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
