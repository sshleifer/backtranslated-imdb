I'm going to publish my review because I'm not a supporter of the 'direct video' genre for a great loan interest in the 60's Greenhouse movies. I have no ownership, I never hire, so there is no lack of gratitude for my tongue and cheeks, low-budget people who have other people. <br /> <br /> I grabbed this film with a lady friend on a Saturday evening on Cinemax. Please do not ask me why I saw cinemax on a Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with world championship poker. Misty Mind's some unreasonably bad acting courtesy (and I wish she did not come from Illinois, because we've actually made some really brilliant Thespian here) attracted our attention. Now, naturally, some good soft-core obscenity targets you and your partner to get in the mood. Some good sex, hilarious tongue, and who knows what? About 15 minutes later, and in a scene where the character of the title seduces a fallen victim, my lady friend said, 'If you want to see the rest of this fine, I'm going to bed so I do not have to. Volume off. Here I was collected from this plot: Mrtyty's character is a sexist, who is pierced by a spider, and with the ability of super shoulder to turn her super wrist, which does not come from her wrist. There are some bad villains involved, who do not particularly look bad or sexy. Spider's day saves, sex is, MJ (male in this movie) is constantly recommended by bad gay bike, and anyway evil villains shoots them from a building on his death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this film? It's over <br /> <br /> Was it bad? Acting to look like a third-class sponsor like the Oscars, I can not know whether a sex scandal written by people who see them being drunk, adult sexually transmitted in college, who accept a class taught by Dr. Ruth, does not know about sex. Was anyone special about jumping off trumpoline, as funny as the effect of humor ?? Well, I still have to face something that Lama has. Sex scene? If we watch a video, the scene that was launched in that scene is the fast forward button. And action scenes? Some of my old VCS games had some good choreography. <br /> <br /> Now I know this kind of movie should be enjoyed for its underlying badness. Companies like EI do not set up for film making: they have a special place and they are targeting it. My experience as a businessman tells me that they have the money to serve their audiences. But after the brief publication of my Spiderman Abbey, I can say that I am not leaving the world again at any time. Maybe this is the problem of filmmakers in such a style: they are paying so much attention to the movies that if they try and focus on them, they will be very enjoyable. 'Le Bad' movie, a La tromba film of the 80's. Sorry guys; The soul is there, but no effort is needed. <br /> <br /> I must admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me ??
