I am a huge Shirley Temple fan. When I saw this movie, it made me realize what a talented baby was really in Sheryl. Ashley Rose Orr probably made Shirley the worst screen. Imagine the 11-year-old Sheryli Temple 11 years old. It's wrong in itself. But Shirley's voice to 'mickle' him? And it's sad to sing. The dance was good, I would say that. Previous users said that there was a little dramatic scene, there was nothing to make the story interesting. Even not even the Amazon Years ... I have seen a wide-ranging global phenomenon that the Sheryli temple was built. The Wizard of Oz was very much focused, when in fact, Sheryl was considered for Dorothy. The film describes that when it does not get the role, it is the end of the world. Sherly told himself that Judy Garland was happy to play with him. For me, the girl at the show Girl Gatewood Temple played. Otherwise, stay away! For the Great Sherly Temple movie, see Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
