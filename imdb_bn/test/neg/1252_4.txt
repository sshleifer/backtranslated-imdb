This movie has made Stu Anghar's life interesting by being creative. Did they forget that their lives were very entertaining on their own without creating accessories? <br /> <br /> A short list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) Stew was not sent for live repayments for live repayments in Las Vegas directly, he spent the first time in Florida and left out of Gene Beach on East Coast Came and went to Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) Steve was never associated with a casino executive (as played by Pat Marita in the movie) <br /> <br /> 3) On the 1997 WSOP buildup The witch did not change. Actually Stewi made this tournament. He even torn cocaine even earlier in the week. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tell the story correctly, or do not say it right. 4 of the 10 for the trustworthy performance of Michael Imperoli (the only release quality for this movie.)
