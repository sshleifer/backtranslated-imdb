OK, I just caught the channel flip and DW3. I found it to be a trash ... but a person who saw many movies, that I have ever seen as one of the most purely bad movies ... I'm not kidding. It's too bad that you will see it, like a bad accident you can not escape from. Sometimes such films work, such as Tromba Cinema ... but it seems like Martin Barsam and Charles Bonson are painful. It is more interesting that I pulled the IMDB, what other people said and it actually scored a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe it's 1.5! Equally interesting is not the title of this series ... in some way did the trash part 4 and 5? And it's all off, here's some dude's comment series best and always referred to as his favorite film ??? That statement made me afraid of the world!
