I would not recommend anyone who does not like to laugh at any movie, but not with anyone. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I will not loot it, but the most used set of movie clay is sometimes half-hearted for the last five minutes of most disappointment in a movie. The most crooked Education scene is the attempt of chemistry on-screen between two important roles, when we lovingly bring Denzel Washington's finger to Angelo Jolie close-knit. This is the only thing that can be moved, but why is it behaving with a zoom of Washington's fingers with the viewer, so that there is a slow light for sex and a stroke like music is out of my way. I smiled loudly and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the story carries a lot from SE7EN, but here it has been implemented more easily, and very clearly. It's a poor people Se7en will be a understatement, it's not really nothing to create for TV movie and even Jolie and Washington's best efforts can not ensure this box office film.
