I only gave this image 4 because I saw it in 3D. If you can not see it in 3-D, I give it 2. This movie is so bad that it's not funny. Anyone can make a film like this for a week's salary. Bad acting, impact and story !!! But it was watch to see 3D. Why can not they make good movies in 3D format ???
