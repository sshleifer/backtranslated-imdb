About the movie, there are enough comments. <br /> <br /> I recently wanted to say something about the German version, which I recently saw on TV. It is widely cut. 103 to 76 minutes! The most bloody scenes for German Television is normal. I understand the reason, but this movie was something else. They just did not have "Gore-Shots" - they just cut the entire sequence by shining shiny. Like: "We have to attack them" - A 5-second shot of the explosion in the camp - The heroine is running away. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to follow it even when the attacks on the island begin. Storyline All cuts create something which is unreasonable, a string of isolated scenes that no other sense gives. <br /> <br /> I could not stand to see the end after spending 60 minutes on this ignorance. <Br> <br /> I think I could give the original 7/10 the German version only 1/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and runtime See first) or forget it.
