This movie is watchable, but nothing special. A road trip to Vegas has decided to take a hitchhiker of four girl stupid (because she's cute). They all can spend the night in a middle of the middle and in the middle, Hitler's psychological problems with the women become clear. <br /> <br /> The letters are - Married, responsible woman; A slutty party girl; Must be an uncertain bride; And those who hate a man just have been dumped. Hitachi is truly beautiful as long as he gets mad. <br /> <br /> There is not enough pregnancy here, and there are not many rape cases. I enjoyed many of the slasher horror / thriller, and this one did nothing for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The conversation is not terrible, and overall I was fascinated with Cast, never seen or heard of them before. And this plot was not out of the possibility (although today I'm really suspicious of any woman and picking a hit at the age of adolescence - no matter how interesting she is), so I was not boring that things were not sensory. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Hitahaier" was good acting and sensual, but was not very interesting. There are many good movies in the same genre that I would recommend ("Stop Stop," "The Devils Rejects," "Texas Chainson Genocide," even "The Heater" rebuilding). Make a favor on yourself and avoid it if you have no other option.
