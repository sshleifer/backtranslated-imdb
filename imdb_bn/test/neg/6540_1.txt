"The Cathedral of The Puff" was a great 84-minute discovery of my life which can not be restored and could not be spent more appropriately (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a good use of life's precious moments). This should be called "The Chapel Chair" because only 'Pamie' chairs can be highly pumped up, open to self-important brothers for public use; And, of course, they have fulfilled themselves so much that they think that the people really want to enjoy their dual. "The Chapel Chair" has been created "The Whaley Boys" is an excellent composition like a movie! "In the Valley of Dolls," "Outside the Valley of Dolls," "Pink Flamingos," "Texas Chainson Genocide," "Night of Living Dead," "Town Cowboy," "The Blob" - All of these will be "Watching the Puffy Chair" To be a good use of time. Illustrative characters are very likely to be expected or too natural, emotional responses come even closer or too close to trustworthy. Also, at one stage of the film, when the characters should be in the same small town, if someone watches the clock closely, someone sees that one part of the city is apparently in South America and another half is located in Maine. That's some city, ah?
