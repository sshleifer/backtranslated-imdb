I do not know about the rest of the movie, but personally I was tired of the sick and Steven Sigal films. When the law came out, it was a great action film. Wahoo Now Patriot, Steven Sigal plays Steigen Sigal above the law. I get tired of seeing any character change. It's the same character, after time, after the time. She needs change This movie is probably one of the worst action films I have ever seen. Calling an Action Movie, it is giving very much credit because there are very few steps in the scene and they have spread all over the film. I think they wanted to go for some plays, but it was a tricky attempt because the film did not show anything except regular Squinidie-Id-Steven-Sigal. Get a new look and lose the Tony Legacy which I want to say, I definitely do not recommend watching this film in any form, eating, eating, hake, Benesei goes to Vegas, but under no circumstances does the Seagal hire a great performance,
