I think there are people who could not read the book - Revi Review on this page - Unfortunately for those of us who love text, Hollywood has opened itself to this destruction. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where the woman came from love-interest, she replaced the cats, or why our evil man got a strong family back - the vast majority of the universe was cut off and replaced with your whimsical love. Has been there. The story World leaders' approach was completely removed and our rugs were named (it has not appeared even after these two books). <br /> <br /> I only gave 2 instead of 1 because the signs of the wonderful bad konyi Joan Bennett has outdated Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins by miles and this is a small way to save it. <br /> <br /> Oh, Bright probably should have avoided it. Trust me :)
