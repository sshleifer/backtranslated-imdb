Let's get one thing straight; It was BAD! So Putin is not printed on anyone's memory. <br /> <br /> Never repeat stories (who simply do not joke, repeats the story lines and character). Following a common story; Quotes by Mama (mother) how she loves the boy's son, opens the episode but gets a terrible smell (as if not old, rate-day-rate!), Some Australian Kosi-nationalist "Boogan" It seems like how wonderful he is because he always or any other, who does not feel uneasy before disappearing for the unexpected episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The word "failure of the word" is an old one, but this is where the most real thing to say. It's so incredibly bad! So weird, I sent a minimum depth of the North Sea, like every trace of its existence and can go to life. <br /> <br /> This is Sally Brettan (good actress, I like her), Armal and Hannal (aside from my heroes) may be quite fun - but not here - and Ben Elton, is so different for so many good things, anyway Is managed to come along ... then the comedy is a very serious problem!
