There are tremendous production prices that you typically find in a merchant / ivory film, but it can be a very vivid affair, taking a highly neutral. I agree with a previous poster that the story can not be published by the eyes of African American families and their ancestors, Sally Hemings, can rarely play a role in its functions. There is not much transparency in helping audiences understand any motivation of these historical figures. And I was very annoyed by the utterance of many letters. Nancy Merand is a French gentleman who guesses what very British sounded. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seem to have tried different signs of different scenes. In fact, Gaventoth is very badly served in this biophic. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha's role is written in such a way that she really will not have any handle to anyone. At one moment he is slapping a slave, and at the other moment, he is deploring the entire system of slavery. Nick Nolt plays a significant role, but does not really care for Jefferson or any of his exploits. All too frustrating.
