I like the first fault. It really did find me and there was something in it that wanted to double me. Some of these seagulls were missing. There was no creativity, there was nothing new or original, which really did not stick to your mind. This is because people are dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadow and says to the chest. And most of the time, it was not even terrible. <br /> <br /> This plot-based movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblen is a good actress, but she was not given anything to do, and Karen's death seems really dissatisfied because it came very fast. I was disappointed with Kayako's mother, Sublot. I thought that he might give some ways to fight sorrow, but he would die in his hands - hair? - Kayako's. That was such a stupid turn. After all, it's hard to feel for the characters you know. All in the same way. And they can not do anything. It does not seem like a cruel destiny waiting for them. It's just annoying, because you know what's going on. If there is anything to fight with them, they also add suspense to failure. If there was any hope, it scares it will be more reasonable. Now you are just waiting for their death. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw him many times and took a bit of it away. I was still scared in some scenes, but I have actually been using huge eyes and blue faces. Developers probably realized this would happen as they added other scary spells. Yes, I was afraid of psychological philosophy at school - even I knew that I knew as soon as I was going home. A nice touch. Toshio was not so horrible in this movie. I got blue-blue tissue with black eyes and long ago I came out with a blank hole in the first film. A blue boy sitting in the corner is nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some characters seem really unnecessary - the girl's infamous milk scene, which I can not remember. I was not afraid, it's just "Hu?" I am not sure whether schoolgirls were even really needed. Karen could make her angry with the United States. It can kill people involved in his life, funeral, or something else. Yet, all of them should have looked at death, but it seemed really annoying because of getting acquainted with many unrelated people. "I do not call you mom" hated the scene. The problems of Aube's mother were equally soft. The little boy was a sensitive character, though <br /> <br /> The June-on signal was far more dangerous than that. It was some new twists - blurring much of the dream and reality, for example - and even if it left me quite a feeling, I was somehow satisfied. I got a bit thinking and wondered left. This movie only provides cheap scares.
