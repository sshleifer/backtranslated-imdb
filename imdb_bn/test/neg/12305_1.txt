Most of the movies I can sit easily, even if I do not like the movie. I'm such a person who recognizes great movies, even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to see. The hat in hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen many movies. Acting is okay (mothers are just as good as cats, it's just that they are really annoying). The uneasy songs of the cats were even annoying and monotonous to the children of the audience. The plot drags over and, and the audience will have to suffer through poor dialogue. "Wicked" parental comments are frustrating, not funny (I think there are some awful comments in comparison to the garden's hare, well, a person who calls people "yes"). Although the film is really small, it seems to have ended. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hate this movie. If the kids do not tolerate it, I do not know how any adult can. I want to do more about this picture but I do not think it is worthwhile to waste time writing this review. I hate it! So, in summary, do not spend this 90 minutes to see your life! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - I've never given a movie to the minimum reviews.
