Oh Hash, I'm really annoyed with all these generic Japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and spooky kids. "Ghost Train" is no exception. It's definitely "ring", "junk-on", "shutter" and "pulse". Two years ago I was in the story of this modern ghost story, because they usually led me to give some halls, unfortunately there is no fresh or funny thing in the "ghost train". The film is really annoying. With the help of a young train trainer and mother of another "invisible" child in Noriko, an elementary school classmate-missing nana in a subway tunnel will have to investigate the mysteries of multiple disappearances. This film provides a slightly dimmer moments, but the CGI effects are ridiculous and climax is absurd. Leave it out.
