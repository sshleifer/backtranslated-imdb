A silent-minded NY nuclear lawyer (George Segal) is slowly going crazy. He promised his father's death bed that he could never send his army mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. A few years later, he is taking care of a senile, dangerous psychopath. She met a nice nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fell in love. But his mother was afraid of him far. Segal is ready to kill him .... <br /> <br /> Um ... what is this comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but let's have some limitations! This film comes out of the way to throw down his disrespectful mockery and it blurts on your face. Very bad someone joke is fun. Jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senior elderly people, oath and racism. Basically this is a film that tries to make people screw and think they will laugh at it, it's a trick. I was hated and did not smile once. Movie morbid, annoying and (amazing) dull. Cast is the only thing to keep watching me. Segel and Gordon both had their role surprising - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is very good. But the script against them The only interesting thing (not funny) is the view of an uninterrupted court, Rob Rain Jr. (and his next wife, Penny Marshall, trying to spot as an observer). <br/> <br/> Actually this film can be even worse - the original Seagull has gone to bed with her head and pretends her paws! That was (thankful) changed. <br /> <br /> A real lousy, sick film. Bottom barrel. I give it 1.
