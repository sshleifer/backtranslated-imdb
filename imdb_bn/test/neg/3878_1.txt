It was a Hindi movie. Hindi horror =. Because: Cheap conversations, cheap special effects, cheap directions + 2 hours maximum 2 hours high film stretch. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... a bit bit %%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specially for this movie: 1. Dialogue is not funny. They are cheesy, and cheap. Although Akshay tried to play his best, for which I would appreciate him, comedy was not funny at all! I laugh only 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the movie is meaningless in the second half of the story. The second half was the original story / movie. The first half was time to pass / build up. 3. All of the characters are not well developed. Paresh Racha First half smart, second half / rest statue of the movie. We really do not develop any feeling or carelessness, and caring for Govinda. Their letters are somewhat stupid. They do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. Jokes are fun, but they are not very serious fun. Characters of gang and drug traffickers have been used in Chess and last 20 films. There is nothing new about those characters. Again, they are showing stupid for being fun. However, stupid = funny is the ideal throughout the movie. The only character that was sensational was that of Lara Dutta with the real story. 4. Special effects were crap. Finally, people fall from the staircase of the fire. You notice that they are not actually stairs in the air. Secondly, while traveling around the stairs, People started flying. When the PPL is moving, the stairs can not fly ... they fall into the ground directly in the name of gravity. 5. The whole movie is dubbed. All conversations are recorded after the movie. Actor lip rarely syncs with dialogue <br /> <br /> Perhaps there are other reasons why this movie was cottage, but I can not remember them. The senses, even stupid, look at this best composition of crappy Indian movies by yourself and you will agree with my review. Increase your expectations for good quality in PPL, Hindi movies, which prefer Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> I say all Hindi movies are not bad. I like something I did not like this one. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for Akshay and Lara's efforts)
