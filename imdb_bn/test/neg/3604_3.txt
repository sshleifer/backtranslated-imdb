I really like the movie 'The Importer's New Grove', but seeing that it is coming home and seeing your wife "relationship" with Lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like super-troopers club after the drag. I want to write 10 lines, but I do not know what else to say. I laugh a few times, but only because I was drinking. When your drunk is a movie that will be the least fun. It was not. Maybe Lama is not just funny and regular cartoon people. If you want a funny, cartoon, lamma-themed movie, in any way, just stay with Impora New Grove. Line 10 here this line.
