The only reason that this movie is seen was Song Hei Lee, who played Korean rumor actress / actress who played "Muka Laka Miki" (Pause me). <br /> <br /> She has given fairly significant portions in this film and can handle it well, although there is no part of the story really interesting or good. Even for a national Lampoon's movie, it's really stupid. Stupid one thing is ridiculous, but just stupid another. I could have smiled once, and perhaps it was me very humble. <br /> <br /> Warning: Seeing this movie can be two things for your health: 1) It sucks completely. 2) Sung Hye Lee is so impressed that she can only blow your brain from behind your brain in the first sight. <br /> <br /> I did not warn you ...
