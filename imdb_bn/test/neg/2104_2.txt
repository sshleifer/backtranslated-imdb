Oh Well <br /> <br /> I saw the title of this movie in the schedule of TV and thought, "I must watch this movie, remove the snake on a plane, it will be terrible but is ridiculously ridiculous." Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This movie is not very bad and sad, even ridiculous. It's just bad. Even worse, the action takes about one hour to get something similar. For the first half of the film, we must bear some of the fake foreign languages ​​(Mexican or Spanish, apologizing for my ignorance) and terrible acting because some women vomit living snakes because we only find it later. Then we will have to face more horrible acting, and we will find that the scandals in foreign languages ​​can speak English, because the snakes eventually go to the train and things become ridiculous from the mockery. <br /> <br /> The low budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. What we have here is not a movie, horror scripts, bad cast, and even very few ideas about capitalizing the power. I think some decent special effects and two signs for a terrible end but still feel somewhat generous. If you can, refrain from it. See it if you want: Stagknight, Wicker Man Remake, terrible CGI.
