This film is not only for the plot, but also for the character of the character, the director and the lack of creativity from all crew, it is probably one of the worst movies of all time and it is difficult to believe in a series of 90's most famous films. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of The Mask, when I went to see this movie, I was waiting for a movie Humorous fascinating film, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead I had a real bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Everby Cartoons I saw this movie was not funny even for my 7 year old sister, so I was surprised: new law In the movie, what was wrong ??? An attempt was made to repeat the success of the first movie, or did it try to create another great composition like Long of the Rings? Because if they did, they were completely away from their minds.
