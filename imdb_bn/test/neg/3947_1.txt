I tried. God knows I have tried to like this Swiss cheese in a movie, but the story was full of holes, some were enough to drive a horse. The overall performance was even over and the characters are quite respectful that they are sorry you died like recent spread roaches, their own deadly deaths knocked off. Overall, however, it was not really too scary. Later we saw the amazing fast-moving statistics that why "Brude" returned and why it was scary. This image has not only solved basic plot points and has done the author's work. Naturally, you want to highlight the idea that the story can not be understood. Who was the secret room behind the garment, why did he not die like a hungry hunger of blood when he got the nails as they wrote the book earlier? Why did the computer say "end of game" for the character of Frankie? The list goes on and on. I really do not feel comfortable to recommend this movie because it makes you waste your time and does not make enough money in really scary moments.
