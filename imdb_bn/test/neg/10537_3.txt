These, for a variety of reasons, a very very bad action movie. Firstly, the Seagal shape scary out. When he looks older and fat, he needs to fulfill a boring obligation and requires creative editing or plain replication of his battle scene. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. It's not a smart and mediocre debate about Masterbrain and Chester. So what about the action? Well, Alkatraaj firing in each other permanently in jail. They shoot wild and bad, compared to the amount of ammunition needed, rather than bodycount. There is nothing to save this movie. There is a good line and good joke in singles. 49er one and a little emotionally interlude ridiculous with judge McPherson. So what is it? Well, normal bell helicopters, blue lights and slow silhouettes, door doors with bullets, and 1000 watt lights are burning with holes, the characters are blowing in the air during the shootings, arms never loaded, long black coats, dark black people and a thin 25 tonnes of gold containing wooden box To take the very end of pain, the up-off credit is an optimistic approach to light. California beach don Michael Paul wrote and was giving directions. At least this mountain comes from a simple mind.
