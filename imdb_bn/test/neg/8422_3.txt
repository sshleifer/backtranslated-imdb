For the first fifteen minutes, the story of Nakad Fame is interesting: two thirty-year-old male porn star tries to sing and act in an apparently healthy relationship, leaving the pornographic industry. Colon Ford and Black Harper are both very appealing and loving men. With the help of Kevin Aviation and Mark Barclay, Coulton created a dance track that was later sold in New York market with the expectation that the Ford of Ford would become an instant star - a unique disc singer hanging up his background as a porn star for PR. <BR> <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is jealous and fight and commentator by obscene producer Chichi Larru, and gradually the film gets recurrent and distorted. A successful career in a character drive is a bad idea for a film (although young both characters lost both letters lost) was a bit of a move to move into one of the options. It's just that a slim song quickly wears thin. Gary Harp, November 05
