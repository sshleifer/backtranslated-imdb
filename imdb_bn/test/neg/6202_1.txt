If you're planning to show 'Partner' and reading reviews on IMDB, you've lost a lot of time on this stupid, stupid, horror movie. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific, terrible, terrible copy. Cinema 'hits.' I've heard about all the other alerts and bad reviews I've heard about this movie, and a precious 20 minutes was lost on it - I thought it was all after David Dhawan and it's Govinda - how bad could it be? But after 20 minutes of showing this mess, I could not take it anymore, and I stopped my computer. <br /> <br /> Everybody in the movie, fooled the conversation, wasted a total time - I gave it 1-star rating because it is the lowest you can. If I could go less, I would give it a -100 rating.
