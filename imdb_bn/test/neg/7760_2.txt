Yes, I could not get bored, nor could my partner be. Incredibly annoying - for at least 3 hours, 90 minutes began to stretch - and I'm not even a fan of action film, but it just falls asleep on her feet - unless you're a seventeenth-populist sweater fan! <br /> <br /> ** Follow some spirituality ** If you expect something to happen, do not breathe - this is not it! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it fails to convince or involve the viewer. It's like a long, annoying and rather isolated dream. Frederick flows through him, whenever he wants, he can leave work, and interesting secretaries can bring tea and messages constantly. Of course not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or file - only a giant calendar that can tell you that the movie took 6 months to watch. <br /> <br /> Frederick is not touched by any real passion, his wife or children do not behave like angry dolls - in contrast to a real life. Even with his strong perspective, Cloos really does not feel anything. In a couple of 3 seconds of any real feeling, the couple is under the supervision of a couple and they have nothing to do with the plot. Well, maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's entertainment, or even you are looking good movie artist, I think this film is incredibly rated by most other viewers.
