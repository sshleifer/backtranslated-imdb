This is a family movie that was broadcasted at 1.00 pm on my local ITV station. It could be a strange decision by the determinant, but Real Howard Spitz is a weird movie, which is a strange film that does not want to disturb the viewers. Come on, there is nothing more like a child than sorry, and that's why Rold Dahl was so popular for the children. Explain why Doctor W.O. was such a successful exhibition around the world. In this scrapple you're just dying for decoration fiction writers to do something nasty for kids but this does not happen. I'm not talking about child abuse, but Howard Spitz could have made the movie better by watching her lose her anger. You can imagine how kindergarten cops how many producers all the PCs are gone? I mean if you are making a central film about a child writer who hates children and does not tell stories they hate it? <br /> <br /> Most of the problems are with director Jimmy Jinn and you realize this feeling that he does not know the bad news for the movie that will handle the material. Someone previously mentioned that the soundtrack is very wooden in Hafjard and Kells grammar. I think he is trying to run the dead paw like he was famous in the show, but it fails to work here and there are many scenes with silent camera angles that seem to be unknown, which is very confusing, which is very confusing. But the main problem remains at the end of the day that the potential has been destroyed because no one wants to blame the viewer's views.
