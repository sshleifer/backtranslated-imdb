This show, Paramormal State, seems to be a "Blowerwitch project". For example, you are watching a 'documentary' which is actually a scripted movie, it's a documentary to see and feel. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the show is 'Outside' Warren, who became famous for their 'investigation' of the murder of Amitivel, which was shown to be completely deceptive, only on the basis of family death police report! (For example, the elder daughter was actually involved in the whole thing, and perhaps even for some help of death!) Then they continued to blame the devil for everything. They are not proud to mention how proud they are about grouping in that case. They do not want to help those who need it most, they only want in strange ways, which will give them the most pressure and attention. <br /> <br /> They are completely deceptive, easy and simple.
