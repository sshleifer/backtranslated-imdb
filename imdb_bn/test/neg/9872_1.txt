Of course, when I had the chance to see this terrible infamous legend of the movie, my expectations were quite low. They were not low enough. Scholastic Roger gradually acquired ownership of Marvel Comic Book Characters in the mid-80's or early 90's, and handed over to Oly Sason, whose director's work was mostly in the Camp Television series like Hercules. 'Snake' It was made with a total budget of $ 1.5 million, shots and short videos were released, and then the forgotten movie was sent to the affected region. Should have been there. However, like a banana hole in a Vaudville Act, these "fantastic four" ethers are waiting for a rare person in Ether, waiting for the prayer, which is unexpected and enough for the fools. <br /> <br /> If you've heard of this comic book character you know what to expect. The people who created this were very true for the source material, and this is the only thing that they deserve a credit in this quarrel. It represents the source of spaceships, which develop supernatural powers when their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reid Richards (Alex Hyde-White) creates the ability to stretch his body and Mr. Fantastic '. His girlfriend, Su Storm (Rebecca Stub) may disappear, and her brother, Johnny (J. Underwood) spontaneously spread the fire from her body. Finally, Ben Grim ("credit" to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Sipherlio) gets supernatural power when his skin suddenly turns to hide and then known as Thing. Reid's former classmate Victor von Duomo (Joseph Kulp) has been offered a suggestion to be his enemy, who has hit Doctor Doom, who hit the catastrophic surgery of the Fantastic Four Space flight, as a revenge for the injury. Set up, then discover the power, villain's revelation and ultimately a climactic war. There are more detailed descriptions of poorly written scripts, but they are insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is a film that God created (I use it in the technical sense of the word.) Here is the full creative imagination to work.) It had such legal right. The plot will be mirrored in a relatively big budget release set by Team Story in 2005, but it will be regarded as a fictitious film to deal with the huge influential projects, in comparison to the comparatively budgeted or competent actors. Most of the original days of 'The Great Train Robbery' are hand-picked or easy to carry camera tricks existing special effects. When half the climatic war turns into a full-fledged animation, you are often released to show cartoons instead of the poor actors, who were enemies in the project. As well as this mess has very little adjusting style. Most scenes are available in flat or wild primary colors, and only the furnished set is a clear science-fee piece. There are cameras, but it mostly keeps the minimum information flowing to centralized characters and the audience on the screen. Editing is included in extra lines and using explicit wipes (at one point there is also a transition using a number 4 center). While transforming things, spin editing is also used to supplement poor special effects. A view that used morphing technology was a disappointment for it only because it was positive as a positive jump. <br /> <br /> The limited camera work is not disabled. In 'Clark', only the most basic camera movement is used and there is almost no style. It worked for that movie because it was about a person who had no style of life and it was consistent. Kevin Smith does not exceed his perception of his reach 'The Blair Witch Project' puts some pseudo-documentary in the audience together and enjoys motion sickness from the stuff held by shocking hands. When all was spoken and done, it was a work of terrorism that was lost and hungry by terrible conditions. There is no idea of ​​spoken or visible level stories or themes. With this 'Fantastic Four', you never get a sudden humor about the filmmakers and actors who are actually trying to compete with other comic book movies with this least budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of time and work involved in a movie. It is so sad that so much of a project was inserted into it. If you are one of those people who were involved in this, it was probably acted as a stepping stone in a (hopefully advanced) film career. Everyone seems to know about taking a job to make the most of an opportunity. Those who are interested in watching this movie should advise only with a group of friends (so you can say to everyone and "you have seen it too") who have predicted about the experience (so nobody gets hurt) from shock), and perhaps you have a drink Come along with the game can ease the pain in the smiley. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 1
