And the title says it all: A chessy sounding title, which is known as the "Alien to LA", Chess Gloss. Why not just call it "Alien from South Africa", this place where this movie was portrayed? "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" My suggestion to watch featured movies do not see the original version of the movie! Duration! Always see the movie with the theater shadow under the screen, with two fun, wise-cracking robots sitting in the corner in the bottom right corner of the screen, with the person trapped in the place with friends. It seems that way well. <br /> <br /> Originally seen in the movie: Awful! The movie saw MST 3: Genius!
