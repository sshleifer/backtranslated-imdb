An unspeakable horror film that was released from Tromba (which was my favorite movie company), which could be interesting but very dark and rolled. <br /> <br /> In a car, the family is reluctant to start, they are killed in a crash, a girl is dead and a mother is distorted. Dad finally goes crazy and prostitute prostitute. She sees her daughter among other people. He killed for her. Meanwhile her now distorted wife is being raped by her order. This sick man! <br /> <br /> Trying to be sick and boring with vague and it does not manage to do it as a good horror flick. Most trombay films give humor to them but this is not the same.
