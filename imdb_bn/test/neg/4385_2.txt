I love the movie in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity So why did not I like this movie? Any movie plot like this should add even the slightest confusion. Who, where is the money, it does not SE7EN, just smile to me Maybe it is me, but I did not feel depressed by watching movies in American Pie films or any other modern National Lampoon. There is no stream in this movie that keeps me smiling, waiting for the next. Instead, I saw myself stop, "Why did they keep that scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you are expecting Van Wilder, think again. The only fun to watch this movie was when the kids were in the movies that the actors were in. 2/10 Liberally.
