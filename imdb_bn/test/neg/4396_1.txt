It should always be one of the biggest folks ... The script was beautiful and could have ended much better. Actors should have played well and probably I would have given this film a better grade. Maybe Hollywood should rebuild this movie with some good actors and good managers. Friends for frustration, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I want to meet again, it will be like torture. I do not want to ruin everyone's opinion with me. So my suggestion is watching the movie first. If you like it and after the vote (do not get a vote before watching it) and by the way ... it's fun watching! Just do not peek ... see it in the end '))))))))))) !!
