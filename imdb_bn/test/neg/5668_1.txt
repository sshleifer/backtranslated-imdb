First off, I just want to say that this show can work well, now it is better than doing it. What brought it down was certainly played. Maranda Kosgrow, who works as the main character Carlyle, was seen by Drake and Josh at the cost of his own show. Unfortunately, let's give a bigger iCarly. Miranda does not have enough work to do, but when she leaves, she is incredibly tough when she goes away. He does not believe how the character "karley" will move or stand. When he threw a hat up on the first episode of the end, his hand never goes to his side from his elbows. Even when he was dancing, he saw the stick in the air. And singing? The thread song was fantastic, because there was Drack, the song was pretty good and Miranda's voice was fake. I must admit, plot and settings are good, unreal, but Hey, it's Nick. They are known for practically stupid lines and characters. But wow, the worst among them is iCarly.
