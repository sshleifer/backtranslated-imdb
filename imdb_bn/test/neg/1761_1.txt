The Jude Law allows Kaneyu Reeves to act as the most wooded actor in his favor, the role of Renegesh Wiser, directly outside the Beverly Hillbills and chemistry of chemistry, often like the DAR WORDAR and the Queen Amedala. The worst kind of "bad guys" cliche and movies have a delicate moment. Incredible that some critics really liked this movie.
