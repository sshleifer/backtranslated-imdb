I believe that the quotation quoted above (in particular, the English subtitle translation), which was not actually written, sends a disclaimer in a rejection letter to the play, it is a self-referential greeting in a tongue. But if so, director Leon Karux is apparently in pretext He informed the actors of the film's genre. They are so deeply honest in their illustrations that I must make a decision that the curse has really taken it here seriously, or is so disrespectful to others, especially to the audience that no one can bother to curse anyone. </ br> <br /> Some operators have been able to create strange, bizarre movies because they do it with Alan and the unique personal style (for example, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorosky).

But Carax tries something new here; The film is a pastiche of the elements taken from countless previous films and after watching the film for decades and literally thousands of films, I am not patient for such an illogical, poorly designed rebuke. At this very first time in the 21st century, one went to ask: "There is no director of France without the exception of Jean-Pierre Zunate who can now create a visual movie?" Ratings: 3/10
