If you want to see the worst film ever made, see more. Some ugly movies are watchable because they are strange fun. Well, there is no intelligence in American movies, there is no strange humor, just the director seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this photo, I see you Kevin Smith's "Clark", similarly Tone. In Clarks you will get creativity, intelligence, and enjoyment - all in a shoe budget. You have to forget this terrible effort.
