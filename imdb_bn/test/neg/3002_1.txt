Telling such a friendly story always uses the same technique: 1) Throwing undeclared, undefined thread around the audience confusing. 2) Deals only in life, death, and God as 'big' topics. 3) Show deeply with the view of life, death, sky etc. 4) Depending on the intelligent weak audience, give you the benefit of suspicion. 5) And finally, ridicule the critics for all the ways. <br /> <br /> This film is his brave fool intellectual. These filmmakers simply do not answer any questions, they are afraid to encourage questions to start. The photos are held together by wisps. Directions are raised and awkwardly dropped. Pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The critics found in the intellectual foundations of this movie are afraid to accept the truth: they have no idea about their notion of the idea. Good news: Not film makers. Conscientious efforts of intellect, intelligence, poetry, and talent demands in response to deep questions about human existence. Unfortunately, this movie does not show any of these features.
