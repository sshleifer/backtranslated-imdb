Terrible There is no way to get around it. A one-level script from some Mexican soap operas, it is a choice and shooting location that produces film laboratories and simultaneously, with repetitive and neutral, almost complete cast disastrous performance. Tarantino's job descriptions have been created so badly, insulting from anything else. I do not doubt the liberals of Matadinho's liberal drafts for the sake of exploitation and plot-related, do not try to see anyone in this movie's theater. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie that made me want to see a Portuguese movie.
