Yes, long ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of Well, like an airport mixed with a junior high school, many orange ornaments are going to wear Juppi, so I think it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, the character of Steven Seagull is admitted in prison, he jumps into the line and goes to another line so that he can talk to his friend, as he has for security checks at the airport. Long ago, he and his friend were punching, some security guards were pushing around. <br /> <br /> I tell you something. If you attack a criminal amendment officer in federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule was shot 30 times before throwing his second punch. Oh, and there are beanies and guys wearing bandanas and whatnot. In jail In federal prison <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jay Rul himself had 50 cents. Before this movie I have seen that in these shows on TV, the greatest celebrity event ever happened, and the competition was between 50 or 50 cents of 7 or 8, who had lived a life of real treachery and the H-rule Who was not Every time I saw the Rule on the screen, I saw the picture, 50 cents closed its ass. Ja Rule looks like every time a 9-year-old screen appears. <br /> <br /> However, back to the plot back. It's funny Sasha is an FBI agent working secretly and she agrees to imprison herself so she can go behind the criminal organization. He punished five years, and that old line in firmness and stupidity disappears immediately. After that, there is nothing else in the movie, it becomes meaningless string of action sequences, most of which are not dancers. <br /> <br /> Oh, how about this, helicopter accidents occur on the roof "New Altraz" at one stage, accidentally freed all prisoners. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of cell blocks. A lot as a basket. They had a ball, but it does not matter. The scene is so stupid that they might be playing hopscot. <br /> <br /> Some people are being punished for being executed as the first person to execute the execution in the art production chamber of Alcrajas, apparently not to steal $ 200 million of gold, but to tell where the cover was hidden after <br /> <br /> <br /> Hey, good thoughts, people. If you can not get information from someone, then kill them. This is a great way to learn the truth! So some gangs are jailed for the death penalty and get $ 200 million for themselves. <br /> <br /> There are oh and $ 200 million in gold bricks. I suspected how difficult it would be to convert them into changed currencies. <br /> <br /> There are also cases of warden in prison. He has some difficult words, who think he is a hardcore broiler, which reminds me of a joke. I once talked to this comedian about the people of California who called each other ese and at home and all the other kind of stupidity. These people go to Mexico, the comedians say, and they say, "O my God, people live there?", As it is fair shake! <br /> <br /> The Supreme Court of the United States came to the Supreme Court and this guy tells him that his man can not carry guns inside his gun, "I am not concerned about whether he is the Supreme Court of the United States! <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> Like a wine and he thinks he is charging. <br /> <br /> However, the Supreme Court Justice is taken as hostage in this film. That's what he told the 53-year-old man, a year younger than Steven Siegel, I thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good view of the movie is going to jail around Rail prison, like the shoulder ball of this small Asian film. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I have worked to create this image (which I have seen), and I have no single positive thing to say about it, except that Raul The Russian woman is shining with that Asian woman. <br /> <br /> Read my review of Malen and you'll never see strongly disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but Ebert wrote in his review of this film I agree with what I wrote: <br /> <br /> "I imagine Flywells do a day's best work at MPA Postal order congratulating each other, "Half Past Dead" PG-13, anti-gun film "Bowling kalambinera 'to provide an R after" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, guys.
