Well what can I say What is F ** There really is not much to say about this, really. You can choose this if you want, if you like me, you can laugh like bad badness. <br /> <br /> Activating - very unauthorized! Just watch the last scene with the main actress running! Rip off of Texas Chipsaw Massas! But in a bad way! Just awesome! <br /> <br /> Gore - not really trustworthy. In one scene, they use knives that have a trim cut that fits their body parts. Using its red ketchup, its real 2 appearance is real, but it is not really. <<br /> <br /> Plot - The movie was closed on 13th Friday from the expected 'Kids lost in the jungle on Camping Weekend'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone incredible will choose this as their costume. The director clearly realized that all the good clothes were used in other horror-film movies. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Camp Blad 2, which makes this look like a colored lord.
