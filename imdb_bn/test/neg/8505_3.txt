I enjoy gay-themed movies where characters are stereotypical homosexuals and this has attracted me to this movie, this and the main actor, this is the only reason I claim this movie as more stars, tell me more about her performance in more movies). Many people have complained about cinematography, but the feeling of the film's camcoder adds a certain "underground" quality to me and usually has some scenes near sunset or sunrise and any movie screen will flush between trains <br /> <br /> Cardboard, the song is repetitive (I hear soundtrack from any other film Through the middle of the half-received), you will have to wait for a conversation about twenty minutes, and then it's weird and amateurs. Graffiti could make the movie look great if it was impressively absorbed and the industry itself was even more stimulating, but it was not. <br /> <br /> The worst is no measurement; There really was not a plot to start. The film simply goes back to the silence shell and dies. A forgotten movie.
