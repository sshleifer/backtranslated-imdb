Every time I look at Larry King Live, he raises the most sophisticated questions for his guest. He does not ask the difficult questions because he rarely receives useful information. It came from the beginning on the radio. <br /> <br /> The King himself established himself on the radio and essentially did not change a bit of television except for his bit title for television. He becomes a dog for his guests and only when they get useful information from them, whether they are volunteer or a caller at the show actually asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is beautiful, parents interview type. This means that if you consider CNN, it should not be a prime-time show in one of the major news networks. I'm not due to CNN's history. <br /> <br /> The new network of caping (i.e. cable) started by Tad Turner as an alternative to network news that it could broadcast news for 24 hours. When it first started, only TV competitions were from NBC, ABC and CBS. For this reason, CNN copies the format of their competition and achieves a respectable rating. <br /> <br /> It did great work for CNN until they achieved competitive networks which provided innovative and better / new news. In response to the competition's heat, CNN denied and banned its competitors who were eating their lunch and ratings because CNN wanted to prevent changes. It did not work very long and its ratings started reducing. <br /> <br /> Now Copying News Network, by copying the leading news network format itself, is discovering itself and trying to cast it back. Unfortunately, this show represents a big piece of problems. It's 21 years old and it looks very bad. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, King needs to be removed from prime time or completely scraped.
