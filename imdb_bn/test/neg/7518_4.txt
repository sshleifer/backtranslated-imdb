The time machine began in New York in 1899, where Professor Alexander Hertzen (Guy Pierce) proposed to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Siena Gilroy), unfortunately, after being attacked by a mug, unfortunately, and Emma died and died in the arms of Alexander. 'After four years' and Alexander made a machine that he used to travel at night, to save him in the night, but he still died, this time is only different. Alexander realizes what he does, although he will go back a number of times, Emma will always end one way or the other of death and she asked why she invented the truth for travel in the far future. However, after the destruction of the moon, two new nations have developed on earth, people like Eli and maternal mortals who came to eat. Alexander stayed around and decided to save Eloi. <br /> <br /> The original grandson of author HG Wells, who is directed by Simon Wells, who wrote the original Time Machine book, was based on the original Time Machine (1960) film, and it was originally a 1960 film producer John Logan's script, Here's more than the original literal source. Although these three shared the same basic stories and ideas, subtitle was added to the death of Alexander's maternal Emma, ​​and for this reason, he invented a time machine instead of becoming skilled. This script is a mix of Saif-Fi, Action Adventure, and Plays that really did not hold me or appointed me so much, sure that there are some special effects, some nice work scenes and at the moment when Alexander's question is answered why he can not live. Actually quite intelligent and understand that it has never captured my imagination and I have always been I could not. The time travel time of the time machine is similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) In this sense you will not be able to change the past, but at the same time the time machine is not set in the near terminator. 2: A good movie as Judgment Day. The character is okay but I think Guy Pierce is very young, an intelligent scientist who has been able to discover the time machine and there is no real explanation behind its instrument, like a moment and no time machine, later it was discovered and made Has done a & it works perfectly I offer a lot more exciting, laughing, excitement and general entertainment value than the Back to the Future Trilogy of the Time Machine, and when it is going on a bad speed, I will stop saying bad movies, then tell the logical story and its moments. It is not good to call it bright or even special. Here there is a shiny small reference to books and original movies, which are both name-tested here. <br /> <br /> This modern version basically has special effects on the benefits, especially CGI which leads to the rapidly roamed scenes, new ranges, canyons and hills surrounding Alexander, and a wide range of pan backed into space That's where we see the rocket surrounded by the moon. The effect is good, one or two moments that look a little lower, but generally the effects seem good. I saw the time machine on the telephone and the station was panning very poorly and scanned so that the left and right edges of the frame are closed on screen, thus the time of the end of the year in Alexander's Time Machine was cut, so I did not really know. What did he go year? Apparently, director Gore Verbinski was suffering from Wales' extreme fatigue for the last eighteen days of filming and IMDB said that during this time the device was the biggest and expensive phenomenon created for a movie at any time. Believe & Guy Pierce breaks a rib during a fight scene but like to carry an armistice. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of $ 80,000,000, the production values ​​are high with a lively redesigned time, though the good effects are amazing time machines were nominated for the best makeup for the Oscars, but lost from Freida (2002). Acting mixes, Jarmy Irons has a great make-up job performance, which makes her look like a rejection from Lord of the Rings film, when the singer feudal Mumbai makes her big screen debut, and it's terrible even though ghay peers <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> Features feature feature (1985) again instead.
