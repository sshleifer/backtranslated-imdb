What I can say about "Quintet" is not too bad to remember it at my first sight. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that it is good. <br /> <br /> This strange, sci-fi thriller I've seen any movie that I've seen mostly, which I guess is that it gives at least a novelty stamp. But it's a film's disaster disaster, and sometimes Robert Altman is one of the worst. In the DVD special feature about "Quintet", it is clear that Ottoman did not even know what the movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This is set in some distant future in the world. In another ice age firm. This image was shot on the abandoned site of Montreal Expos 67, and I must admit that it provides some interesting production design elements to the movie, even many of them seem to be portrayed in an iPod-wide shopping mall. Paul Newman, Jonked Out and looking around for what is going around and looking for this in the future of Newyam's brother, in the future, in the city of Drayepher. Soon, Newman was caught in the deadly game of "Quintettes", which all the indifferent residents play for a good lack of it, and its rules do not make clear to the audience. What we know is that the object of the game is to play it to kill someone else and you will be the only living person. It gives them the only thrill of this innocent residents, because one of them says at one point in Cyclobescillic Silicon, that one can live because of being close to death only. <br /> <br /> The clock is really uncomfortable because the movie is slow, ugly and its helpless sadness. It's almost as Altman has deliberately set out to create a movie, someone would like to sit in one. No Characters - Oh sure, the actor walks around the speaking line, but none of the lines is really high and international actor Altman does not have an impressive list for this article. Only Bibi Anderson gives the earliest thing of a memorable performance such as perhaps a movie like this can be found. But in spite of this, it succeeds in establishing an atmosphere, even if the atmosphere is one of the purest horror, and it is an impressive fascinating subject that one man slowly sees as hunger for death, but it will be interesting. <br /> <br /> After almost a decade of extraordinary film, Almatman hit the dry spell. The "quintettes" followed abruptly followed by the heels of the "weeding" of the oppressor and followed the short order by the bad, but most forgotten "a perfect couple", all accounts were terrible "health" (which I have never seen that it is not available anywhere) And crushing "Popeye."
