I'm proud of being able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the rent, then I'm going to see it at least". I found an exception to these rules - the planets. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but by reading other comments I can assume that Â£ 8000 will be around $ 150. I'll date myself but this movie reminds me of 50 years old Steve Reeves. He was a bodybuilder actor. He was in this really terrible Italian, Dobbed movie, which was played by Revez as Hercules or another muscle-bound hero. Seeing them as a child can not quite explain why you stunk this movie - you just knew they were. Mike Mitchell new Steve Reeves It was ... it really was - a new story from an old Italian "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals" movie. And, I'm not going to baby you - where was Reve's birth? Glasgow, Montana This movie is not so bad that it's fun to watch - it's just plain bad.
