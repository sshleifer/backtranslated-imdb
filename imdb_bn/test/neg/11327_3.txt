It's annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where is that? It is like the Til Street without Army and Birt or Grover's funny characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe acting, maybe editing, maybe cinematography, perhaps special effects, maybe makeup. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most likely all of the above bring you something that can focus your eyes on. <br /> <br /> I want to be scared ... not disturbed. <br /> <br /> It did not frighten me ... it was not my interest ... I found more fun instead of seeing this movie on a microwave time. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered to buy it and if you see it on television through some amazing opportunities, kids do not have to sleep.
