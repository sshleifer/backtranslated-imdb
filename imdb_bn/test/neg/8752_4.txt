I like this movie. Although I rated it as "4", because before the release of the film, acting, plot and budget "B" moved away from the universe. But okay! It has a lot of entertainment movie offers! <br /> <br /> I remember Leonard Moultin about "Plan 9 Out of Space": A movie is so bad that it's great! UFO Neglect - Based on Alien Plot, The Thing of the Dye My Arporteric (Divine, a Head Search for Its Body, Hypnosis, etc.), tell its story. Acting, the camera's second-class jobs and settings limited, but the boy! What a movie! This film is available in the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
