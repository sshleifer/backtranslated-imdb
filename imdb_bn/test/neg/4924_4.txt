This movie has creativity and atmosphere, but unfortunately I have seen the print. Raymond Masey returns to a rock, returning Sherlock Holmes, about the sunny early scenes, about which he is dressed for a worker. Do business for the investigation of the rugged (Lin Harding) unclear palace. It was not clear to me why the relatant wanted more than the death of her saints. In the case of Helen (Angela Baddley), she does not want to stop marrying, she will be done the same thing by sending her. <br /> <br /> Other curiosity as well as plenty. After setting an early wedding date with Helen, the picture could not be heard for the rest of the story. At the time of Violet Stoner's death, there is only one isolation in the presence of a band of Gypsies and it is an interesting tool, a poisonous snake, it is not a Cobra, it is mild by its musical rendering. <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two films - "Selection of Sherlock Holmes" of 1935 and "Murdere a Visavishvil" of 1937 will be used as well. <br /> With repeat nipples and a troubled camera, it's surprising that the story line does not interfere more than it. It is maintained, even if the integrity extends a bit to maintain, usually. I think the film will be my main complaint, because of some jumping jumping into the picture mentally, the real pain in ACP has been seen.
