I can not believe that this is a movie I do not like. . . I usually think I'm open about all kinds of stuff. . . But this flick is fine, good, bad. <br /> <br /> I can deal with the issue if the script and the story are good. If the camera work is good or if the letter is well established then I could deal with the performance. . . I think it flies mostly from the script and direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I do not believe, at least this guy has closed his tail for making a movie. . . So he gets four stars (this is the average rating which just has this up)
