The worst thing I've ever witnessed is terrible acting with special f / x. It was bad that I had destroyed $ 3 for breaking this shit, but I lost my one and a half hour that I could do anything other than volunteering for getting a bread canal or jury duty. The drunken video can not help too. <br /> <br /> To keep it shameless, I sincerely believe that I actually lost some IQ points during this idiotic piece of psychological "work"! Perhaps I should follow my own advice at this time. If a movie is written, directed and produced by the same person and never hopes for Jeff feai, then never expect it.
