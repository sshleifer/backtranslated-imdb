This movie is not like the City of God, you can get the same feeling, but this is not an intense shooting or intense drug scene, you get this idea. If you ask me, I think this film was wasted time, there are many other films that are 100 times better than "wooden cameras" and teaching. Yes I can be the only one to give a negative comment for this movie, but it is only in my opinion. This is a movie where I can feel that I will fly but when the credits begin to take the role of my friends and I see all the mutual, then we all laughed, how ridiculous the movie was. So to finish this topic, I do not recommend watching it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - Talking to Africans was a big mistake in speaking English. They use their native language in the city of God that gives the movie more power and reality.
