This is a strange one to say the least of course in the movie. The original plot is 3 old business associates, invite 10 strangers to their home for returning 10 unknown visitors. Two of those who are seen in love. 3 elderly businessmen died and came back as ghosts to help two small guests. All right, so it can be understood but we have three old boys who have some bread together. It's strange weird ... Harry is playing his part from Kerry Base, if you're a nice guy or a really erect. I really mean, up my mind I can manage it. Then Richard Carlson plays James Houston from Texas ... Hmmm, he looks like a Southern gentleman from Kentucky, as compared to a Texas man. This one is not even close. Then we accept the 3 demons who will maintain a better chance to help finish the game rather than helping New Orleans Saints ... They are not really a helper, and why they even have no chance of knowledge in movies. Foolish movies where the characters A cast works out of full character. You can avoid it ..
