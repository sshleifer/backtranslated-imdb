After receiving a DVD with Sunday's newspaper, I hope that it is never a dropped duff film because no one will buy it. I was roasted. The fox is similar to that played in a school pantomime ten-year-old and is the same for the same cast. Neill is not satisfactory, but playing in a Russian and his hybrid is not helped by Northern Irish / New Zealand accent, and the rest of the KGB character, they all sound like Cambridge footlight reconciliation. Indeed, the only person of true pronunciation provides additional words for additional and additional words, and at least helps to know what is happening in at least one chaos. The "spy" factor is most unlikely and primarily involved in the ridiculous disguise with Chain Foundation, when trying to mix in the background, it is not only quickly becoming annoying but ridiculous. The plot is killed by the rest of the potential but completely confusing production elements. This could be so good.
