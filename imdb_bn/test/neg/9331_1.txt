Tyrone's power is to throw lead as Solomon. However, part of the way through the film he died unexpectedly. The studio has chosen to lead Yule Brenner and to shoot again the scenes of power. In the dark, considering how horrible this film was, the power was lucky - because it was a terrible way to finish her lovely film career !!! <br /> <br /> I have found that in all the epics of the Bible, this is the worst - and it's saying a lot because Hollywood has produced many biblical stories - so many people think that if it's created then the film is an atheist conspiracy! Actually, the film was so neutral that it was included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Fifty Worth of All Time". There are many reasons to hate movies, but the worst thing was the whole thing! Of course, the missions for Egyptians and Israelis were very bad with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English people - but at least this made the picture a bit ridiculous. Bosomina Gina Lolobrigrida, who played the role of a woman from nearby places in Ethiopia, was very terrible, but at least she was not beautiful, but she was beautiful. George Sanders of Overweight and Post-Middle Ages were very bad playing a young role, but at least he had a fantastic voice. Dancer and rebel were very bad to create an orgy scene, but at least you saw a person mentioning a person as a "oryl or courier" at the credit! No, the bad thing in this movie is about half an hour, it looks like nine or so weak and stupid! The only mention of this queen of Shabba and Sulaiman is mentioned in the Old Testament only in a few measurable verses, it is surprising that the film continues only and continues. The greatest story of all time was a bit more, but that film was based on four gospels - not a dozen or so verses! <br /> <br /> The following line is that the film is completely distorted (excluding Gina's clauses). Even for believing Christians and Jews, this is a definitely avoidable film because it fast and loose with the truth and enters amazing amounts of sex in biblical cinema! Dreadful in almost all means, it is not really a blessing for the power of Tyrone that this bloated turkey does not think of him for acting.
