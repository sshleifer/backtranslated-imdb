Sincerely, this film was the only reason for the blockbuster takeover because its carter was there. OK is the first thing to do first. Have you become a dirty Haroon Carter? I mean, he was so beautiful, but now ... with the lenky body and blotchi skin - EW. I think he should remain with singing and the director of the movie could not sync a lip, which found many good looking people. Although no crime. I was mainly at the head of this teen movie - and this coming from me, being a teenager myself. There are 'middle girls' oh-so expected, acting is so amateur, it crunched you occasionally (especially from Aaron) and overall I did not enjoy it. However, I give points for the storyline - that was right, but not realistic. However, stay away from this city until you get cash and it is not good to do anything with your 94 minutes of time. It is not worth $ 6.50! <br /> <br /> (PS; my review does not apply to children under 13!)
