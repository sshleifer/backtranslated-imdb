A route canal without anesthesia is more fun. This movie is boring and unmatched. There is absolutely nothing credible about this character or plot line. When they agreed to agree on this movie, what was God's name? Acting in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty good. "In law" is a fun movie. "The Birdcage" is a funny movie. "Big Lebowski" is a funny movie. This movie is just stupid. I can not begin to understand the sick mind that I want to write "novel" based on this movie. I can not honestly think of a good thing to say about this movie. It just does not make any sense. Please people - I request you - do not see this movie. You will be sorry for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely at the top of the list.
