I started watching it because I was looking for a nice 'background comedy' for this Sunday morning. Then I noticed that it was going to be a road-movie and I decided to actually see it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were awful, but I wanted to give it a chance, because I would not judge a movie without watching it throughly. Then things start to get a little better. It seemed like a nice road-movie about friendship. But then the movie started to get terrible predictive clich√©-twists and when the movie was over, it seems like you've lost your time. Is there anything to say about this? Why did they make such a movie? And I was not expecting a modern citizen, but still, I have a number of ideas about how to improve this film. <br /> <br /> Take part in my advice; Leave this alone and go to see a real road-movie. There are many who have. I do not think the director of this photo is named by this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
