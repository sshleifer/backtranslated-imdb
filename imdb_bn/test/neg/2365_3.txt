"TNT Jackson" is not completely unwanted. However, the version I saw in the DVD was edited with a weed-wacker, or the minimum level of greenhouse / blackspanation sausage on the screenplay itself. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Zen Bell is believed to have been a player at one stage of his career and the movie makes the maximum connection by showing his breasts at least two times more than necessary. (I'm pretty sure that a sunny stpless war scene meant to be funny). I will admit, they are quite beautiful. Yet, he is looking average and a Cleopatra Jones has even a Foxi Brown's charisma. He is at the moment as a film actress, but if the director could make him a little harder or the pornpleld gives him "attitude" and gives him more than just people, but it was good. <<br /> <br /> The fight scenes of kicking people (another reason to watch such a movie) is done very badly. There is no real dance-drama to speak here, only people are getting and standing on their feet, the general aspect of their opponents. A nice exception with an exceptionally decorated butterfly fold knife; The other is a sequence near the very end where the bell (and possibly Stan Shore) apparently doubles a stunt and Bell / "Jackson" creates some decent swipe and foundation for a minute or two before turning off his enemy's liver, Shot shot breaks and the screenplay just stops. (Again, I will admit that it is much more than the traditional time of Shaw Brother Kuiyi). <br /> <br /> There are actually few actors in the movie (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the right hand man of the narcotics in the brain). After completing the action on the screen and adding a rating to a star, half the beautiful Fan√ßa laden soundtracks. There is a semi-DD sex scene that often manages to operate itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for BlackSuffle's hardcore fans. I have seen it from uninterrupted curiosity, and I'm sorry, I took the time. But if I do not want to write an empirical article in the disguise of pop culture of "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxi Brown", then I do not want to take a look at it again.
