Before listening to Patton Oswalt's "Werewruvos and Lollipops" CD, I heard this movie first. She said it is a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a terrible movie lover, I knew I was in for a treatment. <br /> <br /> This film, hands down, is the weird one I've ever seen. Of course, one of the odd verse films. Basically, a giant took man's form for a woman, the woman's death or something, cried the giant blood, fell on the bed on the bed, the bed was now possessed and now she eats it. Besides fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can range in horny teenagers, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. There is also a sick person on the bed, but he keeps his soul behind the photo in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies let you find the plot through exciting steps. Death bed takes another route: it basically tells you what is happening during the slow event of slow progress. Also, I would say everyone at the bed wondered calmly quietly. I think if a bed is eaten through the 5th grade science fair examination method, it will be a little sting. I think the end of the nerve until 1981 was not discovered. <br /> <br /> The story is frustrating, the direction is slow and pretty awful, Spirits in the set, it's pretty painful and brother's one I've ever seen unintentionally ugliest actors If involved in alcohol and smart ass probably will make a great party film. Of course you do not miss
