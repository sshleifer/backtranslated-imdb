I like most of the conversations, I love Cast, I thought it played well. I especially enjoyed DeGeneres' perfect DeadPen performance. What did not work for me: (1) Relationships related to young people (very long, probably outside Helen's character), (2) Apparently endless cinematic clashes, mostly visual but on the re-reading of the love letter. With intimate voice (with its contents should have a mystery); (3) A young feminist scholar and, surprisingly, a pyrotechnic scene (a strange thing that reminds me of making an American silver film); (4) The left-wing "coward" police that smell everywhere "(there is no match!); And (5) setting an annoying romantic small town. I encourage Helen's comet's source (or even glory) to include the film's character more and more, eliminating or reducing inter-artificial artifacts, and being somewhat unusual about life in a small town. <br /> <br /> If this is developed as the first drama, these criticisms may be resolved before editing the material. Unfortunately, this film, which is merely intermediary.
