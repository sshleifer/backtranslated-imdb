It was much more than a love story than an angel descending to this world, although both corners of that story were given a good part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I take this movie into the heart, anyone who believes in the Bible and believes, I could fast cannab quickly, but I do not think the common atmosphere was significant or condemnated. It was just ridiculous or just plain fool. <br /> <br /> Meaning, as John Angel Truvalta as an angel? Smoking? Push her trembling Beatles quote? A "warring angel" knows nothing about heaven? An angel who flirts with all the women? Yes, it is all unreasonable and certainly wrong in the Bible. <br /> <br /> I could bear all that but I do not know how many people, they believe, who can stand up to this annoying movie which becomes the second half of it. The romance started between William Hart and Andy McDowell began to drag it. Some conversations during that romance are so stupid that they insult any discriminatory viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another Nora Afron-directed movie. Man, I can not believe how incredibly stupid movies this woman has been written or directed. At least he is consistent.
