In most cases, I thought the film was ineligible to comment, but the last 10 minutes inspired me to write. As you see, we learn (SPOILERS ... if they can say) that there is no scope for Satan's messenger to properly prepare the world's authority by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! "Prosons" has been lying in a hole for several centuries, waiting for the release of "man's greed", 54 year old former caret champion Chuck Norris will be defeated in only one match! Imagine what would happen if he took Jackie Chan? (* 1/2)
