There is no fun of painful suffering of illegal immigrants! Or the headache of the owners disappointing situation! Rich and noble people compared to Brian Glazer, "heroes" do not really act like villains - do not rob the honest, hardworking people of their life savings - I do not wonder! Hell, how do you feel to be richer than God? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> McMansions, McToys, and McChildren are given peanuts to take care of! But the main problem (apart from rebel insurrection) is evidenced: As a former executive of a notorious company, Dick Big Scale will be for every corporate head of the country! No soup kitchen for him! And, when you are involved in six statistics, you think that he will not be dead near a Gore / Laberman poster!
