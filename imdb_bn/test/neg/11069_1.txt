I recently saw a string of caging films and this movie has been able to combine the worst aspects of this type of movie. You get very little gratitude for the giant that surrounds him or face the cave, although the letters are clipped (spiritual man, the leader with the tragedy in the recent past) and the last was only weak. It really bothers me that the director creates the atmosphere by shaking the camera or showing almost the whole dark. I read that this movie has given a true presentation of caving and yes, I imagine the caves are dark Approaching total blackness for nearly half the film really brought that home. I enjoyed the "progenitor", which performed well for my money, more hard working conditions, good monsters and good end. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** < <br/> <br /> দৈত্যটি এমন একজন লোক হতে পারে যার বিমানটি বিধ্বস্ত হয়েছে এবং বাবা-মা মারা গেছে, তাকে গুহাগুলিতে বড় হয়ে যাওয়ার Has kept for The super strength and speed improvements seem to have, but why is not solved - perhaps the same power their torch batteries by eliminating did, but the movie whenever someone dies, then each of you hunters into tears like a big bird to impress the drink ( See, how much blood splits the walls!) But at the end, only open an animal with his father and mask Gone? If the mystery is reaching a high altitude then I want to ignore it but it was rarely. Then he started to rape the last remaining cover and roll credits ... ajnanabhabe worse than I thought. কখনও কখনও একটি ফিল্ম খুব খারাপ হয় আপনি এটি প্রশংসা করতে পারেন এবং হয়তো হাসতে পারেন, কিন্তু এই চলচ্চিত্রগুলি নিজেকে হালকাভাবে গ্রহণ করতে ব্যর্থ হয়। <br /> <br /> You saw it, you can not uncheck it!
