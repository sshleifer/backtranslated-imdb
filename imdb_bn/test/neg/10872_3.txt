There was more than 80 minutes of annoying expansion in my life, but now no one comes to mind. Hell Ride has been based on the 70th theme of the Pip Fiction and Researcher's movie, which was reversed and corrected on Tarantino. The problem of Hell Raid is in contrast to PF and RD, the story is junky and so the characters develop. How can Bishop steal the silence of the movie? Summary of P. Fiction, No Country Air Gun etc. He is acting in this movie? I could not help but laugh at those scenes where she believes standing with her pelvic, trying hard to feel like some tough bikes. This movie is nothing credible. And why Dennis Hooper? Did they really need Easy Rider Motif? I blame Larry Bishop, for his horrifying plot and dialogue, not to mention the failed attempt in his main role. Do not get annoyed to see this movie, it's time to waste.
