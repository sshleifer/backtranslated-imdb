When I was very young I first saw this Saturday a matinee on Saturday. I thought it was cool and often thought about it. Well I finally resaw it to the DVD. It was still very entertaining but in a different way. It was ranked as the most important campest among the Saifai films of the 1950s. It seemed to fill the military footage of the stock. The conversation is stilted and the effect is crude. I had a conversation in the dialogue. When the line Jeff Morrow tells the beach with the babe. If you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunk friends then rent it. This is a classic.
