Why the original "attack" is rebuilt? "Attack" to my mind was the carpenter's real fine essay. It contains all the good carpenters films in the element. External threat of a small group of individuals. People accept the challenge because they are forced to do it. One at a time! Just remember, the carpenter's original guns did not make any sound, thus more threatening than conventional devices. And now this rebuilding. "The main character I" focus on his relationship with psychology and the main character II (evil but honorable). Anonymity threatened in the film of the carpenter, but rather replaced by a plot of changed conspiracies / corruption. "Remakers" do not just understand the original key plot. And thus produced a few generals.
