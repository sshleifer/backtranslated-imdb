Once a friend of mine hired this, Peter Fonda started thinking about it, it could not be bad. Wrong! It's as bad as it can be. There is a lot to laugh and it's not a joke. For example, in a scene, Hawken walks through the jungle and when he comes out, suddenly he is wearing a completely different garment! Where was the "director" brain while shooting the scene ?! Perhaps the same place was Fonda when he agreed to the same flickr. It is indeed a shame that a good actor has to fool this poor excuse for this movie. <br /> <br /> No one can call this acting as an act of acting. Jack Elam has brought a star count here, but he looks at all kinds of dark and horrific shot scenes of what he does. Not to mention "Indians", the girl was so polite that I just wanted to shoot her just for her sorrow and mine. If I can give this 0, I want to. The shame that does not exist here. It really reminds a bad joke or an amateur footage made for fun. It should serve as evidence that how bad movies can get.
