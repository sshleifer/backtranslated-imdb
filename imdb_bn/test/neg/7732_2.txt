My Lord, this film was nothing more than the film's number by the number. Stirling salesman can not go to New York, the counselor with gold heart takes him under his wing, the salesman comes against California and makes it big, then it grows up, then comes back with a simple life. Hit the bottom of the rock trying to get back to the top. I do not think the plot can remember any part that takes more than five seconds for development. Point in point (spoiler?): John Capellus tells the character when he and his girlfriend are coming to Santa Cruz, and James Woods says that he really does not come, you know they're coming with 100% confirmation next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, San Young certainly looked good.
