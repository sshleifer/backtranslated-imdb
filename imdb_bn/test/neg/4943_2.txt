I am very disappointed. First, German synchronization is bad. It would probably be even better with the original version (with subtitles), but film director Luna Papa and Black Bit watched the White Bit, and the whole film seems to be seen that something in this style is trying to create something. But every direction has failed. It's a strange incredible story and a connotation mix of childhood gags too. No atmosphere, no life Very primitive sex-comedy. I gave two votes, because 1 is the worst, and the other point of 'sibila', he is really cute. Sorry - I like the movie 'Eastern', but it's really impossible.
