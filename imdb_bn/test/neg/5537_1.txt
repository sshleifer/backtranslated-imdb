How was this film made in the name of brutality? <br /> <br /> Anyone regards these subtitles as "horrible" on each individual frame of this genuinely neutral effort. <br /> <br /> Violent acting, unfortunate dialogue and the lack of talent for all involved are nightmares created for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The overall impression? <br /> <br /> Students of an exciting drama became lucky with lottery donations and made one of the most painful films ever made. <br /> <br /> It looks like an Oscar to Hammer Horror TV Show. Element. <br /> <br /> And for the second thought it does not fall into the 'Bad It's Good' section. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
