Did it ever happen to you? I go to my local video store and can see some new adventures in the "Silent film" section. I'm spying a copy of the new arrival of a photo that I was once known as Nakid Alibi. This is one of the mail order video companies that offers hard work (mostly) "duplicate" to find headlines. The box descriptions sound well. This is my favorite player in the movie (Sterling Hayden, Glorya aarrame and Gene Barry). So I take it home and see it. About ten minutes in this film, I started thinking second. Almost half the way I started to dislike this picture. At the end of the film, I just do not like it, I despised it. The image is al-Willis suspicious of the open police robbery. Besides being drunk, he has nothing to the police. When he pushed a policeman and allowed him to go home, the police beat him. When the detective comes to Conroy, the police ended the push and then declared Willis clear. Willis takes vengeance on oath. Later, one of the police officers was shot dead. With any other proven evidence proving "disturbing" Willis, Conos makes his Willis his only suspect, although his boss's suspect is named after a young man. Conroy arrested him, but the lack of evidence was released for Willis. The next day two police were bombed. This time Conroy Bakery goes to that Willis owner and trying to beat a confession from him. Conroy does not know it but a local correspondent whose paper is trying to try a wonderful Willis and Conroy, whose paper has been convicted of police's atrocities Conroys has been convicted. But Connie continued her pursuit and Willis escaped to Mexico, where Willis had a mistress. Conroy Willis managed to convince a killer to help him defend his protector (who would rather be rough). What is the lack of this film is a believer script. Only a draft draft was written before a script was completed and the script was shown after the start of shooting. In the event occurs, changes in character personality, plot twists that happen due to any real reason other than calls to the script. Willis does not like to press a glass anymore, even in the first part of the film, we do not think that he is a rabid murderer who cheats his wife. He treats his wife, his children and employees well. At the beginning of the film, one thought that his wife was a blank canon. He seems insulted to allow police atrocities. Conroy, firmly since the very beginning of Willis has gone past the criminal. He thinks Old Samyavadi Bulgarian secret police policy is governed; "Everyone is guilty, we have not yet found out about it." Later, she showed kindness to the friend and little boy of Connay Al, now we like him. Sorry! Cono's early print was stuck with me very long. And he is a stupid police. After being expelled from Mexico and leaving Mexico, he run a background check at Willis and discovered that a warrant was issued for him in Maryland. Why did not he remember this before? This film was not used for enough running time. Cast well. Gene Barry considers how bad Ali Wilis's role is. I'm not very fond of the 40s and 50s crime thrillers, but I do not think this movie was good, it was a bad taste in my face (some modern movies, but old movies rarely).
