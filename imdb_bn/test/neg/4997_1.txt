Hey, I'm not such a bad-good-film fan, but there is nothing unknown about survival. It's just so bad and that's it. No released cheese, no unexpected humor, nothing! - The annoying mysterious zombie ("undesired": some people who rarely make them) are particularly vulnerable to hair-based effects (if you can call those effects), meaningless plot and annoying actors. Quoting and quoting them from other (better) films (Revittent Evil, Dead Dawn and Comet Night) and directing me to sleep beside me. However, once the last credit was rolled it was my Eyelids Rise. My suggestion: save your money. This is not even a rent, even if you want to stop PSS and / or some people want to sleep, then go ahead and give it a spin. You have been warned;)
