Well, this 'horror' movie was a joke, right? Please say it was considered a joke, then I can understand. <br /> <br /> A big bird of a huge bird - a single tube, whatever - whatever goes on the ground, will fall on uneducated people and they will collapse up. The Mara Corde and Jeff Moro are quite useful to keep things interesting, but at least you will enjoy an impressive snicker when you see the 'Giant'. <br /> <br /> Director Fred Sears made this picture very quickly and knew that the bird seems completely ridiculous, or he really thinks that his movies and animals were actually true. Terrible I like to think - and I hope - it was a former. <br /> <br /> PSS. Birds need a hairstyle.
