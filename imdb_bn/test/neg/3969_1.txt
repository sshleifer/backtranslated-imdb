SLOOOOOOOW, Tepid, Bad produces 70's schloker today's title due to moore croaking; Nevertheless, this film is notable for acting, missing aspects, and the stupid 70's clothing (sadly, remembering Muko when Adidas' clothes were all rage ...). It has the same kind of feeling that more than 70 science-movies are more involved with "Westward" and "Logan Run". Although Primais is attractive (rich people cloning themselves to keep the body parts ready for the body parts to keep the body parts ready), the film is Richard (Team Donnelly), who is both cloning and annoying. Dole does not help ollow, but the rest fits right with the cast. Even Dick Sergeant ("live" TV series, "Ghost with 1,000,000 eyes"), Kinan Win ("Dr. Strangovov", "The Dark", "LaserBlast") and Peter Graves ("At the Beginning"), "Killer From Space" "It conquers the world") provides only the latest taped performance. Produced, directed and edited by dancers, it is no surprise that "Clonas" fail to frighten at least anyone's fear. It can be said that there is nothing in the flicker that the verse-like fans will also like - want to see some of the worst, funny 70 films, Gradeen Clark will keep something. "Clones" is not a bonus; Moko said even MST 3K-version is a young man, so go ahead at your own risk! = 8 p
