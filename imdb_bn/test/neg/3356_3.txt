It was an exciting movie when Pam Gray's Kofi was created in 1973. The plot was silken and satisfied - even acting was often amateur. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to restore the formula with Foxi Bronon next year - not a bad movie but almost like "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the studio explicitly let go of something new for Miss Gear, such as Ceiba, Babi was originally the same plot of coffee and Foxi Bron. Because this idea has been recycled and the acting and acting are so tired and low power, because it is actually scraping under the Blackslawl barrels. Like these other movies, Sheba, Babi started some local black mobsters, and finally someone loves to kill Pam Gray. In the past, it was a drug seller and a pimps, now it is trying to run the most lending companies and fifteen shops outside the city so that they move to the market corners. And, like other movies, Palm is a female hit squad - justice and a good butt hoppin. And, like other movies, there is a "Cat War" between Pam and a white lady in front of "Mr. Big". And, like other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy who drags all the strings. And, like other movies, he is Mr. Captured by Big. And, like other movies, he does not kill him immediately, but he has enough chance to escape (here, while the knife is almost in good condition). And, like other movies, he finally got free and killed his Jim - @ $$ <br /> <br /> <br /> This formula seems to be interesting in 1973, but by this film it was obviously a prospective sister . Even if you did not see other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the punch and the stick were so slow and stacked. The same can be said to play guns. At one stage, four including machine guns, an AR-15 and shotgun attack. Pam responded by opening fire with a 357 revolver and killing 3 of 4 and surrendering others !!! Although he was a good shot, he was rather slow and the boys just waited without waiting for them !!! Plus, even a world champion shooter or rumbo could not be successful even with a one-sided contrast - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they whipped out his cute pistol and cleverly when his "men hit this professional !! <br /> <br /> In addition to slower and hair action scenes than other blanchotation films, the film has a lot of logical gap which was terrible In one case, his boyfriend, "Williams", knew the yacht and nu-tronic at the end of the film, but Pam never told him - how did he know about it? On the other hand, the police burst into a boat filled with hoods and hoods. There was no evidence of police, there was no evidence and the firing started with crooks a little excited and, the crane was .30 Carrier Machine Guns and Other Aspects Excellent powerful weapon but in many cases police was killed by wounding snub-nosed .38s! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is "It was done / done ... it's a complete lot bitter" is a great For example I love the Blaxploitation movie, but it is slow to show only the very dopi and successively watching the fans without fans.
