I just do not get it. Why does it call a siege in the movie "American Weulph" when it does not have any connection with it? The first film was funny * and * special effect of ground breaking was scary. (Memory service, Oscars section for special makeup effects * * created * for this movie). "Paris" is not one of these things. Horrible effects, and much more. Do not watch this movie. Instead of the original "Werewolf in London" rental. You will be very happy
