I have not read the book based book and read letters in the vita and violet. If I come up with any expectations in this movie, then the Bloomsbury group (Virginia Wolf and Nicholson's partner were among those). It was not that which was not a problem for me. I wonder how people have been able to create this film behind it, according to my opinion, very unpredictable and repetitive and the maximum character is flat, despite great elements and some very good actors. The script is not just good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbors - many vain sexual scenes (but only in women, although nothing about Harold's many love affairs is unclear), in general, many pointless scenes, very little information about the background of the characters. It seems odd to consider the quality of the product - it looks really an ambitious work on the page, but the script is definitely the most weighted and this is where the film fails. <br /> <br /> <br /> Harold hit me as helpless, although both of them work really well, especially his. How did they declare unexpected love for each other in a lot, I thought, well, easily unknown It gives a lot of knowledge that it happened through the letter, such as TMDWeds that I wanted to know where the nickname came from - the Russians * as well as the beat - why are sometimes called nicknamed Vita? This can be a small thing, but it is important to contribute to the big picture. <br /> <br /> * I saw the movie with the English subtitles, and apparently where Mita should say, instead of Mede said. As I can explain my frustration with nicknames - I did not understand why Vita should be Greek when Violet was Russian!
