<br /> <br /> I wanted to brighten up this film after the highway 61 and Roadkill's wit and vigor, but it was safe and self-confusing like the hard-rock star. Taking speed, does not help by a long-long misleading sequence, the letters were flat and unusual, and Art Bergman is not a Jello Biafra. I had to press myself to be awake.
