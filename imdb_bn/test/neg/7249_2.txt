I bought this movie for $ 3.00 in Blockbuster, because it's interesting (with the idea of ​​dragging around a skeleton), because the mini-skirt was a beautiful girl behind, and because there was a limited watch sticker there. I thought it was a sweet or at least sincere arrival story with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> I saw it, how it got a banned sticker, because the rare language, the slightest violence and the closest thing to nudity (in fact, can not go around its hope!) when the girl is in her knighthood And you see his pants (you see a lot of his pants in this movie, no matter what he's wearing a mini-skirt). Even anti-religious humor is a joke (and paranoid, playful, disrespectful, derivative, singular, and not the least funny among everyone - it's better to listen to Ray Stevens "" Did Jesus wear a rolux on him? "Television show"). This will rarely qualify as a PG-13 (not rated), but Blockbuster refused to rent it to anyone under the age of 17 - for example it was obscene. A small child can go there and rent a request for a dream version, but they emphasize that Jake and Reba are bad. In this case, it worries me - the only thing that can humiliate people is the idea of ​​suicide at the beginning. If someone wants to see images of honestly pictured suicide (not this, but good people like Virgin Switzerland), it's teens. If both films are properly rated due to suicide view, then there is little chance for me to introduce a story written in a PG-13 film (original two-and-a-half and twelve) characters. Suicide is the top three main causes of teenage adolescents' death (I think it is number 2), so most teens will be affected or influenced by it. <br /> <br /> Just do not tell this movie, though. 2/10.
