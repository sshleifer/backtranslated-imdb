This movie wants me to push my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare with such badness, but some say that the movie is like bloodshed at your fingertips. And that comment comes from the author's cousin. This movie is getting so bad, it has created "Hlak" (second worst movie), "The Provened" (one of the greatest films in the history of film). If you love annoying family films with predictable plot lines, you absolutely love this movie. If you have a brain, then you definitely will not. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep. The next day, I ended up from wherever I lived, and the worst decision of my life was.
