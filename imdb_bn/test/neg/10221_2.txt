I saw the first bit of stop motion animation and most of the live action which was going to a small country, my interests were preserved, but 11 other curious shorts did not really attract my interest or let me remember anything. Music and all of the 8 mm footage seemed to be so random that it all seemed just random. If you do not see it free, I will not recommend it. <br /> <br /> The music does not come step by step in such a step-by-step process. I rented the DVD because I thought it was mixed with stop motion animation or SMA live action and was the first small SMA only, the second had a slight stop motion with most live action. The paper was one of the stuff out of the cut, and the rest was an 8-mm outdoor shot from the camera with the bed. There was no meaning that I could see it.
