Okay now this piece of work in this movie is a piece. It is done with stupid Jesus references and dialogues that most human beings ask if they can watch movies. The big names like Roddy Piper and David Caradine have attracted you, but accept it from me, this movie is damaged. The story is stagnant, and lack of completley in intelligence. Set, veihicles, and costume come in as a cross of bablween five, and a tearing flick. I'm sure pornographic theres with diorougue sure.
