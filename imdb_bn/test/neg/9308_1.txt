Yahoo Sirius $ 3 Bottle Like Wine - There was no starting material and the age had worsened. This film proves to be completely toxic. We can hope that this is its final film and the serious lack of its success will reduce the chances of earning money for any initiative in the future. As the most unusual example of the Australian comedy fantasy, it's okay with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Paterson protects the world". How tragic it is to have so much extraordinary curiosity in Australia that this type of vehicle was given to reveal Yahoo's proponent of school guard comedy. And to remember - he had 7 years to come up with the script. True genius!
