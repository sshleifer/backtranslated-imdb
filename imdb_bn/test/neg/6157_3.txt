The stories and the characters really need to really work. The world concept is very strong, but it is not annoying to develop any of it through the disclosures or the plot. Despite the Chess notes at the beginning of the film, it is understood that you will not use exposition, since nobody in the world is new. And yet, when Matt Ovens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Pack) get stuck and lost and introduce the fat, lazy, rich people to the air worshipers and the museum, then who do we think of these people, the real idea or their We should also be concerned about it. Characters are the only ways to develop world-class living patterns. Easy things, such as ordering a drink at the bar, or talking about something in the past - are things that make the movie memorable, endless shots of vague planes and cheaper CGI effects trying to loot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> If you are often upset because everything is frustrating, stay in one place for a little while and talk a little bit about the characters. All essential nut should be removed. Get rid of the whole air worshipers scene. Staff museum get rid of people. Get rid of all the crappy flying strap until you can make the relevant story of the wind. The whole thing is a big plane, or some set. Just talk to people about what we think. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Payston. Her relationship with film center and robot, Byron, around Tasker's character. In fact, the biggest problem in the film is that we are not concerned about anyone, because nobody takes time to explain their motivation or to delve into their characters. We do not like Matt (well, because he has played among other things by Bill Paxton). He is a scoundrel, who does not release himself enough, go to Android, Byron, without. And this is the least meaning of three main points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is integral. 3. Byron can be well-pleased at any time. <br /> <br /> We tried to like Byron because there is a way to it, but it is basically unused. What we're leaving is a shiny, glassy-looking robot guy, who is acting, reducing it and a timepiece of wood, and later on in reality Jonny. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but we know he has killed someone. We do not know why he killed someone, or because of the situation of this deadly incident, it did not develop. If we do not know the story, we will not be sorry for it. We know for a fact that he killed people. And he likes Bill Payston. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Taskar (partly because he played by the good guy Marc Hamill), since his character does not do anything from the extreme and ruthless, ordinary things - a post-apocalyptic peace officer. Certainly he killed Montclair (Rabbi Coltren) and his team, but they are drug dealers on the way to becoming poppy for heroin. And they shoot at first. He does not kill anyone who does not go on the road, or he does not first try to harm physically. That museum is equally good for the final clash. He used a magnetism of police atrocities against a lazy Deliverant (F. Murray Abraham has lost this role), and everyone else is holding a gun on him. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner. After just 10 minutes with Matt, he was ready to swim along with a whip of loyalty to him, and despite talking about Matt Trash and tearing him out. If I love it, then I'll hate it anytime. <br /> <br /> True Pacton's character is as "true false" as Simon, or nearly as lovable in Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Does anyone fall for him in these movies? Why not Because he is a tall mouthed ass, and a damaged. Why keep him holding this photo?
