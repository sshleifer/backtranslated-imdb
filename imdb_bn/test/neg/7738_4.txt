Because they all see MST3 with their artificial friends (most of them) do not make fun and explicit comments about movies. And these people show them and based on them, the only way to comment and vote on IMDB, they themselves do not even try to watch the film. <br /> <br /> I saw this image on my own, I did not read the first review, I did not have to tell some people to laugh, I only got the DVD (an old place to get out of the outer space, an old condition ) And saw it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I knew what I had for the Gold Globes, Albert Pine, but usually they would be pretty entertaining May <br /> <br /> A lot of pressure on Alice in the brain, the story of the rabbit hole has happened many times, and another kind of entertainment in the basic structure (but completely different from the content), another entertainment B-movie in Atlantis's Warlords. <br /> <br /> The voice was boring, but then that idea, which they pushed with a few lines of movie. <br /> <br /> The character of the protagonist was one of the worst-voices / accents in English language FI LM history, but you can accept it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but it's not a bad film, it's just a bit of an average B-movie DTV type movie, nothing new to anything new, and perhaps I'm younger than the parent (7- 14 years old) will be more enjoyable by It's a bit of light-hearted fantasy. <br /> <br /> I have to see it again, maybe maybe 10 years ago I will not have it. <br /> <br /> Do not be too rigid on the movie because some dolls have told you that this image is not taking seriously, and certainly there is no Troll 2 or place revolt.
