I had two reasons to look at this picture. It was among the first Stellan Squareguard and Marisa Tomomi (both of whom were good actors) and I had nothing to do. While watching the movie, I immediately thought of doing something good: Sleep! This film is a complete waste of time. This is a former former Superintendent of Police. Pre-copper was the best ever, but he was fired. He is doing his own stuff for disliking his former friends and he will save that day. All the great surprises (not !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
