I am a huge fan of prison dramas that is reflected in my favorite American TV show at Ozz. I think there is a kind of smog vioirism in the bad menu of appeals, but I'm frustrated at Don Siegel's Cell Block 11. Okay, since it was created in 1954, I knew it would be contrary to bad language, graphic scanning and gang rape, but even before it was lesser films like previous movies, less weaker films, such as each Doban ID and White Hit. There is a problem in the promotional tone of this film with some pictures of riot leader Dunn being a prison reformer. Yes, that seems ridiculous because he is a violent hero, who pays for some unheeded dark trees, but basically what he does, he wants to see that he has rehabilitated himself to join society instead of suffering. As with fundamental themes, there is a problem in making a movie B movies (most satirical that after the Siegel darts Harry will be created where only a good criminal dies) and that is not very good as the Emile girl's warder. Especially its performance irritating. I like to say a frustrating movie
