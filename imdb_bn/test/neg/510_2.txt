Many people are unwilling to see this because of the humiliating high rating of this film. Some appreciate using this kind of argument (and a transparent agenda that betrays any simple love of America), it communicates with violence. <br /> <br /> The Gate of Heaven is a bad film, it's fundamentally awful. An intimate scene with no purpose, dirty conversation, dirty fiction, simple shots in any way other than a theme ... <br /> <br /> A high quality revisionist history of this disaster and a product of temporary changes. Perception <br /> <br /> See Arab Lawrence before watching the Gate of Heaven for some perspective. You can see how clearly this film is aimless and lost. "Problems" may have been tried to deal with it, it's lost in a mood. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with the critics of America, but when a terrible movie gets illogical praise, purely because of that element ... it is valuable for challenging. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching for two reasons; Curiosity, and as a precaution for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw this house free, the pain of being in the theater and sitting through it ... for 4 hours!
