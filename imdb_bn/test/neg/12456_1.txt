I'm not going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. Bottom Line: It was played terribly, there were lots of plots and totally gone. My digital cable was the only good thing about this description for the film: "A married man has a struggling businessman with his secretary." Huh ?? Obviously, the film was apparently true although the description might be a bit interesting. <br /> <br /> - Celley
