Perhaps there could be a mistake in a film, which contains a group of Italian people who are called Florians, and some obscure-lava-octopus-crustaceans-the non-inspired hellspan-devil-fish! <br /> <br /> I say something wrong! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3 episode, because walking on the right of the ball, without any fault, this movie is easy to consider. Junk with a lousy and annoying plot <br /> <br /> 9/10 for MSTied version. 1/10 for unmounted version <br /> <br />
