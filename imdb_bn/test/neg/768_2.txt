Tom and Jerry are visiting Africa and hiding yourself in "Amos-n-Andy" fashion. They work differently and deal with the quality of extremely poor grammar associated with black colored images described in many cartoons of the ages. In addition to the attacking images, this cartoon is not very good. Why are they going to Africa in the first place? Obviously only other Amos-n-Andy and the audience are given by the African Extra Extended cannibalistic screenplay. Instead of 2, instead of 2, it has got 2 octopus in a few seconds. It's a weird few seconds. <br /> <br /> One viewpoint, which still shakes your head How can I wonder how ignorance can be enlarged ... <br /> <br /> (Note that I'm considering some cartoon that racially stereotical images too Well, this is the only reason for the cartoon's existence if you have good content around the cartoon. On the other hand, if you have a black face with "mammy," shafing feet, poor grammar and giant lip images If there are no other words to the rest of the loss? "Plane DUMB" the case is not there.)
