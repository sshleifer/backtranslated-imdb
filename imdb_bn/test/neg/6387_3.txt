Flash-forward sequence, a completely annoying western set in an insane sanctuary, is one of the first films produced by Schluckmasters in the Hell Canon South Canon film. William Sas, who later provided these fan favorites like Incredible Mating Man and Galaxin, the film tells a sharp story of the golden robbers who hide the secret secret of two women, trapped in their cabin. The discovery is not worth it. Cast (many of whom did not create any other film) tries wildly, but the hammersword is made by screenplay, which usually does not give any idea. The little impact of the shelter scene is edited and punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. Finally, it's a lot of talk and something else.
