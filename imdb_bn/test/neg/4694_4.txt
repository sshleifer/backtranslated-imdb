First shown 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): The mystery of the murder of the Corny comedy with very little laugh. This movie is based on credits based on a previous Italian film, but it was rewritten by two popular American romantic comedy writers. But Charles Chayr and Nancy's daughters are not spending this effort on their other efforts. The story is played by some down-out-run American travelers, Richard Lewis and Shan Young who suppresses the lost dog and hopes to share the rewards after watching the advertisement on paper for DashSund return. After trying to get it back, they saw a hand outside the door of the house of the lady, believing that they believed that the rest of her body believed that she gave the money. They suddenly told police instead of contacting them and telling them the truth that they would emerge from the scenes created for the killings like runways. Other characters in the movie are met before a train, and dragging things to move around Monte Carlo gambling resorts. Among other cast members include character actor John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. The police asked to know about the death, they began to question the main characters and of course, they had to work through their stupid falsehood to understand what had happened. None of the aforementioned character actors can bring this film out of its middle condition, although some interesting moments provided by most Belousies / Shepherd couples. This is not a horror movie, it's not just good. There are plenty of movies in the average and this is another one for this level. Try, perhaps you like it, probably you do not.
