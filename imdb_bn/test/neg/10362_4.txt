This movie was frustrating, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but do not be confused, it is not at all. It seems that there is no junky joke in mind, I do not think they wipe any weed out of this film. The marijuana field is only a plot device. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by seeing this picture that four friends got bored in summer and write a script full of wonderful dialogue (their notion) and a movie. Soft conversations supported by the middle-acting product, say that this movie has a huge 'understatement' of a 'hook'. Do not waste your time or money.
