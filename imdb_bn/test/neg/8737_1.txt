A friend and I came to see this movie in 1980 when it came out. It was playing in a huge theater and we were just two people in that place. It lasted for two days before displaying it in the theater. It's so bad that we all scoffed at this. From that time, we all rated movies based on the worst movie ever killed or killed. Like other critics, it's interesting that it's fun. It sure is not worth a second look. I do not give myself more than 1 because I do not think the makers of the movie feel bad and I can not afford to pay for the accident. Sorry
