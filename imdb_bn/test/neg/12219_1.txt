Perhaps it's just an arrangement of this movie, a documentary, but I believe that this film is well served by good actor and more difficult conversations. Actors also double the business owners' sword They know better than any other business emotions and complexities, but since they are not professional actors, they do so badly to carry that passion and documentary. There were some memorable scenes in this movie and there were many good lines but they became so weak that they will be erased with time and I will have the only memories of this documentary that some good scenes I can not remember. <br /> <br /> If you want to register for the first account in .com and see 99% of the people who do not become an instant million, please see. However, some annoying camera work, poor performance, bad conversations, and overall bad movies refer to the era of the Internet Boom.
