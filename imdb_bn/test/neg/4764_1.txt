This film is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful human virus. They are chasing public men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The film's consistency is quite interesting, but the debate is very annoying. At any stage the film is not involved with the audience at any stage. The supposed, small budget budget is a problem but not the reason for the film's failure. Too much blame is very painful. Descriptive is a great deal but, unfortunately, the narrator has an overwhelming over-dramatic voice. Very rarely this has happened to people and at the end you will be rooting for the official men - as soon as they will end the movie as soon as they kill the drama. Four people will be run in the desert with some stock footage of the better title helicopter for this movie. Overall, very tiring.
