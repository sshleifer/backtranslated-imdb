This show makes me (and many others) hate their life. Let's face it, Joe is perfect; She gets beautiful bland, good quality, everyone goes to her for advice, she is popular, she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms. Why I gave this event 3: 1. Acting is horrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt those people who kept this instant actress (especially Victoria Justice) on television. 2. The characters are incredible and mixed. You have your usually popular girl. A nasty, shallow, stupid, stereotypical, girl is portrayed by an awesome actress. Then you have a common joke which is a bit natural and actually beautiful. Then stereotyped smart girl who is not a chic and clearly associated with her perfect popular friends. Then a rich beautiful boy stuck in a mirror that would be happy all day long. Then the actor must be played by the actor is played by another stinky actress. And the end of a normal nerd person. 3. The plot is annoying, and lame. 4. I hate how these characters spoiled. They just can not be normal! 5. Everything is perfect for them, and we are reminded how much everyone stink our lives.
