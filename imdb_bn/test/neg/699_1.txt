I'm in a film class and I know that I do not know everything about the film, but it's really the worst, stupid, annoying and waste time, the movies I've ever seen, and I've seen the Naplin dynamite. They are both equally awesome. Conrack is annoying and interesting even in the film it is not a heart warmth story and Pat Conroy is nothing overcomes! I'm not saying war and shit should fly, but it will be more vivid than a silent film. Children like to play in this film, they probably could make real kids cheating on Yamakrakus Island, and as far as I can not get worried, this was a stupid idea for a book and a bad idea for a movie. I do not even know why this film was made, the greatest five worst films of all time.
