At this time, The Bastmaster (Mark Singer) came back only to face a new enemy archon (Wingshours), but due to an annoying teenager (Curie Wu), he was transferred to the future, where he later dived. Lots of lunar (lame) fish ensue fish out. You do not get these rotten sequels of fidelity core. A painful movie to see Beastmaster 2. Reference and "Hipnas" badly marked the movie (it was created in 1991) and who really wants to see this Bustmaster? The note is also Wings Hauser, which is the best asset of the film. The lion looks weird, the annoying anniversary and the whole of the 1991 Slang makes the films just unwittingly cynical. This is one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Out of 1/2 * 4 (Awful)
