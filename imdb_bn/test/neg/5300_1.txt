Uma and Trivola were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the film was a bunch of very annoying and noiseless secondary characters, which was covered in some very bad writings. Dances in Uma and Trivolter are sometimes intense with greatness such as Harvey Kettle and similar unusual lip choices. And the black actors who tried to do black work got extremely annoying after too much exposure in the very pictures. He made a fairly good performance by Rock, the only secondary character that you could not wait to watch on screen. Bad, stupid plot. The writers are not able to understand clearly when writing Generation X or the 12-15 year old rap crowd, and the combination has turned into a movie that keeps me looking at my watch!
