It was not surprising that on Sunday Mail, slow-moving, poor performance, and filming (camera sculptures, at the beginning of the film, and even not artistic) = it is not straightforward in the video, but in this case, why not restore anything, it is free to publish it through Sunday's UK newspaper By doing your (film production costs), at least this way you will get a captive audience and some cost redemption To borrow. <br /> <br /> I did not give this picture 1 out of 10, because some older actors tried to pull them from the shell, some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, it was no bloice ??) were nice to see, but Vinnie Jones as lead, and I think she was good singing in 60 seconds when she did not speak. <br /> <br /> This image is dropping on day-to-day ratings, I think it will find its true mark at 3-4 in 10, in the near future
