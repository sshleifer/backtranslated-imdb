Good actors, good directors, good actors, well guided but ... where movies? Do they have a script or just reform it all? At least it's a small-length movie (only 80 minutes with credit). Nothing seems to be in this picture, nothing is there. Some of the mini-drug addictions have been caught in a short time, but you will not get a source of what is happening, even in some sequences of the movie they are not talking about. "F ***" and "Sorry ***** s", but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> Those who love the Abel Ferrara films such as Funeral, R Xmas are going to be a big disappointment, It's been for me. What did he think Did he really think that it was a good movie? And if he did not, why did he do it?
