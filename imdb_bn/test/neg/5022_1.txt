Do not kill my fans, but I have something to say about this. Prose: Well, the most modest season I've seen from Seasonal Offshore Seykhinintai killed the thief. In the rest of the season, I personally think that this is a real plot line and those tenants have more; Well God is such a favorite character as they. Shame is killing them off. Of course, I will write 15 page articles, why I like Shikinontai so much, but it would be boring for you. So this series actually has some preferred characters. I'll miss Banksku ... poor, poor monk boy. <br /> <br /> Continental: Out of the ark, the series is completely annoying, repetitive, and some letters are very annoying. Kagome for example: he overreacts my taste too much; He acted like Yuka from Elphoen liar. Inuyasha: She is a loud mouth monster with a huge sword. What is so unique about her? He has strange doggie! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, no action and too cocky. Naraku is the only wimiest villain that ever exists in the world of Anime. Miroku and Sango ... they have some color but they have been standing for a long time. But this is my worst issue that they are not in a general sense. Romiko Takahasi did a lot better than that. I saw it before. <br /> <br /> If you like the series with many actions, there is no annoying love triangle, but it is not for you but it is not for you.
