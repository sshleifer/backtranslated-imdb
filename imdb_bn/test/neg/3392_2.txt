This DVD is about 30 minutes long, and relentless interviews, which reveal that there is an IQ of around 30 of the average Slipkotian. But these aspects are at least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that the slipcote is one of the least meritorious metal bands to sell 100,000 units of their brand. (The only reason I am saying "a" instead of "a" because a down system is even worse.) Like the Ed Gin's friends, the music of this band is combined with the old metal cleches, which should be both their image and their ultra-lazy music. In fact, their image types are fun; Their videos are like Snippets from Chess horror films, so they meet at least some fun things like entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is no quality in their songs - whatever: just a buzz, one-million times before-absolutely-guitar-neck referrals that are not related to each other and still to form "songs" irregularly Grouped together, there is no coordination, no highlight, nothing is there. But if the reefs are really bad, the voice is worse: the slipcott singer's stotototical is so unworthy "evil" pregnancy - 90% of all metallic bands today - but this is not something to compare than starting a trickery with the hickery! Still, what can one expect? Rule number 39 of the "Nude Metal" handbook is quite clear: "You will alternately roar and sing. Do not ignore two styles that are well mixed, because most of your fans are very vocal, they even love you even if you are a microphone. When their "singer" starts with "tune", then the slip knot is their worst. <br /> <br /> But go back to their pictures, it is theft, copy, leak, levy, borrowing, Mr. Bongo Without anyone else, you have never heard of them, have you ever heard of them? Surely you do not, you only hear nu metal, and Mr. Bungal is far away from him and outside any sorting, they wore very masks - wonderful, horrible ones, slipknot Like, I can also add - at the end of the 80's and early 90's, this band, whose frontman Fayyith noor Mike Patan, his partner The average music is not directed towards the fans because it was not too big. <br /> <br /> So, mainly the slipcote or 'even in the image section, they have nothing new to offer so many years will be forgotten: Once masks will become boring to their loyal fans, while the slipcote will only be compelled to compete in the music market with their generic music. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting that Mike Pattern says that most of the nu metal bands are the main influence of his song. Estimates - and grateful - Patan did not make that clear and in any way refused to be proud of an influence of sub-clauses of poor democracy ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy it, this little DVD and cheap thrills are unknown Ears and annoying eyes ... and then slip the slipcott posters, because in some years nobody will take care of them, the poor give. <br /> <br /> At the doctor's "Get Threatened", she finally realized how she wore a mask: She was a blue-eyed face of Ada, like a younger brother of Dave Mustin! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very difficult, click "No" below. It will teach me ...
