This image is a disaster from the beginning to the end. 75 percent of the scenes from Harkles and Hunted World and Hercules and Captive Wemons have been edited together with original scenes, which do not add anything except a complete wrap-off. I have seen big fan of those two films and scenes taken from them, made my head spin with the re-editing and re-dubbed with nonsense conversations. In order to make more money by mimicking uneducated audiences, such cheap producer strategies have largely killed the Sword and Sandal genre in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene in the new footage and it is a battle of Hercules. With Bad Hercules While fighting cold and Giovanni Cianfriglia, playing Antaius, stood out definitely. She makes Herc a memorable kindness. But the rest of the people were infamous that was probably shot on a day. <br /> <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs!
