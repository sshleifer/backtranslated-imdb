I saw the first 10 minutes and it bored me So, I end up all the way to the end. This film is far less sophisticated than the worst in the film category. Bad acting, throw, dictate, Lara Craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! Through the whole movie, I think there are only 6 to 7 people in the whole cast, but only the two started in their entire movie. I was expecting something like the Starships Trupper, but it had nothing to do with it. I was fooled by movie title and DVD cover image. Do not waste your time while watching this annoying and bad movie. Come on, I wonder why they were annoyed to find such bad movies?
