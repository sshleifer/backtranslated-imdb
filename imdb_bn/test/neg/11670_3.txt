Intelligent summary, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, with the theory, it was a great quarter with the third third movie ... Now, it is not! <br /> <br /> So much disappointment outside of Thunderdo! Its original premises is very low, considering an 'underworld' (a mixture between metropolitan and time machines), but it is not done with very strong beliefs. Add overwhelming Tina Turner and add a good storyline that is waiting for a plane, and it's just a huge stinger. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can brighten again with part 4. This could possibly be a huge budget-explosion type), because it's not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
