I gave this movie 1 rating because it is far, the worst movie of my life that I have ever seen. This movie was created in 2003 and I have seen films with good special effect in the 60's. I wish I could go in detail, but the sound can not describe how crappy this movie is. I could work well with a home video camera and $ 20! I do that Chuck Norris again makes a movie. Now if you think I'm down this movie because it's a Christian theme, you're wrong. IL Chuck decided to make a movie that at least tried to look good to God, but why would he hurt poor viewers like me, such as unclear films? This whole picture can be summarized in 3 words: RE DAMN DULULOUS.
