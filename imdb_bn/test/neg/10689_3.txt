The budget and the inexperiencedness of everyone involved, Livin 'could have been life-threatening. Jumble wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I have always found very annoying), as the previous commenter has mentioned, but Pinate (Edward D. Smith), some of his (over) reactions are going very long (a director's problem), some are relatively fine And have fun moments like when he is trying to direct Jamal in the right way to smoke a friend jointly. After all, he is more confident and self-reliant than Jamal, which can be a very good microscopic search for the conflicts of relationships but did not get much better. <br /> <br /> But its inexperience writer / director / painter / etc. No excuse for its stability. Has he ever seen a movie? Face is important! Has he ever heard about a closeup? Even Ed Wood could make a closeup. I do not think it's a lot of budget problems. I would like to see any actor just give a general description, and not only because close closure, but the light ...! The lighting for outdoor shooting may cost too much, but you can make a reflector with the piece of paper! To keep the camera away from the competition, it will help solve the cloakup problem at the same time. If it is very technical, then you can turn the actors around them so that they do not have shade, or you can publish for shadows, and if I do not shot at the LA, then I will ask for the benefit of the cloudy day. It is not saying that it stole all the movies that are better than it, except for the exception of the weekend, but if live life is not printed well then the viewers could have a better effect. The way to catch a glimpse of what the human element might be. <br /> <br /> The scene in PS Barbershop is just stupid.
