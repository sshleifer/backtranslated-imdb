"Ninja Third" is not as bad as the first part of this "Trilogy", "Enter the Enzwer", but it's still a very bad movie. This is rarely possible for fans of martial arts film, because there is not enough system, but the hilarious and unhealthy violence visible in the workplace often hides. If filmmakers are not yet weak enough, filmmakers have become a separatist "Exorcist" rip off of it. The only ransom is the winner's presence of the performer, which plays "Legendary Heroine". She is a beautiful and athlete woman, in which the director is not sure to absorb various sleazy ways - she just will be an aerobics teacher. I do not think a little soft-core exploitation, but it does not pretend to be anything else.
