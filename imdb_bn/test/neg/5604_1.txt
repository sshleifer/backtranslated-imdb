What is a production, screen time and money is a waste of money. Here some European so-called producers think, a Sissy movie. Former model, Alexandra Camp, joins an American C-Class actor and is one of the most notorious producers of film business, Harry A. Towers. The tower then finds some obscure munich based pods. Home, Nandem Communication, Roller Bouters, and then mix everything without any script and you will get "Sumur" - an invaluable jewel in the worst movies! Get a live man, and anything else, whatever you do, please no movies !! Above all, the producer went to South Africa for filming, what you see on the screen is a giant sand hole, where "action" happened, a bad actor and a very bad FX student would do well.
