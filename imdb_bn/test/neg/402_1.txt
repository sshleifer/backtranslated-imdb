I usually love this movie. Give me old old B movies any day but this was just terrible. Acting (?) Turning off my entire movie was almost terrible to the point. I thought I had seen bad all the time but with this only killer tomato attack! In all the truth - this actor used this film for me. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is weird and the main man / woman was very relentless. This movie was absolutely nothing for it. I might have asked a ridiculous question here but why nudity and sexual scenes? Producers think that if they leave them, no one can see? I think they were probably right! Oh Where's the price and Tingler when you need them?
