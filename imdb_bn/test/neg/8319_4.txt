The brave one is a New York radio show host named Eric Bain (Jodie Foster). In his life he dreamed of living in a city that grew up. He is his great drunk David (New Andrews), with whom he plans to get married. But one night when Irica and David were walking on their dogs walk, they were attacked and they killed a group of rebellious groups and put David in the dead. Erica recovers but is then heartbroken and traumatized, and can endure longer in real life. He bought a guy off gun in the street for safety. But one day he bought a shop, another guy came and shot Clark to death. Meanwhile, Erica shot this man, and he becomes a watchman. Anyone that tries to threaten or harm her or anyone else is killed. At the same time Detective Marsar (Terrence Howard) is monitoring this unidentified unknown killer, and this process has become friend in the area. Erica begins to recover her close by killing these violent people, but she is not sure whether she is doing anything moral. And when he and Merser are close, he does not even know the unknown killer attacker on the right side of him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He played violently, morally brutally. Terrence Howard is also awesome in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry together, and strengthen the film at a certain level. The brave one sees the sight of Prison, and some bright camera conveys the work, but it does not work in a great effect. The scene where Erica is absolutely traumatized and feared to walk the front door facing the world. The camera almost goes way back in a dream way, and actually holds the summary at the moment. Almost every time Erica kills someone, everything gets better and the facial expression of it looks fine. Slo-mo is properly used when Erica was killed in her first murder. But why did he kill almost every time he resisted this? The camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the movies, but here are some scenes that are just flat overkill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Suddenly, his love for New York City turned upside down. She feels that the favorite city has a dark side, and she says so at her radio show. I do not understand this completely though. Erica works in such a way that she never realizes that violence can happen at night, and that's a fool. If he lived there for the rest of his life, he must be blind or very unaware. Iris seems to be inhuman, gluttony for the killer people. He does not really have to look for them, they are just begging for them to come to them as they are being shot for death for their wrong actions. Coping with brave one morality and the proper use of violence at first and then suddenly it glorifies it. The end is very negative, and completely immoral and inhuman. It also denies the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, which the film spends so much time for development and suddenly her morals take a U-turn. The moral between the brave one became very fractured, and eventually just plain across the place. So violence is okay? Is it the best thing to revenge for revenge? I pretty much refuse to believe that. You know why Because I have a conscience that does not guarantee the film. No other person has the right to take life, how bad it is, or you hate them. Araka Bain has come out to stop these evil workers, but in the end he is no better than the deadly man he killed. <br /> <br /> For this movie, Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard deliver much more power. The brave one has a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. This movie can be beautiful, well played, and cute knowing. But it eventually turns out to be fantastic. I donate 1.5 out of 4 of the brave one. The message is outside of the line and morally wrong, and indeed can not be saved by good acting.
