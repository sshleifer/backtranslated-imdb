His embalmed appearance was completely inappropriate for the role. Her appearance remains very white, very coifed in the hair, clothes too clean for any sense of accuracy (and fits well, especially her father's old hat and coat where Inman comes home). If the production allows all other actors to be clean and perfect, it will be one thing, but he is the only one who is not dirty. Her powder cheek was not even a smudge. We believe he gave only the bathtub and mirror in the civil war? She looked like the only one who used them certainly. Membrane, too; I mean, what is that eyebrow? <br /> <br /> <br /> He went to the person only because someone told him that he said that he was intelligent. So, he burns him, then flirts with him more than once, and suddenly it is a love with Odysseus and Penelope? Please <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "English patient". His reaction was similar to Selefeld's Ellen: "It sucked."
