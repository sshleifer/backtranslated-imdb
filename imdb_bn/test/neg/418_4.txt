Why did they follow the book ... I'm really sad and frustrated. I was looking forward to watching this movie, however, if you read the book (maybe recent) it could be very difficult to have the purpose. My wife did not read the book, and she liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The causes of depression are: 1) Karne's involvement ... has gone with the wind, so shame, the very small part where the antimatter is created, it is not compatible with events (why not Vitorian father The first ellipticity was burned with the brand, which was how Langdon was involved, how did it start? Movie 2) (Dead) Pope and Camerlagno have completely gone through the storyline ... It completely influenced the purpose of the antimatter theft. 3) The storyline is not completely contained in the Langdon and Basauria Vitra <br /> <br> All are very horrific stories, and can not understand that Dan Brown has given his name against them. Maybe I can reconsider this movie in 10 years, when I can not remember the wonderful book (the potential for the memory of the book I'm afraid of), <br /> <br /> Sorry for the negative reviews actually, which was lost by hope Done
