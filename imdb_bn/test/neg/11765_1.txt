This movie is basically how "how" it is to be a well-connected podfilefile. I am surprised that many people - especially other gay men - have watched and read the book and somebody has raised the issue that if Weber is not an influential photographer, he will be in prison, child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson Weber was poor, naive (though incredibly handsome) whom he had found in the training camp for middle school high school wrestlers, brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homeotropy photographs, many of them do not have all the art in the teenage years of full publicity. It is child abuse. And what's worse, Weber has made a lot of money from him, and poor Johnson is taking a serious "problem" in his remaining life. The boyfriend's amazing love of the boy is frustrating, as his romp about the famous public (and not famous) people like he is trying to complete Johnson's "education". Curious, and then just boring annoying. What I can say about the film is the only self-sacrificing spirit. But I can not imagine why nobody ever wondered why the effect of "chop swey" (Johnson's nickname) had affected himself.
