What is the world This piece of gambling movie was suitable for Lifetime Network. Michael Imperial is a good actor but I think his "Stu" image has become smaller. Montage was intolerable and a lot. Supporting Cast, where are you? Anybody cutting should be partially wrong. Cinematography was in vain. A gambling story after a school remembered it. This type of story should be left for Oliver Stone in the world. It still sucks ass but at least it will be fun to see it. It lost its wheel before the nation started. The 1983 Indie 500 Mario Andrati thought that.
