The movie, Heaven's Gate, was a good scene, though still tired for 4 hours. But the film gets a great license - naturally with Hollywood James Everill (Chris Christopherson), and "El" actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War, it was started with the hanging. Well, starting with this, I mean it's the beginning, not the end. Here is the original scene: James Everell and Ellen Watson were secretly married because each family can be given a place of residence. As a single person, they can get two accommodation. They prefer homeowners at crazy umman cracks, which actually control the water on the ground kept by the powerful members of the Catalan Association. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any real proof of the truth. It is known that he bought most heads of sick cattle, kept them alive again, and later was accused of taking responsibility for cattle for "painful activity" by the Association of Catalanmen. In the end, she was accused of rape - a law is often untrue. For this part of the mythology of "American West", which has been a fictional tale of a mythical story for almost a hundred years. <br /> <br /> He and Jim Averil were surprised one day, some members of the Catalan Association handed him over to him and immediately hanged him. Victims of injustice have never faced trial. But this was the first link that led to the murder of the Nat Champion. And the start of the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> is quite different from the Hollywood version, which ultimately shows its shot. <br /> <br /> The big problem I think was the film editor, who could make this move faster by writing a more efficient writing.
