This image is interesting only by using its banner and cliches. Sadly it was finally completely obvious to the whole. But it would not be wrong in thinking that it ended firmly. Just a little unexpectedly, though it's nothing valuable to look at. <br /> <br /> From a geographical and perfect hero, to the Germanic side, to the expensive team, the characters were perfectly wooded and clear. Two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (Gididit?) Gave some hope for humor, but nothing has come up. <br /> <br /> I am a great science fiction fan but it is difficult to find any freedom fighter in this film. . A turkey! <br /> <br />
