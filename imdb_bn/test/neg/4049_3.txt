Despite his aspiring ambition, Zurlini's film will be seen as a failure. It is a matter of creating a world that can feel the feeling of the attraction of the audience and the feeling of radioactivity (which I think Zurlini is trying to do). This is another issue that made a movie completely exhausting and meaningless episodic. Despite a beautiful cinematography for a hunting position - and a wonderful score - the movie never attracts the audience. A bit strange (funny words like draggery quadruple water, for example, or some silent-movie actors) or easily confusing (why would Draco leave the fort for the first time?) This film can be successful as a coherent job.
