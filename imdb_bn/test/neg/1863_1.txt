Ghoulies IV begins on a museum storage facility where after PVC and skin-clad blonde Alexandra (Stacy Randall) saved from various guards, he called the angel he worshiped and wanted sex, unfortunately he lost the jewel, so he is not very happy And gave him the command to get the last one ... which is from Jonathan Gray's (Original Horoscope (1985) Peter Lipsis Coming tube) of the actual events and the experience has been captured monster Ghoulies. Alexandra sets Geher to find so that he can permanently return to Earth from 'the other side', actually I do not really know. Im, this is really about ... <br /> <br /> The director of Jim Winnersky, whose name sends down the name of my spine when it is connected to a movie, I'm going to live my 90 minutes on the fourth day of Gilles. As I fully expected, the whole and complete shit started from the beginning and it is as easy and straight forward as possible. Mark Sevier, Ahme, 'script', cough, is not often with the title of other Galile films, and they have been able to satisfy the lipis to regain its role, with which the more additive bonuses to use the footage is from the original, though it is no relevance There are. The story is not nearly existent, a real trick to watch the whole movie, though it is incredibly annoying and foolish, it is slowly expected to be clean, bloody or bloody, as far as clear and it has two comic relief goblin which I suppose will fill the gaping quota They did not see what they did in the previous films and they were really embarrassing to see Actually, I think they are behaving like most of the ventriloquists during the movie when they move their faces Don ... you know that I do not want to talk about Ghuliss IV or think so please believe me that the size of an elephant is huge Do not waste your time or money on the part of it. << br /> <br /> Dictator Vinirski turns out to be a straightforward film on almost every stage, special effects are terrible as a complete movie. Apparently Gholies can be some kind of horror comedy, but it misses the goals of a projected mile, and it's not fun or frightening. The best thing about this picture is trying to find PVC and leather clothing actress Randal and Jewelry and it can not be seen. Half of the few crashes have a decent runway car scene but it has been edited entirely from a different movie and it seems to have been given Wynorski's track record. <br /> <br /> Technically selling the fourth quarter, it is clear that it was in a low budget but this is not an excuse for it to be bad, is not it? Leipis comes back to Caste, but perhaps he wants to stay away, PVC Claude Bob Randall is a very good thing about this picture that is easy to say. <br /> <br /> Gaussis is the fourth whip, there is nothing else to say really. I honestly can not see anyone who enjoys enjoying some of these movies, I can not do it. I can not believe that I would recommend mainstream main Gaulis but now it is going to happen, because that book is even better than the Gholiyasat Chattar, though to avoid people and thank you. Afterwards. The things I'm sitting on do not mean to tell you the truth ...
