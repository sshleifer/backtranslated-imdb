Hey ... I do not really know why this movie got so much praise, I probably missed the point. I can see that many international filmmakers have created great films that work on 'schizophrenia'. Known, excited, shocked, emotional, and forced the audience to move away from their own reality ... and it is true that Aparna Sen's ambition was to have an ambition, in the light of all the other films, this is a short story ... ................................................ .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ....... open end or something .... just point ..... So if you have a good idea See if you want to see it broken ...
