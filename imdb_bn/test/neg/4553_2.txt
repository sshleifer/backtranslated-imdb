This can be the worst movie of my life. Usually I do not see such a movie, but I was forced to visit this school. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Against their love of everything. At the end of the film the film became a bit weird Kung Fu, white boys fought with blacks. Damn it! <br /> <br /> This work is so bad that it lets you laugh. I think that the dance of this movie seems to be so cool, so easy and ridiculous that I can do them too! And Georgina Vardabah is probably the most annoying person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Jhan Nenenhooz is on the way to becoming Dutch ed Wood. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not see movies But if you like to see soap, then your time may be very good. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
