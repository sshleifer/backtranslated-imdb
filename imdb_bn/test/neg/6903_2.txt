It was so annoying! No Plot! Originally a watered-down version of the Lion King mixed with the farm. Again, no plot. Awesome! The worst hour of my life! O my Lord! For a few minutes I have to get out of the theater to get some relief! I'm probably chocolate twice. The semi fun part is all previewed. I hate movies like that. Yes, the movie sucked pretty. I do not know how it got a good rating and reviews. There is no plot or story !! If you go to watch this movie, you can bring you an air or girlfriend / boyfriend to come out. Awful, terrifying. I do not think I've ever been to a movie and loved it for so much. It was good that the ticket cost only five dollars because I would be crazy if I wanted to pay $ 7.50 to see this crazy.
