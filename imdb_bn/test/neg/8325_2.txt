A documentary about these homeless women. It was so interesting that it focused on women who were socially involved - jobs and permanent friendships-but in such a situation they could not afford housing. <br /> <br /> I saw some women interesting, but the story had little focus or progress. Direction and editing failed to maintain my attention. Of course there was a difference in the story of this woman, but the message was the same, and in more depth it can be said by focusing on them. <br /> <br /> I ended up shooting it, but it was rather an annoying journey.
