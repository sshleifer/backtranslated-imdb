Some have described the calgary as its "era" the most controversial film. While it is controversial, it is certainly the most shameful: almost every big name associated with the film has made an effort to remove it from itself. Writer Gore Vidal has actually filed a lawsuit against the film (with mixed results) for the deletion of his name, and when they saw the film their reactions differ from hatred to strategic silence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> CALIGULA was a large box office and critical flop (the producer had to rename the Gucciano's theater), and although the film was released in VHS home market, many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was more than a decade It was widely available for the time being. But now CALIGULIA is in the DVD, edited "R" and available in both "Ordated" versions. And there is no doubt that John Gilgood is delighted that he did not survive it happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say something like Due to Dupe Lynch's Dune, which is a holiday with Fellini. Padahouse publisher Bob Gukakion has fallen into the script of Bhadal, who earned the fame for the project's bank roll and attracted big stars - and then brought out V Vidal's most scripts to soft-porn director Tinto Bras. Then, when Gaxion thinks that Brass's work was not quite clear, he and Zycarlo Luui portrayed hardcore elements on boldness. <br /> <br /> The specter will be surprised to see what the viewers can do, but those who see the original cut quickly realize that it does not leave anything in the imagination. Nudity is an extraordinary amount, and it remains in the edited version, but the original is done with XXX scenes: There is a great orgy with gay, gay, and live sex, strange sexuality and the throwing of Roman guards for good measure. This movie is bloody, incredibly violent and bloody with rape, torture, and increasing violence of the day. In a particularly annoying scenario, a man dies slowly, a woman pisses over her body, and her genitals are cut off and thrown into dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary with the DVD release, Guccien said that he wanted to reflect this movie the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know little about caligula - and the best we know is the best. On the other hand, bleeding and casual sex was not the commonplace of Roman society, where there was a crime punishable by adultery. And of course, ancient Rome looked like a weird, slightly oriental, age set of strange places and designs made by designers. <br /> <br /> Plus, set and costume are often beautifully beautiful and even though cinematography generally judges them; Scores are very, very good. Helen Mirren, the most successful member of Caste, who manages to cooperate with our interests and empathy; Empress Cassonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape the reasonably good form. McDowell can not say the same thing, but there is not much work to do with him in his trial. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great fascination, but eventually it is a strange thing, for this it is more attractive for the content of design and flat-out curiosity. Some of the display companies (including McDowell and Mirren) are very nice and some sex scenes work fine like pornography ... but many of them are very annoying, they may bother you and be bloody. And undercuts his lover of the diverse nature of the photo. If you're on top of it, it's a one-time watch, but it can be enough once. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, Ur GFT, Amazon Reviewer
