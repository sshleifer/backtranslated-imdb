It seems obviously many people have enjoyed this movie, and it's nice. This is certainly a very good movie, and I am thankful that in the era of heartless or emotionally damaged film. Unfortunately, the film has a lot of problems and it was not something to watch. <br /> <br /> The primary problem is writing. It's just not very funny. When something fails to be blurred or malicious and fails, then it is worse than trying to get it intelligent. This film comes back into a great degree of "smart" family member, of which no one seems imaginative or appropriate. There are also some central premises in the film that extend the motivation of the cacti or character to make a realistic or true work. The back story looked a bit more compelling, and they worked quite well for the sake of storytelling, but it did not create a little momentary flatness in almost all the movies at the moment. <br /> <br /> The direction / editing does not support the film well, although I can not explain properly. Somehow things were always rather fake than mine, and for the most part of the actors were forced through the irrelevant elements. They try, and I do not blame any one person here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I suspect that perhaps more than 60 people can enjoy this movie more?).
