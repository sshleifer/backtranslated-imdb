I really like playing far away games, excellent graphics, well-level designs, attractive and cute foes, above average length and even somewhat decent plots. I'm not the default against movie movie spin off. I thought "to the movie" was ridiculous. But what Uwe Bowel has done here is to accept the game and correct every good aspect of it and make them a bit scary (not good length, the film only runs graceful 90 minutes), more stereotypical than characters, which is a great achievement. The whole plot is called without any twists or mysteries. Several ridiculous funny scenes tell you every bit of the story. And come "genetically modified soldiers"? They might bring some good names <br /> <br /> However, this image will get some rewards for the most stupid love scene. I have not seen anything like that. I was not convinced that they were trying to get serious "we'll get out of wet clothes" "I think I can get Hypotharmia" (though everyone wearing T-shirts) "Our body needs to be gathered for warmth" Is this your gun? "But ... but who did not do this work consciously there? There should be a writer, a director, actor, a gaffer, a power station, some food people! Why did not anyone enter this scene to prevent this recession? This film is fierce , Inhuman, genetically modified film? I started to get annoyed about how many logical errors, inconsistencies and scripts writing It will not be humiliating even to the deadly worker-fan. <br /> <br /> This image actually asked 2 ratings out of 10, so I will do it for you, but the second star It comes from me to explain where the special effect? ​​Actually, it is not actually the reference of the game? You want them to wait and use the font from the game for title and credit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
