The main social message of this movie - despite the surveillance that is not acceptable to prosecute - is logical, in the last statement of McConnagai, I was humiliated. In the courtroom drama, the last statement of defense attorney is much more than the film's crooks, and when this problem becomes difficult to solve, the speech is distributed to the jury as well as the audience. It basically means that viewers think a black girl is a more serious crime than a rape than a rape of a black girl. I find this too insulting for one. For the rest, I'm acting logical, in addition to Sandra Bulkak, who thinks of excluding his usual bubbles (actually not working in the courtroom drama), but when the message of the movie is poor as one of these. It tells you that the verdict is justified, and if you disagree, then accuse you of racialism.
