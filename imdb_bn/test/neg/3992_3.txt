Similarly, Lamberto Bava was his father, Mario (who was a very direct manager, was less than that), Murli Sovi Dario was the lowest director of Argentine Mold. "Church" has at least one thing to recommend it - incredibly detailed industrial direction - but absolutely nothing else. The film is filled with long winds, one dimensional character, and almost a lot of time I wake up sleeping. There is a fine line between 'Art' and 'Pretreatious Brepe', and when "The Church" is not completely worthless, you'll be better off looking at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
