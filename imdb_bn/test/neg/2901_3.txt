After following the 1980 blue-style "The Revenge of the Enga", this bizarre suggestion was 'treated' and mixed with ninja shenanjanins about spiritual possession. The end result is not different in nature. An awesome experience when someone is at risk of being inside the public swimming pool, a jolt inside the public awakens. For example, say 'action packed' role that is set up everywhere in a golf course (!) Here we are giving a group of golfers a blasphemy condemnation for the apparent cause of the gang, (although I must I would like to admit that the shallow elitist attitudes adopted by many participants of these special games make me somewhat irk ... hmmmm probably why he killed them Did? ..... yes I can relate to that after all). Indeed, later in the film we are told that one of the golfer was a top scientist but the line of this story is never mentioned and never ordered! However, to return to the introduction, the police surrounds the golf course and shoots the whole hell from the killers .... and he will be shot because he will not be there !!! Yes, hundreds of rounds have literally been pumped, and so far he can not kill all the law enforcement figures. Finally (after feeling eternity) our miscreants exploded the bomb and vanished ... .. or it seems, in fact he is just hiding under the ground and outside our unarmed pregnant officers. He is hidden and torn to search for the body. <br /> <br /> We later play a telephone repairer, a beautiful actress here and a beautifully beautiful Lusina diy in the physical condition. From his high advantage point he will lead to the death spot (latest last !!!!!) Nizam. However, after a close investigation, the man suddenly jumped on his last leg and put him on the ground. After a few struggles, our disciplined heroine fortunately tries to destroy, but does not depend on Nigazata having hypnotic power and she inevitably surrenders to them. Nina's death at this moment really inspires our soul into our heroine! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There have been some very scary cinematic scenes of search! <br /> <br /> The more complicated, especially the boring police officer (who keeps the average yak for a lot of shame and shoulder hair shy!) trying to win in his love (most bloody annoying !!!) ..... Well, at the end of the picture, in a weak 'Shock' (short) twist, the prelude gift is not accepted, he is the one who must be killed by the officer! <br /> <br /> But still have some hopes to wait! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, To learn how to travel quickly and learn the events sent there, it flies all the way from Japan to solve the situation (the worst suspicion!) In a short novel (which is a fraction of a few seconds!), It has been proven to be private interest in this particular discipline Sholay's father / teacher (?) Has been killed and Sh Our eyes have been blinded (thus needing to look really decorating a watch surveillance eye patch!) <br /> <br /> After stealing the body of his dead body from Magbazar and finding our heroine, the unwanted habitat for evil spirits Provides, they are filled in an oriental temple (probably somewhere in the middle) where our people sho re-disjointed direction Milan managed. <br /> <br /> Now reanimated from the dead, fighting it with the sword with the winner of the evil Ninja and Sho traditional ninja style ........ Good. Yes you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> There are really just two things going on for this movie, such as always the best quintesse (who always looks really good at the role) and lovely Miss Diki. <br/> <br /> Good to be nice, I saw worse than my time, although I still can not recommend except those who are desperate to complete their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections.
