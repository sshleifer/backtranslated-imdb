With NBC's "Thanks you are here" the network is trying to repeat ABC's Impossible City.com success, "Who is it is yaw?" In a host, Drake Kerry will judge the performance of some regular customs asking for improvements in what kind of scene. At the NBC Show, Dave Folie and co-host Dave Allan Greyer supervised a significant number of famous comedians, who need to improve their path through various scenes, which started "Thank you God are here." It takes too much importance (why the audience should be reminded again and again that the actor has never seen the set before), both co-hosts seem to be less encouraged. After watching the sub-parallel series consistently after making an unconscious attempt to make some hilarious action, I am amazed that realists are willing to be happy, or they are also making improvements. This time the slot filler expects to be a very short living.
