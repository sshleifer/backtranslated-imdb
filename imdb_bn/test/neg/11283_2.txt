Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish movies with an amateur cast, ice cream, I like Scrum sincerity more like a caricature <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Cream sellers in the city of Western Anatolia, where he is making himself successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies. He dreams of his product's TV commercial playing with the beautiful models of bikinis, dancing around him. When her dream became nightmare, she woke up with a big building beside her elder wife who, for 6 years, refused to have sex with him for any objection. Because he is not successful in his job? Apparently, because he said that he was selling well in the old days while refraining from the pressure of ice cream companies worldwide. But this is what he says; We actually do not suffer much from him: he still sells good, travels to neighboring village, when his apprenticeship is in the shop, sells ice cream to the city. Ali is blaming big companies for using sweet and color agents when he is truly using "sahlep" (powder root of the mountain orchid). Ali likes to buy a motor bike with a bank loan as a travel dealer, and even the news bulletin broadcasts in the local dialect which gives advertisements to a local TV channel. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, he always quarrels, and Ali threatens him that he can do something very bad at a ridiculous moment. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his shy bike was stolen by the city's infamous little boys. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames big companies for theft, but of course, no one cares about him. Hated his wife hated, Ali became drunk in an inside. A friend of his desk, a socialist socialist in the city, gives a secular lecture and criticizes globalism and promotes the issue of submitting worldwide with a real connection. Ali decided to return home and kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents her. An elderly neighbor advised him to walk the night and give advice about life. According to him, Ali could sell hot sahape drinking water while facing the global temperature. When he returned home, suddenly we saw his wife realized his worth, treated him like a hero and praised his childhood. Meanwhile, thieves were sick of eating very sick ice cream. They admitted to the doctor that they steal Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and brings happiness to the end. <br /> <br /> While the plot can be committed in a way, it is a story-story that disrespects the film and makes sugar. First, the director apparently does not show much of an effort to tell stories; Everything is based on the dialog. And the dialogues have never shown that the movie is actually a visual industry. Even Ali's problem is not believable because we can not see it, we understand only from his words. The director kept his film market on Ali's religious war against big ice cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. We do not see enough of their pressure. This film actually ridicates Ali because the big companies are behind the theft. And when its motorbike is found, it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism globally. <br /> <br /> Because of the strange humor that the movie is, Chasey. Perhaps people are cursing such a part of Turkey and making so much rage in their daily lives, but pornographic language and strange humor is not enough to make a movie fun. Although they were both obscene and "tricky" I could have accepted it but they are not cute, they are just chessy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe American people might prefer the oriental version of American Pie Style humor. But the American pie was never claimed to be nominated for the Oscars or for any political message! If you think that you can only smile at a man's big building at his shorts (and we had to bear this jaw twice!) Or an elderly villager says "You are **," then you can see this picture funny.
