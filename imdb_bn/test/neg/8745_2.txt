I think you can talk about the potential crop of this movie, but nothing else is because the filmmakers throw it out to the filmmakers. The plot is virtually unknown, pacing is neutral and the actress is unhappy. What is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, the measurement of this film is anticlimax anticlimax; Plus title does not even seem to be remote correct. The only freedom fighter in this movie is the beautiful dark-haired woman ... well, the blonde girl was pretty beautiful, but she was nervous and she was not good to see. Anyhoo, with so many movies, this one will only meet MST3K.
