I'm usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and despite playing cold-hearted professional killer, I think he is the most attractive character here. That said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it is incredible he was not caught before. The plot is unclear point thin. Finally, in the 20 minutes it can not be predicted in the movie until it was not boring and objectionable. <br /> <br /> ** Following the threat ** In Hollywood morality, good people always win Some people are killed along the way, and bad people die, or at least till the end is moving towards justice. The frenetic humiliation of the film is our ERA terrorist, which has suddenly become the character of an eccentric, sensitive character, it can lead a new life. As his former terrorist player (who now is a loving wife and mother) <br /> <br /> Who is the big villain? Former (and, as far as we can say, abductors) terrorist, or tenant killer? I can not see much to choose between them in real life or movies. <br /> <br /> I saw the poorest movie of this year.
