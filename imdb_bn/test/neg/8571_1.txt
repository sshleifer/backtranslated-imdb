Review: Nunsploitation films. They have been almost forever. Maxwell devil movies Alicardas worship, Night of the Damons 2, Convent, and of course Dante Tomaselis Disikation, pop some of the minds. Blame someone for trying to absorb a religious / sacred image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. The most recent addition to the Nunnopoitation sub-clause here is the title of the novel only. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls who live in Catholic school. A school in this school is particularly cruel. Acting girls defend themselves against Nun and accidentally killed him and then decided to bury him and not tell anyone. After 18 years, go ahead and go back to salt who are searching for his killed revenge. <br /> <br /> This movie is produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, Spain makes awesome movies. Does this company need a reminder of slow movies? Well heres a short reminder: Arachnid, Dark, Romasanta: Wayroll Hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture Stuart Gordon Dagon (in my opinion) about the only real movie made by this company. That's it. Oh no, wait, I believe they produced fantastic Christian Bale Car Machinist. But that's it. So when I hired this movie consciously, I knew that I was going to see something which was very good at heart. Yet, the mental preparedness that I was disappointed with. <br /> <br /> This movie is the only good thing that's going on for its shiny look. The movie has some excellent cinematography. It does not look like a cheap horror film. The film's special effect was right, salt was able to travel with water. Well, this is an image that was spontaneous for some cool FX moments, sometimes in the Chess region, but it was quiet enough to see it sometimes. I threw myself off like a water bucket in the scene with Nun. It's not a particularly fatal step, but it's made for a cool visual. Here are some gore but it does not do much. A special scene involving the death of the lift was cool, but sadly this scene was top of the movie. And through it it was only half way. After that, nothing is really cool and the film deludes in the incredible borefest. <br /> <br /> The movie is popping up in just now the salt and then to give us a fear of fear, he will kill anyone and then cut it! We get back to the ballroom, get through the room, open the door, you get drill. And I'm just hated it when it's active in a horror movie. People are going to open doors and in the rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak its horrible dialog. In a special stupid scene, a character decides on the right side of the blue that when salt drinkers drink water then they become flesh and blood, so that they can try and kill him. And everybody is okay to say okay! And they all plan this plan for killing salt in water tank. Now, who gave this information to this person and why did others accept it for granted? Who knows, but his scenes think that movie is stupid. <br /> <br /> And this image got another thing in my way of enjoying that they used the Spanish actor. A very thick pronunciation When they try to speak in English, they understand what they are trying to say. ID likes to dubbing them then try and think what they are saying and frustrated. This DVD does not have any English subtitles but it also does not help issues. <br /> <br /> So, conclusion, it's a movie which has some quick scenes, excellent sound effects but a terrible terrible scripts. I think it will show you that you have the biggest budget or the best effect, but if your movie has a bad script with such great characters and situations that are not connected to your audience, then you still have a bad movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />, now, for the makers of this movie, they will have ten rock jewel and light fifty candles to their favorite child to see if they will be forgiven for making these sinful terrible movies. <br /> <br /> Rating 5 out 2.
