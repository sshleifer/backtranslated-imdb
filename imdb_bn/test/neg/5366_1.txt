I was excited to see this show while I started watching A & E promotions. I was a ghost and supernatural, because I was a kid, and when I love it with "Ghost Hunters" (SciFi Channel) I have tried to see three episodes of "Paramormal State" and it is used only for commenting on my time because it is so bad and this concept is permanent that anyone who believes in abnormal is unclear. "Abnormal state" is beyond fat. Chess "Director's Log" voice-overs that you would like for Captain Kirk. Cesy teasers are going to break the commercial that is taking the context of the break. All of these unusual abuses are considered to be "evil" and act in a demonic spirit. Then outgoing, demonologists, psychology ... like "Poltergeist" you almost leave the party and hope "clean this house." Come to come. I greatly appreciate the "ghost hunters" method, where they go to dismiss claims, then they can remove what they do ... and they are almost always optimistic about the client (if they find anything) that is not the worst evil. "Unusual state" "It's not too good to be bad" ... it's just plain bad. AR was not standing for "Arts and Entertainment"? The art part has gone long, and the entertainment factor is now waning as of now.
