It's the most evil, silly, and non-peaceful films I've ever seen. The Israeli representation was racist, chasing and wrong. For one, when the song was dragged along with the right-hander Israeli driver on ES'ER radio radio, "I had a spell on you" by "Natural Alastas". The song style is mostly Arabic, but it was released from an Israeli compilation CD and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food, and mosaic) are influenced by Arabic culture, and there is no reason that an Israeli Jew would be offended or angry by a nearby car playing the song. The ES is way too long to calm, still shows calm with its sunglasses and cool shiny, and appears to be gathered, as viewers are shocking and racist, and ES is forced to see visitors. <br /> <br /> I traveled all over Israel, and I did not see the IDF recruitment poster because the service is mandatory. But the film does not have only an employer poster, but it is an Arab terrorist stereotyptical image and "Want to shoot a shot?" It was not the mentality of most Israeli soldiers and an "advertisement" on the Random Israeli highway. In addition to this, the director wanted to satisfy the audience that atrocities against Israel on a massacre of anti-Arab racist society. <br /> <br /> The Nija scene was undesirable and unreasonably violent. A Hollywood-style action-involving Israeli army shot by Palestinians should not be viewed as a disguised scene just like the Israeli-directed film. But for some reason, pictures of an unreal, non-comic and violent scenes cause visitors to express their appreciation, since the director reminds Israeli side of it so much that any shots of Israel's soldiers will be welcomed. The director does not fully try any effort, constructing the bridge, portrays human as "another", or works towards peace; Violence is the only solution. It is influenced by explosive tank scenes, fall of guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends works in Israel's military and the aim of the firing range is never black in the eyes of Arabs, or any other civilian canvas. On the checkpoint the soldiers were instructed that until the head reached the Palestine until it returned, it is clear that their own lives are dangerous. According to my friend, the procedure is a warning, screaming around the air or around the area, and then when all fails, the legs are shot and then interrogated and admitted to the hospital. It is shown in the film that aiming to deliberately target women on the head is not the right method. <br /> <br /> The guidelines were also poor besides these errors. Repeat resurfaces, and no longer concentrate. Symbols, such as balloon drawn by Arafat, are forced outside the effective integration of a plot structure or setting; Balloon sharpen Palestine and return to Jerusalem, and it is the E.S. The Israeli troops have made a check for permits and follow the Israeli ambulance flying near the checkpoint of the ambulance. This is an Israeli dual criterion director. The attempt to show the life of director Nazareth as a bit and vain is completed by overkill; Occasionally with little change even random people are shown routine and even a member of humor can never laugh and shout with the purpose of these scenes as the minimum in the conversation, allowing many rooms for personal explanation without shamelessness of life. A "division" of the film, with daily life of Nazareth in daily life, director with Ramallah and the checkpoint between Israel, this instruction blames this neutrality in Israel, but does not provide any direct evidence that such a fault can be done properly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I spent hours trying to figure out how many hours I had finished singing and started strangers Why do so many modern metal-cutting action shows and fashion shows were included in the score track. I still can not come up with an answer. I felt that there was no music in this movie; The contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was not really annoying and affected or thought-provoking. I understand that if the director wants to provide some comic views for some scenes, but I have seen that there is no comic in the targets or targets of Israeli soldiers, or if a woman has to walk on the other side of a checkpoint, defiantly In fact, I was tempted to stop my ears in an acute scene, and was bothered by the lack of score during the quiet scene. Whatever the director's intention, it only provides an audial dissatisfaction across the film. <br /> <br /> This film does not have any valid political message because it ignores others' wrong and extreme representations and in reality does not solve any problem. This is a promotional film, because the director is willing to show sympathy for Palestine in different symbols, styles and scenes when the Israeli party is shown as innocent and ruthlessly ruthless; Through every step of violence against the Israelis by the Palestinians, dynamic things of dynamic music or fierce songs are displayed, so that the positive and thrilling feelings of music and movies from the audience are often directed at one. No thought, reflection, or understanding of the conflict by the audience is deep; Emotions are simply pulled aside, and put there in a good "bad versus" clich√© scenario. I believe this film does not have the depth, quality and power of other Palestine films such as "Paradise Nieu" and "Gayle in the Galilee".
