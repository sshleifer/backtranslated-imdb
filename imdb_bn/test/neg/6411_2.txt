Good <br /> <br /> Carrie is the best actor and proved it in "Man of the Moon" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mines". But hey, what an actor can do without good stories and exact instructions. He can do "number 23". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " What he did with Batman is just a catastrophe, but perhaps Batman films look good. Well, they're not. Instead we got Disneyland in Gothic and Macbre. Of course, "foling down" was great but would you ruin the film with Robert Duval and Michael Douglas and with a nice script? No you can not <br /> <br /> And the good actors and poor directors finally got together "number 23" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But ... Fingerling's sub-plot (almost half of this movie) is just like another article in Max Payne 2. Voiceover, quality of intelligence, quality of character, even color, mood and music, editing and mixing sound! Perhaps it works for the game, but of course it is not in the movie. <br /> <br /> Myse N scene is so bad that it's fun. It's not even annoying. Park the car to walk down the carriages? Why? Is it normal? No, but it looks good. Why is the society covered with dark white paper in his apartment? If he wants to kill himself? There is no logic, but it still looks good. It seems, it does not look good at all. It looks rather unattractive. <br /> <br /> All female letters flat. Why is that so? K Care, let's go with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this fingerling? Personal eye to suicide? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Walter Sparrow is debating his wife about the weather book, the scenes may actually be the best part of this movie. Instead we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Frustration <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But V.O. What about Well that's another story. "There is no such thing as luck. There are only different choices". Captain obvious recovered! "The number is coming after the fingerring, and now it's coming after me." Footstool And so <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> successfully and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The main character of the dog subplot dragging in the graveyard. It was so much old technique and so comfortable on the side of the author, and it should have been banned. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The edit is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie, just like the last episode of Flashbacks and X-files. It's <br /> <br /> <br /> I can say that this story is good luck, but not so. I do not understand it. Chronological order is called weak and incredible. Leaked unused letters are always the chain of situations that are nothing but bad written fiction. It may be fun, but - the whole movie is deadly deadly - it's not. Many coincidences are just bad for each story. And "mystery"? It is easy to guess and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> The frustration with the reality is a great theme for good movies, but I have never seen it in Hollywood productions. If you are interested in this, Polanski's "Suppression" or some of David Krenberg's "Spider" or "History of Hollons" both wanted to show "Numbers 23" related to the same problems. Wanted, but failed.
