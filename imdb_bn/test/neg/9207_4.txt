Although there is not really much depth in the letters, the story is funny and generally okay with the one who is good, with the best. <br /> <br /> The second half begins to get worse, not just for the character of the film, but also for the audience, the story is basically waiting for its obvious edge. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br>> Well, please let me re-write it again: "It gets a boy girls story, they roam the car, the thrill goes away because it is very clear how everything will be developed, in this film Onao scenes not seen her laugh suddenly, feeling some little 80 and yes, he was director Jonathan demame really.
