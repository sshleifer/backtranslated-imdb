After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of tens of thousands occupied the Steady Alive, a bloody survival video game, based on the horror stories of Ibizet Bathery, popularly known as Blog Countess. This group started playing a great game. Soon they killed the same character in the same way, as they played in the role of the game. Once the line and reality disappears in the game, our heroes must find ways to defeat harmful blood poets. "Steve Alive" is an incredibly poor tin slasher flight which is incredible without any mystery. Waiter-director William Brent Bell has no surveillance on how to make a clockable horror movie. The fear of jumping is irritating, the blood / cow's layer is almost unattainable and the story is not understood. The conversation is very bad and everyone involved is acting ashamed. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream Flickr of 2006. Stay away from this boring Turkish.
