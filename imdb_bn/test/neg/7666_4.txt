Concord ... Airport '79 begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (McCannman) is the owner and president of Harrison Industries, his boss Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner) for keeping secret documents with Magnificent TV profile reporter Maggie Velan (Susan Blakley) The armed forces that have developed arms for them, illegally sell arms to foreign countries But Maggi killed Carl and she just escaped with his life, Maggi was caught in Moscow's Concord in Paris on the morning of the next morning, and there is a desire to blow up a whistle of Harrison, which could be her boyfriend, who would destroy her. Testing for the prevention and destruction of high-technology 'buzured' homing missiles and destruction at Concorde Participate and destroy documentary evidence ... <br /> <br /> Named Airport '80 - Concorde's movie and primary home video releases, because it was published here instead of 1979. Directed by David Lowell Rich The latest entry of the franchisee was conducted and a notorious bad movie that clearly smiles and smiles during press screening, which is universal As the action-comedy encouraged to preach. The first thing to say is that the Concord ... Airport '79 is a genuinely brutal and cruel film, but with complete entertainment, I can spend a lot of time watching 108 minutes watching a lot of bad films, I can really do it. Before I can reveal him as an illicit artist, I want to kill a TV reporter, but I like the strange plot about a rich industrialist, but this guy does not work fine and he decides the best way to blow Concord with him. There are three mini-disaster flickr each time to save the pilot every day so that its own guided missile and then a fighter warrior can finally get it down and shoot before trying to destroy it. You know George Kennedy plays Jose Kannadi, who played Jose Cannidae in the film, and the Concord pilot is going from Extintinner's first mechanic, I also think he is a bit of jeans because of his involvement with four years of nine years. I think why the airport series was closed here because Patroni retired and lifted jeans after this. The thing that's happening here is only silly, Patroni Barrel rolls out, finds a guided missile of a huge concrete man and destroys it and destroys its window missile. When to keep a cool head This guy is good, very good. Then there is the character, playing a saxophone black child who washed the towels in the toilets, an elderly woman with bladder problems and a group of Russian organisms with bad signs. Also, despite being shot around with a missile and attacked by a jet fighter, Concorde passengers do not feel disturbed and do not feel happy to come back the next day, I do not know about you, but then I'll probably find the safe way to travel Police or authority does not ask anyone? Why Concord's captain Patroni is allowed to sleep with and sleep with French prostitute only? Concord ... Airport 779 is certainly not annoying and full of memorable moments and it was entertained in a way even though it is far from a good movie and modern viewers can not have patience with it, in hell I liked it but it was a great way It's not that kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Although the Concorde is not flying yet, it is still very plane-plane and there are lots of footage here, a Concord used in it ... Airport '79 VII was built. The Concorde was the same aircraft that broke the accidental fuel tank and on 25th July 2000, the burning fuel burned down, but accidentally 109 passengers and crew and 4 people died. On the ground. As it was broadcast on TV in the United States in 1982, the new 20-minute new footage was originally included, if it did not take all the new shots two years after the end of the original production. I know here take a bashing to the maximum of the effects, but when I think this is made in the end of the 70s when I do not feel too bad I think they've seen quite well. While the cameras are dominant during the shots, the actual footage of the original aircraft used to be used in the toy model, which makes my opinion very bad and I would certainly see that the manufacturers are trying to do with limited money and limited technology. A curious way is quite impressive, without looking good that they actually know what you mean. Perhaps the most action missions in all airports of the airports, explosion aircraft, horror crash landing, murder and Robert Palmer (not a singer) are giving a woman up to a woman. <br /> <br /> IMDB said that it had a budget of about $ 14,000,000 which was more than I actually thought, probably its special effects are not so impressive all the time later. In Ottawa, Washington, Los Angeles and France, shot. Acting is not great here, people are so mortal that they are not about to die. Garage Kennedy got some bad one-liners, Robert Wagner played the bad guy. <br /> <br /> Concord ... Airport '79 All the bad movie enthusiasts everywhere I find fun and cruel to be honest, I rather see this entertaining mess, more than two hours of Oscar nominated bonus.
