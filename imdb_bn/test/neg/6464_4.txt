Very long ago, I bought a cheap VHS tape titled "West Rambling Along", which was supposed to be Laurel and Hardy. Not familiar with their output and without recognizing this title, I decided to take part in the whole dollar and buy it annoying by buying it. After playing it, I've marked this photo as Hop-to-IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was in customary nowhere, making this product packaging criminally fraudulent. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It seems that it was duped from an 8 mm film source. It was a somewhat suitable musical score. Indeed, in all seriousness, the tape is valuable, if you just want to get an idea like a movie. In my opinion, it is a decent but unexpected brief. IMDB must add ramblazing as an alternative title for this film, which was eventually named the Stan Laurel film in 1918!
