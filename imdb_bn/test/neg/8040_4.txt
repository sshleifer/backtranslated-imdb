First seen on 10/29/2006 - 4 of 10 (D-John Stephenson): A group of five kids gently entertaining stories, who were forced to fight with their parents and worked in their first World War. England entered the war. It is said to them, do not go to the Greenhouse of uncle's palace, of course they work over the over and they discover a sand elf, who wish their daily wishes that only the end is before the sun goes away. This "IT" is mentioned in the title, created by Jim Henson Group and voice by Eddie Ezard. The problem is that their desire usually comes with other problems that they are supposed to learn from. This section of the movie is not done very well because it is probably the children, primarily the character of Freddy Haimo, can not learn from them but instead of going back to "it" to solve the next big problem. "IT" is not nearly funny, because it's not really the chance to improve the comedian Eddie Ezard and Kenneth Branga is lost as an unbridled uncle, though he is the best character. As far as the child's ability to play is good, but the imagination was probably going on in the field of fiction, but there was also a human story, which probably led to confusion with filmmakers. So, above all, it was a good movie but could be a lot better.
