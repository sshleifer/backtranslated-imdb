This picture was not so bad that the story went away, but the camera's work makes it hard to see. I do not like the so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done this day; Do you know - type-jumping off-center, panning around, etc. Especially I was excited about this picture, though it was mixed with some black and white frames in each scene and mixing something new. I believe the film would be even better if the camera work was shot in more conventional ways because I could not concentrate on it and instead found the analysis of camera work. Maybe more people express dissatisfaction with the camera work, as these filmmakers finally get hints.
