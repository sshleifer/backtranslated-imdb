The storyline will be very useful in many errors and irrational sequences. Jolie's acting is quite flat and poor, Washington is right, the rest are cardboard cutouts. Somehow this film almost ooges mediocrity almost everything. Plot is lam. I like this picture very little or rarely, the culprit is about the original method of the accuser to end his victims. Technical details are the most distant CSI 'Knowledge' and worse than the Zizmos and half the film is a wonderful, if the director takes care of even more detailed credibility. (Later some spellars!) I mean, an EKG instrument with a dry sun wave, reflecting the heart's heart, is a quadruple with full body muscle spamm and a working hand fingers, sure. A murderer pays a man in the heart while keeping him alive, allowing him to devote to the rat and after that the rats face the mouse! What's that with all the stupidity? Then there are several continuations, but you can find here somewhere in IMDB, I find it a shame even to my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Time wasted time. There are still 4 out of 10 to kick my girlfriend.
