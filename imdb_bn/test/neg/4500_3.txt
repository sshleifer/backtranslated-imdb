Gamma v. Virus was made lazy and most of the time it is suffering from it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Space aliens have tried to get down to earth and gamara stopped. So they sent another ship which led to the kidnapping of two young boys. Then the aliens control Gama and bring him to attack mankind. <br /> <br /> At first I must say that I have finally enjoyed the giant war between gamers and viruses. The brothers look like a big squid with a beak. He has no strength and does not have any rays, but he can stop the upper part of his head to create a sharp point. So it is not a bad giant for the overall war of gamma and it is appropriate. The brothers really hit Gamma seriously and put him under his sarees under his shell and I am surprised that the gamers could survive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs. Bhasra decided to use the footage from the previous gamer film, for this picture. They see war between gamers and barugoons and gamers and Gauss when the aliens see gamers in the past. But when they showed the battle of Gamma with Gauss, they first showed war between Gamma and Gauss in the city, then they showed the final war between the two. After showing the re-footage of the final war between Gaimera and Gauss, they show the first battle between Gamma and Gauss !!! Talk about non-sequential order warfare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The order to attack him in Tokyo. So they see the scene from "Gamera v Barbun" where he destroyed the dam. This is a huge problem for me after the show scene of "Gamma the Engineer". Mainly because of the fact that "gamera unbeatable" was black and white !!!! The use of stock footage from a black and white film to a color film is really lazy and it is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Dubbing is also bad again. It's so annoying for two kids, but it would be nice to see the image of a guamera that does not involve little kids. <br /> <br /> Another gamara movie footage on the use of the ban. The final battle is horrible so basically I skipping the final ten minutes and watching this film observers. The rest have already been seen.
