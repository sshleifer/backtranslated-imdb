How good is it to describe it on TV on the perverted criminals? And I do not mean show COPS; Here, they are actually being presented as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see any remedial value on this show unless you see the opposite reaction to human crises. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; A star which Bobby Brown helped pull from the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing short of life than a criminal. Why do you see him Whitney Whitney will not stand beside her how terrible? The couple should be locked and it is making money for them and their character is the human waste which sees the meaning of septic tank and their corrupt meaning and money correction.
