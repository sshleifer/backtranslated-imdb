Franco Troft's "Mississippi Siron" was a helpless plot. Screen suspension suspension requires too much elasticity. The plot went at a glacial speed. It started in an interesting setting but soon after being rational or intelligent, it was the turn of Melendram's foxes. What were the critics? This one is even overrated to be described as a damaged. Even Catherine Denwhoe, who was impressive in "The Grave of the Cherub Burger" and "Bell Do Jar", he was just boring. <br /> <br /> We also rented this movie when we rented another trophy film. We first saw it, and it is so bad that we sent another invisible at the same time.
