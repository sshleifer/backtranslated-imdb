I enjoy watching Robert Forster. This movie was the main reason to rent. I wanted to see a story where there is no place in the middle where the characters can do good work to each other with some kind of confusion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I dropped the movie. I could not be interested in letters. I would not be interested in stories that were not acceptable anywhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I stopped it. I'll rate 4 movie reviews out of 10. It certainly falls under the mandatory 7 ratings, which makes the film suitable for viewing.
