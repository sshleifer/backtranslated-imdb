Aussie Shakespeare 18-24 set. With blood, blood and blood. Good levels of nudity These level levels will not be for each, violin for some very cheap for most. They try and do the best in low budget but it only works in spadical. And this Macbeth seems a lack, it's not just compulsory. Although there are some good performances in most of the part, especially Macbeth does not have a head. The best performance came from Gary Sweet and Kinky Mick Molly. If you see it in Shakespeare, but if you want to have your cheese mature you will like it. This is not a bad movie, but it's not good. Sam Peckenpah will like it, that it is pictured as a Western. I had much hope from this, I liked the Romer stomper. But it was an empty attempt.
