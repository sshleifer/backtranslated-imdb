(Spoilers may contain) This episode is the epitome of curiosity. I hope it's fun for a movie so bad to rent it. However, I can not yet determine whether this image was intended for scary or ridiculous purposes. It combines emotions in a rather annoying way. Apparently this is trying to be tricky but actually it is not. For example, when a knife goes out and tries to kill a teacher, it starts playing happy music. When we go to Toccico, we're up to bit, Kossi-Mister. Roger Neighborhood Song However, when the little baby's "blood" falls, and when he finds the foot, he dreams, it can obviously be tense. So, watch this movie and decide for yourself. It is very strange to describe in words and for this I say, Kudo. <br /> <br /> "Dude dive ... wow!"
