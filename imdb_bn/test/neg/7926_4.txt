Cycano's first expression: live action movie trailer (visible on YouTube), "Wow, maybe this might be one of the best live-action animation adaptations." <br /> <br /> This time I was wrong! Simply tell, the live-action cycun movie was a puzzle that lost the number of pieces; <br/> <br /> * Story * <br /> <br /> The story of the movie oddly follows Anime and Monga, but the story of the movie is just a car, rather than a complete automobile frame. It seems that many parts of the story are largely omitted, changed, or completely changed. Actually the last mang or anime is completely different from the end. <br /> <br /> Particularly the characters; There was a lot left or a different feeling. The relationship between Foumy and Suezier is telling Shuja because she's a video store lady. Chise's character felt very strong already and said only infamous I'm sorry the movie a few times. Sue can be said the same. We kept on shaking the lead, singing and chewing of a tall, tall man. Other characters like Tetsu and Akamie were different to them. Probably more attention was given to the reduction and pulling of other characters, the quiche and the sue, which did it. The way is too much. Expect a lot of sweet action scenes like those of the trailer? No good Trailer plus a few minutes, the only amount you'll get to action. Before watching this movie, I browse this movie, I think I've got regular Asian romance drama. <br /> <br /> Pacing was very fast way. In the film we see the famous scene of Sees with small shrimp and a chain gun arm, in less than nine minutes. There is very little time to know the letters and connect them. What they did was divided into two films, even a triangle. If it is not there many things will be changed or omitted. <br /> <br /> Again, the film behaves like a frame. Anime was a complete automobile because all the small details and these are small, they could really add up. <br /> <br /> * Production * <br /> <br /> - Visuals - Visuals are frustrating. So special effects CGS turned out to find quite fat. Sorry, they were like those who found the Sci-Fi Channel movie. They are not bearable and for the effect of this movie. <br /> <br /> - Music was the average of music. It was really no theme except the Orchestral background music. The picture has reduced the addiction song that Shuja was always threatened. Although the song is a noticeable piece, the last song, the trailer sounds. Do not have a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It is embarrassing that it has not been integrated into the movie itself or the orchestral version of the song. <br /> <br /> -Casting-cycling welding was so. The main star was Chase actor Aki Maeda, who is most famous for his role in the War Royale Film. The actors were very good at playing Shuvo, but they picked up the glasses from the main character. Oh yes and Tetsuo looks like a third lupine. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what I have heard from some others, live action action was not bad that Saikano played. I feel rather blamed that the story has been fixed and the series has been crammed into just two hours of film. <br /> <br /> * What can you learn from Live Action Cycano: * <br /> <br /> - CGI- I really want to guarantee that CGI was not that bad. But even that, we could have acquired some more battle scenes! Perhaps the most anticipated live-action animated adaptation Neon Genesis is not likely to be affected due to the impact of the Weaata studio. <br /> <br /> -Marginism- Fumumi owns a video shop. Chase used an audio cassette player to listen to music and Shuizi tapped a mixture for her birthday. Why? This image was made in 2006! Not only the reality of the movie, they can create things like Chase, so it can not be in the 90's! Future CDs, DVDs and MP3 Players Age Hopefully in Evangelian, Shinji will be a Sony Walkman MP3 player. There is no one who plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> Story and Pensing - As mentioned earlier, the movie Saikona has been removed very quickly and the story has forced many details to be removed. It is a smart step to make Evangelion in a solid triangle, to ADV Films and to anyone else, so this story allows more time to recover as much as possible the original truth. <br /> <br /> - Workers- Most leave the character design alone and let's say those classic quotes! What did the live action of Evangelion Asuka do if "you, stupid?!" Or Shinji's "I Will not Escape!" Sometimes they are as small as those who think, who frequently have quotation and who have those letters. <br /> <br /> * Conclusion: * <br /> <br /> All, live action Saikano movies were potential. It really did not. You are not a fan and watch this movie: You will be reluctant to start anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) Those who have seen and loved Anime / Monga, will not get your hopes this one. The research will probably show you the disappointment. It was still interesting to return to live life in an animated adaptation, but it could have been more. Unluckily, I gave out live-action cysho hockey kanozo (cycano) 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'm sorry" Quince says <br /> <br /> <br /> ~ Necotakuto
