Guy Pierce looks like and works like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or a lemon worn by a lemon jeans who stand in front of Buffalo stumping, because they understand that the buffalo like levi is too much. In each scene, Guy Pierce thinks he says, "Look at me, I'm so beautiful!" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. Every scene called for brave, Pierce Sticks gets a short end. Spinner: Still, at the end of the film, this intelligent book-worm character runs a pack of babu-like morlocks, which can move along the walls (like Spiderman) and jump. At about the same time, the time machine seems to cause a kind of nuclear explosion that erases the entire valley. Curiously, even though Pearce and her golf die almost a foot away from the last Marlok; After a few seconds, Pierce, Mumbai, and the tribe fly away from the security of their hills. Now that's fast running !!! Jeremy Irons as the king of Morlocks are great. She really makes much better than the movie. Mumbai model model actress is not very intelligent and she is not acting in this movie. The scenes that took place in the 1900s did not have any real environment. Although dresses of time and vehicles are shown, the characters imagine how they conceive and speak in the 1900s, and they behave like actresses. The original version of this movie was much better in this case. The characters of time were much more realistic and they had many good actors. The original version of this movie seems past as the basis of the characters. This new version lacks the substance and feelings. Pierce Emma fails to save him from the scene related to death and his fate. Scenes are very good. The problem of having Morlocks cancer is not very well explained, and it is not understood that they have some big dark Butcher shops filled with knives and cutters, yet they are not seen using any weapon without a flashing. There is also stupid water and bone full giant pit. All over the underground area, the mortals walk around the chewing gum in the flesh bones. How can all the skeleton go to the pit? It seems that there are some mortals that Bar-B-Kui will eat their people from the grill, and the other miracles are just like a filleted flesh? And where are these animals restrooms for all? I saw dozens of people in the brain to blame themselves, it happened to me that they could have a very good toilets and plumbing systems, because they thought they were lying in a lot of bones. All these issues have not been tackled. At the end of the film, Pierce holds the hand of the monkey, but you can see that he is kissing his friend Mandingo. One of the most annoying things about this movie is the non-stop Lion King music in the background. Once again Pierce comes (802,710 a.d.); The Lion King music never stops, and the natives are close by every time; African mowing singers (this is Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?), Who shout aloud from the lion's jungle song. At the end of the film I saw the credit, and the jungle music was not specifically marked, but I think Elton would probably have to keep an eye on this. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once, then forget it.
