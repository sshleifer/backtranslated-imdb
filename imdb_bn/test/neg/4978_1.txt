When I could tell Disney's "Underdog" rights, I thought it would be a matter of Pixar partnership rarely, and we could get an extraordinary adult and kids movie "The Incredibles". Well ... I have forgotten today how Disney's classic stuff for today's stupid young man needs to be stopped. What did they think? There was a product of "Underdog" 60, your Prime Funbase between 40 and 50, why would you focus on this 5-year-old? It should be alga "Roger Rabbit", half-animated semi-real. Instead, we became submerged in other dogs like Reef Ruff (a WOLF !!). "Underground" can not have a "power pill", because now we are "illuminated" it may be a reference to steroids or drugs. Patrick Warburton is the only good casting as a "Cad" because he is actually similar to the cartoon version. Otherwise, the old school "underdog" fans will have to avoid it like a plug. What then? Is there a live action version of "The Go-Go Goopers" which is an incognito as a recurrent history lesson? (If Disney jumps on this I apologize better!)
