This movie is based on the series of Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! This animated movie in any settings other than streamfighter! This movie is about Rau and who is with Chun Lea. I could recognize Rose, Junkyph and Bardi! No characters from the video game (which I could discover)! The war scene was just fine but there was nothing really spectacular! And there was not much of them! This strange to me! StreetFighter is not about war! Streetfighter Animated Movie (1994) is much more than this movie. It really tries to be more than that! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural parties has nothing to do with the skills of the characters in video games! And in this case that's a bad thing! The story is so annoying that you do not really care what's going on! The action is down t down! Why? And what happened to other characters from video games! Surely they are more interesting than the villains of this story! The main attraction of video games with their own special skills! Rui is all about this movie! Why this anime fails!
