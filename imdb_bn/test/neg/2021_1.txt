I am a loss for words. The description of this movie is exceeded. I do not believe there is a language in the world which has a word that can describe how awesome this movie is. If you try to see it, do not forget to roam for "end of the weekend". Before I could not accept it anymore, I only made way through these pieces of these three quarters. Thankfully (or unfortunately) some of my friends remained in the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a few weeks of therapy they could complete what I had lost. There is no story in this movie, no plot, no terrible writing, even worse acting. If you enjoy watching train wrecks or automatic accidents, this picture is for you. I think my IQ showed it 30 (incomplete insert here).
