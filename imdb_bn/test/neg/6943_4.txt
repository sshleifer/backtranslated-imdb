A sadly predictable, clichéd story about a woman, which she should not have been better than. Sadly, more than one famous novelist John Dosse Pausos, who was filmed from Pére Lewis, French foreign potboiler. This time Marlene Dietrich Konk, an impressive, cool-heart Spanish beauty. Don Pascal (Lionel Atoll) picked him up from the cigarette factory, but he called her. He warns his longtime friend Antonio (Caesar Romero) against him, but he does not use it. A conflict has arisen, Kocha blames the passquilot for trying to kill the only man of the choice: he does not do it: He points his pistol in the sky, but Antonio shot him. But instead of going to Paris with the young winner, she returned to her, who died for her. With unexpected bits by Edward Everton Horton as a Spanish governor. Dietrich spins on moving, waist and twist in the Spanish woman's part, and then jumping backwards, blurring, inserting her head and more. And he makes the mouth, and in the middle of his forehead there is a curl. Photography has peculiarly crowded: No outdoor scenes can be shot without fencing tunnels, an internal scene can be shot without a busy description that it is almost impossible to follow people in a house, a diarrhea can not be seen continuously, without a major dress change shot . Carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers, it's almost like Surgado's sea water scene.
