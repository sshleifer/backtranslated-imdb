Before the days of the home video, Stan Lourlin's Pre-Hardy comedy 'Kill or Curie' was known - the amount of it was known - only in the film of Robert Yang's 'Lorele and Hardies' of 'Hussey' 20. Yangshan knew what he was doing: 'Kiel or Courier' was best given for his collection of Gagan, the rest was only on the floor of the cutting-room floor of the humorous humorous comedy Jansen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The name is not too much". The dates of this movie should be banned since 1923. Most of the time, during the ban, most American patents buy medicines if it (Ahmed!)

A proud woman stood up at the door: Stan quickly tried to attract his attention by drawing his attention with his finger. Of course he is not deaf, and he immediately whacks him with his umbrella. I have found this sequence of aggression, because it is not among the deaf people (the deaf is not a joke) but it hates the misconceptions spread widely in the hearing of people because they can communicate with the deaf only with their fingers and communicate with the deaf, and in fact the sign language is very complex As well as learning the grammar, performing the charles. More funny, this movie has a spinster Radolfa, a pet canary called (as in Valentino), and there is an incognito photography involved in a person capable of hiding behind a narrow object compared to his body. I saw this device in several cartoons and live-action movies but 'Kill or Curie', I think, as soon as I saw the oldest movie to use it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stren Laurel, a poor actor, chaplin or keton, has done a physical business here, where he has expressed his passion - and its amazing changes - when the camera Back to the back, then Nevertheless, Lauriel never became the first-ever comedian until he agreed to form Oliver Hardy's greatest comedy team of all time.
