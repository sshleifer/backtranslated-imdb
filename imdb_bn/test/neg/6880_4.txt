I just do not call this a good movie, actually it could even be a bad one. <br /> <br /> There are at least 2 good reasons to watch this movie, those performances by Brookener's performance (Eden) and Jonathan Jackson (Eric), both of which provided strong performance. <br /> <br /> They are very good, who are very bad, especially megna good (casino skitter). <br /> Bijou Phillips "Upstairs Baby Hoods" - Dramma Havo was nice, but here she is boring and far from good to far. <br /> <br /> The story is worthwhile but there is nothing special, but it would have been much better than being held in Lucian that any children actually included the lower-accent below, but they (!) <br /> <br /> < especially a movie where "the monster" is actually so deeply entrenched in the Lucian people, with the vocabulary and such common foolhardy characters include the pronunciation T's not. <br /> <br /> The only hello, it's Rapper Method Man, he plays deputy turner and he speaks well in some of his scenes and I mean that if a rapper is able to do it then why can not the "professional" actor? . Same? Mr. Tikal Ukka Math is very enjoyable in his very small role, who knows Tiklian Stallion could ever be a policeman? Even if it is on the big screen <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, this is a pretty stupid but fairly enjoyable slash-movie, but if Brookeer and Jackson left the rest of the young It would have been worse as well, but it could be really bad, thanks they are as good as normal. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 4.5, decent but there are hundreds of good slasher-movies.
