Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting role is the best acting act when you know that this movie has been a serious problem. Although his career was relatively quick and he was not the best actor of Sir John Jeillgude's Brigget Nielsen. Indeed, this film proves that the only reason for his attention was his boobs and because he was incredibly involved with self-destructive football player Mark Gasteinio. So, instead of her "film break", her and a Beverly Hills kisses film went on to her one-note career. It is also clear that financing wizards have also left in this movie, because supporting cast (along with Simple Arnold) is quite long and the script is soft, lazy, lazy. Fans will be very disappointed in this slow and continuous film looking for another canon movie.
