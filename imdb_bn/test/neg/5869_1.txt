After reading another review on this site, we were not sure that we would be able to criticize this movie because it is not good enough. However, 2 minutes in the movie, we knew we were for another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this film works out of a molten, freaky, broken ice cream cone (you know, which gives you sticky and dirty and looks wet-nip). The biggest problem with this movie is the plot. What was it It appeared to people around a psychological ice cream driving around the neighborhood. That's it. There is nothing more to do. Firstly, what is the capability to become an ice cream in this shit town? 1. Spend a few years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to people. This hospital was severely damaged by pumpkin, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and large syringes on the head. 2. There is very bad health and a mutant face to make children away from terror. 3. Make sure that your truck does not forget the body part, loops, and eyes of the holes! <br /> <br /> The actors of this movie have the perfect B-movie Caliber. Is mixed with a bunch of unknown, except those .... MacLeigh Culkin is a trailer-trash version !! Even her bratty charm can not save this stick in the pants. This movie does not seem to be a rhythm or cause for murder. Repeat the whole concept of the movie! Who will be shooting an ice cream man by a driving? Gangster? Girlfriend? Vanya White? Who? We are still struggling with this question. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was in charge of this movie should be blacklisted from Hollywood immediately. Did they really think that a pillow under a baby shirt believes the viewer is really fat? They forgot about arms, face, legs, and other body parts? Above all, the film was made in 1995, but the dress was taken from 80 films, which proved to be the elder brother's white, crutch-hogging high water pants. <br /> <br /> When we were watching these shotty production, we developed both ADD's serious cases. We did not find ourselves left to walk around the room naturally. At many points in the film we found that looking at a blank wall behind the TV set, it was more entertaining than the original movie. We're surprised that this movie did not create it in the 100 below. Later, we picked up the tape from the VCR and kept it on a black surface and melted like a sub-standard ice cream cone.
