When you look at the creation of this DVD - they tell you what they have tried here - they are recovering a good versus Bible story and are trying to promote a main stream movie to the audience. The film failed in modern society like us. This movie featured several sheep. People today are very powerful for this kind of promotion. <br /> <br /> As far as acting, instruction and technical functions, they are okay. Chuck Norris is actually just as an angel as an angel to look unexpectedly as an angel, an angel less than the 1960's was less absurd than Tommy Smothers.
