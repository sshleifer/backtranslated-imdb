Generally, I will not waste time in reviewing a movie "Human Poker Chops" (2001 version, confused with previous movie titles of the same title, which is probably known as "Anthold Story" in the West.), But since it already has reviews here Quite unclear, since it is actually formed so I think I'll post some more details, so Because of the film, nobody really has been enticed by purchasing it, because it is a strong force. <br /> <br /> <br /> ************************************************************************* **************************************************************************************************** ******************************************************************** Chinese explanation of the popular Japanese "Guinea Pig" movies. Have strong ideas - you're heading to the head and heading "Guine Pig Making" untitled "He's Never Die" You can see a fantastic transformation of the thing, it has been proven that it has been made, with some glyhounds of fairly good nature, with a glitch in all GP movies, a punk rock, DIY, shot-on-video aesthetic, genuine artists, Manhole in Mehol "), a resounding political agenda and a stray, disrespectful initiative that sets them in a league. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> It is shot in 35 mm film (desperately with good production value), it's 90 minutes long and it's completely free to release anything. This plot is related to flashbacks, regular torture, death and Grace's last vacation, heroin-addicted street pedestrians, flashybaya, in a police interview by suspects, while stealing money from her and her abduction and atrocities by her pregnant women. <<br /> <br /> Despite its fastest efforts in the game of morality, the film is an isolated, inhuman sense, and nobody can help but live in the minds of the people behind it. Although it is half-heartlessly portrayed as an innocent victim, Grace's character, and the characteristic character of her screenplay, positively leads to a frustrating, completely absurdity, "She deserves it!" The perspective that makes it almost impossible to see the whole thing. Grace's deterioration is spent much more time, and when his prisoners are finally convicted and kept in jail, the authors seem to think immediately about those who are not taking care of them for a long time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a movie is hesitant about it, even people who are actually stupid sex and stop violence in movies are also very much absent. Grace's heroin addiction is used to bid for torture, torture, abusive, verbal abuse, continuous flow of psychological abuse and then increasingly intertwined with the prisoners. And when I say it, do not mistake me accidentally. It is a frequent density of nudity like "guinea pig" which is often regarded as the headline of the case despite adverse violence in adolescence, "Human Poker Chops" has no sexual panic. There is no real nudity in the film and there is totally weakness due to violent stupid characters (who fill a dog in a bag at the beginning of the film and push it against a brick wall - do not worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is frustrating unclear and inconsistent with the same line of body Giovinzo. "Combat Shock" and I guess even a shock could be compared. Both films are no social or social. Morally retractable characters and climax of both films , Especially inevitably, with unexpected disasters, especially the glue system that prevents a person's physical body collapse gradually. <br /> <br /> In fairness, there is no violence of 'glamoriges' (where "guinea pigs" is easily charged ) But no one can help it, but it is a place where there is no surprise for such a movie.   ক্ষ উপস্থাপনায় এবং কোনও গতিশীল গতির সাথে এটি কোনও বাস্তব পয়েন্টে ব্যর্থ হয়, একটি আনুমানিক অস্তিত্বের প্লট লাইন এবং কোনও বিনোদন মূল্যের উপরে থাকা অভাবের কারণে, আমি বুঝতে পারছি না যে কেউ কি কিছু দেখতে উত্সাহিত করবে এটার মত. I just made it to the end, completely aiming to be able to fully review it ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 10. Below 10. Below the bottom of the barrel.
