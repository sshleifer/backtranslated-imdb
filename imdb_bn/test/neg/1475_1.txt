This was a documentary even an awesome, annoying movie. Occasionally, it provided insight into life and had fun moments, but it was not fully worth seeing. Every time I start feeling sympathetic to Mark and hope he will succeed, I will be frustrated by his responsibilities and the abuse of alcohol and alcohol.
