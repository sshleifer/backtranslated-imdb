"Mirrmask" was a horrible disappointment for me. I was much expected from Jim Henson's production and it received favorable reviews compared to "The Laboratory" and "Alice in Wonderland". Unfortunately, these movies have ended in one of the "Style Over Stuff" movies. <br /> <br /> Where most children dream of traveling around the circus, Helena is a child who has grown up a circus (child labor, someone?) who want to escape away from real life. Helena wanted her mother to die, which is a bad step for a cat that was lost with a princess complex in a kid fantasy film. You know the next thing, Helena's mother is running, and for some reason, she suddenly moved to another world. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I think that I was sent to the Museum of Contemporary Art in an era with Sigia-tinted glasses. <br /> <br /> CGI-generated animals and backdrop showcases were the first interesting and I like the arbitrary giant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We were waiting for leadership wherever we lived, wherever we wanted the film, hopefully the "exit" sign of the theater ...
