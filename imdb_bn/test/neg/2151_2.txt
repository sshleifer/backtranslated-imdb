Not sure if it was simply a shy film or it was intended to be a drug in "B" Western. The story line was so but the filming, editing and acting was just plain bad. Aside from the background, the music was ultimately annoying, very loud and only non-stop. Many times you can not sign out on background music. I'm shooting at SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and some old West with them, and many actors are members of this group, so why did I buy it? If you do not have any interest in this group or the game, surely you will not get a little interest in this film with its help. Even acting senior actors (especially Stella Steven) also left much to be desired.
