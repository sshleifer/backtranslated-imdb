These pictures have an amazing cast. MGM took some of her best character actors and usually played them in a film with a wonderful Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star live in the same house as the same greedy Wednesday. They have been involved in a fate for years, they have been selfish quarrels. One of them has the idea of ​​giving some property to buy a good name (like Carnegie), but the property they want to give is actually included in O'Brien. And, since she is an orphan, she is a volunteer to be her guardian so they can give up her property and look like great charitable people. <br /> <br /> Wonderful character has an incognito subplot operated by the actor. Henry Davenport. And, as O'Brien's Irish (as proven by his heinous accent), he and a little man make up a lot of plots. Actually, I absolutely hated this part of the film and wish they would completely eliminate it. Instead, the story may still be about melting the heart of the sweet Margaret, - it will work. But ... "little man" ?! Sheesh! Overall, the actors are very hard, but the intrigues of the plot and the terrible efforts they have made me cringe. I saw many people like this picture - I guess I'm just an old cow! I saw the film is terribly difficult to see.
