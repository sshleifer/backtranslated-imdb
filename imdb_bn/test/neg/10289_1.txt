This is a snap movie. I am also at risk in the IMDB library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flickr. I thought I was going to see some classic horror movies with creative ends, which the authors want to discover .... which does not give any idea while writing horror films, but as an observer we try to be reasonable and understand. This finishing was not creative. It was ill and there are all earmarks in a snuff movie. I am surprised, it has been edited towards the end, and it is worse that it will come out for distribution at the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is harmless to many innocent innocent minds ... to see, finish the film and you can understand this statement. The plots, the plot included, is a sweet little girl "not yet 9" her character says. She does not end up snapping, but she is an integral part of the movie. Why do the administrators feel that they need to get admitted with a sick storm? If the director feels that it is an art film, he is doing wrong.
