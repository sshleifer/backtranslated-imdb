First: A Warning <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie in the Universal Hitchcock Collection series DVD. Source printing seems to be inaccurate, but the image is a little soft, it seems to be a second-generation copy directly from the video. The structure is very tough, so all composition is terrible. Even the title of the movie is cut. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, in Sixties, Hitco has given a comprehensive description of his whole body work, but this picture What he can tell about is that he did it for Carol Lomber and did not understand the characters that he simply photographed in Norman Crosna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the story of Philapdelphia. Carol Lomber is generally a meritorious wife who learns that her marriage is technically illegal, falls in love with her husband, and feels that the film is quite 'strange'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Long before the end of the film the audience says: "Dump the fool cows, they are not valuable. <br /> <br /> Jean Raymond plays the best friend with whom he is involved. He is a sincere, 'old family' Southrena It is supposed, although it is not clear from its pronunciation and it becomes clear in only the drunken scene (which he plays otherwise very well). He is a respected, generous, impressive lady, so non She has been bullied and sponsored by Robert Montgomery and has made a lot of humorous butt - even though he did not behave like Rolf Belammy on his Girl Friday. </ Br> <br /> This film was created as if it was made by such people The only screwball comedians who knew the fame, but did not really see it. For example, a good screw Comedy is a running comic thread which has a strong central concept with continuous intertwine and overlap.Also, all comedy elements are strung out, just like a beads on a necklace. This is a sculble comedy by numbers. Same with Generally, these comedy moves forward in increasing speed, which eventually leads to violence. Do not hit the hitco His side is slightly slower and the picture has apparently become a strong heir that all seem to be a little more written (but least) and a little longer. He was never the special director of the actors, so he only let Caste go with him. They're okay. <br /> <br /> Hitako had a funny idea, which he often used in his thrillers, but as a story he did not feel like a comedy. Her next problem with Harry was the same for the film, but at least she was involved in the film. Here he is just going through the speed. <br /> <br /> All the people associated with this movie were very good professionals, so this is not particularly bad. It seems only a bit derivative, more familiar, long and far flat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith Carroll are for Lomber fans and Hitcook is solely for one.
