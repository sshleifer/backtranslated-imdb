It started quite well, the accident and the decision did not return. But everything quickly falls into place. In the end there is a decent plot packing, but many scenes which makes sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) is angry at home and is ready to deal with people, and when he takes the club, when he parked in front of his car in front of his house? I do not want to hide it, anyone decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes is ridiculous. Even acting, which was not bad at first, it became worse at the end. If you do not want to look bad, do not get bored.
