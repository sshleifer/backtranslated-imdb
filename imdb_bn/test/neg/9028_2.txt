This picture is a great disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting movies throughout his long career, some of which were highlighted by the strong and powerful performance of Spanish actress Victoria Abril. Juna La Looc, she relies on a talented actress and new actor Pillar Lopez de Ailla, but it is the only positive element in one of the most terrible world of the film. Lopez de Ailla works hard to portray Juanva as a romantic and enthusiastic young girl, completely dark in love with her handsome husband, it seems that she can not develop her character on this one-dimensional feature; Juan was an important figure in Spanish history and in his story the politics of that time was essential ... but here he was known as a soap opera, a romantic leading female; This is a real sad story, and the film can affect the chance of showing the way of personal life and its opposite history. Worse, Italian actors Daniel Leoti and Manuel Arquire have turned out to be a real bad performance, which is a real problem for Leoite, because he portrays Philip El L Hermosore as an important part of the story. It seems like a clear choice to attract young viewers, because they are both like the top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Jemma and Rosanna Passar are completely destroyed in support of fully accessible roles. Although it was a big budget movie, little care was made to create a good screenplay or "time slice" on the screen. Clothing scenes are particularly unique, such as those taken from the stock ingredients, without the actual addition. Above all, Juna El Loch (and this is what makes difference with many great historical movies such as LA Rain Margot or Elizabeth) lack of a director's perspective. This is a wonderful turn in Aranda's career, because she was able to create it, in other works (in my mind of Libertyus and Amantes), create very personal and interesting films, when this Zuna is nothing but a regular academic historical piece. And that's a very good one!
