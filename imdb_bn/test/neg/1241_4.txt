This program is meant to look after someone, who can hear the training sometime. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of medium ones. It's funny and does not look like the authors to differentiate between what's odd or fair. <br /> <br /> it's moments. When Spike pushed neighbors to repeatedly make the neighbor's ground his dog, it hit its peak. But the sunny moments are very few, and there are many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to see the positive IMDb comments seriously on this event. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Most were written by show workers and by Spike's relatives and personal friends. <br /> <br /> It's not very good at the time.
