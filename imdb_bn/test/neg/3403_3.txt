The first movie that I saw from this people was "the baby of the grave" and when I heard that it was coming, I thought it should look good because Weverly is a real place that rumors for frustration. This documentary / film was AWFUL! Producers, directors, cameras had more fake comments than men ... they had to keep their faces outside of this photo. Weverly has been rumored to be frustrated for a long time that if someone still suspects seeing this movie, then there is no doubt that every story about the place like this documentary is fake. The unusual evidence was horrible and almost existed. I heard a good EVP from high school students with a bathroom tape recorder! They tried hard to do something scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not a story, blotter is not too dark to watch a video, not a picture, not a tape recording! The tomb was bad, but at least it had some substance and the cripple factor. The only reason I'm giving it 3 is because the history section of the show was very good and informative. It is necessary to learn about how the hospital comes in, there is a daily life, and how it ends when these 2hr pieces are fragmented.
