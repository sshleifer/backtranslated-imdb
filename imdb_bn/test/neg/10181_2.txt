The only reason I'm not 2 and 1 is this movie, because for some reason I'm forced to finish it! Basically, I want to see if there is an alien, a UFO, movie title, movie cover and everything in the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed with the way religion could be mixed. It can be used in movie facility, but I think, instead, the movie is trying to send me a supernatural message! Finally, how big was this cast cloth! I was so different, and very bright, so confused with each new character's shirt that I started to wonder why this new movie was not classified under "poor comedy". <br /> <br> fingering down!
