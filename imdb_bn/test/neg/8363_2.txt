I rarely see a movie with such a cast, such as a potentially powerful story and based on a best selling book that is weak and somewhat unexpected ... <br /> <br /> A story based on a Brent Easton Elise Novelist - A young Elizabeth wartzel (played by Christina Rixie) as many drugs, frustration and self-motivated tragedy suicidal Which tries to deal with the loss, which is really good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Want - kill yourself already and let us go towards credit rolling ... The director is not a helper because he does not provide any speed and the story looks so confused that you think this false girl actually has no idea about it. While directing this imitation of the film, it was apparently directed by Prajak, and so it gives autopilot an intolerable mess to the film. <br /> <br /> The only freedom fighter features sympathetic Jason Biggoss, who is Wurtzel's boyfriend (who gratefully decided to dump self-generous Indonesian egomaniac) and an incredibly good Jessica Lang weeping baby children. Lang can not be brought down by apparently scary scripts, indicator and terrible coworker. Pure class <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know who actually was Warzell or who was, but this film successfully completely discouraged me from his writings. <br /> <br /> I finished showing this movie and immediately thought: OK. Time to see something, that's actually about real problems ...
