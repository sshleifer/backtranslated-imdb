Talk about garbage! I can not think of a good thing in this movie. The screenplay was poor, the acting was terrible and the effect was, there was no good effect. I can not believe that the author of this movie has introduced, everything in this film has made me sick to finish. <br /> <br /> In front of the video box shows sharks like teeth and scary eyes in Dhaka. . I look like a scary villain, but like the old saying "Never judge his cover book", the whole arch appears to be cutting a cardboard. A part of the photo is slaughtered by a salad tongs of a girl, deadly. The setting was bad enough, as they could set the whole thing in Lapland but instead a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I've taken this movie as a joke, which I think they want to be it but the only thing that laughs me in a bad way was tacky effects. You can argue the first one you saw, but if I want to see it, I'll be safe. <br /> <br /> This movie's biggest joke effect, like the snowballs, looked like they were made home, and that carrots were completely embarrassed. If I think the budget of this film may be between 8 and 9 pounds. Actors must take possession of the producer for the last minute, their script said that they would take 6 minutes to practice these lines and be shot on an island. <br /> <br /> Painful, actors have forgotten their common lines and made way through them. <br /> <br /> I finally gave this picture: 0 out of 5 stars
