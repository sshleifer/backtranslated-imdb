I sounded familiar to the plot as I saw this film before. However, when I saw it at noon (for some Manmohan-entertaining entertainment), I did not recognize anything - if I saw it before, I must have stopped its horror from my memory. <Br /> <br /> This picture is awesome, and it shows her age. Actually, it seems to be old: comedy between the mid-80s. Although I am a fan of the toilet and I can see the strange side of many things, it is "the comedy" at its most vivid and homophobic time. Plot is thin like Supermodel, which will not bother me if only the movie is fun. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < James and Carl are boring, the kind of unexpected males that an intelligent woman drives one mile, their practical joke about ridiculous like the war in Iraq; The character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (seems like Julia Roberts, but lacks her charisma), and there is zero chemistry between him and Carl - although it may be unfair to blame the actress, I do not know what she could do, such as a poorly written piece; And villains are not funny or scary memorable. <br /> <br /> There is a good trash and bad trash. This trash that should not be recycled explicitly.
