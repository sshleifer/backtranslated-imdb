All right, the very idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not have planes 2. Children do not run the airplane with dirt. 3. It looks like the Air Force is stupid. 4. The kids do not allow his whole career to make his son happy. 5. A reserve colonel <br /> <br /> Seagels, I'm sure this was worse than the trio. The only release quality of this waste of soundtrack celluloid I am sorry but I do not understand why anyone in the world will write directly and make such an impossible junk. The Iranian Air Force is fortunate that they can filter a few parts for an adult F-14 and this child burns 1 but 2 full loads and F-16s? Gimme a break
