As long as there are some huge rebellious conspiracy, my jaw fell down when I read a positive review of this jaw; <br/> <br /> I acknowledge that this is not like my movie, but I tried to see it instantly, however, you know that it is very funny, and <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> I said, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a year, I'm not actually telling a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, who does not actually say "gay", does that mean so crazy? Homosexuality weak This is not good, in fact, this is uninterrupted vomiting. The trick struck on their kind ass, the music defies it so bad it believes. Soundtrack compilers have heard that they have ever heard the bad songs of the worst voices they have ever heard and put them in the stock of waste. Oh, my good Christ, I can not believe the rubbish produced in the 80's, I grew up among them, and I can not find the value of a note here, it must be dark time from the cinema-gear. <Br> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie, then look at a psychiatrist, according to which she will measure you as a sick, sick person.
