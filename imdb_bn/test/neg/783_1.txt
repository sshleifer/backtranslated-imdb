Perhaps one of the best films from the same mind like Donny Darko is. Where do I start? I think one of the worst things of the film is that we have spoken about criticism of humanity, and yet we do not see any humanity in the film. More than 5 minutes of film do not express anger about the possible death of other people. These people are a terrific cardboard cutouts. Sadly, how they act in such a way that can only be described as horrific acting. Does this really see the humanity? Judging from the response of the audience, this is a terrific encapsulation of humanity. Why do the characters of the movie do not ask questions which the audience has? This is not a charge of humanity. A string of men who set up Kelly is a complaint that is not compatible with real people in this situation. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful thought-provoking movie, but you're comparing it? Armageddon? I saw someone comparing this to Kurosawa's work. How do you really want to be deprived that you think it will promote good existent discussions? Love pictures of love! Even the unknown proposal is ten times the humanity's complaint. There we really regret the greed and people's condition. Yes, even the unknown proposal shames this movie for a philosophical discussion and it still gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this intelligent trip. <br /> <br /> Very rarely, I have become very provocative, congratulatory and goofy, the film has collapsed. Definitely on his face. It has a high school film project depth, and that's a poor one. Really, this is about the level of discussion organized by the film. If you want to make a good mental movie, then make your own bias and see the Dasha test. If the box survives even after achieving a goal, then I would be willing to forgive the harmful act, harmful plot holes and innocent different stories. Sadly, it can not even do that. <br /> <br /> The true allegation of humanity is, there are people who think that this film is a deeply spontaneous spontaneous outlook on human condition. It is not crap! This is not a summary of the Cliff Notes edition! This is a quick idea and based on the hackle-written 9th grade paper, some Internet Message Board rambling. If Sarat lived, he would have convicted Kelly for defaming him.
