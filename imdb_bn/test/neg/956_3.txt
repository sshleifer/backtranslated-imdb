"D.O.A." Director Rocky Martan and Anabal from an exciting thriller <br /> <br /> Zuckle. It's okay and the playplay is quite bad. There are moments in this movie that make you laugh at the stupid image of the violent scene <br /> <br /> For example, someone is shot around a window. Then we can see from the outside <br /> <br /> The building looks like how it looks. This happened when I laugh at my head. This movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. Just watch this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * No ratings found because of its age.
