I saw it under John Goods Wife (one of the worst titles for a single movie), or the Red Right Hand (the other horribly titled title which does not make any sense and there is no relevance to the film), set in Semem, Massachusetts 1978 ' (Incidentally, one year of my birth, which was probably the best thing in 365 days) where five old college friends re-school Join for the reunion, the gay-boy Faggett Roger's head (John Kantz, the title for him) is true? Just say, laugh out loud ...), Martha Allen (Kim Brokington), Rebecca Lawson (Genoa Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Do), Allan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife, Sandie (Megan Rawa) Plus John Good (Mark Ardito, why title is titled 'John'?) And his wife Sarah (Abigail Morgan) There is an uncomfortable tension in the air from the sound and when many people mention their 'missing' friend, Kleff (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories come back. Then the phone calls, mysterious noses - bloodshed, hallucinations and crimes are committed; those incidents really come true before the whole year ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executive producer and curtain directed by Kurt Giussia, Art articles also get credits and if not enough, both of them work in movies too! Personally I thought that John Good's wife was awful, that means he could cook or not! Ha ha, just fun! Although seriously I did not think much of the film at all, initially it is running very slowly and is the first 30 minutes of reconciliation, which is related to each other and uninterrupted building exposition. The movie never explains, those weird noses-bloodshed, mysterious phone calls, for the benefit of God, almost incomplete death of the group that can not be natural and what was the whole? She has some dirty, sexually transmitted, dirty talking, shameless, bitter blackmailing - all the slaves that she has seen, she sleeps with only every man! In a conversation, he will not move the spouts out of place and seemingly disagree with the rest of the film, which seems to be more dramatic than the horror / thriller. Then, in the end, if there is a more bad way to finish a film then all the hanging in the sky is left without any ties which I still can not see. The whole thing was very predictable, I understand that nobody will know that when he mentions his friend, Kalef does not become 'absent', will not be anything more than that? <br /> <br /> The director Geosia and Thomas have created a scary movie in the top of the predictive and annoying mountaineering, a description of a preview by Allan, which I just do not understand because he has no less importance than anyone else and Is doing The reasons behind this description are never explicit or explained. <br /> <br /> The technically correct film is fine but there is nothing special and the place and clothes do not seem special to me, it has never believed me. This happened in the late 70's. Acting was right and what about the last name of actor John Kant? I think if his wife is standing beside him, then we can describe him as two kants, right ?! <br /> <br /> I really do not think a lot of Good Wife in June! Ha ha ha) And I'm not sure who will appeal it. Forget about any grave, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement, forget about everything actually made to watch this movie because it is not here. Not recommended.
