When I showed this film, I could remember: "Is this going to end?" It was unbearably annoying to see. I could have stopped it if I wanted to, but I wanted to do justice to this review, so I fought in a good fight and the victim was tortured to see the film so that you, a good reader, would not have to bear that pain. <br /> <br / > <br /> This movie sounds like it's a great compound when reading premiere on paper. However, the actual film does not fully provide this premises. <br /> <br /> The early scene was a miniature feature in the early 1900's, where they forced children to carry dynamite in tunnels which is not large enough to fit among adults. It seems to set up the compound for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes, it becomes clear that the case is not there. Adults who have committed this crime are never punished; There are no results shown in the movie for their actions. The opening scene is better than the rest of the film and completely irrelevant. The last time an opening scene presented a film wrongly, so the 28-day opening scene was the only good scene in the whole movie. Wicked Little Things / Lomis (A movie is so unclear that they changed the title to change the title and sold it again). The opening scene is the only spectacular view of the whole film. Instead of <br /> <br />, the film goes forward today. A single mother and her two bratty, foul-mouthed kids. OK when press the stop button and do not go near the movie again <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They will receive a total of 3 minutes of screen-time. All they did is kill a dying murderer. The rest of the soil and the rest of the children buy local shops, roam around the forest, and give each other a strangle conversation. The fool, the girl quarrels with some other fools, and washed the weeds with them. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to care about anyone sending junky kids to this movie. Each single character is both silent and annoying, at no redeeming qualities at all. One does not mention dimensional and clich√©d. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Their new home, then rolled the last credits. That right there will be instantly change from 1/10, to 10/10. Really say! When the foolish mother raises her eyes on the street and crashes the pedestrians on the street, her daughter calls her: "You killed us almost, mother!" Of course, in the general sense, whoever knows that if the mother beat a pedestrian, then the pedestrians will die - people do not enter the car safely. I think this line has been inserted into the movie so that the stupidity of the original characters does not know any bands and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked things run for hours / hours for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it definitely felt like my 5 hours or more. Trying to fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. Jamie Child is actually annoyed to kill a person until one hour and 34 minutes have passed an hour. Then the fools are drinking beer and getting out in the car and saying in the line, "If you want to get my pants again, you better start the car and get my ass out of here." Seriously, that's verbatim from the movie. It seems to be a celebration when the kids are finally approaching their hacking for 1 hour and 5 minutes in the movie when the kids are finally clutched, one-dimensional, poorly played, stupid and annoying. Of course, "princess" fist-smoking-the main head of the smoking-smoking character, unfortunately, the beer-drinking girl becomes Scott-free. What was that a buzzkill! He had a long screen over others and so is the most deserving of them 4 most annoying, and a pickaxe from the head. More reasons that he should be sending in the first 10 minutes, as before. Although it can be kept around 1 hour and 5 minutes, but it is completely inactive. <br /> <br /> This is because the feature length films need to be padded for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So when he is alive he will keep him alive for a long time, with him and his mother will take 27 minutes to walk on the foot of the soil. Within 1 hour and 22 minutes, this is the second * time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a car where the engine will not start when the kids get her. <br /> <br />> Zumbi is completely generic for kids. Do not say anything <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the filmmakers will see The key to finalizing the bird gesture of viewers for viewing. In my opinion, filmmakers must know that they have tied up a person whose whole film is ill-fated. Because they face their face without covering the first face of face, cover their faces and die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bubonic plug.
