It's amazing that some people saw this as industry. We saw it as a badly portrayed (sticky hand held cameras and all), (usually) poorly-worked, obscure mess that seems to be more like a high school film project with children in making black and white films. Poetry injections do not make an art film instead of a story. When we saw it in the theater, people started to start the fits of giggle (in our included) in the constant stupidity of this tyrannical, confusing mess. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our candy and popcorn, then we would have walked out of the theater with more than two dozen people, who were looking for something more interesting!
