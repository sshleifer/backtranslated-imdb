A novel adaptation of a movie by the same name written by CUJO Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I could not read the novel but scanned the comments page and gave me some insight. I have finally noticed a reference to the change. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is as follows: - St. Bernard's dog bites with a riddle bat and falls into a murder. <br /> <br /> This movie is now quite interesting, working on various movies. But while writing the novel King, it can be something new. Or maybe King's novel puts a cover on the story that is never seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is nothing significant except the dog cat in the first 40 minutes of this movie. There is nothing else - nothing scary, nothing interesting, adding depth to the characters and nothing interesting is anything interesting. I got saddened in this section and always shouted at the TV, "Come on, start!". The shows that were seen on the screen are reminiscent of an extended TV movie or a TV soap opera episode of a TV movie. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie that gives no focus, so it can not work at a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but in this section it did not get enough screen time. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on after a killing. <br /> <br /> After a 40 minute mark, something happened eventually. The dog suddenly turned from a lovable pet to a harmful killer machine. It's starting to attack some people. The dog will attack, because the two letters were trapped in a car, but an interesting cat and mouse were behind. Even in this partially long second half, the mystery will again be well constructed before the death. Until the film reached its conclusion, it was again a stop-over situation. <br /> <br /> I can tell you without ending the fact that it was very unfinished in the story of Stephen King. <br /> <br /> Exciting to watch on the screen sauness scenes. Some great cameras attack humans in the harmful nature of the dog when it narrow it down. This is especially important because others refer to St. Bernard's dog, where Rotweller says, there is no scary near nowhere. Unfortunately, the film failed to use suspicious music to support images on the screen. Music is far more than sensationalism It can fit into a TV movie, but it can be incredibly visible in a dark-protected movie that has presented a nightmare to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a bigger problem with this movie - photography. Camera-work and especially the choice of colors, it seems like a very cheap TV movie, I am writing this comment in UK where it is seen in Channel 5 as Dinajpur Film. <br /> <br /> The top two actors provide good performance, which helps in breathing life in neutral parts of the film. Credit should be done to do a great job with the poor elements offered by De Dew Wallace and Danny Pinto. I could have forgotten a few brief moments by focusing on the conversation, which in my opinion could not allow any other interpretation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> High expectations were there. But it has become a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend fans of Stephen King or Awesome movies to watch Ceuzo. This is one of those moments where I recommend the book instead of the movie. I hope the movie lives in a way which failed the film.
