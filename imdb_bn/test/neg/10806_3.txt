The fame of the movie when Martin Shane's little, little known brother lives in him, you know that it is not really 'good'. "Salto" is a low budget, followed by an angel of death, about 20-something year old about a stupid film. This is a stupid film, but it is quite entertaining and even slightly stupid in its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is very small and it can expand as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, so fortunately for the audience, his very few lines and most of his walks on his walk. This movie looks like a really horrible / fantastic franchise, it seems to be the same plot layout as a slash. 4 characters, one at a time each ... someone will live? Who really cares Although I like this hate, I do not. I did not like it very well, but I was interested in most of it, so I guess that's counted for it. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** of 1/2. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, violence and nudity
