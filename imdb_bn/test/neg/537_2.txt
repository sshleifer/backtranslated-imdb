I want to agree with the previous critics: There are great animations in this movie, but there is a problem across the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Plots are huge, the interpretation of the plot of the dialogue is a little bit - the main plot point is not even fully explained in the last five minutes. Failing to explain the picture more confusing points, the letter is clear state. There are some letters that pop up and the importance of the story is not explained - most of them are only * once *, and it is very confusing to the audience. <br /> <br /> Don 'do not waste your time with this movie. If you find it a good smile and how to do it for DUMB.
