This is a movie that I do not like it because I do not like it, because it is so bad that I can not close its eyes (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 miles in Grenland") Waiting for the first time I was waiting and waiting to laugh and I was not getting the chance to take 3/4 of the way through the movie when they hijacked the police in their disguise and switched them in the park. Location. Outside, jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their anger and wrong ways are not funny ... add it, this is not a very funny movie! Even at a slapstick level! And what's with regga soundtrack? It is a photo two white rubbish and music is all reggae. Getting out of the place, right? If you like a good train record, it's for you. If you want a good comedy, look elsewhere.
