First tell me, 1 out of 10 is very good for this movie. It is unfortunate that IMDB does not have a star tenth ... I saw this miscarriage of a movie in midnight due to insomnia, and it was completely rubbish. The plot was horrible. Acting was terrible. The movie was completely annoying. Looks like "Malachi" Shadow with Alake Belvedin (Shadow also is infinitely better). The character was so much relieved and 2 dimensional, she could not even get my attention. I was not even Eve's name in her. When Don closed his mouth he was attractive. "TWIST" (if you can call it) was ridiculous and kind. When it came, the film did a terrible job of creating a character that was associated with a character that I simply "give it to a S ***". The only thing that raised a eyebrow about this movie is Med Med. Daison (also a film that was a lighter year than the genocide of the film) in teacher terminator 2. Anyone involved in this movie may be ashamed to waste the time of countless people in the 90 minutes. It is no wonder that any actor from this movie was ever a fruitful career. Summary .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gogli was good, Pramos night (Remake) was good and I said that the fourth was good ...........
