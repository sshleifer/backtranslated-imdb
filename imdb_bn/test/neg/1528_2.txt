Where do I start with Killing Mines before I say good? This film is about a young psychological profiling FBI woman, or something, which for some reason works for LAPD for a watermelon. There are some recognizable faces, such as, "I love you, people" block from Wayne World, a policeman (very good age!) And two players who seem to be always playing police ... You have guessed it, police. One of them, one of the gross point blocks, took the place of Cusack and the other is the FBI with final destination glasses, which are harmful like other crap. I know, the FBI, the US Marshals, the CIA, etc. are not the police, but they are all the same. They enforce the law of a certain degree, which makes my police my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a police proving that you want, as they are seen as those who still try to bring down bad guys. No, I digress. The woman is working alongside these police, who are sitting around the library at some point or in some way and have decided to resume a case for some unknown reasons which did not look at the Ionaks. He saw the dead body as a baby, so naturally he decided that he could reopen the event that he was personally involved! I liked how to witness a murder scene as a child of other person's mental state profiling person. Is that something that can screw someone's head?! He started asking the question of some journalists when he kept the story open, although he thought of being the same old woman, perhaps at the age of 10 he wrote for a newspaper, or he wrote several school reports, and he decided that he Be the best person. <br /> <br /> We tried to steal something as well as opening a murder case 25 years ago. Really unclear block sprints through a busy street wearing a baslove. Mixing way, stupid! However, he and the police, behind the park's ice cream, are behind him and after crossing the woman standing on the bridge, the thieves keep the child from the clay arm and throw the child in the river. This is the best bit of movie if you have not already guessed it. I'm not unhappy, or do not hate kids or anything, but seeing the scene so stupid, I promise that if you see this movie then your pants will laugh. It gets better when the lungs jump for the rescue of the feather and the child from the final destination, announces to his friend "It is a child!" How did he not know that he was hanging before, out of me <br /> <br /> However, after the thief, he licks it but loses it. He later thought that a random dog did not surround the thief, so it seemed that he would be his own and decided to drive the thief through a dog. The dog did not have any signs or anything, so how did he know about where the dog was found, and thus I could not find another question of thief. After that I stopped watching soon. The story was moving slowly, and because I smiled to throw a baby, I lost interest and missed what I was saying. Saying, I'll go ahead and guess that the killer pushed the journalist because he was a little lower, and she was spending a lot of time with him, and anyone who saw the Colombo knew that the person outside the police force was the investigating officer Most of the time it is your bad guy. Plus, other people's reviews say that the killer was quite clear, so I was sure that it was. <br /> <br /> So all, a pants film, but only worth seeing for a divine scene.
