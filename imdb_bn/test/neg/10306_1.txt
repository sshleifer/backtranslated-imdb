I open my mind very much. I see all kinds of programs in the end ... good or bad ... just give them opportunities and learn from good aspects and bad ones. This show might be good. But what is my God, writer, casting director and director thinking? Actors acting terrible ... with the slightest exception of Murray (Mummy Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski), sometimes good lines are being given with many good executions. <br /> <br /> Rest Cast Cast Show This is the same story line of each episode. Sam plans to do something. Her boss hindered this plan by allocating her ridiculous work project. Then stupid ways Sam is primarily stupid that one way tries to accommodate both and lacking any real intelligent humor. This is each episode. It gets very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they dig the eye candy. 2 hot "girls" of the ceremony are written in writing (still there are brothers? Please explain that let me vote). I saw why they wrote them ... they had no significant role ... but they did not add any good to replace them. <br /> <br /> The character of Kaki Derek Trilogy has been shown continuously in season 2. His performance (along with others) is similar to many poor sitcoms of the 80's ... Then it was funny ... but now painful. <br /> <br /> The show could be so good some good writers and some people who had no talent for their run. This show lacks everything. The production quality is the only good direction. This is great in this context ... unfortunately the content is sadly tragic. <br /> <br /> My God. Fox, was something really good to love? I'm now sticking to the "Sunny Always in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" shots. The bar should be set by programs that actually consider the audience to be intelligent and do not continually suppress them by using all their brain power to breathe.
