I bought this movie in DVD despite the "style" review and it was stupid ... the review was perfect and I have never seen any bad "erotic" movie in my long life! Even if it was partially beautifully illustrated and interesting around, the plus was nice ... but my own Extreme Itotica (C) movies are more than 100 times more erotic (only soft delicious) movie budgets! The story is not a logical connection to the first movie or the famous book ... or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some strange and sad developments ... Then the main male character Close Kinski - did not see "like the second master" She tried to play a bit ... even as beautiful as Durban, it looked delicious in any scene!
