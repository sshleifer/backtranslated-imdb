I do not recommend watching this movie. It is a movie where a movie is being shot, actresses and actors are not being played any attraction. At the end of the film to explain the reluctance of actress (acting in the film) to co-operate with the actor (in the role of the film), the sexual scene is a repetitive repeating movie Fat Girl of the same scene in Braille. There was everything played with more dirt, if you could attach the subtlety to such a sex act. A common French expression for sex is a comedy that is oh la la! Breitut's film brief crossings has sensitivity. Sex In Comedy I can not see real sensitivity and a clear plot for the film is not being developed so that there is a different story in the end with confusion.
