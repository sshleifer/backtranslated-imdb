I used to live in Barstow CA. In 1968, when the movie reached the Killers' Three Theater The trailer was enough for my hard-working money to watch this movie. I was really looking for Bonnie and Clyde films and I was playing a shameful guy like Dick Clark, Robert Walker and Dean Warsi were making a bad attempt to re-play Bonnie and Clyde. Not saying it went well on. Maybe that's why it was not created in the video. Even in my childhood, I torn a bit like leaving the theater. After all the good part of the movie trailer where. The movie was dull and quite dull. However, Dick Clark is killed so it is not total down.
