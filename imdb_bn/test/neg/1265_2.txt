I got a rare copy of the first Alamedo movie with high expectations - a wonderful contemporary director of Aldaudova, I enjoyed his 1988 film "Nerve Brake of Wizor of Wiser of Winb's of Worship of Buzzdown", and I have read one or two very positive reviews. Movies. Well, critics in this movie have seen that I've missed the whole lot of humor. I just found it irrelevant, tasteless, and annoying. Yes, there are plenty of exploration, dragging people and unreasonable sexual situations, and yes, these elements threatened viewers in 1982 (which was almost Almodovar's intention), but most of the shock values ​​have probably decreased for years, a sarcasm continues. Outside of it, the whole movie was feeling very disorganized, no character was particularly sympathetic, and a "comedy" - even for a dark - I did not think this picture was fun. I think it's a favorite audience for such a movie, but I'm not part of those audiences, and I do not want to be sure.
