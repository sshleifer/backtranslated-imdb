This is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen, perhaps only terrifying and completely overcome by meaningless blueberries. How does Harald Zwart even put his name on this shit? I feel his respected feeling, I wanted to make him hungry fast. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so poor? What is this story Yes Is it the actor?
