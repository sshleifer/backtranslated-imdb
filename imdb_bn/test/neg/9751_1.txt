Why do not I get such a man seriously "Oh My God Stap Up Up Best Movie !!!" It's a bunch of junk! Acting, first of all, ridiculous, and do not start talking about dialogue because it was terrible ... movies seem to be entertaining, and it would be my first to say, * not entertainment *. I'm actually laughing because I'm very embarrassed to see it. There is nothing for me as well as music and dance. And do all the girls talk about "hotness" with Channing Tatam? Anyway. The movie was kind. Do not waste your time - or your money. Unless you're a freak film dance, but movies are not like * movies * ... they joke
