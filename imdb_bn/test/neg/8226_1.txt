I have no interest in how the film does not acquire New Jersey (like Jakh, I'm from there). Fine Anyway. I lived there long enough way. I do not have to see a movie that catch the Garden State. <br /> <br /> I have a bad picture on this movie. Let it be easy on you. We'll use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (You can not predict any image): <br /> <br /> - Music placement was compulsory and patronized. Example: Large: "What are you listening to?" Sam "Did Shins ever hear?" "Number" "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they proceed to play the Shines of the McDonald's commercial. (Do not love any movie characters you do not love - visitors - How do some feedbacks? I love it! Hey, they kept subtitles in various scenes, "Chocolate", "Say" aaaaaw '' 'Crying' '' Inspired feeling '' etc. .) <br /> <br /> - The scenes were SO BAD. So cliche SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The whole movie. But not really, for example: they are in the rain shaft by the ark. Big run-up - Welding rain (oh so he's free!) - A piece of heavy machinery and screws up! How are you doing But wait! Here comes Sam and his friend (annoying drug addiction), and they all are screen !!!! But wait !!!! O god !!!! It has come! What they are !!! Long, Depp !!!! In the rain !!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> - Conversation was so BAD. So cliche SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They are leaving the Ark and Sam says something, "Hey, explore the infinite lazy. Good luck." And the man said, "You, too." Oh ... oh my! I did not understand ... could it be? Oh my god it is! Big life is like ... Ohmigad ... an essential habit !!!! Another example: Big at the airport and Sam. Sam says something, "this goodbye?" Not enough for yes? Okay, the big guy says, "This sentence is not at the end ... it's an ellipses." And guess when he tries to walk on the jetway and returns to his life in LA. Do you know Do not guess. This is the waste of your time. <br /> <br /> This is a Grade J. Wes Anderson Rip of Movie. When the meadromatic and clean is not busy, the movie spends a lot of time with the characters of crazy-kaki-off-kills. Hey, Sam's brother ... Thanks for giving thanks to Jack Broad because it really made the movie more textured. Also ripping off Anderson: dialogue Scenes: Sam and Largeman are a bar. Walk to friends, "Vagina!" One of them said. Then they saw him sitting with Sam, so a friend said, "Sorry, I told the waist." And Sam says, "OK." <br /> <br /> - Inventive cinematography, which is inventive but not screwed and annoying. Push me slowly / slow down the film. Again, Wes Anderson effectively does it in his movie. And it was well done in "Danny Darko". But, really, it was in vain. How nice. A crazy party where folks take X and snake coke. Roll out all the best strategies! <br /> <br /> - You can count the best moments (even if you lose your fingers). That even makes it work. The crash quarterback thing ... Well, that was good! The little thing he (Maharao) says is that he is going to enter quaire (something about hafing tertinine) ... that was good! Oh, wait, about it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Breaf, I think, always a little more intelligent. But, he is loved. But, man, this forced, proactive, melodramatic (you still gotten that?), Too cute, overly everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I am multiplying, the waste of this period is currently rated as 8.0. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rental this. Movie
