I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis, and I was really looking forward to seeing this last night in the DVD. Basically I try to avoid the review until I see something and make my opinion is a big mistake! For the first segment of my 2/10 which is just fair enough, and if they make a movie about the letter number 1, then it is above 5/10 mark. Once it was transferred to 'reality show'. The region stank it to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds has surprisingly taken the essence of an actor, but he was certainly less effective as gay gay writer and famous game creator / cruel family man. From the box's blogger I expect a flashback thriller in the 'memo' line - unfortunately it's not near the movie's ideal.
