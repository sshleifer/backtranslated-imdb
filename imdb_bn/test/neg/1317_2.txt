Oh but this is sad. After another good actor, it turns into mourabelable dialogue under half-hearted fashion, incredibly pedestrian aspects should be considered acceptable. I like Robert Curley and Joan Halleley, one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can do a good job when pushing and David Suechat is the master of the highest honesty, but they all surround the gene of water in a barrel like fish. I was devoted to the oath of Katni, pain or both. <br /> <br /> What was the whole thing like? Well, as David Hood Junior underground engineer, whose partner seems to have washed his eyes, he takes it seriously and gives credit to him, while "losing them all around," it can not be easy, or maybe his view assistant If the director (if there were) came in the direction of this, but I do not know what these people are doing in a movie that was poor (paying bills) Except), I can not begin to say how frustrating I am among them. You should be ashamed! <br /> <br /> No other positive thing other than David Hood ... Yes the sky's shots of London were mostly sinking and responsible for influential artists is also more concerned than disconnecting their fine works by fiction. If you forgive the expression, some of those who see it will do it on a much less screen rather than the best ones. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? British filmmakers are trying to imitate disorganized, visual-driven, tabloid-level generations such as disaster films and then making them worse than Americans. Greati realism, integrity of character, the emotional real desire of an emotion that makes you think and care ... Family way, spring and port wine, carter, long happy Friday, trainings ... do not get me wrong I like some crazy hakum Do The original "Italian Jobs", Tom Jones of the Adventurer; But it would have come, there were more realistic plays for camping.
