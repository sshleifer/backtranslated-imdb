My God, I was expecting something more than entertaining than downloading this movie, because in 1903 my regret for films was one of the years, but it sucked! "Plot", although I do not hesitate to call it, about some stupid elephants. It gradually makes its way onto some platforms and death gets electrocuted. Lame Even for a small film, the plots were very thin to maintain my attention. Edison, the best, the worst director ever. Plus, elephants have no screen presence. And end? Wow, that was not predicted. <br /> <br /> <br /> The quality of the photo is very terrible. You can barely say what is happening at most times. The only positive thing about this movie is that it is not eleven increments than other non-fearful horror flickr. Otherwise it will not be completely waste of money and you will never return 1 minute of your life.
