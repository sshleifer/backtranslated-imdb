The movie was found in a DVD Discount Rack for $ 10. It was not worth it. Some cameras work and the dialogue looks and sounds like it is done by a film student. Sandra's performance was somewhat believable, but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged. <br /> <br /> One thing I'll give them. In contrast to most action films, people of this movie actually jumped from the body and robbed the bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
