The fear of a thriller, the mystery or the abandonment of any emotion, the story will be credible. There is nothing creditable or realistic about this film. There are several scope options to run or turn the tables, but it also manages to screw every time. Opponents who have planned and customized their shuttle, supposedly, put a lot of surgical arms around them to trap the people. Actually there is a scene where the "smart" girl has a gun from the head of a bad guy, and decides to push her to drag the trigger. It was a thoroughly predictably, brainless "thriller". Each character was one dimensional. The "victim" killer was the usual cruel, unblemished sheep who deserved to be killed. Anyone capable of writing an intelligent thriller on this planet?
