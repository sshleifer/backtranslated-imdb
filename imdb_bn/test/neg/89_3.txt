Artificial melodram with a painter, taken by "Mail" from "The Man", is concerned with a boarding-house ownership, who receives a frustrating housekeeper. Despite hard work from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both try their best efforts), this tired yarn is not very inventive in its primary set (which becomes visible quickly) and the following cast of characters (although it is a smart pond that is the worst of the senses! ). Hookie Horner's hockey and comedy (probably should be directed by Lupino?). Where are all mysteries promised by advertising? Dennielo worked as a co-producer. * **** to 1/2
