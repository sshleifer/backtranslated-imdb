I discovered "Patriot" on a DVD store and it could be a real action thriller. No, this is a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is no doubt a cinematic and theater not only for movies. Fortunately, the film closes after 90 minutes, otherwise visitors should take antivirus against sleep. One thing ended: it was a great country where the image was shot. You can really feel American air but that's all. I hope for Steven Siegel that he will finally succeed in a bigger blow. It should not be seen because I and my wife gave average 4/10 votes.
