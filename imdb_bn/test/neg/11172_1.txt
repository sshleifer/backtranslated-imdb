The description of the cover described (at least the Swedish version of the plane) will not be fooled by the out-line of the plot. This story sounds rather interesting, with gestural indications. Nothing could be more from the truth. This is the absolute absolute sad movie I ever experienced ... It is easy and accurate to be perfect and nobody should sell or hire. If you still think that the plot seems to be provocative, then reflect it: Telephone can remove, run and kill people as any other electrical equipment. It can throw things on you, you hunt and run after you. Please do not see this movie, it is disrespectful for the horror genre ...
