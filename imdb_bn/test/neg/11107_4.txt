First off I do not say this movie is anything spectacular. Like throwing bells rescued by reconciliation, a bad dress is like a guy and always like a giant; The military is in vain. It seems that the more training you have, the more your gun is bigger, the more you live in a horrible movie of less sugar, you will die. Apparently, film businessmen show little respect for navy seals, marines and ninjas, who think it's the worst. The plot is thin, a nutritious cryptologist. Panna named snooping cobbler. Then let the two members of the crew loose it where he smuggles it over a cruise ship. You can make your taxes and watch this movie and do not miss a beat. The most significant part is that it really makes all the appropriate captain's girls rolling around. In the end he goes to all the martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt. Let me get this straight, the monster wipes the entire navy seal unit, they are used in ARMOR PIERCING ammunition !! Okay, could it be just a movie? But here the Captain's daughter comes, who can not be older than 19 years old and comes out of the cave and with the front and side kicks. It was fun. They will get a medal for coming up with that.
