I was avoiding this movie for a while ... because I saw it as an unnecessary installment in a series that could only have two parts. However, after reading some fairly favorable reviews ... from some IMDb observers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented at my local video store. I have to go further ... when I say ... it was 50 rupees. This movie is one of 10 bad movies I have ever seen. First off .... I understand that anyone wanted to see the 33-year-old Macchio in this film ... but why did he not read letters or anything from Miyagi to Daniel-San ... possibly explaining what happened to Daniel ... Hell, at least Daniel or could say something. But, no ... and already collecting bad scripts .... they have added the fool beggars ... I thought the beggars would take oath of silence ... Guess that these devoted fans will not take their commitments seriously ... hehehe The training that the girl was going through in the movie was instant and stupid ... and the semi-military team of the young man .... It was a misconception that it was far from a martial arts movie. The girl just fought a little with the final scene ... and still she did not even get hurt once ... fighting with the man ... give me a break ... she would have hit at least once ... I guess writers and directors It seems that this girl has to be frustrating to be caught by a man. I could go ... But, basically ... I'll finish this film because it was so bad ... even the girl she chose was not too good to look (she was sorting "baby") .... I Just think of a few movies that I'm sitting on ... compare to how bad this flick was ... Don "Do not spend your time right now ........
