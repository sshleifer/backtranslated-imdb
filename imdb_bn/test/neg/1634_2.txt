One of Kanan Vannabes's long lines is tired of making cash for the success of the movie, this Italian nudity was as bad as they were. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight against invisible enemies because this movie is made so cheaply, there is no meaning for hiring enough special effects or real people. I will not be disturbed about going to the plot because I refuse to follow someone and understand the feeling of storyline. Perhaps I saw the television cut, but I can not imagine any version better. It seems so random to me all. Evil magicians, cavemen, monster snakes, medieval castles, grenades, and gliding hangs ?? It fits together. As director Joe Jo√£o did a harmful fit during the preparation of the Cave Dweller (or any other half-a-dozen names) and threw away what he could think on the screen, despite how it was not related or how it relates to the film Already fit into puzzling plot. Acting is bad enough Miles O'Keef could not come out of a waillet paper bag and he proved it again in this film. The rest of the cast is equally outstanding. Then there are there. . . Yes, you can get ideas. It's late, I'm tired, and already I've had enough time to write about this piece of this garbage. To take my word for it ?? Avoid all costs to avoid the cave dwellers (or whatever you want to call it).
