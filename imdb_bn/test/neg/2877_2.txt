The basic plot of 'Marigold' is controversial with romantic comedy, where the film industry is retreated. Ali Carter's acting actress, Marygold stuck in India. That's bad, he's out of the money. He then decided to play a small role in the Bollywood musical instrument so that he could earn enough money to return to his country. Here he will show the love of the Indian choreographer, Salman Khan has played. Basically, the movie fails to script the stage. Just a movie call does not guarantee the quality movie of a Hollywood venture. Marigold stands as the best example. The industrial direction is weak and old. Musical, Marigold turns out to be a bud. Recognized as Shankar-Ehsan-Loye's strong hearing. Actor, Salman is distributing her most amateur performance till date. Ali Larter is good and has infinite screen presence. Very good according to performance, she is good. <br /> <br /> You can get good reviews of this image at http://www.wikingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
