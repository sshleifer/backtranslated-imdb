I saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and this incredible revival, there was a problem staying awake during the miraculous movie. It is a 75 minute film that looks like 175 minutes and is about 20 minutes modest composition. This is not bad in any objectionable way, it only repeats something that has been said many times, much more interesting and exciting. With only a few exceptions, interviews are done in and out and a little more emotional communication or context. This is how to "how" to do something that can not be done. I was alive in the age but felt a slight connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
