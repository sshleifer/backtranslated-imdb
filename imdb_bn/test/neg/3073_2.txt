Some movies have been created so badly that they can be seen fully for the cracking factor. The disciples gave me so much trouble that it was uncomfortable. I have seen all the disbelievers that I saw, no one was not aware of how bad they were when filming? Combine most of the hammed performances from most wooden actors, played the same role from each other 'actors' and the fastest editing (and big time failed) attempts to emphasize the film from all those rushing edits. All this is a film that will hide you in a few hours of your life and give nothing back. Avoid every cost.
