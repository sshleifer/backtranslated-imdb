Adela is a rebel teen who is correct with his attitude and everyone else is wrong. He must be the center of attention and he'll work stupid to do it. He sent his poems to school with his attitude. <br /> <br /> She fills up common characters in today's movie; Cruel, weird one, stepford housewife and sex minority The incident took place and finally Adela talked to "learn his teachings". Atl is trying to bear the deep meaning of the state, but failed to supply it completely (at least I bought it). So what you have kept is the superficial interaction between the same stereotypes you saw in a million movies. Please see the director's chest fiction, Adela blows her bobs a few times, at least I can not see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the picture is okay, but if you are like me and do not like to make a teenager kiss the man and create a U-turn in an instant behavior, which I think is incredibly incredible, twice before watching it Think about it.
