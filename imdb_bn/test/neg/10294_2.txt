I would say, when I saw this movie in the film 6.5, then I think it's valuable to a scene. I was sadly disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is clear that two supposed FBI agents are actually murderers. Can they make it even more obvious? If this film is meant to be "twisted", then it is very sad. Palman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is not a match for a bad screws. Pullman adeptly worked on a socialist murderer part ... and that's the problem. "I'm playing an FBI!" There is no switch from! "I killed only 12 people and boys, my arms are tired." You can not blame the actors ... The story has failed in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I was sure that I was wrong, there would be no director / writer ever a plot "twist." So be blatantly obvious about me To attract the attention of the audience from real killers, Armanund and Pullman must be acting oddly, I thought ... which gave a lot of credit to filmmakers. I should follow my instinct and close it to the movie before even 15 minutes before it even marks it. <br /> <br /> Credit of Lin Ch, he managed to interject many things to a good film: gender, violence, humor, and trained actors. Too bad they were wrong configurations. I hope James can recover from this role ... I found his performance especially impressive, because the stunning drug would be a drug addict-savior. <br /> <br /> Those who compared this image to natural birth killers, they reviewed this role. <br /> <br /> Those who compared this image to natural birth killers, keep in mind: Tarantino has humiliated Mickey and Mallory characters, yet sympathetic. The art of the film makes Gore much stronger and it is never seen in surveillance. The surveillance only seeks the killers of natural birth ... In fact, this movie was also a wet dream about even a fraction of what it was. Those who have not seen surveillance ... do a little bit more intelligence. Camp Rock is like.
