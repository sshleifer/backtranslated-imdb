Oh dear This will be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's incredible repetitive; In every scene, people are shot dead, screaming, or kissing in the face, which quickly become very dust. If war is good then I do not mind, but it is not; The main character, Philips, hit the hooligan laughs with ease and how often he is standing in the full view of the tracker, he never gets hurt, though extra and small letters are being shot and shining around him. I rarely see a bad cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, even if you call him "actor"), it's not really surprising, they have to work with the conversation (sample line: "computer killed my brother!"). Plot is a sub-par ripoff of excellent terminator; Special effects are ridiculous. Overall, this film is just completely awesome. And why is everything exploded?
