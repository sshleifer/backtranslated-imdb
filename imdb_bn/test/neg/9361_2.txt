A woman gets caught catching in a seemingly unexplicable rash of suicide. Then again, is this really suicide? It seems like there is a ghost in the loose. Guess what The ghost has dark black hair that hides its face, and takes it with its head or arms in such a way that makes it very strange for the observer. Recurring theme music announces the arrival of ghosts in an unexpected position, and surprising sound effects - which are heard like the words of small void - are always accompanied by this useless soul. Does it seem to be something? Well, if you see some Asian horror films in the last few years, then it should be done. Taking the loan from "The Ring", "One Last Call", and borrowing loud and unexpectedly from a few recent hit hits, this movie tries to carry an unintended and seductive plot for a climax, but we've seen it before. If you are not disappointed and do not see any other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, then avoid it.
