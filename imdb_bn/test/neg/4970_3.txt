I have seen the movie trailer and cinematography and interesting presentation. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 is sure to be an above average movie. <br /> <br /> The story about Mandy Lane (Amber Hard) ?? A beautiful girl in high school, which is a subject of high sexual desire. Mandy's friend Ammeth (Michael Welch), excited for another classmate to show her love for Mandie, a fellow student drunk dead. Nine months pass and Mandy's teenage weekend is invited to an isolated farm of her teenage friends ?? Three girls and three boys go there! A security guard works at the farmhouse who has Garth (mounted on the Unison). The incident happened on the first night itself ?? After one group members were killed. Who is behind the killings? I do not say to loot the game? Do i like the movie No After the usual attractive opening ?? Each of the movie events takes a downward turn with unfolding. The killer is released by half time, loses all interest in the remaining activities. There is the end of the story threatening the audience, but it disliked me and bowed down and laughed! For all these mysteries? Huh ?? Amber Harold plays a shy and aware girl as well ?? Who is aware of his beauty and the desires of men for him. The remaining cast normal ?? Nothing to say about Teenage boys and girls are going to an exclusive place and gradually someone has many movies by killing them together ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only and most amazing collection of this movie is the cinematography of Darren Jenette ?? Those beautiful pictures captures the perfect picture! (3 out of 10)
