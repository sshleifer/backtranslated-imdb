Mr. Kennedy should close ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie script. What is he thinking? This is a movie that should not be started "Hey, I've got an idea, should not pass". If there was a zero rating, I would like to give it, but I guess I will live permanently for a generous one. 1. These days it seems that if a profit is made then movie executives will dig an old hit and it will run by a set of authors and what turns up. (Hey, I said, "Hit and run!" How I felt when I finished this movie!) How I saw this part of the trash that the light of day went out to me. It's unexpected humor, strange animations and jokes that are filled with confusion rather than a state of confusion. If you're dragging into this movie, and someone is paying for you ... well ... but it's still going to be more painful than a brick on the forehead. However, if you are planning to work hard on your own, find a better option.
