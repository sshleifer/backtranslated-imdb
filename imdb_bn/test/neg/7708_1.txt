All right, I acknowledge that despite the well-documented failure I've enjoyed the house of the dead. I have seen the worst movie ever since Door A Demos. The effect is much higher than DATD. But the plot is weak, everyone's favorite, pornographic films and "characters" decisions and actions focus on consistent foolishness. I want to try Uwe Boll's latest movie theaters to get some ideas from HOTD2's perspective. The only way I'm not suggesting that he really cures, is a case of a different disease, but when your sense is not to be insulted in such a despicable way. Ok it's there. I have run the lowest ten lines and we will not waste any time in the celluloid waste, which is the house of the dead.
