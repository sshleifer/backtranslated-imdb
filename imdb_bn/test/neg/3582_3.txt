I was caught in this North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was beyond the despair. From the audience mood, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a long time to fight, and then refuses to solve it, instead of saying our story "Selecting" will be selected. Does it expose a movie a spoiler? I consider it a warning more. This is the best, only half the movie- and not the better half.
