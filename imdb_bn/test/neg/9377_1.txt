This is the only movie I can think of, after it's finished, everyone involved in creating myself and myself was sitting angry and wasted time. Not surprisingly, Alan Moore has refused to do anything with V. Vendetta (an extraordinary film) after this scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is bad in a way that wants to close your eyes. Plot planet size hole Memory is the worst script. Dreadful acting by a decent actor. The visual will be that great, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could be so good ...
