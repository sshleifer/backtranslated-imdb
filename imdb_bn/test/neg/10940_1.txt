My friend and I hired this movie and in the first 5 minutes we had no idea what's going on. It seems that it should have ended in the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible movie, my younger brother might be better actor than some people in the movie, and the plot was full of holes (if you can call it). I would never recommend this film to my worst enemy, but whoever I really like.
