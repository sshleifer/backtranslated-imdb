One reason I bought this 'film' from a gas station at 3.99 Bin: Billy Draggo, who is my favorite actor. She is terrificly awesome and good, but where it closes. The movie itself is a dirt cheap, horrible terribly terrible effort to the west, and both manage to think, a successful merging does not manage. Along with dragro, acting is so bad that I wanted to put a couch on my ear, the production price was unknown and the script, I do not even know where I will start. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> terrible, shameful, ineligible.
