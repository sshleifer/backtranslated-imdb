Luther the Gick (1990) is even worse by a cruel horror film and trombone value! It bites the head of the chicken, and bites the throat with the man, and in fact he thinks he is like a chicken !!!!! After 25 years, Luther has been released from prison because he has apparently been captured by a "model" and has gained another chance in life (it is very hard to believe how he plays and treats people throughout the film). <br /> <br /> After killing an old lady in a supermarket car park, she sneezes into a lady car and comes forward to torture her daughter and daughter-in-law in her family. <br /> <br /> <br /> We then treated with a long submersible and annoying film, all the way through terrible acting, before a vain police tried to kill Luther! Oh and the film is a ridiculous and ridiculous ending !!! I like low budget horror movies and I think "The toxic avenger" is the best classic of all time, but I'm afraid that Luther is terrible, unreasonable and lazy, not even more on Gore's path, just bloody neck bits and about it! 3/10
