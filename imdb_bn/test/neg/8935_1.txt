In Beverview Cheerleading Camp, two naughty and happy shows, cheerleading teams must interact with the daemons 'tough' bad girl Cheerlinging team, which I think is always to defeat an extraordinary Falcon team that can win this camp. Is this a common clich√©d '80's teenager (hair) sex comedy who you think will win? But the lack of originality of this movie makes it more for bloody horror. Oh and very bad dance numbers and compulsory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stay with the course camp). Just terrible, forgotten, and sadly there is a wonderful lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My grade: F (I actually gave them)
