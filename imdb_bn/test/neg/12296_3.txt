Yes My generation has grown older observers who watched the cartoon cartoon One of the best cartoons in the 80's Joe Tunn television history. Well written stories, well developed characters. It is a magnificent toy commercial but it has definitely helped nothing to convey that line of toys approved. Almost twenty years later and poisoning against Valor. Animation was the most average. The movement of the character sounds dirty and like a doll. The film was felt more like a signature than a soldier's story than a special military force. Then we have the character development or lack there. Dust likes to be all dust? Want to do slice and dice thing together? What? How did the writers write the exact equivalent letters of Jar Jarbeck's development? For the story. I love sai-fi somehow. But the death of the warrior in the death of soldiers in the death of the soldiers in the whole concept of soldiers' binding is the death of the universe. Mega monsters or toxo-zombies? But every 10 minutes I give the creator credit for trying to please fan boys by martial arts action. I am not a big fan of SS and SS, but I like the war scenes between the two. You can appreciate VVV for what it will enjoy. I do not accept VVV being able to appreciate as I should. Again, Joe compared with what was done in the 80's, and honestly nothing compares to the glory day of GI Joe. You can appreciate VVV for what it will enjoy.
