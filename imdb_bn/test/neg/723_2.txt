At first I thought 'Nasan Ka Man' could be one of the progressive new films. As someone mentioned earlier, the movie is not made badly. It is clear that directors use more expensive cameras, good angles, good sound equipment, beautiful appearance actors and nickel positions. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are completely filled. If it is not for all Polish and expensive filters, 'Nassan Ka Man' will look like your ideal, second-rate local movie - - HyperTitactive Drama, Expected Plot Twists, "Yes Right!" Moment, cry, scream, and that characters can keep you less noticed, shoved down all your throat. <br /> <br /> Some things annoy me about this movie. After all, when is sex with the family adopted? That's not an ounce of blood-related argument a difference. Secondly, did the father ask him to keep him secret, because the girl raped her for 40 years no one told? Where was the light in this photo? I know the director has tried to see the super-dramatic thing, but I was simply forced to turn on the feature of the brightness on my TV set.
