I know most other reviews say that this movie was great, but I have to disagree with it. <br /> <br /> Sure, this is a good book! When I was too young it was actually my darling. But it is not meant for the theater. Maybe a little half an hour may be small, but I can not see how they can launch a small kid's book in the whole feature film. <br /> <br /> This is an intelligent movie, but I'll only recommend it to really young kids. Old kids will have no interest in it. If adults see it with their young children, they may have more interest. But anyone in 7-adults will celebrate adolescence. <br /> <br /> Sorry, if you do not agree with me, then this is my opinion. :)
