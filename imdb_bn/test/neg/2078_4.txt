Before publishing whether this movie is valuable for your time, you must know that I have never seen any other adaptation of Carmen, so if you search for others based on how it is reviewed, it may not be used much if you are < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I did not pay much attention to it because I'm open at that time I did not and I did not know anything better. The story has been around 150 years or so. Did I miss this movie later? Yes, primarily because of this plot, but because of all the acting actors like Pazz Waze, I would gladly sit all the adaptations to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> The story is said by the eyes of the director Vicente Aranda (who rewrote the story about Joachim Jarda), the original story writer Prosper Mirimi, who created his way through the 19th century French author. He came across Jose (Leonardo Saberglia), who is a criminal soldier and Carmen (Paz Vega), a tropical, sexy, gypsy woman who has satan's face, Toro 'and those who lead man in shame on their ruins. The moment he meets José, he is attracted by his stand-official behavior. But he hooks him, reels him and lets him go a long time. Until one day, Hussein wanted to kill. Carmen inspires him to join the Gypsy Corollary's band. They seem to settle, she fell in love with her, but she met shiny Escamillo, bullfighter. Can Jose test his jealousy, or destroy him? <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, seductive story, often Shakespearean or Ovid Plot, which portrays great emotions and emotions, which can create or break us and transform us into things from characters. . It's poetic, burning, and above all, slutty. I was left hanging, I did not know any way which was going on. I always hope that Jose Carmen's dirty might change in a small way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I realized that I had a little deeper story, and I realized how much Aranda had managed to recover the classic Mrs. Claire. It was a shallow, slutty time drama wrong, that Peng Vega spent a lot of partially or completely naked (I'm not particularly complaining about this!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was poor. I was not as influenced as Saberugalia Jose. Whether I'm still a weak actor, or I think Joseph is considered to be a weak character, I'm still not sure, I did not read the book. He is supposed to be a man of burning desire of Carmen, but he is mostly confused, jealous and spend a little bit slowly. Pug Vega Carmen was a little better as well. I was convinced by his harsh, evil character, although I saw more rigorous acting by him in other movies such as Japing and Lucia El Saxo. She thinks a gypsy woman is very nice to play (I'm not much like Andalusian Gypsy women), so in a way, the role really does not fit her. Other actors were not great in the film. They started doing everything half-hearted. The story is sensual, emotional ?? They saw half-education, as if they could not wait to wear 19th Century clothing. However, the costumes, I was fascinated - one of the reasons for its release was a movie. I like the Spanish culture, I like the uniforms of the soldiers, the top-hat and women's flamenco dresses. They have a good time planting. That's all I can really say about that. Sorry, behind the criticism. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned script was written with Vicente Aranda and Jokuyim Jordanian and worked so badly that Mary could look at her grave. It was boring. José's acute emotional use was not used for Carmen (or perhaps it was acting). There were pesiled lines on each other and captivating words, both in the words of the devil and Satan, in the words of oath. I know part of the word strange in Spanish, but the picture is full, the word 'whore' was literally bound in every line, probably in Savile of the 19th century poverty was realistic, but the story was not needed. <br /> <br /> The editing and camera operation was neutral and simple. I really like just one thing, and in the mid-middle of the camera's face, a camera will run like a fly-up. That was good. But the rest? Boring <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To the end, it is unfortunate to see such a wonderful story spoiled and operated. If you are a literary teacher, look at this adaptation to get ideas for your class in all ways. However, only half of the male genres give interest to the film, thanks to Paz Wagga. Otherwise, stay in Opera version (though I hate musicals). I give this picture 4, I love the story only for that story! And Paz!
