The worst movie that I saw in 2009 is that: The story is shy about a fool thriller or a fool's comedian. <br /> <br /> As it happens, there are many non-viable long, annoying dialogs that make no sense! <br /> <br /> Custom is famous but there is no passion without fast-forward to play! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a plus beach hotel that looks really vague. Compared to, "burning" is a funfair! <br /> <br /> NB: Many users think that it is located in the French Revier! They are wrong! It's not exactly the opposite of France, (Nice, Kansas): Seabark and Normandy, D-Day's beach be easy! So sea sea ocean and the sun is no more like the sea!
