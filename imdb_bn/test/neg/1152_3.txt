I never heard of this movie until I came to the DVD. I was instantly excited by everything about it: actors, titles, covers, and especially the authors. Arthur Miller, can not you make mistakes with him? Yes I did not read the novel, but I'm going to guess it's a lot better than the film. I had high hopes for this movie. I love Messi and Darne, and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this movie never gets over the message of cookie-writer about racism and prejudice. If you do not see any other movie with this topic, or if you never knew that America was established with the group, then perhaps this movie will be managed by you. Others probably find it predictable, zero, and overall fun.
