I went to this movie with half-high expectations after the love of the cartoon series in childhood, and it almost destroyed the love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, awesome I understand that it's not easy to work with a CGI letter, but it's not really there, but I've actually found all of its performance with its non-animated characters, including the absurd. Chipsmats were adorable, but sometimes the plot of the story is obviously clear, and so I did not lure myself into the theater for more than half of the film's plays. If you think you see this movie, then rent it most. It's not worth the price of eight to see in the theater, unless you want to laugh at a terrible act.
