Governess, away, was a very unfortunate film. I do not use this term very rarely because it was a poor excuse for a movie indeed. I see this feature with just one word to satisfy this ?? "Why"? Really, you can use this question at the end of every scene of this movie and it will feel as fit. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (in both stories and letters) which eventually led to a misleading film that moves through motion rather than explaining to the actors. Scenes occur with drives for any predecessor, understanding or complete completion. It was as if I was really watching different concepts thrown together without any resolution. The actors were setting the event of motion that does not fit or characterize their character. This picture was my biggest problem. Due to the complete and complete lack of this film, all the particles of the basements have become depressed by the original "fluid effect", leaving the rest of the picture to be felt all over the world. <br /> <br /> Explain me more on this lack of consistency across the film. I want to take this film in a bowl of molten otmeal, which has a zebra. It has no ideas and it had no logic behind all of it. Minnie driver was the worst criminal in this work. His character's line was very Fiji and almost transparently painted. She will always do things to talk to her sister about sex, but she is still very open for sexual experience. This is the first moment of his emotion in the film, and there is no pain or excitement in it. It happens instantly, and it does not seem right with Rasina and her sister that our original conversation was at the beginning of the film. He is a very intelligent woman who accidentally found solutions to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly asked for his right to discover? That was confusing and completely random. Is it clear to someone else that his teaching method did not exist. Anyone could see in their right mind that he was not teaching some of Cavendish's girl. The sudden and curious relationship between the driver and Jonathan Rys-Meyers that randomly form me was laughing loudly around me. I have probably discovered some magic in this movie, such as the Rice Meyerce was literally "fascinated" and suddenly some unnecessary plays were created. It seems that the director (or the author) thinks that the original story is not going anywhere, adding this random character, we can take the plot a little further (or may confuse fewer movie enthusiasts). Well, it did not make me fool, I found that he used to play almost a "cut and paste" character to fortify the weak story. Do not start me until the end, which was not compatible with the rest of the story. Again using the "cut-and-paste" method, the author of this movie needs a way to finish the story, and this is the only solution they can reach. Is it sad when the actor is forced to do things out of character ?? But I think the name of the game of Hollywood. Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was in the dribble. There were a number of perfect cinematography moments where you can see that a creative sleeve is trying to meet some pieces of music, but there is nothing to write to Grandma. With some strong role, more family structure can make this picture even stronger, but as I said earlier, leaving your lasting scenes around the whole movie, you will enjoy your foundation. What might seem like a sturdy story, will finally wear with time, and at the end of this film I felt that the house was growing above me. In this movie, Wilkinson observed his usual voice, when the driver apparently did not want to be nude, but everyone else was there (in my picture doctor should be seen after burnings? Eewwww). Also, he wore the same dress every day. That was hateful and I could smell her through television. Sex and dirty laundry Now there is a great film for you! Just here began to be some potential float, but instead it was just garbage. Nothing was answered, the question was felt like snow in Alaska, and medievalism began to rule the highest. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a decent film that can combine together powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just unfortunate. I was not quite boring enough that the characters were running through the motion without any kind of pre-interpretation. I do not need to be handed over to me like a child in a cinematic moment, but something should be done to build a foundation. I remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy used. If you were confused about what you like, then you can fully understand the movie The Goddess, and if you like zebra in your oils ?? Then, maybe this picture is for you! <br /> <br /> Grade: * ***** Outside
