Bright acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effect! If I see what I will say about this movie, then I see a bag of diary for the whole picture on my head. Instead, I tolerated a 2 hour crap-o-Ram. Our "Bright" story begins with a few billion, whose fate is not so much better than the volcano in the terrible endeavor to find out his lucky characters. Instead, he finds a 5'4 "man in a Chess rubber dinosaur suite and some queer cave people. <br /> <br />, his infinite knowledge (along with his infinite big nose) he decided to go inside this" special "people Volcano with a team, to fly this underground land, do they flatten? No. Boats? No. They can use this giant soup with a "solid metal" drill, which I swear I'm a stranger I saw that in short, this film was weaker ... oh right! This is the perfect movie I've seen! Those of you who did not see it and are thinking of sitting with this wonderful Sunday afternoon; I warn you that if you watch this movie You must be ready to spend any roots of your manhood and to give yourself full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> <br /> The system only has the lowest of 1/10. I pay this 10/10!
