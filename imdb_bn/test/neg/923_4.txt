Karb has recently been converted to your Anthusiium, which inspires to look at all seasonal episodes, I hope more than Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie which is the average 'Joe's' life I need to be interested, care, feel and reason to believe. And with Jeff Gallein in Hefazat I also hope a wonderful comedy moment. This image has repeatedly failed me. <br /> <br /> Jeff lives with a mother, a sad tragedy that is a social disaster. He was not a relationship, real or even casual for many years. She seems mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with her mommy darling Can things get worse? Of course. In short, he was dismissed by Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agents, all around him. All his 'damaged' status is strong. Silverman's 'fatty' test was cruel, as stupid as it was. His passion for the role of "Marty" as a way of salvation for his career, even a big death hit. <br /> <br /> While the final moments of the film give a glimpse of the better things for the film's journey, 'there was a lack of sadness, sometimes with golden glimmers.
