I love B movies, but I want to be aware that from the beginning I was watching. I believe some of the aliens and hunters can not upload any movie as bad. <br /> <br /> Alien and the Predator wonderful. This movie made a big joke among them. The producer did not take this movie seriously. I'm extremely disappointed how Straus Jars handles this film. They made an interesting character of amazing characters. They were trying to be serious at the beginning, so their authors went higher. There was almost nothing continuous, the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators. I am very ridiculously sorry that none of the aliens and predators are ever more important. These characters are iconic of American pop culture and the makers of this film have no respect for the original films. Cash in their previous movie names should not be allowed and they should be ashamed of themselves
