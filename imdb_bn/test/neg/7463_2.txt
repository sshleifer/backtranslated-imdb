ATTIC starts off well. The two main actors have been widely supported by a somewhat unreal story, and here a character is under study, but the character of Carrie Snowdress can be bought by monkeys when the film goes on acute speed. Those are not the clearest little monkeys. He bought a real big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot machine kills the movie primarily. It is not only imaginable for a woman like Snowden's plays, but it does not have any reason for anyone, some of whom have somebody else. Come on, come on! Forget it
