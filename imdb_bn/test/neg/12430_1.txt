** Prospective Spolars ** ** <br /> <br /> Whenever bad fans meet for more than a few minutes, a name that always comes is Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has resurrected our other turkeys (Jantar Things), cheap Jack gangster dramas such as a bullet for Pretty Wife, and radioactive conspiracy like the United States and Goodbye soft genes. Loose NESS is a humdinger to say at least at least. Take Action is very tall and narrow, Larry has an extensive and impressed Halloween on the California California lake. Initially, the film brings some amazing (for budget) water photography and still creates some atmosphere. Then, except for the Scottish signs, the voiceless spoken by the anonymous actor deteriorated the conversation, not to mention a soundtrack which would do nothing for the very harmful bagpipe. At one point, the campers "take you high road, I'll take the low road", just to throw in a Scottish cliche. If Scottish people have ever decided to leap into political reforms bandwagon, they will blame Larry Buchanan in this film, despite his title. The giant looks like a giant papier-mache doll and looks awesome in comparison to dragon in Beanie and Cecil than it. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie occupies the land and tries to conceal a fifty foot critter behind a tree to protect it from some golfing soldiers- and the soldiers do not see it! LOCH NESS Horor is a real mind-bogler that must be seen - several times - believe.
