That's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would someone make a movie to get away with the murder !! Mr. Allen again plays the only character he is capable, sexually-impaired person who can not get the girl. Allen, get a formula, it's a reason you can successfully illustrate. Clear this movie! It's time to waste, unless you want to kill someone successfully. I am sorry for the actors who say 'Woody Allen'. Look at his cast, and tell me that those are still working a lot. My respect for actors, who work for him, goes down immediately because they decided to participate in this film.
