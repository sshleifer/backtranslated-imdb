This is not really an awesome film in any of the regular yardsticks. Plot, story, acting, impact, direction - I could go. It is enough to say the poor However, it has a certain appeal. The context shows a lot of sex scenes, it's fun looking for Batman references. Um - that's it. Really poor, do not bother.
