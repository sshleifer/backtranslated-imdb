Hello, I'm Derek Canon and I welcome you the first ever Canoniet Review Shows. This movie was controversial for this week, which movie was a route, I would choose four epic epic, guess that I decided to draw one eighty and move to another road, I decided to review a film so that it was completely a very unique What is the idea of ​​murder? Movies I'll review today Jack Faster Mutant killer Revenge of Snowman Christopher Alport like Sam Tyler, Ileine Seal as Annie Tyler, Marla David Allen Brooks as Marla Clark Agent Manner, Ron Patrol as Jack King, Ron Patrick Murphy as Captain Fan, Colonel and Scott McDonald, Ronaldo as Jack himself. Frost. It is hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredible funny Jack Frost (liked the view of the groom), but it is more difficult to believe that it is exactly the same cast. As soon as they came to the island and the captain's fan turned on, the movie was destroyed for me. What was the point of his character and how did he measure it in a horror movie? The only possible reason I can see is that they wanted to give us a character that was completely killer snowman sheets. Sam Tyler looked more paranoid than that, then he did the original work, the left-hander of the anti-fridge I was the most meritorious exhibit in the movie. But his wife had some bright spots. She played her role in a role as the main woman. She was a voice because she was pure idiocy film. The scene where he killed Snowman was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray McDonald has done a great job like Jack Frost again that he gave. If it is not for weak characters, then he may have been immortal like Chalky, Freddy and Jason. He used to laugh when Jack Frost was curious, and most importantly he had a suspected harmful stroke. <br /> <br /> This movie can be so much, it may have been a great franchise continuation, instead a plan to create a Jack Frost has been canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets two out of 10 for me, and it is lucky that it gets even one.
