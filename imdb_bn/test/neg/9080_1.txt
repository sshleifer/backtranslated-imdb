This is one of the few movies - perhaps the only one - that scared me for the real years. For the first time, I saw people torture, shouting their teeth and crying out. It was brutal; The worst thing I've ever seen in the film <br /> <br /> Clement Mole Och, who played Joseph Girl, still saw the worst character in the film, and I saw thousands. He was so sad that I would never see this movie again, nor would I recommend it. He also saw the appearance of Haniber Lacar like Mr. Rogers. If you are not aware of the victims of torture, then stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know that there are many sick people there, many of them are professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sward, sick stories. This is a "B" movie, however, with some wood played by stupid dialogue and Charles Branson. This is not one of his best efforts. Even if it was, even here you do not want to see many terrific scenes. Trust me in this regard.
