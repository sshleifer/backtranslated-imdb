I really enjoyed BG Season 1-3 and really understand who does not like it. But I can not make this fool. The spellers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are regularizing irregularly stupid things: <br /> <br /> So if Starbucks thinks that why does not he know where the world is? Out in a raptor? Will Admiral resign his third most experienced officer? Qoram will choose their new member, unelected Adama junior? He has a political experience of about three weeks under his belt and he is the son of an unbeliever. Will Adam surrender himself to senior officers by sending Goda and Halo with the studio? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said that the season has been miraculously and referenced to God 3, it is now fully topped. I started watching the BG because I thought it was Psi, not some Bible epics. I hope the letters will behave reasonably intelligent, and ask for some satisfactory explanation about some intense development of the series. <br /> <br /> The Baltic was the best character of the show, but now he seems completely crazy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not a good drama, it's annoying and finding a writer. Be done <br /> <br /> OK, so what are the good points? 4.1 Beautiful war at the beginning. Some good dramatic scenes when viewed in isolation (good acting). A good final scene, a nice cliffhanging curve ball to develop. <br /> <br /> But this is not a Sci Fi, it has become a fantasy. I can not imagine how the author can recover this.
