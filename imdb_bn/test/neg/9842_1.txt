This picture is terrible. The story is simply not unbelievable, the situation is so stupid in situations where it is not frustrating. Broadway's Secret Garden star Daisy Egan feels sad that this is a professional step. The idea is interesting, two young girls are coming very quickly. But the sex is not even arousing. The movie is stupid, the story is stupid, stupid acting, and the idea is flat when the idea is flat. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls came out with their son for the first time and tried to flush their panties under the toilet. Good times next guys are good. My scale * scale *
