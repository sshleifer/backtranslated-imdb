So far I have seen the worst movie this year from Bollywood. I can not lie, my wife liked this picture very much. This picture of Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal did not become unbelievable, but it was Ameesha Patel. When he fell into a dungeon, he played the role of a blind woman lying in the dark (thankfully for him) hero Arjun Rampal came to rescue him (somewhere in the middle). It makes me wonder how a blind girl is aware of the danger when she falls down from a mountain because she can not see her environment. From this scene, I started watching the movie very closely, and Ameesha Patel's acting in every scene was an error. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way he can speak is that he can not keep an eye on his eyes. When I saw this picture, I respected Rani Mukherjee more than playing the Black Film. Acting as an actress can not reach this level. <br /> <br /> She, however, falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's Cliche Story Suddenly Arjuna has killed a man who is crazy about love for Amisha. Amita disappointed, but then Bobby entered the film. She falls in love with a blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor in my view, but he can not drag this picture to a higher level, where Emisha Patel entered the ground deeply. I would say Bobby has a good role to play in better films. Bobby grew up from his first portraiture, and his lovely father gave him He was so bad when he was playing Barasat, but when you see him acting now, you get a shaver and believe in what he says. Only a filmmaker will have to meet him with high potential, like Yash Kapa. <br /> <br /> Whenever Amashya falls in love with Bobby, some people enter her life. Arjun Rampal did not die! Who believes this shit? I do not Why did not he give his role to the ugly son of the movie family (Sushanta Singh or Arian Ramsay) and gave Amitabh Bachchan the role of Bobby in Blockbuster? If my comment sounds like a cry for Bobby-like actress, I'm sorry, but she's a lot better than Ameesha (big screen face) with a movie. It was so terrible that I bought it and sorry.
