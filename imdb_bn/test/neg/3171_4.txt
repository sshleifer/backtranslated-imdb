I think the homegrand is a bad name for this movie - more like "Planetown Gown" - but it does not have much of the same ring. My guide describes it as a comedy, but the sad travails of this helpless buffoons are not my ideas of a belly smile. More in the series of ferrous thrillers / plays. Characters have developed very well - an all star actor Oh-so committed, only shamefully the plot was unreasonable. Ted Danson gave a good cameo in the moving part of Jamie Lee Curtis. John Forest Jovi has this amazing ability to measure the THC content in front of his car! I guess if you have done a few impressions in the past, you'll be able to sit on this one - otherwise it's a shameless paranoid type of gun.
