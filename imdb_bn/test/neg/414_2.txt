I am an historian This movie is so bad that it hurts. Try to see with an open mind, but if you are going to enter a film or a movie of this nature, then at least do some homework related to history, location, church protocols, etc. Stop playing the drunk audience, please. There is something in us that actually comes out of our shoes and theater when some of these nature comes to the city to get rid of the theater. A little research, I'm asking. But then again, it's a joke somewhat of the book itself based on it. So basically, they took a novel with a lot of errors and decided to create a screenplay, millions of dollars in it entered, and distributed the theater release to an incredibly disseminated world, and no one is taking time to do it. It is a lot of research. I know some of my colleagues who made this loan alone for a loan or at least a few weeks have given it to a body of students for research on various subjects? Or just give some money to some people to manage through it because trust me, there are many hungry historians who have grabbed the opportunity to present it.
