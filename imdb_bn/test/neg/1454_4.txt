Before hitting the international acclaim with the Chamber of the Seals, director Jonathan Domme made his tooth crab comedy. It was one of them and many Oscars winner American comedies such as I could mention, it has a fine idea, well-read, great performance, a complex romance. But it's just not too funny. The Pfeiffer crowd moved the city backwaters after the widow who is killing her husband (Baldwin). The criminal makes him guilty of stoning (stockwale) Pfeiffer, Pfeiffer is too angry for his wife (Ruhl) to get angry and to complicate matters, police also go behind her. All this should be a smile for a minute. Pfeiffer, excellent as a cute wig sports sports widow, as well as excellent deals such as Hyperactive Ruehl and Modine excellent. But this script only excludes the oral or physical type one-writer, intelligence, humor or punch line that claims such film. As a result, it is a better smile than Gaffar. It oozes charm, but the tedious short over humor.
