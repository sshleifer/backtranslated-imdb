I found a lousy effort to continue the success of the Dominion story. The original movie is a story about evil, and it can infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Scrude version is a lack of evil. Visitors will not get a great feeling of fear, fear, even foreboding. Harleen's version gives clear evil offers, violates the sanctity of the church and creates a credible story given by Father Marin's background. Schrader's story reveals exactly what happened. The Dominion does not encourage the audience's emotions to express sympathy with Father Marin and wonders why he was frustrated at first place. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in seeing an addiction to the original Exorcist will see: Start.
