The story differs from the first film. The story about a second series war in heaven is good, very good. Religious themed movies are not the main choice for many people, but the angels in war I really like the story, and some imagery give it back to the angels field on Spike .... extraordinary imagery. While the original movie was poor, I could not find any reason for the main character - there were priests and clerks there. The main woman ... there is no reason to stay there, the main character dialogue was empty, there was no substance, the story could be better without them. Now, there are some Starling performance features, Walken, Staltz and Martensen pulled some winger, although their view was mostly with lively Leads. <br /> <br /> One other thing that I can not get from this movie is why the dark soul purge Native American ceremony. This carrier is basically from American American sources, but there is nothing beyond the last scene that connects with that tradition here. The plot was very little for dark souls, the dark soul is considered to be the driver of the whole film. The story behind his real owner is touched, but can not understand why his soul is his special soul. <br /> <br /> I can not find an argument for scrolling scenery shots. In this film, some of the surrounding plains 'Chimney Rock' I think they had a helicopter and wanted to do it the most because there is no relevance to the shots, nor they are with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the science-fi section than scary. There was no real shock or fear scene, some of the light and the blood but no fear element. So, the role played away from the role of 3 this film is a big ole 'bud. Unfortunately the mud factor is good acting factor, just over many weeks overweighs the actor.
