All my friends and other colleagues think this show is so cool. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I can be the only woman alive !!! I just saw it because my best friend respects it and wants to be Charlotte's character! <br /> <br /> The first full plot (if you can call it) is about four women who are supraslut Samantha (Kim Catrul)? Probably each STD is found and Messi, brown and green genes consider the triangle (he will try anyway). <br /> <br /> Not much like Samantha's more than 40 women, compared to nine New Yorkers, Samantha (along with some good NY scenes) is the only reason not to have any kind of entertainment and it is not enough reason. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Christian Davis) is a well-dressed high-class NY New York, who still believes that this princess is an impressive story! But sweet and beautiful, he will not fool you, he is spreading most of the time. <br /> <br /> Now Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is a woman who is stereotyptic, angry feminist I think in one episode that she is a lesbian, but apparently ... she is not a shame. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the most annoying character. I swore I said, I'm looking for more human in Twisted Sister Front Man Daddy Schneider, cross dressing, cc boy, brother! This girl can not live without love for you .... hear a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I love to do it fun because I have heard it is a new awakening for women. Seeing your nightmares, sad, adulterous people drink very sad costume dress realistic and see the cocaine's annoying 15-year-old rallies as you think it is tragic ............ just use Protection.
