The film decides to leave the couple and family dogs as well as The Everglades. When they first arrive there, their neighbors do not welcome the gas minister who forced them to stay away from the cabin, where they spent the night for the week. After quarreling with the old man, three hill areas do not take good care of their arrival and they threaten their cars. Local Dummies can not speak after asking or just do not want to answer, they can finally find the cabin. After they have lived, strange things happen to the audience with discovery in their car, the person who is the chief of this trip, who killed a dog by shooting a dog, thinks that it roams around a killer's door and later ends a series of deaths. The story to add a church group is not even better. Then, in the end, the whole unrest survived fooly shot carrying a gun and moved to the town. Lame That's what this movie is about.
