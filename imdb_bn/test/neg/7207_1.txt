Video distributors like Sab Roja and Bremen Damage Films, used by it, will release low budget, shot-on-video horror films in a selected market in Gorehounds, which will feed them with gleeves. This is acceptable to me, because you can see these movies miles away with their ornate box art and Chess title. <br /> <br /> Now we have Lion Gate in our mix, they decide that they set a "professional" cover on it and poor saps by charging the same price as one of their high-budget, professionally created features. Good to put in. Not suckered by this! Imagine, if you've seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2, you know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it's not on a video store shelf beside professionally created features. <br /> <br /> I have seen a fan of independent film and a lot of budget, shot-on-video production which was still a worthy hire but I have ever seen that it is one of the worst movies. "Acting" (if you can call it) was abysmal. Laughing laughing for a minute or two, laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing The story is bad, the dialogue is bad, somehow acting managed to be even worse. The only possible absence of probabilistic absence is a visible scenario which can still be awful, but the winner effect of a girl's winnability or reward compared to blood splatters after a menopausal dispatine. <br /> <br /> I tried to create it through this whole film, and I did just because I paid good money for it and felt that at least it would end in all ways. Stay away - stay away from these far away.
