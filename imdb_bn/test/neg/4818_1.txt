As a native of New Orleans, I can say almost everything about this film, from Crescent City Geography's tyrannical En'lins dialect, to extremely creative "manipulation". This is one of New Hollywood's movies, which has decided to stereotype New Orleans: 1. A city full of foolish people like French cities. 2. A city that has just returned from the Summer house of Blanche Dubais, is like a full Mothers in the city, where alcohol is consumed every day. 4. The city of deep mysteries, where almost everyone is practicing or being victimized (I admit that we will be the city of drunkards, although the mardas do not consume every day). "Big Easy" is one of the worst films of New Orleans. I will not recommend it to anyone.
