I was extra on this photo but I did not want it to be my garbage. The worst thing about this movie is music but acting, scripts, editing, directions and stories are terrible. The only way to make the budget so low and low budget is to have a good script. The script that should be hijacked before creating the movie is not funny, I could not laugh once. How to make me laugh, the makers think that the film is being made the most important thing, if she takes away her total junk, how she thinks. The film needs more than a million budget and a good writer. The only reason I did not give the film in ten because I'm sorry for a guy who wants to make hundreds of grand grand, if you go and see it, be sure to be drunk at the right time. Haha
