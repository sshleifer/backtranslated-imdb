Apparently, in the eyes of some people - there are not enough horror films in these days that have left the youth behind in a desert by a mysterious, blood-ridden madman of a truck. I mean, we have Joy Joe Ride, Wolf Creek, Zipper Cripps, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP can be very bad for those who are very good. It's a girl and her boyfriend who left their lives to get together in California. Alongside the path, they stop in a scary error so that the young girl can relax herself, but when she comes back - she finds her boyfriend and her car gone. From there, he learned that the criminal is running a yellow pickup, who kicked and hid them in the house. This movie is so annoying that it's annoying. The acting is annoying, the cow's light, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the whole movie, but something memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
