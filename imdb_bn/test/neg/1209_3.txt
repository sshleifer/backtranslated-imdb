It is hard to believe that this movie did not get generated once, but four times! To enjoy most movies, there is a specific 'suspension suspension' requirement, but it takes away one too much. The basic scene is an air force pilot shot on an 'air mid-force' country. The US government is taking steps to bring the pilot's son (Doug Masters) to try to rescue them. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it is a big joke to the US Air Force. In the movie you will see that Doug and his friends manage to make two F-16 airplanes, all the battlefield, fuel, Intel for mission and more secure. This base security seems to be a joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do it. is not it! Several times in the movie, Doug Ground targets off the AIM-9 missiles. AIM means 'missile in Air Interprets', which means the weapon used to reduce the air target. He closed the 15-20 missile, where the maximum F-16 could be 6 AIM-9. Movies also lack the continuity. You will see a plane configured with a set of battles, and in the next scenario, this is a completely different war criminal package. Also, 20mm just does not touch it! An F-16 holds 500 rounds of 20MM, and it is mostly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I can always go from film to plot holes, errors, and wrong mistakes, but I have not bothered you. If you are in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are rather thin. Most military films are related to the army, the navy or the marine region. Like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'A Few Good Men', the Hollywood Air Force can come with the movie, we will be forced to watch movies like 'Iron Eagle' series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
