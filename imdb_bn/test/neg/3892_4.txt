<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics expressed concern about this picture. I saw it and still do not get it. The plot is thin, very thin. Even after the film ended, I still do not know the name of the female character and neither the name of the credit of one of two male characters, she is grateful as a "farmer". I do not care about the character, so I'm not concerned about the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery and cinematography were bright, but the National Geographic or Discovery Channel had such material. <br /> <br> I can not recommend anyone to this movie.
