How horrible it is? Let me count these methods: 1) It's a bit-and-switch movie that starts with a UFO investigation, then a high-pressure sales job for Christians. Come on! If the creators of this movie feel so strongly about their message, why is it incognito? It bother non-believers and push the fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! The characters of this flicker told me to go to church with them, then I would run like hell on the opposite side. They are scary! 3) Acting is terrible. They all behave like an educational movie about etiquette in the workplace. 4) Cinematography is the home movie bad. Wait, it's not even good at all. 5) The script is bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action Like a tennis match, they move backwards in the closing of the "conversation head". 6) Instructions ... Which direction? Oh, there must be a manager anywhere. I challenge where you want to challenge. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I have some positive comments about this movie. Editing takes professional, but can not make a difference. A good edit of bad stuff is still a bad movie. The opening theme was really good music! Very scary and UFO-Ish. The very bad movie was not about the UFO. <br /> <br /> If you can not say before, the following line here. I saw this movie, wasting my money, and it made me angry. If they were not really impersonating about this movie then I can say it was my fault.
