And I could be generous. The vast majority of the movie is footage of the scenes ... great giant, two women are doing the exercises, again the dazzling giant, a crowd of pools, the dazzling giant, despite the wounds, there is nothing worse for wearing. You get the picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The word is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. And in the scene where they tried to "artistic" with the light and camera tactics, the man in question, containing the flashlight on the scene illumination, is clearly visible on the shot. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that the production was the result of some horrific disasters that destroyed the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to get together in the memory of the crew members of the ventricle crews. Have tried to save their life * real * movies - plots and interesting conversations. Sadly, there is no evidence of this, and I was forced to conclude that in the immortal words of Joel and Bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
