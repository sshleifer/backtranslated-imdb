Whether Armanado de Osorio was a good film producer or not ... this film again doubted me seriously. Her blind-dead films are praised by many fans. This is what I can understand. But do not want to be disappointed like Gothic Vampire like Malena, do not show any signs of a gifted filmmaker. And that goes for the SERPIENTE DE MAR. It is a terrible act, a fool plot, a fool, a lot of things that you can expect from a bad monster-film and more experienced actress Raymond, who works best for destroying her path through this movie. He yells about what he's doing. Apparently Millionaire already had very sick while shooting for Surfrent de Mar (his last dramatic feature) and makes it more sad, coming out with such ridiculous stinker. In addition to Peter Cushing in a made TV movie directed by Roy Ward Baker, one last appearance does not change much about it. <br /> <br /> But look at the sock doll / sea snake hoot. It swirl up a lighthouse and crush it. See it destroyed a shelter with small boats. Seeing this, the police are getting taller on the broken small train. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes 3/10 and 7/10
