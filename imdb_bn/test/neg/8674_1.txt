I'm not a Jane Austen Purist, but why not say anything if you do not have to say something <br /> <br /> <br /> Billy Piper was so wrong that it is difficult to know where to start. Wrong personality, modern makeup, completely wrong hair (his young one does not stroll around the public with his hair loose and unhygienic), he is not particularly humble or over the family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The destruction of pieces (as well as those scenes that can be lost in the views of a retinoli in the house of Oh-so-Claustrophobic pink Counterpoint can add.) <br /> <br /> Those who are responsible for them: - If you do not imagine (even so do not matter so much as the budget imagination) please make something meaningful with an adaptation. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> >
