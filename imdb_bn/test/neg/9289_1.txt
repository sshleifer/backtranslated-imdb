Martin Lawrence can be considered as a genius, but those days have gone too much. Rontelat shows a man who tries to play sympathy cards to his grief at once, and whenever he thinks he can benefit from his arrogance, he will take charge. The sad fact was his best days at this moment of his life: after listening to his co-star, half of his funny shows were killed and today he is playing voice and facing the horror of film career. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It feels great after one that the concert film was not made for further inspiration of Lawrence's career after his humiliation, but both of them tried to save his life Trying to make a big effort. And to be proud of it, it's a bit wrapped up, at certain moments that she has shown herself as a 'fame'. Sadly, the concert is becoming just as funny as the gravitational voice of Martin, trying to mislead, and then claims that there is no reason for anyone to be of anyone to someone else than anyone else. The sad fact is that it is a real embarrassment for the public because of Lawrence: He is on the way to express his sad sadness, you want him to run on the stage in his underwear, go around a gun, and restart it again. . There is no real insight on its performance. Many like childhood titles, Martin is trying to create the ultimate moment of his own truth on his own path and unfortunately fails. He wanted to wait e waiting! Instead of a true Hollywood story, to walk on a stage and to make himself fooled for the second time. Perhaps the most tragic thing in this concert film - or, after all, carrier's praise - it's Martin who has no idea what's in it. What was this picture proven? Sadly, his fame was swift, he had a flash of pans before the underwear incident, and now the work he can get is to poke the Will Smith or Pixar production. They may also be known as 'Tombstone' on this concert because this is it. Martin Lawrence just died here on stage, and it can be an interesting career with what happens. now? Only a kind side note in history.
