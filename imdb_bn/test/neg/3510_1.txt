I found the idea that I saw a different movie for most people I've seen this picture. It's not really that I found the movie offensive or something - just this script was incredibly amateur for a movie that had some money in it. I pay tribute to Paul Haggis's work in a million dollar baby script, and I am very disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was frustrating to have a 'racism' version of the traffic, but I do not think the traffic is really a movie that has been left out of the first place. <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst feature is that it feeds on spoon-obscure images. Haggisreally think we're just as stupid as a shot needed? Do you need to see the phone phone book in the Farhad dashboard? Can we not live to do something reasonable for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I had a big problem with such dialogue on the nose. I have heard from one critic that the value of the conversation is deceptively high, because people can not speak this way, but of course they think so. That is irrelevant. This is the work of a script that can use the conversation in such a way that it can be used to set up (in this case very impossible) situations to provide characterization and credibility. All of these characters speak using the same voice and they talk about racism in any matter. <br /> <br /> The objective of such a film should be to preach in such a situation that in such circumstances, the race can not really be a problem, rather it is the sole focus of each scene, whether it is racist itself? Characters revolve around their philosophies and simply memorize the statistics of ethnic relations, even though they only revive the Acts in written research. It is absolutely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> One photo will gradually express its meaning, do not open the mouth before you face it and then will not quit. I can see that the intention of Haggis was honored with the film, but I dared that he could not recognize his own script by handling it and therefore, he would overcome his errors. I really hope that the author / director will be careful in the future when this 'Mosaic' narrative style will reach. It has been good several times, but it is very difficult to get balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman will not be expelled in that section.
