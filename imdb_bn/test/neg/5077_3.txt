I saw this movie in DVD in the morning and was so disappointed that even this was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creator plans to not make a comedy drama. However, at the end, I realized that Mr. Tony Goghio was also very cordial about this movie. It's a sad reason: the conversation is ridiculous, acting poor and solitary, the story is a fishing story! Poor Ryan Phillippe - Despite his efforts, his character in the film is probably his worst performance! What to say for Jason Statham - An imaginary fiction which lacks all the skills for the development of the role ... That's why I vote: 3/10
