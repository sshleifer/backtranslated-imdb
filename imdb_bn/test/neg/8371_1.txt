When I was watching this, I was ready to write an explosive, critical criticism of this "film" (this video actually), but then I saw that someone already did. I quite agree with him. But then again, it seems like a lot of effort and millions of people went on it, so I think you have to give some credit to try them. However, who says that anyone who does not already know the world of lover and what they were trying to publish will probably think ... well, I think, this is not only bad, but it is absolutely no knowledge. Thanks to God, I read the other review section ('a little mad, perhaps?) Which revealed that this guy is "Shand House" (which seems pretty bad, judging by the DVD box), so now I can avoid it and HP Save my mind from further manifesting such profanity of brightness Lovecraft.
