There is a great thriller in this movie, but it was frustrating by the script for about 20 minutes, which was mostly used in the beginning. Anyone who starts to appear in the story of the hole can run through a truck. The film follows the wonderful curve from the time of conclusion to the best from general to bad. It is not recommended.
