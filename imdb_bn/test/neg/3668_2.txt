Confused, miscast, messy, interminable lunacy High gloss mgm offered a budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a wife who dreams of her poor, handsome husband (Robert Taylor) dreams, but she is not a mental killer. MGM's attempt from a Hitachchian thriller started from the beginning, was a Turkid, Molded, Ludicrous script, and the fool's casting of Hepburn was devastated like a dangerous woman for her life (who thought that Hopbern had some fear?) Louis Beyer forgot. He has directed a thriller to tell Vincent MÃ¼nnich, or musical instruments. Taylor is shy. Only Robert Mitcheum is a cast, anti-cast, a quiet, low-cast actor, as a good man. Karl Furrent's extraordinary cinematography created an image of beauty - and was lost in the wrong movie. Last result: "Parnell" of the 1940's Metro.
