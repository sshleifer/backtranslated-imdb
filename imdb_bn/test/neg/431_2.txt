This is a title for a movie search. It is a pitch that some studio executive feels profitable and the rest are enemies. When this image was made, there were two things which CGI did not do well: man, and fur. There were not well furry people to see better people when render by computer. This is just one example, which I can remember that the effects of a good funding squeeze a good leap after the original film. For the record, Verhuvez's design does not help. The filmmakers could not possibly decide between the quadrilateral and the confusion, both tried to do it and were harmful to an animal which looked painfully in the same way. Transitions are physically nonsensical and with a relatively high forehead and short graduation, the end result is the cross between Ron Perlman and Hena. But the parts of the crusher back. This is a movie which is cash based on its predecessor cash. I'm a fan of the original movie of London but not a boy, it looks good in this light. If you think some lately humor is forced, try some hard work here. Bubble gum scene, body humor, dog that ... you know, you only have to see yourself. Thomas Everett spends vacation in Europe with Scott friends and in mid-night, the "ugly American" and Bongi jumped off the Eiffel Tower and decided to break from acting. As a result, he was rescued by a young woman (Deli - Julie is not going to be a star in America. Ask Rupert Hawker, while he is jumping with his death) he is going to be a part of the servants who are suffering ... I'm not sure, something bad . Stereotypes, jamming plots - gloves, melad finish. No matter, only millions of "American Wayuvers in London" in the studio can fool the fan of London to hand over their cash. In most part, they could say that they are wrong.
