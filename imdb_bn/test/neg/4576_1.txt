I went to see "Passion of Mind" because I usually find the continuation of alternate real romance, such as "Sliding doors," "I, me, me," etc. <br /> But this was the worst I ever saw ! I was forced to sit through myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Each type was sexy and interesting. <br /> <br /> In fact, a psychological explanation was given for dual life, which was the annoying frisson of The Elixra Complex; Perhaps this magic should not explain the magic to work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/28/2000)
