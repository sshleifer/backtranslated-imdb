Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is not as bad as it is; In Italy, a Spanish / Italian co-production picture is managed by an alias using "dish ash" (!), The film is unfinished but usually disconnected and manages it in large amounts of shadowed letters for $ 1,000,000 in hidden searches by gangster Cesar Romero. Despite the third bill after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman - the credit sequence even before the rolling ends!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's basically a tragedy clause which is basically a slave Clauses - who are embarrassed to be embarrassed to send money back from a Sicilian-accustomed American Treasury agent (whose name publisher, does not seem to have any right!). Having "vague", but instead, it is always in trouble - though in the end he finds looting, swirls curiosity and conquers the girl (Martelli Romero's daughter, whom she waste a little bit here) !! However, the best moments in the film are provided by Sue gangster Ricardo Gar√≥n: Without the use of his strong-minded personality and subtle lecture, he travels with three nitwits, which is often not a barrier in terms of his plans! Also, considering the story that is being established in Rome, the police officer investigating the case is Spaniard (an uncertainty of the co-production agreement)! For a few years, I missed Hoffman's other Italian comedy - Alfredo, Alfredo (1972) - most of the time (I think Leonard Multin only has its rate * 1/2 of her "movies and videos Guide "... but then, MAGGEN MILLION gets a BOMB!); With the impressive Stefania Sandrai director and co-star Peter Germi, the film's credentials are of course more respectable and I hope it will be rolled out again on the Italian TV ...
