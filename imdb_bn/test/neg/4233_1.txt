I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and would not recommend it. It's two and a half hours long, when there is no kind of void-on-parise speed. <br /> <br /> The main characters are lazy and completely lacking in charisma or personality. Nobody laughs at the time of the film (even if I did not have them), and although Domino seems to be a healthy sexual appetite, she can not enjoy sex in any way. <br /> <br /> The whole experience was frustrating and the scholars, the director on each scene pushed me in a way that made me crazy instead of hitting me with the beauty of her technique. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of questions left over why? Does he dump Algeria's people? Why does he lift? What is he looking for on the allocation fence? Why is he kissed Joseph? Instead of ordering another bottle of wine in the baggy juice, why did we go to see this garbage?
