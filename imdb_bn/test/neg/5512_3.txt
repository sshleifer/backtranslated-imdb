This film is a great effort to ride the skirtales of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses another recycled footage from "Bizzed Bounce the Scarce" which is better than another Roger Cromman Saa-Fi Trude, but at least it is better than "Stars Bounce of the Stars" - this movie does not have any real role (but it's Roger Croamen film-you What was expected) The whole soundtrack was made in keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects were available from "Blaster Galactica" Recycled - there is no special effect because it has been recycled / reworked from any other movie, the costume costume is something to be saved from the liberation war of 1981. - Onyxili, the youngest son of the film, gave the performance of Hellouva, and she would encourage her to play again in the Sylvester Stallone film "Over the Top" - I'll give 3 of these 10 stars to the film
