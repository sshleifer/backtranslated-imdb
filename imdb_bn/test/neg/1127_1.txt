To quote Clark Griswald (on the original Christmas vacation): "How do things get worse?" "Look around here, Alan, we're in the threshold of hell." Little did he know about Shevy Chase that he was describing one of his best films as "Sickle". Christmas vacation second sets a new high (or maybe it should be less) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD, it would actually be considered as a sequel of origin, but we were very disappointed. Lam this picture. It is not compatible with the original, it is a complete waste of film, and embarrassing for other good actors, who were lucky to be part of it. This is to record a record in IMDB for the worst reviews. I really think we have a good case to win a class action suit for the recovery of the money that we have restored in this movie.
