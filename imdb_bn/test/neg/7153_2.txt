This is a road movie. At least the movie yellow ANF is a road movie that I think (?) Offers. I can not say much positive about delivery. It's bad acting, of course their English. The camera looks like it is made by a child, there is a bomb with the counter and suddenly a beetle descends from the sky. Since it was so great, we actually submerged the whole time - and it was the most interesting movie. This movie will be released in America, but I'm not sure that you have to go because it can recommend the quality that we produced. Explosion boring look Basically everything is above. Everything is too high: Find all the cool parts of yellow films, sounds, children, etc. In other movies, keep them together and you have delivery.
