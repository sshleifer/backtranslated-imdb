This picture is the worst movie of my life that I have ever seen. To get access to a former husband, a woman tells "The X" to be a lot of people. To achieve its goal, kill people for the reason in the bath. I do not think that women never went to acting college. He only spells out the whole picture in silly expressions, and seems like he is trying his utmost hard to look at the camera. Mostly failing He made friends with his former husband and son, he did this to use her husband against them. When you first see this movie, you think that "ex" wants to kill his ex-husband, perhaps because of his bad behavior. But in reality women are overwhelmed with people and want him back. Both of them enjoyed moderate entertainment (of course using whip). My advice to the general public is not to buy this film, rent this movie and I do not see it (at 1.15 in Fox)
