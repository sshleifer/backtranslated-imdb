It is a story in which an old man tells a story about his youth. However, you see issues related to personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc. which are used by the end of the 20th century and used by August 21st. <br /> <br /> Then when this person says this story - in 2020 See, how well we are then. How is that saying to us? <br /> <br /> There are also many legal problems that do not give any sense. In the court scene, this story falls in the natural form of amazing evidence, which is unacceptable in a real court in this country. Also, before being officially announced, in most states, Grandmothers must be absent for at least seven years. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Elmo Sternshares You are now officially a SELLOUT.
