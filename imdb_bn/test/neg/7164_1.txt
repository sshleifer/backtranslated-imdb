Such films disappoint me easily because they are not worthy of money that enables them to end in my DVD player. This movie is confused with its jacket blogger and even more irrational in its casting choices (why Mr. Song is a romantic interest? Why do they just want an Asian woman there, or does its unbelievably intelligent character actually lend the story of this "message" movie a new perspective)? Little to go ahead of this movie, and the lesser the story is, the less it is. But in a good hour in the process, I realize that all Casting agents of damp cast can be frustrated, the results of the brain's carrier's results in the study of incompatible character, and neglected by stories disrespectful and tragic problems, capitalism, materialism, and the forward of the modern world. At the end of this movie, I had been closed for the last two minutes and I thought that "Avery's Gone Green" was a product of the world's "connections" - someone with very little talent knew some very little skill, absolutely no marketing sense (but With plenty of disposable ego) knew someone out and popped out this lazy and inefficient effort with a weird and humorous-a-conscience. And this is the most tragic - how many infinite good scripts have been sent to this unexpected trip? Leave this picture, and feel good about yourself for doing so.
