The Americans came to the strange house of Will (Greg Evgen), Mara (Alexander Paul) and their little girl Abrry (Brianna Evigon, daughter of Greg, the real life) when they came to a big, new heir house in Ireland. The spotted bodies are found inside the house, a kukalal granny is shown to scare turkeys, run furniture and frighten the ghost of the deceased child and the little girl. Unusual investigators were finally called upon to eliminate the evil spirit, but became overwhelmed by any means of death and left everyone around the clay of the flesh. <br /> <br /> This image is full of clips, but there is a standout performance from Alexandra Paul. .. very bad it does not belong to this movie (someone else can think I'm close to hand)! She can keep a straight face slightly and see her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums can make a joy. In any case, it is much more interesting than seeing anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
