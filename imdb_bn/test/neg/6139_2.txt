**************************************************************************************************** **** Bcroft) who said he was going to commit suicide. It is an impressive courtyard which extends all the velocity and excitement. The bright hook turns out to be a deceiver - the story follows the lack of substances, gravity and revelatory values. Shock and surprise like a mother and a daughter can have the last conversation of their life? Where is the mystery revealed, confessions and imagination and regrets? They are here, but all of them are portrayed in a colorful color that holds the emotion in the background and celebrates the 'talent' of the playwright, Marsh Norman for all other expenses. The result is not a film, but a tedious patience test. <br /> <br /> I said that CC Speaks must be one of the best actors in motion picture history, a woman so magnetic, she surprised and stardom twenty years later surprised me that so natural. All that he does comes with the touch of classes and magic and I have retrieved more than one movie from his angel's face and weak eyes, his soft voice and sweet smile reusable bin. Because of the first spacecraft, I have seen this movie in the first place and it will be a failure in a significant way to make her a movie terrible. This image fails in both of them. <br /> <br /> The first and foremost film is so faithfully accepted from the Pulitzer-winning stage game that it is clustrophobic and repetitive. The whole film is a dialogue between two women between Jays and his mother. What has worked on the stage - For two hours in the middle house of a middle-aged mother and daughter is being claimed - died in the picture. A game, no matter how great, * Adaptive * requirements for the screen ?? It is authoritarian and arrogant that the conversation is so perfect that one word can not be changed. The screenplay for this movie can be summarized from thirty to forty pages, and an intelligent photographer gives some brilliant spacer and able bandwidth to break some * physical * sequences, some facial reactions, wall-to-wall ek festivals. And a single set like prison. It is not surprising that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright, Marshan Norman, who knew the theater but revealed himself to be fooled by the film himself. <br /> <br /> I can not strengthen the effect of the stage-script script, there is a film. Jesse and his mother are debating about Jessie's upcoming suicide, which is ineffective and lazy. Women roam in the living room in the living room and go back to the living room, where they start again. A small midwestern house is not a standard set for a single set film, and the director never tries to make a trick or original effort, trying to break solidarity with an external shot or cutaway or flashback or * some *. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... Only two women cover the couch cushion and dispute their views. Dedicated to pay tribute to the game ?? Even shakes up for Shakespeare's mainstream classic screen. Does the original game seem almost annoying ?? It seems that the film was created to create a dramatic billionaire document, which was in a phased manner with the audience. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for the film's failure is Anne Bancroft. She can be a good stage actress, but in film - where 80% presence is present - she rarely fits. She is definitely playing mid-western grandmother, but her morning coffee does not fit much before looking like Mrs. Robinson. He has been behind Jesse in the house, is looking more excited than surprising, and feels unusually disrespectful, even when his lines reveal loving-defective women. <br /> <br /> He is always honest, honest and best. Open and so good that you actually agree with and agree to the character of his character. Sissy lets us see that Jesse has a flat tire, a bad mistake that has a bad break and has made many mistakes. He could never control his life, and his suicide would eventually be the way to say "no more - I'm going to stop this place." As he keeps, Spesak talks? You hear He has proved in all of his films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, all of them will not be curvaceous and barbarous and should not borrow a testosterone. In this movie and "Cole Monir's Girl", he has quietly demonstrated soft strength and quiet depth, which is as fascinating as hypnotic? You can not help but fall in love. <br /> <br /> so for me so much night "Night, Mother". Spasak has broken into a film stilt stunt that can never be busy or confused. I will not recommend this movie to anyone other than the deadly fans of CC and even you will be disappointed. I give the film a complete character grade bonus for the last, which is brave enough for the lead character * to * * and a hackneyed happy ending enough to end up pandarara enough courageous. Grade: C.
