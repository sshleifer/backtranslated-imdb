This movie is called "Why Solomon". That's not what it is. The main character wears a hat, but it is in line with Robert Howard's character, Solomon Kane, which is known from the early torch magazines and many publications since this day. This is a fiction film, it is not really bad and it can easily pass with a good review - if it is not called Solomon why. The hero is a new inventive character that is not explicitly called SK. The story is not Robert Howard; <br /> <br /> <br /> After a series of fiction movies, it's another movie: Easy Story, Poor CGI, Poor Actor, Poor Instructions. Yet it may be fun, you know: 'They are cheap, they are good.' But since it is called Solomon ears, I can not accept it. Imagine a hero, Billbo of the blogger of the ring movie, who killed the black-eyed Sagaph with the help of his left-back friend Argour and the beautiful heroine Shadoffax. And in a final battle where three witch rings use the evil wizard, who transforms into the Dragon Gondorian. Imagine that How did the movie complete with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane? <br /> <br /> If this is another horror movie, then I will review it 4 stars, but since it is known as Solomon Why, I can only rate 3 stars.
