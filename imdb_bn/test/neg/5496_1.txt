R.I.C.C.O. STUPIDEST film is ever made. I can not believe my father was bought by this bad guy. This film should not be buddies. If this film was widely known, believe me it would be the # 1 place for IMDB's worst conditions. The act is horrific, it is scary, which is why it is awful. *** There was no horror at this piece at all. It's an urban action, which is funny, because I can swear it was a comedy. I can not help but smile when people shoot. The only person I've just reviewed and I hope I'm finished By this vote I hope it will be in the worst position at # 1 place !!!!!!!
