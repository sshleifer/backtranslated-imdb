One of the movies in Ayan is where you find Indian cinema loop holes. Here's a good example to show how frustrating it is to a great writer, director, and actor-makers. Mohanlal, one of the most wonderful actors in a movie in a real story of Kashmir. Image seriousness is shot with sub-standard comic scenes and songs. This character is Havaldar Jayakumar, who, in fact, is the film's producer's son. Therefore, her officer does not even care for her hair despite her asking him to do this. This child does not know what he is acting and he is the hero of the film. God helped the Indian movie with such producers. <br /> <br /> This film is a compassionate show of what is going on in Kashmir. An intelligent audience can easily understand the limitation of such great writers, actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences. But unfortunately, a film about the largest number of films in the Indian Militias has been shown to be a kind-hearted display, which simply feels the movie is stupid. <br /> <br /> We will eliminate producers such as film industry and prepare the way for better movies.
