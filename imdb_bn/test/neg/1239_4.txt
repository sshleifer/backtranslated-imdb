I have seen the first two nights before finding some information on IMDB. I saw a 9+ rating which was astonished at me because I was not impressed by what I saw. (As a reference, I believe that Lonsom Dove was the best TV Western ever. I grew up behind the MGM in the city of Kolkata in the 50's and respected Western style. So I saw the first light and read "more" I have got a number of reviews with 1 or 2 stars which lacked character development, poor editing, it's universal backlot Mm has been a long time) Thinking that the shot has made my feelings better and the overall impression that it was not my feeling of change in LD is coming near. I think those who wanted to write were "less than 4.0 "<br /> <br /> It got me to be amazed about the process of getting a rating of + 9+, if people 10s and 9s providers justify their vote. War is not the time, then stuffed the ballot box by the financial motivation of the people? I am using for a long time aiemadibi screen to show movies and think it is the best available. Now I'm not so sure.
