The worst movie I've ever seen The quality of the words was bad, the scenes were even worse and the above was not the argument at all and it was no speculation ... <br /> <br /> I first thought: "Oh no, I did not want that the PALIC was a innocent killer That trill is proof that ". But this turned out to be even worse. Generally you get a super-hint or a hint in this American film. I want a very small hint that indicates to the killer. The audience does not involve. And now, when I do not get any indication, you can finally expect some of the few / she-of-the-killers' greetings. And that's not all. Ah ... it is frustrating, let it finish ... <br /> <br /> In a word: hateful .. <br /> <br /> <br />
