Yes, I finally made it all the way. Although it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I was a director of Setup, I was thinking. Acting ... Well, I do not even know what to say. I thought that playing Emily, she tried her best with a boring, sometimes painful and sometimes anticipated conversation. <br /> <br /> I know that it was a low budget but the hollow term and unfortunately the look was like a 100-minute long audition tape and turned into a word. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk to the end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not recommend anyone in this movie. For those lesbians who do not have many movies to watch together, it's nothing to waste your time. If you are looking for a sad lesbian-themed movie then off of children, steal and see the wrong or high-art. All of them will make you sad and depressed, but you do not have to suffer the cinematic hell in this process.
