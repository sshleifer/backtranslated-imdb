Because I gave 4 reasons for this movie for a few reasons, but this movie was not bad. First off, the edit that I got was very nice, the script (or what they had) was not very good, and if Nunjio was not for La Bianca, the act would have been frustrating. But all that aside (O O I know it like the whole movie) it's not that bad for an extremely low ed. , Low budget film. If they make more money then they are a good actor (but they were scared so it was good) and this film would be even more awesome. Some people would tell me that this man was very much influenced by the fighters of Walter Hill. I mean it just like this movie. Anyone who saw both films will agree with me.
