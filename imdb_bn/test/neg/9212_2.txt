Very poor quality and acting equally bad. This movie is a major example of today's England and mentality. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie, and the movie is not the nature of Christianity, which is most known. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised because this movie has left the BBC program and the BBC well known for its quality programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to challenge Hollywood's psycho / drama movies is completely unsuccessful. . <br /> <br /> Poor performance, poor plot, poor culture, which seems without religion. I do not want to buy it, instead it should try to rent it or buy it when it comes to $ 2.
