This movie is a group of women (most notably the highest honor) who are heading towards a small castle, to buy property for the recently released mummies where they plan to set up the shop. They will not be able to go there (even 15 miles away) when they arrive in the nearby town, so they will walk. When they arrive there they do not have any soldiers there, but a good amount of people who have used the fort and have built a small town nearby. They did nothing right here shortly and some serious problems in Fort McMillan (FT. DOM as locals). <br /> <br /> Instead of the Plot Line, I will comment on the things that I have seen about the movie. The first very flat off of acting, only a few people seem to be real enough to believe. Although my first was poor performance, but in the end I saw some outtakes and these same people became alive. So the rest of my sole concern is how the director wanted this. Above bad acting, I'm a great problem where people do not react correctly in a particular set situation. Take, for example, which is only 15 miles away for them, but it takes Macmillan to fit it for any price. However, when we reach the fort, we will see that it is well-governed by a systematic population, each of which will be provided, not to mention the mail, etc. This should be done in 1867, but we can see that the railroad car is not so popular in one of the general styles of the electric lamp (they are at least not) and at least 30 years later an engine engine engine. There are places where you can see curved black letters (and probably do not want to go back to a car in a car and bother to look for) and other anachronistic items. If they follow the rules of "world" and actors can be actors, it has got 4 instead of 2, and they can re-write it 4 times better.
