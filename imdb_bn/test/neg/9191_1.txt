This is really a curinge making exercise. As a tribute to fire fighters, it is in the stupid view of "we are just a bunch of cruel people" in the middle of "It can be intelligent that my happiness can be really dangerous". Mostly it's just plain stupid You can not believe for a single minute that real fire fighters work like this. It is very terrible I can not bear the clock at the time. If my daughter does not rent and insists on seeing it till finally, I do not have the option to stop it. <br /> <br /> Things I'm John Travolta Fan I have seen all his interviews in my opinion only about him. I feel strongly for this money. I'm sure he'll be happy to forget this.
