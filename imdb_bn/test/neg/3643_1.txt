This is a bad show in Nikkedian history. Above all, a boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen TV, and a laptop to each student. This show makes so unreal, and annoying. Plot is pointless, and incredibly annoying. Actor is so bad, it wants me to take my life. I really hate the show, the most popular girl in the school at gambling, and is loving, and intelligent, and gets the best grade without any work. He has no real problem, and every man wants to make his date. She is so perfect. There is no one there. Also, I hate that everyone will do something for him, and everyone likes him for every team or club. It's very annoying. Quinn is so obnoxious His experiments are devoted, pointless, and fake. Chase is such a wimp. He said that he loves Joke, but if he tells him, it will ruin their friendship. How merciful Michael tried to be funny, but he accomplishes something. Nicole is so painful, and many screams. He is not seen doing any work, or studying, but he is a straight student. Lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (forgive me in my language). I want to say more? I do not think so. Stay away from this show at all times, for your own good.
