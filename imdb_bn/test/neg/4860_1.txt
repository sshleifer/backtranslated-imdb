To wait for the picture I wanted to see, click on the Encore Mystery channel, I caught the shadow conspiracy just a few minutes. An old man meets Charlie and holds him by the hand. Suddenly, in a bright rainbow, a murderer taps the old man (beside his hand) across the street. Waiting for "C" to wait, "A" tries to shoot "A" and misses clearly. "C" was a very simple goal, the old man could not escape. Duh! On the roof there is "A" lift and "C", "A" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the wire, which is parallel to "A". He hits, and cables, impossible severs. Later, at this time with a special rifle, the "A" lines range from 50 meters to "C" lines, but the motorcycle is coming and stacked to tweak the Ryder instead. How does Charlie get his part? Daddy goes to the producers and says, "Look, my child needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid sit-down. Good without all the actors, yes ... you got it. I usually have to wait 2 or 3 minutes for that CSI. Come over Let's see, what can I do next hour? I know, I'll trim my tunnel! My time is very good use.
