I ran across Yevette McClelland in a photo at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought that he was a doll. After writing my review of her photo there, I wanted to see her more! This movie is available, it was quite bad. It's not his fault, he's only in a few minutes where he is probably the person to attract you to see this bad movie. BAD instructions. With all actresses, the scene is over and looped over. Amber Smith acted in a very bad breasts yet another actress looked pretty well. But I really liked Yvette, this was probably her a bad choice. I can not believe I hired this trash in search of him. I hope to find her other movies.
