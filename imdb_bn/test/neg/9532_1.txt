This is one of the road movies that you want to tell about the terrible consolidation of women, the universe, the good life, the terrible consolidation of Manhattan's bright architects, who remove the links with everyone, including their three-year-old child. Something might seem unlawful - in fact the hero's selfishness and the view of Pal Pal of his old school, which starts as a good old day conversation and ends in a threatened note, is a wilderness film forest. <br /> <br /> In the parents-to-house-when-there-a child has been told and said and told. Of course it does not prevent the child from protecting his life. And when you see the attitude of the hero's wife, you can remember that she has never heard of the release of the woman. <br /> <br /> The best soundtrack that contains great songs from Wiley Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Wright ... but you can enjoy them without this annoying ugly work.
