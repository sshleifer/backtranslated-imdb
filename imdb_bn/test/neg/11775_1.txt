There is nothing to see here. It has been all (and well) before. Who is this woman caring - lack of every way - as a mother and as a friend as a mother? At one moment when he could take the high road - he became addicted to both legs and breathed his breath - "Me too," there is no better reason! If he is not a beautiful and young person, he portrays on the screen - but like the actual human ruins that are presented by our family members, neighbors and friends, who are actually involved in the attachment, we want to change the channel in a nanosecond. <BR> <br /> This movie starts downwards and goes downhill. Nothing is broken, no lesson to teach - nothing emerges in any way. None of the main character, even expressing sympathy, let alone sympathy. (Well, maybe snake.) If I wanted to close a door in my hand I would have been more fun. Who needs to drivel like this?
