All right, this brother bought me a few times before, who took me to "see the short" in the movie, which was both influenced by "uber". And both get to get tiny and one after another saw to be cool. I have read reviews of people who did not see their childhood and this picture was quite good .... I think there is another way to cheat the money-making customers. What is this picture of my WTF? After about 10 years and Chilean pamas became a pussy .... the script was basically the same, after the success of Flop Fiction, they gathered Trivalta and Thurman, some big stars (as well as load load of words) and thought that it was going to be good. ... Vince Vaughn's character was simply boring, though I was both a fan of both Rock and Rock, despite the use of both actors and under unrealism. Basically I am glad that it was bought as a gift for me so that I paid for it, I would have been very annoyed.
