I just finished this unauthorized orientation of HP. In Louisiana, the boyfriend "The Lukking Fear" was shot. Outside some changes (name, setting), it follows the story of the short story by the dot for the first 70 minutes, but indicates its own "packing" that you can see from a mile away. By any means, it is a much better adaptation than the full Moon Sun. Very bad it's a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots things with an all-flash in the art short. I swear I may have counted two camera movements. Animal design is cheap (we're talking about buying a mask here in the shop) but they are in a dark way (intentional or not) shot where they are somewhat vague. The most fascinating thing in the picture is the abandoned palace but McCormick fails to absorb that as well. Good adaptation, file this one under poor execution.
