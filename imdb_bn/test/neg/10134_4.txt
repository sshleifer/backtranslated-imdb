Think of yourself trapped inside a dark medieval era museum and a resurgent vampire and its Maniacic Sidekick follows you. Where do you want to hide the absolute place? I'll say New Yorkberg torture machine Virgin Virgins, because a good risk you can brutally die. And yet, the elderly lady of this movie walks in silently in her tearless coffin. "The Vampires Coffin" is a frustrating series, because director Fernando Mendes did not rebuild the original Gothic atmosphere of 1957, but emphasized ridiculous situations and dialogue. Ugly cobwebs and more evil palaces with dark vaults, but confused doctors and tired assistants excite that frights instead of smile. This story opens at the final resting place of Kent De Laud, where a prominent doctor and tenant assistant assistant clinic stole the coffin to test the dead body. Naturally wood is removed from his heart and the number of vampires is still alive, immediately the little thief slaughtered for his filthy work. A beautiful female patient at the vampire clinic has her eyes, and it is for her soul to recover and destroy bloodsucker. Until Enrique Saldivar. "The vampires coffin" is in limited quantity and there are very small steps. The whole film would be really annoying if it was not for a box of memorable sequences and modest acting performances. Photography is amazing, though, with the magnificent use of shadows and dark. This scene is seen in most cases, where Count de Luvud calls a young girl on a lonely street in the small town by night. It is the only true visual scene in the film, the rest is roughly medium and day-to-day.
