This movie was frustrating. After 15 years, when some information about Mariam Hemingway was brought back in mind, then the reactions that I felt about this movie came back. Although I think of Peter O'Wowel, I was completely oblivious that the woman was "Lead" (OK, she had a little more than she had for the discussion of the story) was Miss Hemingway. I wrote a movie review when I watched the movie, and warned people, the stories did not work properly, and trying to sort things for fifteen years of my subconscious still did not create the feeling of flux <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> The original part of the original movie (which was anything) was painted after the film, it could be seen, an editor came and tried to find something. Ilena. It's about I do not know whether this was a project of the previous studio boss, and it was threatened to disrespect the heir, or it was rescued from the original screenplay, which failed to recover. The dramatic version just did not work.
