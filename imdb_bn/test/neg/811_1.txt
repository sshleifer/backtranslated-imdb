Founded in 1945, Scanbert follows a Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train in Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he was a walking disaster, which led to the greatness he created everywhere. On the train plans to kill a man and his daughter's daughter, his wife (who is also on the train), a soldier is going home, two elderly gentlemen, a angry train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, even more people. <br /> <br /> Nir-Isha Thriller (which is quite good - at least for starters) is sweet with mixing, and comedy, both films fail. The film will not change the voice with a new scene and sit properly. And when the train moves towards its final destination, the film becomes even more weird, the real real end of the note is gone. <br /> <br /> Good bits are lost in timeless plots and letters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors, regardless of how small it is. It seems that the filmmakers have worked with them and they gave a part to their film. Very bad performance is as bad as scripts (your lines work - do not read them!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Specially dragging scenes for almost ten minutes instantly (quite often, in fact) incredibly slow. The photographer thinks that swearing is a good way to replace good conversations. Although the movie looks great on movie B and Wade, but it has been lost in other sections such as for making a stupid movie. [1/10]
