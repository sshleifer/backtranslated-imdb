Michael Alrede's comic book story, especially his work on Madman, is usually funny. "Astroesque," Allyd's budget indy film, reversed fun. <br /> <br /> The most horrific acting really makes for a cruel cinematic experience really combined with a terrific dialogue. Very sure ALREAD is running WTF's ongoing, but he is the only one. It's not enough to dare to see the whole mess ... The more targeted you are to resist the whole mess. <br /> <br /> "Astroscope" is Allred's "Some Roots on the Red Rocket Film Tie-7" comic book, which is amazing, mostly unreadable. So if your "Astroesque" experience is not terrible enough then look for complete comics and continue to have fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also sorry for me, what is an incredible waste of time and money? Buy my VHS copy, which is now available in eBay. Hurry up.
