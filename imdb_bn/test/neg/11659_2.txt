What I can do is reflect the attitude expressed by other commentators. It meets the Happy Days of the City of Allah. Ruthless thief's dualism (one minute ruthless killer, the next minute a lover's diaper commercial) is completely stagnant. You can contact it in two ways: (1) a lively, realistic movie turned sad; Or (2) A sad, ABC-afterschool-special with prejudice, violence and animal cruelty. It does not fly in any way, is not it? Why so much praise? As others say, they get a "Conscience vote" in the west. Showcase our image of poverty against our sculpture, double-wide theater seats and 44-oz Cox's Bazar, and we would appreciate a heartbeat. But - Oh, do not forget the candy quote, because the bitter pill of the reality (like tannery) is hard for us to swallow. <br /> <br /> I will get many disappointments and congratulations on this film, especially when there are many other worthwhile films. What I can say is: Be careful about the films that get award (Hollywood Oscar = Sweeping, Syrapie Trip, Cannes Film Festival = Beard-Stain, uneducated publicity). To find the real gems, you have to work hard on it.
