Imagine, the Hoover 2 was better than the Bow Capacitance which was the first, but the sinking is not better than being alive. Okay, I'm a little harder with this one, it's just video game adaptations of jammy movies always put a bad taste in my mouth. The resident Evil was right, but his sequels are pure garbage. The first HOTD was noisy entertainment than anything else; Uwe bowed that saw. And the hotbed was 2 ... well? Entertainment was worth, there was a hot girl, she was proud, but ... what is it? The script, though subpar, was better than the first one. But scripts in horror written letters, stupid action sequences, clichés, and shocks towards the end and reach the level of ridicule that booleyester is very proud. But, could it be worse? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hotdream 2 star Sig Hig (yes, Sid Hague) You can guess, it goes all sh *. A nearby college campus seems to be the center of the zombo (or hyperpion?) Epidemic, and you can expect that a team of commandos and two Jumboists scientists are going there and trying to save the world by neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No, it does not blow up sh * t. Instead, they will get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a healing of deadly viruses. In it and it gives blood-character interactions, an inevitable quantity clichés (but, hey, at least black guy is not the first to be killed), and offers decent looking zombies. <br /> <br /> Playable. Was Sticky Funge a qualified actor? I do not Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine somewhat as final. And supporting cast was very passable. It was all passable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore was just right. Cheap fear and even cheap tension are almost unattainable in this movie, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid as * C *, but at least no sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet was not impacted. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will only apply for fans of Junk enthusiasts, arcade games, and people who want to rent a cheap horror movie at the weekend. Apparently the end signal is going to be the third one, but I will not rely on it. Uwe decides to do it. A 4
