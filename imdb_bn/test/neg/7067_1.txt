. . . And sometimes, to see it. Now, I have been watching bad scifi movies for years. I love watching bad scifi movies. I think this is the only reason I can see this movie completely. I worked hard with "Nookie", "Indian Superman" and the terrible "Fantasia Four" film, just to name a few examples. Generally, after I saw a bad movie in the pain some go away I would have to beat my head against the wall. No, this is not the one. With "TDB", I hit myself with shoes in the middle of the movie. Temporary fix I can not believe that I want to see. I waved. When I was finished, I cried. It was awesome. Seeing it I was bad * Shallder * Will Will Wheaton "Curse" in his underwear, which, by the way, never seen. As well as Wesley crucifa in her strong whites, it's just so bad. But about this review "TDB." The worst part about this is that anyone wrote the film and said, "It deserves to go to the movies! It's great!" And Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in Caste said, "Oh, what I want in my movie history!" I'll see "Indian Superman" until the cows come, but I'm never going to see the steamy pillar of the drain again.
