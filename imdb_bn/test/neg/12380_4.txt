Personally, I have no problem with the script, nor the script. I have a problem with the monster bird. It was just easy. Simple and easy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One's first emotion is sunny, when someone sees it. What they thought !? Budget will be formulated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think, if the producers could have actors like Tigers, Cordes and Morro, then They will have special effects, people will come very well. Animals Well good What is done is done. This is their eternal joke, which was unrecognizable.
