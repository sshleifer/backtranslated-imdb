OK, I agree with all Barney haters on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly faces and obnoxious and very loop in the show are sideways and irrational. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The creators of this show do not use so much humiliating stereotype of homosexuals, but this would not be a problem. I mean, all gay men do not wear jokes and the colors do not love purple and pink, and a bosom of all the lesbians who are ugly and stuck on their stomach in the stomach of men is not searched. As a bisexual woman, I think it's terrible for a children's show. If it is South Park then I do not remember it, because South Park is for people who can differentiate fantasy from reality. Many people looking at Berne are small or disabled people, who can not distinguish imagination from reality. <br /> <br /> And now I'm thinking about it, Barney has exposed herself as a ugly gay stereotype. Let's see, he has no girlfriend, he is dressing with pink and sashin (yes, it is true). If you claim the rights of homosexuals and bisexuals, stop making them a scandal in front of them, who do not know well. If Barney looks at the black face and at the same time eating fried chicken and watermelon, you know it before the show will drag the wind. <br /> <br /> I give this shot a negative of five. Do not show your kids such nasty shit. There are so many insults that there are children in the show.
