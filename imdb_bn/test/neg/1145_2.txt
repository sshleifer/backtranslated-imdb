I have a few fan of holiday films, but when a movie franchise is to go to the big screen TV screen, you know it is steam-out. The TV is not good on TV made for Lampuna films. This is another reason for the movie. <br /> <br /> I think we were very excited when it came, but we also had to deal with the reality ... this is a TV movie. Randy Coed Kusin is as good as Eddie, but a helpful introduction to lead is also good. Dana Baron set history as the first actor to rebuild his role as one of Griswald's kids. He's just as nice, but it does not help a slim script. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie also made? This is probably because NBC has recently taken a few years of introduction of X-month Vacation. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all about scripts. It's not just funny. People need to think before they write stuff like this. This is not a Christmas movie I recommend.
