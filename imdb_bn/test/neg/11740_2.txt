* Includes Spoklar * <br /> <br /> The bright and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel by Alfred Hitchcock was an extraordinary movie, which was not anything in the past. Each shot, each camera's angle, was every nugger perfect. He just did not break the rules, he made a whole set of starters. <br /> <br /> Mocking here: There is nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant does not just show respect to hits, he closes every idea and does it in less original, more conventional ways. I did not have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I like the drugstore cowboy and I think my own personal Idaho was a very interesting movie. My spirit has been burning again when I came to the Psycho Remikke, "Why are you doing this, Gus?" <br /> <br /> There are two reasons for remixing in my mind: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone thought of a new, new approach to the element. None of these is available in Psycho's Gass Van St version. Despite the fact that it is in color and has a montage of annoying images related to possible internal dialogue (which I found unnecessary) in the title character, there is nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I left something to be like casting. Annie Hiech was right as Marion, but the lack of a certain weakness depicted in the genate leg was originally. I did not feel sympathetic to his character, because of his opposition to the options he had suffered as a single woman living in the early 1960's, the choices he faced were less limited to women in today's society. Vince Vaugh has found some smiles with the rendering of an incredibly simple Norman Bates, but I think that Anthony was more effective in Perkins' time and the nervous, scary looks were more effective. I enjoyed the original performance, only the character of Lilia Crane was Julian Moore's acting. She is as nice as usual, and the character brought a new strength and intelligence. <br /> <br /> To be nice, show some beautiful camera work, particularly famous "Bathroom Scenes" during the time where Van Sant takes advantage of his color use in colorful vibrant paints. And yet, during the whole film, I had this annoying idea of ​​Dju V. I have not seen this before? Oh wait, I've seen this somewhere before! Almost every scene seems to be copied the shot from the original to the shot. A director often feels the film as a school project. "See, I can make a hitc movie!" <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not already, see the original. It is held for years, and this hand bit of mediocrity, hands down. You will not be disappointed.
