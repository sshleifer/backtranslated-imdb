The greatest risk is a surprise to a person who has seen more in his films. Director Rango Lam has created an average action-movie, which can be compared to other mid-quality action films, what is this in the special context of Brussels's muscles? This is a pretty classy style, an interesting atmosphere and finishes, but at least, there are beautiful heroes of Glory. Even Vandemo is not crying through his acting, he does a relatively good job. Of course you can not compare Ronin with the highest ricks (oh, what creative title!), But after watching 'no off', this is a good movie hell ... certainly in the special standard.
