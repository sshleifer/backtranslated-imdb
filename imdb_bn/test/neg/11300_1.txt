I saw some torture in the movie. Over the last few years, it seems that the producers and directors are ready to make films that make me move closer and closer to the mad. Hanib was not an exception. I was not expecting too much when I came to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and says, "The book is always better than the movie" does not believe me that this film will be nothing but a trash. But what I came to watch is a movie that seems to be a little better than all other bad movies. <br /> <br /> Generally, when I watch a horror movie, I make myself happier than anything else. Although sad, I could not even laugh at a tragic excuse for a film of Hanib. The film was depicted with a promise, I guess. It was Anthony Hopkins, Julian Moore and Gary Oldman. And for the direction, Ridley Scott was there. Films with significant talent has been very good. From this picture I could cut so much that I doubted that there would be nothing. It was kind. The story was so ridiculous that it was written like a complete foolhardy. What's worse is that the book was even crazy, and there were some scenes that were very extreme, which was tragic in a movie where <br /> <br /> *** ***************** Ray Leootter is being cooked into pieces in the brain. The scene that wanted to cry more than any other, because it pushed its predecessor to such a memorable level. Lambs silence is one of my favorite movies all the time. But Hanib was busy for two hours. This film should be seen only if people are not able to write a good movie.
