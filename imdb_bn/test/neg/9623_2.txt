After enjoying the introduction of Neil Guiman's writing (especially "The Dream Hunters" in Amane, his cooperation with me), I could confirm Mirammars and was very disappointed. At the beginning of the movie, the Live-Action section was quite inspiring. The relation between letters was reliable and easy to imitate, and I liked the set, costumes and Helena artwork. The next computer-generated scenery, though, was provocative. The dialogue was painful and incited, interaction between live actors and CGI scary. Events happened due to flimsiest reasons, and most of the cases seemed to be inefficient which may have existed. I saw the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I'm not just any authority, but strongly recommend that you do not see any of this and will not be with Gaeyan's strong writing.
