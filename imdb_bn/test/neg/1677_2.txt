This movie does this on CGA. I mean, scientists have used its original "Butts", it does not use CGI like sigell. In this movie it's easy to turn people from mutated killer bat. And really bat in Afghanistan? Plot connects you. Army soldiers find a terrorist and attack with the bat and die <_ <But I gave this movie 3 stars because the camera zoomed on the soldiers. The acting is bad and this does not look like even a horror movie. Among these films there are good TV movies for the Sci-Fi Channel. But if you like the films of Saifaiyah, then you would love this movie because you are just 43 oh like the channel and do not be surprised if you fall asleep during the movie. Oh sorry, I think I'd rather give 2 stars.
