Being really fond of the following series, I was really looking forward to publishing this movie. I was hoping to laugh a minute roller-coaster ride ....... <br /> <br /> Where? Do you start from this mess? I think it's a good start that it's rarely on our screens and Eddie is in the first place, such as a joke and a lantern that they usually do not usually deliver well. The funny thing is that I was waiting for the first laugh. After 20 minutes of good time to see. Most aspects of the story were unfortunate and it seemed that the picture of those bad moments was full and they decided to get out of the final cut. <br /> <br /> Set around the film and the atmosphere is like darkness and dinge, which I think is good, if they try to run 'terrible' guest house 2 buffoon, it only gives me a higher pillar above the sad conditions of a movie . Should never be created. <br /> <br /> acting, sometimes, unfortunate. Fenla Fielding Mrs. F Oxfur and I saw Simon Peg has very good results. <br /> <br /> I would recommend guest house paradiso for guests who are blind drunk because they can praise the terrible birds. This image was not seen and you have been warned of real prosperity and Eddie
