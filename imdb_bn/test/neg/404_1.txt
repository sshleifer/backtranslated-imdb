I saw this movie based on a few comments that were bad but funny But you need to be careful that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They look like science fiction films in artistic work in the 1950s. Funny at this time, but for the most part it's boring. And the total lack of logic to make the problem logical with serious unfortunate special effects, which marks most of the illustrated numbers. One of my favorites where three letters drop hundreds of feet in a tunnel created by Arakania and it comes to make it fully illustrated. Inadequately the arachnia has also operated the hook in the power grid. Very impressive But this is just an example. And what is its value, sucks music, sucks acting, two cute girls are annoying, obnoxious people boring, a geek of so-called handsome lead people, and black girl who is for her is a fool. His father is the worst actor I ever seen I'm not sure that the brief moments of entertainment may be made for the experience.
