This picture is so copy-cat, clich-rayed, clammy, and fun, I find it wonderful that nobody can be deceived by the experience sitting by it. <br /> <br /> Here's a weird comedy, ridiculous psychoanalytic, and easy-to-understand story in this "hard-hitting" presentation at Hyde School: The Solid Folk The students are unhappy because their father pushed him and in anyway he forced him to do evil. A teacher is a student who wets his pants in the class. The girl who is going out with the above mentioned joke really loves her and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only saving grace student counselor is the view which is vaguely interesting, but most of this photo is so begging that it begging <br /> <br /> This image does not show any insight to teenage boys and I would not be surprised especially with the explosion of teenage boys. Those who love this movie seem to be worried about their children about their children, and they think that this film will help in the "understanding" issues if they fold the wrong tree. What is the morality of this picture? "Hey everyone, find each other and embrace each other" Give me a BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can go back with this message from a person of 14 years old. In the 1980's we were watching Kentucky Fried Movie, Extro, Poker, Evil Dead, Terminator etc. This picture will fall into the deaf ear. <br /> <br /> Another type of "obscure" film, with 'One Perfect Day' is okay, which was as bad as the film's turkey. Thanks to God, no taxpayer's money was spent in this Bologna. <br /> <br /> <br />
