This movie is going on a lot. Another critic commented that the film's controversial, imagined nature reflects the memories of the director - it's okay if it is written and performed. Instead, what we're getting is a straight-forward story - some time - which goes around and down, leaves in some cases, prevents the flow of unnecessary degrees in other areas and otherwise just does not work. <br /> <br /> There are some plot details that do not work. For example, why in the day-to-day opposition to dragging a dead body on a beach in an urban area? Why leave your flat sheet on the body? Why did an artist who knew Joe's character for a short time decided to give up "everything" (even if it was not much)? This sub-plot was poorly developed for that point work. In that case why do people have to be any other illegal or artist than giving the view of money and unwanted nude posture? Was he an easy photographer, or opera musician? In that case, someone rated an apartment in Opera House - especially without some obvious connection to Opera? Coincidences are both very clear and vague and vague both. Why people will take everything in the warehouse and "invisible." If Team is with a 10-year-old school in a small town like Bunga, then how could he lose it for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well that others would recommend others for a job. <br /> <br /> Some other suboptags (such as mother and her boyfriend) and sister were felt like running. Some good ideas that can create features with full development or maybe attractive shorts. As completed, this movie offers little knowledge and even less offers.
