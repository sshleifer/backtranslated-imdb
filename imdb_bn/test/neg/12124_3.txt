I'm saying it's better than most CIFs, but it's not saying too much. <br /> <br /> This plot is purchased by anyone who bought a game that is made from bones and skin skin in Spanish (and does not expect any Spanish investigation!) He and his friends play the game, while running beer The friend who runs the beer is the game that prevents the middle way. What follows is a follow-up movie that is ideal for a film, or ideal for a final destination movie. Finally there is a puzzle and there are interesting subopts with copies, who want to bring the game back to their family ... but otherwise it is just a mess.
