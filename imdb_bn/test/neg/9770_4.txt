I have a great struggle. A story which is extremely overwhelming, this movie can be great (rated here by a few) but it has been mixed with acting (I think the director and relatives are playing a key role in the role). .. While calling this act, not only expanding that word, it is making a new payment! A whole new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are in a miracle (for example something I really do, for example, see the Japanese Curious Circus), you can ignore the errors (see above) and enjoy more. Here's a great idea, after all! There are many great metaphorical and uncertain scenes, but seeing it (with a group of friends) almost all of us could not stop laughing ... certainly not the purpose of the directors! Again, everyone has their own preferences, like one can see the high ratings of this movie, but if I only work on Alendandro Jodorosky and / or I am a fan of them, I can only recommend the movie!
