It seems that all companies that enjoy the taxes taken by Romania for the photo provide an invisible image from 1994. They do not try to establish the oldest car, but they are Laramagini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and some other new Mercedes that you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they were portrayed in some areas of Bucharest where they were able to clean and rubbish in their streets. People can not wear clothes with me '90 dress may be so stupid that you can understand the second hand purchased from eBay or the price. <br /> <br /> I wish for the future for the future to make better money than US movies and our country shame and shame. I have no reason to believe that anyone can understand this message (out of my English --- sorry)
