How can you make a mistake with the painting of Peter Cushing, the solidness of Donald Plassens and the mix of Luan Peters? Easy, give you a scary script to work with them. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, an evil role, has grabbed a couple couples of Donald Pleasence, which led a devil worship. Donald is a scheduled but only clergyman who wants to identify his friends but needs Fred's help from screen-do to identify him. He called for a bloody surgery in New York, who was dressed in a suit like a cartoon hero. Meanwhile, one of the missing people, Louun Peters, joined the investigation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, women will find this a crapfest. Whenever they go to the bad boy, then our two male hero tells Luan to be at the hotel, although he can manage himself better than the Squimish priest, who is managed by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> The story: $ (The script really lets us down, no tension is created, no appropriate conversations are given to the star, and you will need both hands to be asked to stay behind Luan Peters and the man Men do work, I can not see a minute in the film, we've got a minaret statue which is a fire.) <br /> <br /> Wilnees: $$ (some attacks and some pills, but Those who are afraid of you <br /> <br/> ACTING: $$ (Even though I have three favorite actors in this movie, there is no recapture here. Peter Cushing has no screen time, Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he is a stinker set and Lewan Peters Peters It has been much better to get involved in this genius, but then again, Ya Nkees lose a game here and there). <br /> <br /> Nudity: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath but you do not See next. He was in the flesh and blood in the show, as he is not obliged to).
