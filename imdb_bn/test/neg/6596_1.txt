All right, firstly, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed the credit and stuff. So when I finally got it, I was "Who is this dude?" It was like. I had found Flex like a few hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. Not a single point. He could not dance like he could or could not walk like him, the only thing he was a voice was. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can not really comment on this because I do not know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was just like plain wake. Dialogue sucked. Cinematography-if it can be said that sucked. Soundtrack sucked. Acted sucked Yes even the Flex ... though I'm very sad about it. I do not want to suck it. I am so sad that Flex said he could escape with him. But the whole thing looked like the costume. You know Looks like some people saw that they had dropped Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> Concert sequence just suck. I'm sorry, but Flex can not just dance like Michael. I mean, what was VH1 thinking? Makeup even Michael does not match any time whatever. For example, he was still dark in the movie when Nevarland was disbanded for the first time. In real life, the MJ was as white as hell. There was some sort of stupid delay in discoloring her skin. <br /> <br /> The movie was not annoying, it was not for me. It was not really anything. I was very upset about everything that was wrong with it. I could see how it turned out and if Flakes could free himself. He really does not. The only part I see a little bit like was the Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love That was nice. But when I was kissing, I had to face. Oh And only two parts collapsed with me. For the first time when they were cut from Michael with short hair, you know Michael's thriller era with long flowing hair of a dangerous era and he was still black! That was fun. The second time I laughed when they showed all of Michael's posters and memorabilia, but instead of Flex's face! It was very fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was a cheap trash. It was only two hours of dress and could have been much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you want. But this movie is not funny, it's funny. I came out feeling it angry. And when I found it was Flex, I just started to feel so bad. So ... if you want to see.
