Revisionist History - Made a semi-heroic romantic creation of the evil Marquez de Sode - mind-boggling enough. But extreme acting, amateur cinematography and terrible dubbing make the picture worse. The only reason being an observer is that almost all the women in the film are superb. And, surprisingly, being persecuted for days, with hands tied above, apparently do not refrain from the beauty, hairstyle and makeup of a woman. My guess is that producers draw most of the pictures in Russia, choose women for their beauty - and desire to work efficiently - without acting ability. If you decide to do this, there is no good for you, or a movie student looking for a bad example, quickly move through every scene involving nudity.
