When I first saw this event in the cartoon network, I found it reluctant. Then I read a lot of good messages about this show, and I decided to visit it. The show was so annoying. Each episode was predictable. Plus, this show has no logic. Hypermart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things, start with 99% episode of a slow attacker Townsville, then the mayor (he is a real fool, he is not funny, he is so stupid, I can not imagine how He was the mayor). Professor, yes, this should be the most intelligent person in the show, but in fact ... he could not even find any difference between the giant and his brother. Comments on the statement also make these shows annoying. They are in the same line at the beginning and end of each episode. Also the animation is very weird Everything is shown in an ugly way without the main hero. This episode also gives you some life-lessons on each episode, and this means it is dependent on young children, but if you are more intimate then you will see that there are so many violence and even blood (!!!) during their war.
