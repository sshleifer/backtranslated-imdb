Why is this movie made? The producers have fooled so easily by grief that they will give them money to make the so-called "film" of torture methods? I love the bad movie like the next mashostist, but "cave donors" push it. It is severely painful to see painful. This plot is a chat ator - something about a buffed-up knunboot that I will mention as a private snowball for this remaining review - to fight invisible fighters and to rescue a bad guy to rescue the princess. Find out a good hairstylist. I saw this damage, because I saw this damage, but really, are you so careful? Oh yes, Private Snowball has a silent Asian Sidekick (who's not?). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the private snowman battles the invisible people, visits some caves, frees everyone as a good king, so he looks al Gore like Jim Carrier. Then Private Snowball creates a hang-glider (yes, I'm serious) and gets the girl. Kayabat-Kee-Yay It's cheap, weirdly silly, and mind-numbingly dull. I'm not surprised why the director finished the pornographic work? <br /> <br /> The bottom line: AVOID. It will steal a part of your life and you will not have any funny "very bad-good" capfreeze to take you with experience. Bad it! Bad! Aak! * Gags *
