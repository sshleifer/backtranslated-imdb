Many people do not remember "The Care Treatment", and I can not say that I blame them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Intelligence has become a secret (cobbler) to solve the murder, it is quite surprising. <br /> <br /> Cobb urn is always reliable and O'Neal is always beautiful, but it looks like something missing from the proceedings. The story twists and turns are very involved and even climax, which is supposed to be nervous-waxing, is instead groin-wrenching. <br /> <br /> A Miss chance entirely, and that was an unfortunate one, it was based on a Michael Crichton book. <br /> <br /> Well, at least crickon did not write a sign of it. <br /> <br /> One star. Coburn, "Kerry"
