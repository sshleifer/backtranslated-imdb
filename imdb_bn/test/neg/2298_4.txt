You know, I really have a problem with the movie list. I was reading the Maxim magazine a few days ago and had a list of the best 50 B-movies of all time and knew me, of course they must go through and all of them have to be reviewed. That's why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bat and Repeat Wire and Coffee in my list. So I noticed HOSS. On the other hand, it is recognized in the video store and list of 50 best B-movies Maxim and I decided to rent it and test it. My only comfort is that I hired it because I was recognized from a list of B-movies, so I already knew that it was going to suck. <br /> <br /> I can not tell the type of movie that is given by HTTPS. Total failure, this is nothing more than the T & A movie in the late 70's, and it never pretends by anything else. The only place where it extends from its purpose, is suddenly an incest maid involved in a few former consulates, who steals a lot of money in the house, HOTS. It needs to be removed because there is absolutely no room in this concert film. Since the rest of the film is good, this subculture is completely unnecessary and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a fairytale competitor based on a few rivalries, which exists in a university which is a bit of maliciously, until they form their own form until the rejection is over. Another one snobs. This new fraction, Hels of Heels (Hots), is an entity based on Seal's assistance (Seal Suboptot, which is not included in the film, and is given in addition to paying attention to that name), there is a running around here and there throughout the movie. Seal). <br /> <br /> It's going to be a strange word, but it was actually a scene that I was very nice in this movie. One shot that I was fascinated, I have to say. Through the middle of the film, the rival pi is pissed, a girl in the girls is pouring alcohol into punk, and she poured and drank some glass for herself. Surprisingly enough, the way he drinks alcohol drinks alcohol, which reminds me of Charlie Chaplin, which really brightens the film. Obviously, nothing in this movie has come in any of Chaplin's, but the shot only raises my score from 2 to 4 for the movie. <br /> <br /> Completely, the film is exactly what you expect it to be, many people are looking for excuses to stop their clothes (I think how ultimately one of the girls' ideas for dress-up-clothes-every-soccer game. RAIIEIEET ??), and many thoughts are not inserted into something else. For example, a scene can be seen at the beginning of the film when some of the P girls poured hot sauce to refreshment in HOTS. The team was eventually caught in a scandalous photograph (the girl taking the picture did not understand that she had photographed at that time), although the film did not come for any reason afterwards. <br /> <br /> I have seen such a movie before, it was like a gate byte, but without violence the radiic and coffee was not far away. Even with bigger budgets and more silicon, the wire is also the same. Fortunately, there are only a few comedy in the Maxim's 50 B-movie list, because the Chess T-T movies sometimes occasionally after entertainment, sometimes with poor semi-nude scenes as bad films, after seeing HOSSS. I think I like a bad movie rather than a bad joke. I'd like to watch a lot of terrible actors to be scared rather than pretend to be fun.
