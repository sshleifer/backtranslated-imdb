"Based on a joke of Jim Wintersky" ... what I read at the end of the closing credits is. Well, Mr. Winnowski will get a sense of humor! This film is terrible, really. I liked the first two chapters of the slam party genocide series; The third image was quite vain, but fully watchable, compared to this piece of comparison! Even a driller killer and plot, acting, character, position, event ... everything is annoying, stupid and ridiculous. The only good reason for watching this Turkish is girls: If this film is not obscene, I think it worked better! The film lacks very little: the first scene (one in the tent) can be bloody, and the scene standing on the door with a similar person can last a second! A little exciting little moment can not save an unxistent plot. BG (Lynn Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only portable character in this movie! Oh ... Brink Stevens, who first performed "Linda" in the Slamble Party Massacre, has a secret part with him: Police bothered him for more details about the killer; But we have some footage from the first picture! No dialogue, no loneliness, or anything related to the life of the life, who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes (as he says) in his life, does not give us any information about the murderer! <Br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
