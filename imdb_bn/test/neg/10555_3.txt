It's a stand-alone line, but it really enriches this movie ... "If it's the current state of gay movies, then we're in real trouble." I have seen this movie in CIFF seeing IMDB rating (7.6) high quality IMDB rating and if there is ever a case for voting stacking in IMDB, then that is <br /> <br /> Simple plot ... The boy is married to a friend of his high school ex-boyfriend, so he goes back. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the first time, despite the character and plot of my cookie cutter, "Letter's Day", I like the last feature of the director, but in his old suburbs (still carrying 10-year-old torch ). You are supposed to be a good manager with each subsequent release. I do not know how you got terrible support from many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Jonah Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but the way he managed. Lifetime of writing was the quality of the network (back way when they were really bad) and the situation was incredible and uncomfortably difficult to see. I have reached an extrinsic remote control to speed up, but finally I could stay myself, waiting for a decent finish. Threat ... no. Even the floral male nudity that took place during the movie was also ineffective that people were present to keep them in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be justified ... 2 Leads, especially in undesirable nude scenes, were fantastic. During their resurrected friendship, there was a real sweetness among them, because they did not reveal how they went differently. And the picture looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent movie. <br /> <br /> How can the Network TV give a weekend weekly weekend week (eg "Agley Betty" "Desp. housewives", etc.), but the release of many features of similar styles could be as bad as this?
