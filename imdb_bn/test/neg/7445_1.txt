I really do not notice who this movie is. From its absurdity, ridiculously bad acting, delicious conversations, and not to mention villen as a child, I think it was meant to be a child film ... but I think there may be something more swearing, than medicine and medicine. Not to mention the constant references to greatness and killing-which are trying to please the public? The film is trying to combine local music with very schizophrenic, such as the Huawei Metal, which ultimately is not going to like because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it is so funny (worse) than the actors that I am not so helpless that I do not want to recommend otherwise. <br /> <br /> When I say I am completely serious It can not be seen for more than 15 minutes. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
