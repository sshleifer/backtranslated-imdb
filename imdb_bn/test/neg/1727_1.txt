The effects and performances of this movie did not just sting, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist has discovered that a smoky moon will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... shelter ... then everybody is upset that he is "playing God" <br /> <br /> How tall! He created the thing, why is everyone able to access? Completely crippled story, do not waste your time!
