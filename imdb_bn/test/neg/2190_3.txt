Los Angeles physician Tom Red (Vincent Ventreccha) lives in a tragic car crash but is going to jail in the high desert of California. When his time was over, he landed a small, windy city called Paguchi's flat. His first stop was a bar, where he quickly slams a beer and gets rented as a bartender. There are many for having a hard time finding work for Pre-Cannes. This is the first of a long line of irrationality of the author / director Harris Dawn's modern, desert-set, silly attempt to make a silly attempt to silence film silence. <br /> <br /> Tom met him on the first night of his job. Malnyens, Uncle Dean (Greg Henry) and her two nephews, drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL soldier Randy ("90210"), a deadly sex worker named Sunny (Alexandra Holden), hangs with the family of bad boys: Brian Austin Greer). There is a shooting after the end of his shift, and Dr. Tom will just be nearby. He agrees to treat one of the injured and most importantly, do not tell the police. I'm not sure that a person's pen is a good step for fresh people, but this script (written by Dian Fine) is rarely with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom creates a series of weak decisions that enhance him further and is more involved in criminally MacLyn's age, including stealing of medical supplies and hopping in bags with sunlight. Everyone is shouting at the theater, "Do not do it, go away," but how does Tom do it? <br /> <br /> For a classic film Noor like "Body Heat" or "Dual Damage", we express sympathy with the original and William Hart and Fred Macmoor, because they are bright, sexy, decent female fatty like Catherine Turner and Barbara Stanwick. Disappears on the web. This is not their fault. We will probably be tempted by all that money or that special dame. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to have been more stupid than the situation. Sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character, and there is no money to entice him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . It gives us an incredible car chase with one of the "club" things that clamped the steering wheel. Oh, the oil tanker that just exploded - nobody noticed it. <br /> <br /> Am I surprised that such ridiculous scripts have ever come in green light? Perhaps for Brian Austin Gare, I have more juice than loaning him. It is clear that he had taken a relatively small role compared to Randy - an incendiary murderer - to show the producer that he showed more acting range than "90210". <br /> <br /> Very sad to see it Nicolas Turturro Dealing a Stereootic Hispanic Drug Dealer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I will give 3 stars for the scene with unexpected smiles and sexy Miss Holden running around in his red panties.
