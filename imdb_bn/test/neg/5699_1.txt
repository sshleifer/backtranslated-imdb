I rented this movie because I love Lenka and I have seen so many TV shows and his 15-minute fame with his new T3 movie, since then I want to verify that I'm watching another movie. <Br /> <br /> She is fine on acting conditions. Well not good and not bad. She makes up for everything being extremely fantastic. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Radoni was very surprised as Roland Hero. He played only the strongest in the film. She will be a very good actor and probably an action star. <br /> <br /> Also Krisanna is OK and Rodney is all about everything else about this film being the junk in her pure form. <br /> <br /> A computer hacker hacks into a flat system from the ground and uses a joystick as he tries to slam on a plane between a nuclear power plant ..... or something. And of course, the heroes stand in his way and destroy his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and it was not a low budget glow. "<br /> This image was created in 2001 and it is very similar to the September 11 tragedy. <br /> <br /> Why do they make movies like this? <br /> Panic * - One star (too Waste of good actors (waste time) (also known as air pancake)
