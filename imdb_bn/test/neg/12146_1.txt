If you were kidding, right? Could this be a real film? Is not it even a real video? Make a video cam at a Harvey Milk High School, and they can make even better films. The filmmaker can not be serious ... right? Is this irony? Comedy? The drama has gone terribly wrong? The scripts as fantasy are about as psychological and dull Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come with a good playpipe. The conversation is not clipped. The clich√©d dialogue camp may be fun fun like this holiday mess - but it does not and it does not. Worst - a landlord was waving in a dramatic scene in a private apartment, carrying a framing pan like "honeymooners" episode. Whaaa ??? I saw good acting from the Middle School Drama Club. Leads are an attractive lunk, not another. Both can not even manage a convincing kiss. A lot for romance Supporting players are at the top of japa-dropping. <br /> <br /> Everything is underscored by an annoying soundtrack and the word appears to be recorded in the back cell toilet. Most of the dialogue (forgiving) is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> This cute movie pane is not suitable for the next Rocky Harrow or the brain's science theater 3000's gay holidays. This is just plain. In each position. Perfume perspectives do not dance on your head - they will pull on you every expectation. Look peculiarly at the neighboring holidays and look silently - it will be a better time to spend.
