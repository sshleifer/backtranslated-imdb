I'm speechless Matty Simmons has managed to do anything I feel impossible. He created "Harlem Globetter on the island of Gilgit", "Citizens buy." Can not start painting even this piece description ... I do not know. You think the premiere looks funny, but now I have seen it, it's funny to keep a barbarity on your fun. <br /> <br /> I will not be bothered to describe the evidence, because the title says it all, if it is not to say that I was literally a funny thing in this film, not even one, even the monkeys bite. How can one of the funniest characters of the "Holiday" franchisee, the decorated white trash ede (Randy Quad), be so terribly illusory? I never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. I am this "ridiculous" torture, Mary Flin (Catherine, Eddie longtime, but sunny wife), Dana Baron (Original Audrey Griswald), Fred Willard and Gorgeous Sung Hye Lee (probably the only reason to watch the movie, if only the sound is closed) Save old comics, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), that's coming. Hey, do not listen to the audience I only say "Thank you to the sky" that Cherie Chase, who has been frustrated for years, has become clearly evident in this diarrhea splator, this is his most successful career move. I do not know people like me are religious, but I know tonight I will pray to the Lord for 2 hours of my life (if not two years) I will go in front of my television <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,
