Before this movie I believe that there were two types of bad movies. (1) Your average, perfectly intrinsic rent (i.e. "Constantine"), and (2) the work that is quite curious, or bad - it's good (a "man's hand to look"). Now I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there is a bad movie in the third movie: Voice Sandwich. That will be tattooed irrevocably on your memory. There is a work that is mind-decently executable. Anathma <br /> <br /> I have hated some pictures before, but I never hated a film that my hatred reached his threshold and hated myself! Have you seen a movie that you do not just regret for reducing the time of viewing it, but the next hour you apologize? Be careful the disciples of the mystery science theater, this soul-sucking movie. Instead of going to "Iron Circle" or "Killer Ch rew" instead.
