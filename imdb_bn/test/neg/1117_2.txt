I'm guessing these drivel up folks are directors or some cronies. This is not bad, kind of the kind of Michael Jackson song. Graduation will be compared to pansing this movie. Insult of graduation. This film is eternally unharmed, shameless makeup for her and thirsty for some distortion or blood, or whatever introduces us to some irrational zombies. Trust me, you will not care. Mom's only thought that it was unthinkable to take these injuries and take it to the home of Phillipith. And worse, I'm not taking care of myself. Backstory about zombombie kids? snoring. Mother and / or the dangers of women? Do not care <br /> <br /> Short, WOW was this dull. Do not disturb.
