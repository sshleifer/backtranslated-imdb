This movie is a disaster in a disaster film. This is full of great action scenes, which are just meaningful, if you throw all the ideas of reality. Let's see, the words to the wise, the lava burns you; Steam you burn You can not stand next to Lava. The removal of a minor lava flow is difficult, alone a significant one. I think someone who really believes in this movie can believe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean acting actually very good. The average above the impact. It is difficult for someone to believe in reading this script and terminating all these talents. I suppose that if this proposal is starting on TV ... look away! It's like the ruins of a train: it's awful that once you know what you know. Look away and spend your time in more meaningful content.
