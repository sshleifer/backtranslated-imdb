This is a stupid movie. These are as badly written as many movies, weird, and sometimes just fools. The action really is all there and many pages to be desired overall on the movie. Here everyone is talking about Jim, doing bad cart and doing a very bad job. <br /> <br /> Look for Scatman Rage in a small role, he is very good for this movie. Jim Kelly is good at the cart, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendrey is real bad. All of them, this film has so many parts that do not give any idea at all. Undisputed love / scene away with Hendry and Kelly, what was that? They are the people that destroy guitars, for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there was the mandatory girl of Trumpolin !!! What was that now? They were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard from them again !!! Then the whole ethnically charged element of the film, which is cool and all, but this film does not go anywhere else. As I said, it is good to laugh once, but do not show again.
