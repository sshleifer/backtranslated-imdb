Some really have good music and performance; Kid Creole and Coconut, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Toxoido Moon, Plastic, Babel Mail, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but none other than that. Conversation, especially the narration (Saul Williams), is really good, but how important it is that performance is quite beautiful and completely bad, which is thrown into the hipsters! Debbie Harry and Jean-Michel Baskit (later the lead role) have not enough cultural rights to keep this film as an element of innovation. It takes a growing interest in Jack Karaoke Style, but there is no insight into the band performance where it is running along. I think it's balanced about balanced music and bad acting. Enjoy it, but I just expected more. Although it has a fairy tale to end though.
