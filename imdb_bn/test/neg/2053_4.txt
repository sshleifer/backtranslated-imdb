I just saw this picture only Sarah and I'm giving these 4 stars for him, on the other hand I saw this movie as one of the worst movies. The practice was terrifying. The script was uninspired. This is a movie that was contrary to itself. The film was brutal and unreasonable. I do not like to feel like a good film. Just give something a jump or two. This is not even that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, as much as I think about the overall plot, the more it gives less knowledge and the more we find the holes. Really a shame, I'm sure that there was a good idea somewhere hidden. <br /> <br /> I may have been a little difficult to give the picture 4/10 but the actors are involved and again the genius of writing SARA clearly, this film should really be distributed much more.
