All right, when I say "Wow," I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before the tromer. The film is about an alien crash landing in the world, which makes us terrorists with a gun that explodes in the explosion of humans. Be careful !!! And by that, I mean to watch for their special effects. There is an amazing number of errors. Acting is terrible, but I want to say that no effort will be made to try any of the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and weaker light is ignited. In one special scene, it shows the day outside and then shot his gun shooting at night behind his knight bust. Then it shows again. * Walking Walk * I usually like low budget horror films, but I had to force it to finish because I did not see a movie without ending it. The only achievement to achieve this film was an alien which was not stereoical. So for that, and for that only ... I give it a 3 out of 3. <br /> <br /> If you have a bad day do not see this movie. You will be even more depressed at the failed attempts to make this movie.
