Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so awesome, I could not pick up the whole film in the movie but in disbelief that I was actually seeing something like that. Haha The audio editing is horrible, they try very hard to come up with creative cameras. Because they are just weird and stupid Script sucked. Acting was terrible, the story is not very good. Even for a movie, very unrealistic. But this is a 20 year old movie ... so I'll give it a bonus point for it. And yes, the music was terrible. But we got all started anywhere. And a hassle of submitting this thing ..... 10 lines minimum ... annoyed. Well, I know why I could not find the movie in the movie store .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... The good thing was only $ .58 cents. Although shipping was $ 2.59. Oh well ... I do not recommend any time to waste their time and money ...
