I did not recognize the skills of making the above average film production of Hanek. For example, I appreciate its linking as a powerful way to strengthen the strong sense of reality in the exceptional-natural-day-setting settings. However, regardless of the content of this film, I see that there are still intense interest in misleading relationships or feelings (and / or BDSM customs) in the 21st Century. The main character is incredibly topical with her mother, as she feels the separation and ignorance of Walter (I do not want to talk about the disappointment of a boyfriend who does not love the same way again, which can be understood; I mean that he looked at him as if he was crazy Or if he is a monk, then come!). I mean, D / S is nothing new in the world, and I think treating the matter is rather foolishly considered to be "unwanted" or pathological; It's not In general, films dealing with this issue are actually backwards. So, I think this film is completely finished as a programmatic film, worried with the old psychoanalytic theories (ISN 'is almost embarrassing?), and it is in real life with life and D / relationship It is not related to the experience of the people involved (personal experiences, forums, IRC chat rooms, and even recent scholarly studies. ).
