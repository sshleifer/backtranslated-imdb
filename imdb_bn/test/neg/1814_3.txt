Overall, the movie "Heart of the Dark" was a bigger than the book. Anyone who ever read books and had enough understanding about it would be able to see numerous weird errors. There is an essential difference between the two. I think the director is walking in a losing battle. I could not imagine that anyone would accept the giant act of restoring "the heart of darkness". It is impossible to explain the strange story and magic accurately in the story. Conrad's story had so many layers and depth that it would seem to be in vain trying to make a visible explanation. First, it is impossible to hold the story details. The extraordinary penalties created by Joseph Conrad can not be properly revived through the film. Marlon's feelings and emotions can not be considered equally well in the film. If you do a great job to deal with Conrad's work, you know that Conrad has just written half a story. Connection series created by additional half-reader. You must be able to judge and connect Joseph Conrad's ideas as a reader. As a result, there are not many important details in the film. <br /> <br /> Also, although the movie was fair enough, the film seemed to be short. It seemed that Conrad was able to pack a lot more information within 75 hours, the film could pack in half an hour. The motion of the film prevents the exhibitor from learning letters. Marlow was a stranger much more. The book puts you in the shoes of Marlowe. Anyway, in the movie, you are watching Marlow from a distance. I started thinking that the director was trying to use the same "read in line" method like Conrad. However, the connection was weak. I know that if I did not read the book, then I could not begin to understand the depth, character and depth of the situation. Finally, Cartz also interpreted the mistake. His role was brief and the details were not included in all. It was impossible to understand the time the true corpse was shown. An important account of the book was that Cartage became the deity of the Africans. I did not define significant details. Also, in the book, the cartage represents an atrocity. He died a long time ago. I believe the director comprehend this detail. However, instead of restoring it, he was just mocha around Kurtz and mumble everything. Moreover, the director feels that the attempt was made to think of Curtaceus as mysterious, but, instead, he was completely unaware. <br /> <br /> Together, this movie reminds me to finish a science project, the day afterwards. It has been made easy and rarely made sometime. Characters were disconnected, important details were omitted, and overall, the central plot was lost in translation.
