Earlier, like "Blair Witch Project", "Hachette" has added the perfect part of the campaign from its own bottom (Fangrias Magazine's passionate reader, it is hard to miss full page ads); Even after running his diverse theater, the film is often circulated around it, and probably will become a goddamn item in some way. With the promise of a powerful (if confusing content) committed to preserving MySpace URL and the so-called "old school American horror", "the Hatchett" will attract many curiosity searches with its DVD release (where the claim itself is enlightened on the disc). Perhaps it seems to be a big print blogger from Hit Knowles and its small media VIP pass and ads that allow a movie for free meals is not like it's cool news. But "Hatcht" questions me that writer-director Adam Green's "old school American fear" is really: based on the evidence, it means "Friday 13th February" and "Rescue." Characters are unreasonable stereotypes (Black Chris Money type , Survival Chicks, Topless Bimbas, Riksite Old Temple, Asian Tour Guide), whose interactions are painful, tries-to-hip conversations and more Gai clear sunny (mostly not) bad as the "cabin fever," but still); The padding of the script (for example, "Rostling Bush" scene), and "hatcht" winds are considered as common in any of the postmoderner slashes of the last decade, it is the only feature of the typical counting hip machine. I would give some obscure praise for this Gore - if you can go through padding among the dead, Red Vino is definitely astonishing and the only real reason to see it.
