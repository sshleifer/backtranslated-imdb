In all episodes, I have not seen any real work or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people are old and then someone else. Say something a bit about them and tell them how valuable it is and who has made it and where it came from and whether any work was done for it and <br /> <br /> <br /> 30 of them , I've realized ... there is no play ... no one ever gets lost in limb or life, or gets divorced or hurt by a car or a plane. <br /> <br /> No carriage is running or explosions - Not even horses race with old cars. <br /> <br /> Not all guns and swords are victims of violent murders ... What gives? No pyaches, no fog, no guns, old Englishmen in bad cases ... just yap yap yap ... your old tea is set and it came from the country of Germany in 1602 - Allah Allah <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone to go to the screen screen and ask about it, but not ... It never comes and only what happens is that some staff English or women Ming dynasty During the time, some of the old sales in Boston or China show some bad words - big EFFIN deal <br /> <br /> No one ever can not kidnap Lead and can not catch them for ransom? Are there any alien spacecraft that will remove the whole floor? Who would write as a series of this series and expect us to stay awake? <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no work, no mystery, no work, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This event is bad! What ever happened to the thongs and spewing laser wearing supermodels from a future weapon? Antiques Roadshow - grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep in the show ...
