Well, I've seen many reviews on this topic, and many preachers always show the display scene. But this flick is a difficult one. And I mean it by all means. It is difficult to find a copy, because it was a low-budget independent release and was looking for copies of MPA VHS, because it was obsolete but it was rated for MPA. So copied underground view disappeared. All people involved in this membrane did something else in biz. So it's made of this flick unique. VHS copies almost never pop up in Ebay or other sites, and if they pay you more than $ 100 a get. But due to the US connection I was able to catch a release of the worldwide selling DVD. It was limited but it was to be an official one kind. Now and then this splatterfest has some screenings. But is it all the mock price around? Earlier it said, it is difficult to catch but it is also difficult to sit. There are poor killings, there are nicrilia, there is nudity, but there are many things in the copper. And to be honest, if you want to see the movie within 5 minutes, you will see it in the end, it's a flashback in the murderer's mind. Blood flow, and in fact it is a splatterfirst, but not full 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. The film's quality is okay, the sound is okay, there is no laugh, the colors are okay, black and blue are not so low budget. It's okay to see but you'll never be afraid but your friends feel like a beer and a pizza that I think. 555,'Aaaaaaaaaaa 333.
