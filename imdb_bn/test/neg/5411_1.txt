To be honest, the film is so violent that I like it. Never seen such a great movie in my life. I was in shock. I mean, I do not even know what I want to say. The characters also could not keep their guns, one minute was M16, and the friend's MP 5 was there, then later they saw the gun switch. (Do not ask me, I believe in my guns) and I do not realize that I would never understand the place they got from a place near my home in Vietnam, Arizona Highway, and then a chemical plant in California. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, how is that awesome? I wanted to roam arsenic through the movie. How do I "skeleton people" decided to go a killer spree randomly on that particular day. But hey, whoever made this movie should be shot on his knees and should be fed to pests of fire. <br /> <br /> Happy day.
