I saw this movie n, I can say that it's really a bad movie. The director has gone ... Of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but then he is a cheap guy. There are many technical flaws in the film too ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... here's my suspicion- until finally when they rescued the family (including a girl who was raped only) ... why did they Leave them out of the place? I do not see any ambulance around! There are many aspects of the movie that are true ... but I just wanted to help Major / Help / Support / Help a better director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
