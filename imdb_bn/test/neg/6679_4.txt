But we also have to oppose the full curiosity of this film, with a view where a girl's headphone manages to sink the word of her family, a finole that starts to fall back on a bad guy, and ends with Brothers Plane, as well as most ridiculous acting The screen is kept in a very clean, provocative script. But here and there are some cool action sequences and the unfamiliar smile factor of the film must be kept alive with a pulse. **
