I think I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These experimental films (and, yes, they spent a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail at a level: this intelligent single-minded person is often left out of the secret secret of fools. Of course, they give the price because they have similar errors in their testing. Frankenstein did. They do not expect to always have anything. There is a lot of things from pure science that are not fashionable for young women here, for fashionable cover-ups. The young woman certainly can not fetching herself and helping the doctor herself, but she may be a little more intelligent or even making an effort to resort to what she is doing. Things got wrong and due to this intelligence, he got a lot of power with understanding as to how he came. Rock Hudson looks quite fit here. She mostly does not make this role in this case. It wanders with plenty of cleanies and silliness which reduces the basic problem. Once he has taken his revenge, the more appropriate things will have to be inside him and allow him to find out and destroy him in some grand ways.
