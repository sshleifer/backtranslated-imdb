Al Pasino was once an actor capable of working in the role without resorting to the constant use of actors. In other words, when he could work, he would not have to talk like a street junk. McConnagi certainly was influenced by the passinoes because he was the founder of the word "F". It can be such a society that they live in reality, but most of us have the modesty to see what we say in a mixed company. I do not remember the exact words that Professor used Professor to explain the constant usage, but it was something like that. "It shows a lack of discretion to intelligence, poor language skills and everyone who hears". Maybe it's time to sharpen his light again and take some acting courses. Oh yes, the movie ... is probably the worst thing that McConnago has played. I hope his next role will be the companion of the more gifted people. Ren Russo was always hot.
