*** SPILILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen since last year was a "village." Any intelligence that insults anyone. Wrote poorly and wonderfully concreved. Discuss the way someone does not, especially in Los Angeles, these characters. There is almost no one. If the point of the film is to say that "we all have some intelligence", they have done terrible things to say clearly. Just his point was not definitely the base, but this character of each of these pictures was amazingly stupid. The car jacking scene often makes me walk along the rescue and he does not let the DUTY Rookie forget the white from the COP, it raises a black hole and ... I could go. Terrible, just awful
