I can not believe to sit through this garbage. D. C. Its palm trees (as already mentioned), a dummy-body-body bit so clearly artificial that I thought it was ready to be a dummy ... as long as it left the vampire ... stagnant dialogue, ridiculous plot I think Lilie's final film in Jill Ireland was her shame before her death. Do not waste your time - I do not want to. The only saving grace that it was on the wire, so I did not waste my money above everything.
