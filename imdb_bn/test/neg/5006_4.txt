It is tragic to see someone who is eligible for a George C Scot in a low budget thriller that the original novel was written by Graham Greene and it was consistently managed by a few more experienced men. A good senior photographer is not for consideration. The exterior setting of the novel is rather visible in captivity to capture the film firmly and has many missed opportunities with the carnival. <br /> <br /> The viewer commented on this site elsewhere, one Astute observer complained about a variety of diabolically bad expressions in this movie. Knowing Irene as Rochester I saw George C Scott, yet I prayed for him that he would never have to take a role that he had to pronounce British. Only then, he probably could have passed too much South Africans for British or British, perhaps acting by an American actor. I can stomach Mary Strip's extraordinary hard-hitting accents (both British and Australian) - at least in every sentence it seems right, he wants us to wonder about his skills. Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Scott is not a Morril strip, and it just destroys illusion - like Michele Yeah Crowking Tiger, making a stirring enthusiasm for Mandarin Singapore. <br /> <br /> Peterson does not work differently. We would like to see CSI. She is still very handsome in this movie and without more or less slim. He's the Harrison Ford of the TV. Each passion, same old expression for every situation. On the second thought, there are two Ford - confused / painful and happy. I've never seen a smile in the CSI!
