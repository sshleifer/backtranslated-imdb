Have ever happened to be seen with parent figures? Parents of this event are almost as irresponsible as kids. Instead of punishing them to manipulate the smallest child, they allow him to kill. When dealing with children, they can not agree with any step and they do nothing at all. Yes, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "cute." This show already tells manipulative Preeten that this "sharing and victory" strategy is the best way to get their parents 'cave'. The oldest children are constantly running and are imposing themselves in impossible circumstances, but their actions have no consequences. Yes, great television is okay.
