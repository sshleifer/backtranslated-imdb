First of all, season 1 is poorly humiliated. The prison is ridiculously unreal, the characters are so transparent to the two-dimensional, and the direction is terrible. It's playing like a bad video in a junior high school game, the characters are roaming around the characters, and telling deadline and practice lines, the closure of random prison interaction is going on. Soon the show gets better, but not by many. Returning from commercial breaks is always played impressively by the Whistle Perrineau, along with some ridiculous monologue by the wheelchair-bound Augustus Hill. His character is consistently in bad times only during the worst time of psychological periods, which occur mostly in an invisible rotary glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what is happening in the show. Unfortunately, bad ideas in Oz can fill an encyclopedia of different volumes. In all conditions, consider all of the first. Prisons are drunk, drug addicted, and not just CD players (CDs ?? they can pass steak knives), but all incoming mails are thoroughly tested by publishers. Christ, like the men's club with place guards. That's not much that guard Near the end of the season, the grandson of an old prisoner diagnoses the disease of leukemia, and all prisoners pitch $ 20 and $ 50 bill thick in order to help send Disney to fulfill his wish. This will be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prisoner of energy became suddenly cautious, loving boys without Kenny Wangler, an annoying character, but only those who believe together. Even Adbisi wanted to be nice. But that's okay, there are no commands or ideas on the show, so this is not a misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> Later, suddenly, there is a boxing scene, among which a prisoner "I love police" shirt. In jail !! Can you imagine I have a cousin who was in prison several years ago. I sent an old picture to him with some friends in high school, and in the picture, a friend of mine saw an "I love police" bumper sticker and "wood" (who was in jail, year and year) but only caught it And the shreds ripped it. My cousin is lucky <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also always beats the guard force and even more senior officers not to call it. One of them tried to bribe him to go to an English class. You may lose track of charges, prisoners or guardians. Multiple investigators, for example, go to underwear and die trying to stop the drug business. Personally, I will allow the inspector to visit the incoming mail without the risk of the investigator's life. <br /> <br /> I see, what else? Shilling's son Odi is alone and some do not want to ask how he got the drug on the street. He just ... caught them, I guess. And do not forget to pay attention, otherwise why would you miss the prisoners to get enough money to be able to afford the Accelerular Durmal graphs when you get bad drugs? I was not afforded this kind of luxurious treatment options to guests of maximum security prison. How did Robbes Dr. Asked about Farz's schedule, he can ask if he was given any kind of brain, Farz was so scared that he went to the warden and left the job on the spot. Doctor and dentist have the right to request not to see certain detainees? After the announcement of the full jury of poet and O'Reilly, Robson said. He wanted to see Farz, and he was taken to his office, brought to justice, and the guard immediately left without any word. They can also give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I can not take stupid ideas in this show, but it's like flooding, I can not stop it. Who can recognize Chinese refugees, who can not speak Chinese and disappear in solitary till they need them? Who did the religious war and all respected prisoners? Who is Robson Gum Transplant? What is the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agammanan because he is not directly involved in the jail and basmalais due to the whole matter with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was ultimately nothing more than a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> But what is the worst idea? The things that go somewhere, which are constant. An Irish man comes to the jail and makes a bomb. He threatened to blow up the whole prison, the bomb became ugly and after the entire prison was vacant, the bomb squad took him away. Never heard anything from him or the whole situation. It's like it happened. In one episode, dogs were given training for detainees. What bad condition If this is not bad enough, during a training session, a guard fires his gun into prison walls as a training exercise. No one seems to mind <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "I hope you do not think I'll leave it!" And then they walk away and let it go. Do not remember the audience. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was lost by the Prison Break, but the Oz is just a stupid prison drama which can be as good as a game. A short one. At least a low budget movie. Not enough to maintain a multi-season TV show. Then again, I saw six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand myself ...
