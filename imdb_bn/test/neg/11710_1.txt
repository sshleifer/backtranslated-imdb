This movie has made Anne and Mary's life unfamiliar. Mary Bolin, who was actually a slow and stupid animal, and made her fool the "good" sister. It was really a lot of interesting character, and that's why it's his life, and not Mary, which is often called. <br /> <br /> I failed in the reaction of the previous review, how was Ani's life so "criminal" ... Henry was a real criminal to me. Regarding the duration of these real-life events, husbands should be accepted whatever the purpose of the king to win a crown and to keep the barrier of his love. Ann, in most of her time, was the relatively innocent figure, most of the courtiers. Most modern historians have often overtaken stories and slander, and in most cases this film has been perpetuating to him and I have never heard of anyone who believes in rumors than sleeping with his brother. This film is so exciting and false that someone believes in this fact about "truth" about knowing this period of this history. <br /> <br /> I won 'even in filming the weird film ... but I'm sure the camera was not discovered in the 16th century, so I do not understand why Anna and Mary are talking to the whole movie together ... It's really a bad plot and it's disgusting and annoying, making it lightweight. <br /> <br /> Thousands of days Anne is not right, but one of the most playful women in history is coming closer to infinitely more entertaining and minimalist storytelling. Do not even think of renting it. It will not return within two hours!
