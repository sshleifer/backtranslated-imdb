Director Lo Wei was known for reading newspapers and taking a set of neaps - telling us about the method of filming, huh? The review I read is in two categories: 1) It's a bad movie, or it's a The movie is so bad that it is annoying. <br /> <br /> So we will agree on that matter - this picture is really bad. <br /> <br /> I am voting for Division 2. It's almost impossible to complicate, and it's worse and worse by the work and performance of the camera and the wrapping. Still, Lowway loved so much that he slowed the pens so that we could all be <br /> <br /> maybe maybe wey this day Or two) disturbed this day - he just wanted to enjoy the suffering, cast, crew and audience all the same.
