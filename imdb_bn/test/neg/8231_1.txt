This movie was so horrible that I can not even describe it. I was surprised that I was even sitting in the trash pill. I could not believe even a movie like this was thinking too. It was a serial killer that had a chicken-like clucks. She just does not get stuck a few times, she completely undone clucks out of the movie. He even stupider like a hammer flaps his arms which I have never seen. I could not believe that this happened in 1990. I thought it came to 80 or early. Then the girl was not very smart for protecting the chicken or the chicken. The last just gets worse and I have never seen bad ends. This movie is just chicken **. I smile more than being scared and I strongly advised that instead of looking at the film, got the fried chicken bucket.
