Edge v Michaelbs-Birring General (Prefer sweet Chinese songs on the chair) 4/10 Tackers. Hydeneric - I saw one of the worst matches, as expected in Hell 1/10 trip threat WWE match- Why I see them, no one has ever won the championship in the lane, this is not the main event. Shows it when JBL happened through the wall. 3/10 world heavyweight championship- fantastic oak match, beat more than a trip by a H more than a match, but I was happy to see it after watching the shit. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, Brand Showdown, Hassan Thing, and the last choice. 7/10 Above all still crap. Why do somebody watch the cyclone ???
