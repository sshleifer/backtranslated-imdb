This extraordinary annoying and unreasonable film made me think that Chaplin was genuinely Hitler, because only someone like him could torture people in this quarter. I saw this movie reestablishing, which caused more serious pain through this torture. This movie is painless, but it is nothing but a repetitive film, which, instead of indoctrinating for two hours, inspired it for two hours of spontaneous protests. After the first 10 minutes, I would like to start traveling from theater speakers. <br /> <br /> If I can give zero in 10, I'll do it with joy. Avoid all costs!
