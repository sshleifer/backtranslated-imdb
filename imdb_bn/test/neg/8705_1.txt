The filmmaker wanted to illustrate the story of Moses and the stream of Israel, and the film helped the film to understand the strong understanding of keeping the audience in shoes and keeping Moses on the shoulders. I was excited to see this movie and was very disappointed in the story. (I will give up videography, special effects, and artistic power in this review.) How frustrating it is to this historic account of the movie and historical accounts from the Bible syllabus so far. One of the upheaval principles of the Bible is that * God * led his people from Egypt and he promised that he would take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. He did not only promise this, but he led his people at the pillars of the cloud during the night and in the pillar of fire. He never left them; He was always visible to the Israelites. However, the film portrays an image that is silent when traveling through the desert. This movie has changed the theme and theme of the Bible text and instead portrays God as a neutral, cruel, disciplinarian savior. <br /> <br /> Moses' illustration was also wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why he regarded all Israel as parents in old and new rules, even Moses was known as a man of great faith). However, this movie portrays him as a real, angry, insecure loaner, who called on God his life. All right, I will give some creative freedom for film makers in the story of producer ... but it's beyond creativity - it's heresy.
