This movie is ridiculous. It is tried to be a comedy but the screen is awesome. The whole movie is made in low light and you can not realize that it is a comedy. Really bad cinematography You have to sit there and here some of the jokes have to be followed and it will be there, but on the other side they all are inside the jokes. It's worse that like a wannabe drama Flick. This is a really uninterrupted movie. Their expression does not reveal anything except frustration and disaster, which is how it came out. Unless you want to be disturbed by your ass, I suggest you stay away from this movie in this movie.
