Years ago, I made a fairly good TV titled "Linda". It was created in 1973, and Stem Steven starred Female Fattle Title Roll. After ten years, I am surprised to see the same story published on TV late in the night. However, it was a 1993 version, played by Virginia Maiden. Do not make me wrong, I can manage remakes, even vague ones. But this badly written and poorly-rated retrauded me sadly for Madison and co-star Richard Thomas. Contrary to the original, the conversation is torn apart, it makes me wonder, "Why were they bored again?" Second, the camera work is very heavy elephants, and film stock is poor. At the beginning of Christopher's "The Big Picture" of the guest, I occasionally felt reminded of the student film competition. Finally, Cast or Bored (Madness) or Trouble (Thomas). Actually, he really feels like enjoying the job Ted McGinley Of course, with its perfectly coifed hair and hairy teeth, she is really stretching herself from her previous work in "Eastern love boat". For the criticism of Bloom in the Bloom County, raise the following line: <br /> <br /> "For what movie this movie has done for the Q-ed." <br /> <br /> <br />
