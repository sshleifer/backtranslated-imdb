What a sucky movie It's not a lower-class B movie. The German elite StormTurupers attack is a strong example of Russian bunkers as an old WW1 war. The acting medium, the plot is thin and thread is similar. Sometimes it's hard to follow where going. Action sequences are quite effective (when it shows up) but it does not use proven equipment / vehicles from WW2. It is not in any way at the same level as "saving life" or "platoon". Lots of vain attempts at character development, which lead somewhere. The old theme is good officer / bad officer that is highly anticipated. Even the sequence of action is even a 12yr old child look set up for them. I could point out better. Very bad, this same guy was "Das Boot (boat)" because it was a great movie. After this success, he took a lot of part because he came to the film and lost his touch. I bought it instead of DVD, instead rented it.
