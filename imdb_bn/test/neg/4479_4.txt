The only romance of romantic romance and pain in this movie. If you want a cinematic adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel, follow the formula for the previous films, such as "massage in bottle", "night knights" and "a walk to smith", again remember. No one dies from accident by trying to save anyone else and romance does not convert this character here. <br /> <br /> There is a soft spoken special forces army sergeant, John Tier ("GI Joe's Channing Tattam"), there are two memorable memories of two weeks of flying. Savarla Curtis (Brilliant Amanda Seferrand of "Mama Mia"), who spent spring break in South Carolina, left a printed college girl with him. Savannah does not drink, he smokes, but he tells the person that his head is filled with superstition. Uncertainly, John and Savannah fall madly in love with each other and introduce a continuous exchange letter of love characters which tend to sleep by a standard. While serving the army in some angelic corners around the world, he is outside the world, when he is in the college worried about his letters in the college. Just as they are hot and heavy in them, suicidal terrorists crash the plane at the World Trade Center. Without mentioning the option of John Savannah, he re-wrote his friends with a wave of patriotism. Meanwhile, another man, an impostor, but friendly family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial"), whose autonomous, autistic child's name became the object of Alan Savannah. She is a girl who helps in building a house for the less fortunate and wants to start the summer horse farm for autistic children. Delay in what seems to be done before he was finally identified with Tyree with eponymous characters. In fact, he pushes him for a patient! Later, he confessed to John that he knew that the sound of his voice broke the solution to marry Tim, so he did not make that terrible call. Probably, John Savanah expressed concern over the lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero took some bullets in Germany and carried the wind. Although all of these are transmitted, Ti is his own coin collector, Mr. Tari (Richard Jenkins of "Stap Brothers"), who is suffering from Aspera syndrome, is trying to talk to him. It seemed that his father suddenly went to the hospital on his last legs. The honor of the lead female character lacks a shred and a tremendously low blow tire amount to his betrayal. Ti, his father, and Tyri's Commander Keith Robinson, is the only sympathetic character in this long distance epistolary romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning in the uninterrupted love story. Isha!
