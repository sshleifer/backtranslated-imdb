It is one of the fundamentalist Christian films, which strikes religion with religion, like a slaghammer. You know when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous. Three Mexican Mexicans flying to Mexico to deliver the Bible. It does not give any idea from the Protestant church and most Mexican Catholics. The Protestant and Catholic Bible is not the same. There are books in the Catholic Bible that are not Protestant Bible. It is difficult to believe that churches in Mexico will not distribute the Bible to them. I understand that they are going to some place where Christianity is minority. But Mexico is far away. If you can not believe in a story setup, then you do not have the story left. A movie about religion may be entertaining, but this movie is not.
