It was such that anyone trying to create scary video games and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrific, another movie for directors that started happening all the minutes, the real ghost hunting video was edited like a scary movie instead of investigating, the music tunes and the words that came from the house were influenced by what would happen to confuse you. Thank you for wasting my time 2 hours! When there was evidence, it would fly by! Most of these people were talking about this place. The Ghosthunters episode shows how this event was completely destroyed. I'm so annoyed with sci fi channels for this game, I have not seen it from promoting it.
