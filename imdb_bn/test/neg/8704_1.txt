I was angry after seeing this photo as the first half of a Christian. The film's website said that they researched the film before writing, but I believe they forgot to consult with the last source of the Bible. I am sitting with two different versions of the Bible and half of what happened in this movie is not available. They made what was in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible, which they thought that modern filmmakers wanted to see instead of the truth. I personally am very young to remember the Ten Commandments of 1950, but it can not be anything worse than that. I have written on the network and only hope that they publicly apologize for this abhorrence.
