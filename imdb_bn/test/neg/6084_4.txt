It is embarrassing that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth only lean towards fierce stories and scripts for money. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It has some nice location, it's a great production, some good camera work and editing, and it's fairly well-read . <br /> <br /> What is the real problem? Fairly simple, the entire courtyard is completely incredible. However, instead of spoiled a nasty story for you, if I can get through it you have to find out all about it. I managed, but only because I like Baldwin and I hope that it will be better. <br /> <br /> It was not. And, it was one of the most anti-climatic ends seen for a long-term. Actually, sometimes ... <br /> <br /> But, it's fun to be frustrated, I guess, if you're not good at anything.
