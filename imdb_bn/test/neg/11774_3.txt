What is it about drug addiction that the film makers offer their own proposal for the first time? This topic has been dead. Drug abuse is bad. We get it. The drug addiction watch is painful. We get that too But the filmmaker's license does not allow the film to create a vicious film with respect to the block. Not every movie requires HitachiCean excellence in the cinema's superiority, or Osson Wellson's deep focus should be used, but it is still a descriptive film. Verite does not mean the meaning of a pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DVD cameras are capable of producing white-white and black blacks, and this filmmaker is simply idle by shooting in contrast to the existing light: the film is completely intrepid with the cunning cinematography. And even there are a sound mix of documentary films. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right ingredients, but the director indicated more on her and sucked all the life out of her performance. Addicts can live in a fog, but they still have passion, but these characters seem to be present in any off-screen. Supporting players provided their lines only without creating genuine people. Sorry, sorry to be Debra, but some things do not want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next film will be better - but please do not have another drug movie. :)
