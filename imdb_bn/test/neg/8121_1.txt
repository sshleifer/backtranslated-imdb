Seriously ... I am surprised at all the good feedback here on this show. We have two foolish kids who have a bizarre smile on this show and they just like the unusual funny things ... listen to two shows, but most of the suicides get ... as they comment on the music video that is going to be <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> ", or better and generally used quote" that was cool ", and above all, their annoying h C. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try Simpsons, Rain and Steamy, South Park, this show really does not have the time or energy to see this terrible MTV series.
