This is a very awesome movie. And if you think you've seen another horror movie, you probably have it just like before. You've probably seen Sccrro 2 created in 2003. Yes, what I said, Brian (director) stole the idea of ​​the movie. And he not only stole it, he has actually been able to make it worse. I bet, even the actors were afraid to tell people that they were actually in the movie. Also I should mention that the director is trying to try to make glasses showing the possible tits as possible. Also kiss scenes are done together like a porn movie. Actually the director never saw that, and tried to unite a suitable movie that would never work.
