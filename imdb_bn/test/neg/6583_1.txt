Too many fantasy fantasy, if you still look at a shot - it does not look so bad. But when people start walking, then it is very dangerous. The lack of blurred motion, lack of emotional emotions, and a feeling of feeling in the face gives me creeps. Characters are not even present in Alivai / Organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview screening with my daughter, really fell asleep! He was not all involved. For the record, I used to think that he was easily associated with Pixar-Esque films as well as a few pictures of 'Bad' 2D movies like Sinamad. <br /> <br /> The light is painful, giving the appearance of children a campfire holding a flashlight under their chin. Bad sinking lips - actually worse than final fantasy. <br /> <br /> I seriously asked Hong Kong to play five letters but it is a big confusion across the whole film. The role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way I can not just pinpoint. This reminds my father's fake "phone" voice when greeting clients. <br /> <br /> I think these multiple roles are confusing - you know very well that the voice is the same, but still different. It thinks each character as ACTED, opposes it as a real human character. Realizing the role of hacks has broken reality. I saw the trick - a La Eddie Murphy, but Hanks could not just drag it with the voice, with the terrible animation. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my money - wait for the rent.
