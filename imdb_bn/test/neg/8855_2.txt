Great play? Mentally strong? Bad words! BBC Habib has lost big time for skilled productions like Wire, Soprans and Carnival. OK, so the budget may be much smaller, but last night 'The Street' was poorly played, expected, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and waste a big fat of time. The TV (British TV) was not as good as it was and is moving forward behind American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of cruel violence from 'local gangster'. There is no indication that this man was insane enough to kill a man honored for so long. There was no remorse when he did this, and such a character should not be such that when Bob Hossein called his son Pansi, 'brave' appearing. <br /> <br /> I want to express my discontent for this show, but I am not, and although I can not prove my point enough, I believe that it is unclear, shock TV, which Life does not show any real internal perspective. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
