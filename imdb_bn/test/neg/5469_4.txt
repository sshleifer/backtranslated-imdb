While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and has been sexually abused by three hooded women for a long time. He has been released, the director of his company Isabella (GREAT SCAKCHI) has already replaced him in this game, and his girlfriend welcomes him cold. Angry and disgraced Daniel Dans left the company and went wrong to find abductors. Daniel feels that many women are victims of sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> "Deepika Bukit" is a weird movie that loses an initial initial power and it becomes a long-loving soap-opera or soft-faded shirt. Dedicated production, the DVD cover is exceptionally well, but the letters do not improve well and Daniel's panic seems too heavy, because most people will be fantasy with the dream. Three sexy women become sex objects. Concerned about Isabel's illness, the composer did not add value to the development plots; The open conclusion is very frustrating and there is no explanation about the purpose of women or title. The screenplay about a man's feelings was very clear. It was nice to see the beautiful Grara Sketch again and ultimately its make-up was impressive. There is a word in Portuguese that can be translated into English: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should be doing this and almost a stupid story about two hours should be protected from watching me. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Livro Das Revelco" ("Publication Book")
