The 17th century billionaire ship La Diałblo started in the Streets of 'Ivan San Sebastian 1683' after the drowning of a violent thunderstorm. Go to the Streets of 'San Sebastian Present Day', where two divers are looking for wild water rich wild coral hay, it comes across the debris of El Diablo and discovers it, but it attacks and kills it. A naughty eel. Captain Mac Cash (Owen Crowford) operates a boat-rent owned by the owner and 'participant wiking' which is available for tourists who want to fish, dive and usually explore the islands. Sarah Livingston (June Chadwick) is an industrial teacher who ran for treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to just pass the time?), She hired Max and her short-working Assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she could try Diablo detect and get rich. Dhumketu's wealthy enthusiasm encourages more immoral members of the local community, because they derive the attention of Max and Sarah by mocking the perpetrators and the fact that El Diablo had a past past, the idea of ​​the past has still surpassed its supernatural heir, even now ... <br /> <br /> The June-Cloud Douba operated, though with a little help from the IMDB star Crowford   ংস্করণটি শুধুমাত্র ডুবইয়ে তালিকাভুক্ত দেখেছি, আমি ভাবলাম ইভিলের কিছু সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে এবং একটি বিট ভিন্ন কিন্তু দুর্ভাগ্যবশত এটি একটি পাথর মত সমুদ্রের নীচে ডুবন্ত থেকে এটি সংরক্ষণ করার জন্য যথেষ্ট নয়। The script written by Arthur Payne is okay with two diverts killed by some of the sea creatures, but this opening is never mentioned again, the creature is never seen again, and there is no other miracle. Next, the famine below is suffering from a serious incident of serious and identity crisis, it does not seem to be what it wants to tear apart the pieces and pieces of different styles from the deviation of water, horror, action, thriller, crime and threats. Even when it's time to throw in a little kill mystery and religious meaningless. As a result, the Evil has become very different, and the best view of the whole film is that I have found myself in the first opening section and becoming more frustrated with the lack of any series of horrors because it has gone faster and we do not see sea animals again. The temple is low, slow, unknown, expected, stupid and lacks any kind of elegance or intelligence, in short, Evil does not do any good work below that should be a good film. <br /> <br /> The director dive failed to make some vigorous though he clearly shot huge wildlife material, but I thought that I saw a national geographic documentary with all shots of fish, coral and wildlife. Often, I forget about any cow, washing some blood and watering the blood and often coughing blood. <br /> <br /> Technically, the bottom of the Evil is very basic, as well as the soft and beautiful photography of the water. Fish. These points and shoot components and overall production standards are very low, even where these shots were not very sunny or attractive appearance. Actor is poor, but then I expected something again? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This result is a mess. Add it to low production prices, there's no ghosts and absolutely minimal stuff that you can avoid, even if you have a great movie that can probably avoid your best disappointment and even definitely have 90 minutes more ways to spend your life. .
