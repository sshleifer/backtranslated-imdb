"Harrow's Dungeon" is a lot of things that can make it a pretty horror movie. Christie Manson, Torture Chamber, a paranoid host, henchman, a horse in the dungeon, etc. But sadly not saying that it was not well-formed. <br /> <br /> An author and captain breaks the ship owned by an island a fort, his slave, and a silent maid. The count has become more susceptible to the fact that the displaced men (all in the ship) are pirates (in all things) and they are attracted towards them and attracted and persecuted silent maid with them, tortured and imprisoned. Sound or bad? <br /> <br /> Not OK. I call this one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I'm hesitant. Because it was so much probable that it is not actually "worst". However, this is a big hit against this film to see all possible possibilities. After all, this is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> When our hero is covered in the dark, very gothic scene is seen and face by the mad and lethal roaring bride. Wedding dress This was both scary and annoying both of the first time I saw these scenes horror open. People I wanted this a good movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the rights to make this movie a late-night movie, but eventually all the mistakes were made. I recommend someone restoring this one
