This film is really quite weird. Definitely certain * events * Dublin identified as the main hero known as "General" but almost everything is just wrong. We are not talking about the distortion of ancient history ... but unreasonable, complete distortion of documented information. The question is why? The guard is identified as the next day, his gangstones, his gang non-meninge, and people like Kevin Spesy himself. Anyway almost pure fiction, why try to give a resemblance to the realism? That's all, it's a poor exercise * No way you want to see it. Someone does not have a second value at all.
