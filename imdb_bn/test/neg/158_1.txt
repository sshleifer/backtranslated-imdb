I tried to see this adaptation, but it was so terrible that I could not torture myself in this way. Except Ariel's exception, the performance was quite sub-par. Phunda was at the top of a role that should be handled with some damage. I've studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, and so far, the worst I've ever seen. I wonder why some people in the world are wondering about this picture. Shakespeare, and in many cases nicely adapted. It's not one of them. If you see this movie, can I tell a drink game? Drink whenever the funder leaves the original idea and two drinks from the book. You should be quite drunk in very short periods.
