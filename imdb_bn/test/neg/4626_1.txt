I saw it on a Sci-Fi channel so that I knew it would be bad to start, but I was hoping it was worse than expected. The effect of the CGA on the dragon was terrible, even for saa-fi channels and the study was unfortunate. I could not say if this curiosity is stupid or how it comes out. The only release quality of this movie is terrible that it is almost funny, especially in the part where Patrick Swayze's protagonist moves to the house of his father's father, who retired after losing his legs and is now in bed for the sole purpose. He was a knight to tell viewers. Most of the film focuses on a large dragon egg that stops an extraordinary baby dragon with a bad CGI that I have ever seen. This was just awful.
