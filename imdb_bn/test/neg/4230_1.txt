I can never remember that I was so disappointed by a movie. Probably I expected to happen too much (in a way you can expect course course of course style cinema). But nothing here is going on. Thankfully, I was watching it at home and quietly quietly could channel switch when quietly start to kill me silently in the face. And that was very often! It is not really a man who does not talk and move slowly, unreasonable pig and French kiss men are not too much pleasure, not to mention the ugly bodies being explicit sex. Just if it is any ideas ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; Being able to solve the crime was actually made up of zero characters, it was also made to show one more zoni. Only four incognito characters have been developed and no film is going anywhere, it is very soon clear that the director has been chosen as the killer. And makes any Sence. Despite all the annoyance and anguish, I must admit that it has suddenly come to me unknowingly. I do not recommend it though maybe you should examine it yourself.
