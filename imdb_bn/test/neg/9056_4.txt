Personally, I did not really get the full benefit from the law to meet one of yourself. I've reviewed the really highly rated review here for the film, and I'm a little surprised. Maybe I felt "moved" by some other critics, but I thought the film was quite tedious and basically unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The film's "Action" is an autopsy footage that is "Art House" Style - Extremely close-ups, strange editing, etc ... and with no words or dialogue <br /> <br /> < br /> I think the law to meet one can be considered as a study of human decomposition, or maybe (if you really want to dig a bit) make a few comments about humanity's weakness or whatever - but personally I find it semi-attraction But at the end, we think of the empty stream of spontaneous footage. If it's your thing, then it will be a winner for you. For me - I saw more interesting ER footage. Not a "bad" movie, because it's not really a "film" in a traditional sense - I could not find anything really remarkable about it - 4/10.
