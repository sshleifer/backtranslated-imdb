Queen Gelguard is great, but the rest of the movie does not work. It's like a hamburger-zelo-molded salad - interesting idea, but who ever thought that it would actually work in movies? I like the two previous films of director La Boot - they were cruelly honestly and gently funny. This movie only leads to ruthlessness and coolness - with quotes junk dolls. (As a high idea, think: Doris Day-Rock Hodson may have produced the movie Sam Pacinpah - now you can match your expectations to the current production state of Hollywood.) These actors, Freon, Kieron, Eckert, Wins, and Janny Almond make their scenes alive. Which creates a discipline of their novelty inexplicability which is raised above objects which are only a Do not have the lips. Funny to the movie (in the Lynchian way) if Freeman is not suspected that this incompatible moral is seriously accepted, I have found Freeman's capricious, sentimental-well-spoken statement. .
