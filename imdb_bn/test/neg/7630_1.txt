I think Sovi√®re has given the most annoying and trivial "tactics" in the history of the film, but of course I was wrong. I have no hesitation because this movie is going to be good. Unfortunately, I was worse than expected. The worst part is the clear ending is so ridiculous and terrible that it does not actually happen until you can believe it.
