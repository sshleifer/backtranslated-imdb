My first disappointing BBC / Jane Austen flick. Tone off, costume off, hair off, music from outer space, and Robert Hardy, blessing him, looks like he's really bothered to be such a stinker. Even casting something off. No, I'll take it back, a good director can come out of a bell fiber, so you can say. The performance of this item is so great on the top and the musician that it is almost absolutely amazing in the story of Jane Austen, which is a satirical after sending a worship / primitive Gothic novel to the messy abbey. I wanted to slap the female lead after a while; Who decided that he would be so cruel? Immediately I saw Pride and Prezudis ('95) to get a bad taste from my mouth. Ram Ram!
