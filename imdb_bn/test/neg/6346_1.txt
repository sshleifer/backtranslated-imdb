I'm not sure who should blame for this frustration - Actually, acting is not bad and some stories made for Disney movies are not terrible. The story itself is shallow and resorting but not surprising in such a film. Acting is more than a bit bi-dimensional, but I credit myself for the achievement of the actors to do something with the material they could work on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> They have created a 'perfect' pop star and then acted in an actress who can not sing to save his life. Can not sing the girl, if someone can record the song! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
