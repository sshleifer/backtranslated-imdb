I was not impressed with the graffiti artist despite the appeal of an article (low budget reforms). There is little dialogue and at least for me, I was disappointed that it does not give more credit or guerrilla artists do not promote this work. Instead, it is a story that covers the familiar area. Compared to tags buildings, there are two friends who work a little more, tag partners, and finally check with a relationship. They seem like the opposite, but rather uncomfortable together. Little about their background has been explained and it happened at a fast pace between two young people (though, I realize that it is only 70 minutes or more). In recent years there have been numerous number of plots and productions of the same kind that the noise of the independent film has started to be associated with this particular story, such as these mainstream and much more have become involved. <br /> <br /> Most movies can encourage viewers, who need immediate dialog and purpose. The basic image of this story (at least widely), almost any dialogue, no insight and performers routine with nothing else to carry the viewer. And, for a small film, I wish they could get quicker at the point. That bothered me apart from the ordinary plots. Yet there was something about a passing surveillance between at least two graffiti artists' daily practices, even if it was not for most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are tired of mainstream shit and do not mind an indie picture and some are interested in this underground, urban art form. But, you must see it for yourself, because it can be one with a more flavored taste. See Transit for More Recent Indie Films Centered by Graphite Artists
