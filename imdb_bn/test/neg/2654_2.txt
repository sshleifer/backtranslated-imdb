I'm a video store clerk, so I try to watch movies that are carried out every week. I have a problem with this; Actually, I think it's a privilege. So do not with this film. . . After a half and a half hour after the hero of our hero, he shot his way through the scene and I planned to get to the scene. I felt like sitting in my house sitting in this room. And if I knew that there was another hour to rest, then I could have left it right. I did not think about the characters, the filming was ineffective, and Ford began eating a kiss like a thief. Even the score was inconsistent and jarring. What a waste
