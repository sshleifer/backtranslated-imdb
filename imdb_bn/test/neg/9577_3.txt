This Spanish-Italian co-producer tells a funny and surprising story about Dr. Banner, who is not only a woman, but a scarred face that leaves her behind a scary face that makes her look like a scary. But in Madrid, a professor knows that some tests have been conducted on animals with reproductive substances in cells. The test was successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because Professor Dr. Do not allow the first human guinea pig to barnster, he kills the substance by killing him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie. Also, the film gets boring after the good start and is not able to go back to the speed, although the film does not exceed its running time of 83 minutes. And the setting for the last third of the movie has been changed to the Swiss city of Geneva, it sometimes shows a holiday movie as we see how beautiful Geneva is (it really - but it does not help the plot to move forward.) Thus, with more talented directors, good actors and a big budget "Shantik" may become a vague Italian classic. But, as such, it's simply a relentless and annoying crime film that is not really valuable. Ratings: 10 out of 3
