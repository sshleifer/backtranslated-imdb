This image is about a young man's painful journey to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and neutral. It does not depend on steamy sexual scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot is occasionally incompatible and may seem disconnected and some events are not properly interpreted. Although I understand this because this image is a collection of memories that is very personal to the director My mistress about her sister and mother probably does not need the existence of this film, but I can certainly imagine that her very important event in this life. <br /> <br /> The movie's budget is clearly visible. It is a sad that sound effects are done badly. The description and some conversations (especially the classroom teacher with the French teacher) are so echo that what makes it hard to do. Ambient sound, significant traffic noise, is also captured across the film. When a scene falls in the other, the level of traffic is changed. <br /> <br /> This film is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary for a young man's journey to take his sexuality.
