What was it on the earth? My family and I just waisted about 2 hours of our life for this piece of evil! No plot, no tension, just a lot of annoyance !!! My kids can do better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But maybe we could not find the point of the movie ... Oh wait, my mother. He liked the reason for the following reasons: "At least a movie that is not a movie ..." If you are looking for war movies with any war, it is still interesting and strong and powerful anti-war message, then you will have to see "Trench". <br /> <br /> I think this image is 3 good out of 10 because it's good enough for a afternoon and because I'm very nice ...
