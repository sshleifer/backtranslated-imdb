It often does not feel strongly for posting something about a film. This, though, was the worst movie I ever seen. Performance was ridiculous at the best, they were bad, well, there is no other sound for it, terrible. Especially the lead ladies who will be seen and heard of random sex under-ons. Actually, the plot is unrecognizable, conversation is scary and characterized ... there is no one. I'm surprised this is not the picture of Alan Smith. I can not stress this strong enough ... to avoid all costs. How can these films be made? It's not too bad to make a budget movie.
