First off, I found that this image has got 7 ratings on this site. At first I thought that the industry people could log in to IMDB and jacking the rating. But seeing the tasting tomato and it looks like this movie has a rating of 76%, it seems that people have duplicated the scary pains for hypocrisy. I mean, this picture is just awful. Acting is just terrible, but the rest is bad. At least played some (unintentional) laughs. <br /> <br /> The son of a teenage skateboarding is involved in this plot, which is being interrogated with his friends for a murder in which they skate. And that's about it. The rest of the film includes terrible acting, horror dialogue, slow shot shot of man, face-to-face, human skating, often set to music that does not fit the scene. Probably that is to be "cool" or experimental or hump. Or perhaps it was hoped that it would fool the man that it is deep in some way, but it does not work. This film is nothing to work on. It's pretentious garbage. I can not recommend it enough.
