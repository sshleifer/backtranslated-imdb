Terror in the jungle is a real quest. When you saw it, you are one of the few lucky ones. <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is an incident of a crash in the middle of the South American jungle. Crash view will be believed. Everyone died in the crash or later survived by crocodiles. Just survived a young blonde boy. A nearby tribe brings children to their village and they (all men) respect her because of her golden hair! I'm not joking with you! Eventually there are many natives in search of survivors and many wrestling people. All the time, the baby sat on a throne and her blonde hair was surrounded by a golden delight and she cried nonstop !! This is a hoot !!! <br /> <br /> contains very vague and very suspicious elements. If you are unclear then it is certainly very good-it's a good movie.
