If this show is first broadcast I would love to be curious with the premiere and setting. With an open mind I saw the first two episodes and naturally it was run in most cases in half-season. I recently saw A / E and saw an advertisement for this trash and I could only surprise myself. I really hope people see it for a smile and do not take it seriously. Characters are really some of the most ridiculous and straightforward ridiculous in the script or otherwise on television. It is certainly making ratings so I will give credit to the establishment and maintaining a fanbase, but I seriously hope someone is watching it under any evidence serious.
