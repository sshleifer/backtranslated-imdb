Bloody Birthday inaugurated from the General Hospital shot at Maidivawal! A total of three children were born at roughly the same total time at the same time. A caption tells us that it's now 'Medawale, California, 1 June, 1980'. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Anne Smith (Erica Hope) are going to do business in an open graveyard. They hear the noise and the duck investigation. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brady (Bart Crumar) is annoying and there is only one child's skipping rope handle which holds Annie. Unfortunately Sheriff Brody could kill her little girl Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and her two friends, Curtis Taylor (Billy Jane, as Billy Jacobi) and Steven Saiton (Andy Freeman) before killing. As they finish their class name Timi Russell (KC Martel) another young boy Sheriff Brody, as well as the three murderers are aware of how he saw it. Shortly after the incident, Timmy played with Steven and Curtis at a junkyard. Curtis Lock Timmy in an old locker. Timmy leads to escape and tells his sister Joes (Lori Lathin), but she does not believe in him at first. Carries the killing of three children. Their harsh teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) is a van and their victims are Savie couple of Big Brother Beverly (Julie Brown) (John Avery and Silvia Wright). Joeys started to suspect Debbie, Curtis and Steven, who targeted him and Timmy for the evil three. Can they assure the authorities that these three innocent 10 year old children are really murderers? <br /> <br /> Ed Hunt co-written and directed a deep dislike for this film. I think it's absolutely terrible and it does not have a single enjoyable viewpoint during the 83 minute running time. Hunt and Barry Pearson's script does not give us any explanation about the purpose of our child's murderers, which excludes the sun, and there is no conscience for these strange children for some strange aesthetic reasons, so when was this only child born? If that is true, why do they wait before their tenth birthday before their killing? I guess it suddenly kicks, suddenly? It is reasonably well paced to credit but I still found it incredibly annoying and tired to sit through. Completely the film is very irrational and predictable, children are exposed as killers in the first 10 minutes and I mentioned after no purpose. It's very stupid, too. Watch the scene where Debbie Steven fires a bowl over him and stops it! If Sheriff's death is put down to him a few steps down, yes it's just that the injury hit from the accident is not going to be the same as if you practically will notice that his beaten death with a baseball bat, no capable doctor or pathologist in 5 seconds. There is no single drop of blood in the whole picture, and all lame killings are soft and unknowable. There are some nudity shown outside, like Debbie charges 25 cents by hitting the boys when her sister strikes Beverly. Just after the 5-minute mark, Joses wanders in the kitchen's room and the Bam Mike is clearly visible on the screen, even a small thing, even after a completely obscure thing, an early scene. The general disqualification continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and immediately forgettable. Actor is a poor lifelong, these three kids are very annoying and have come to my nerve since the beginning and through this film, much more, Curtis was sitting in her gynecker's eye glasses. I just hate this as simple as that film. I can not think of a good thing to say about it. Of course one should avoid.
