The last fall (2001), I have taken a movie class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hesier). His great knowledge of filmmaking, the ability to disassemble any film scene, and the Academy Award winner in some obscure classes give more credibility than his average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had finished filming a movie "Full Raid" and was in the next generation, my interest grew. However, the end that I will never hear that film project. Last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week, I saw on a TV list that the "Full Ride" was shown on the WB network. It instantly raises a red flag, because I can not help but with the help of Dobson Creek, Charmed, TINplotation Shows, we can cooperate with WB. Plus, the whole round was about to be released straight on the TV. . But, however, I dropped out of that time and was sitting to see the creation of my former film teacher. <br /> <br /> After two hours and the end credits started rolling, I think it looks long and difficult. What I saw was a simple WW-quality show which extended up to two hours long. In fact, it almost seemed that this movie was created with the sole intention of displaying the WB network only. This film will be relatively straightforward to criticize a common WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are shallow, story in every sense, the scene is completely transformed and the development of character is compulsory and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Off in a life of crime. Then, instead of being imprisoned, he was given full scholarship. Obviously, without much choice he agreed to play soccer with the football team, but his fellow teammates are not excluded from his poor spirits due to his spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> After love comes the interest. Of course! Where would this expected fanfare be without a love interest? He came in Amy Leer (played by beautiful Meridith Monroe). He is actually a favorite character, as opposed to so annoying Matt Sabo, so we almost appreciated him for rejecting him for the first time. But, of course, the inevitable pass comes to pass. She falls for her, changes her attitudes towards everything, and feels all good and happy. But now it's time for the conflict! Before the movie, Amy made Matt clear that she does not want to score with her because it is her and her mother's 'shameful'. It will not get Matt's frustration and his football friends (yes, they finally become warm to him) who betting him. But, of course, Matt finally comes to accept these terms and decides that he is not everything about Noki. Here's where the exciting plot thickens. If you do not want to destroy this wonder then proceed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Matt came out of some people that obviously Amy Leah always tried to score with a person every year from the All-Star team so that she could not see her little Work in a cafeteria in the city (which is boring at first) and it can take it to a big city. Suddenly he realized that his love was a shame, Matt tried to return to the crime scene and left the football camp before the "big game". Ammi tried to reassure her that she really was in love, but it got very hot by buying it. So what will Matt do? Will he take him back? Or will he loot the gas stations and return to the all-round shock? I will not waste your super-ultra-wonderful end. <br /> <br /> [last speaker] <br /> <br /> So, if I pumped you for this movie, please understand that my revelation and genuine encouragement were not. This movie is a vague version of 'University Blues' or 'Summer Catch'. And that's not saying so much. There is no comedy to save it and the characters are very careful. So what have you left? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not like the most of this picture, this photo shows how much of the negative picture painted Heiger is. It seems that he is trying to capture teenage life in Nebraska and small towns in the rural areas, but his methods are all very simple and shallow. The high expectations of the characters for the creation of 'big cities' and the steps they take to make them exceedingly exaggerated and only make it less that a bunch of hikers residing in the farm communities of Nebraska I am not sure about Hogar's intention to try to establish his home country in the spotlight, but I think he has ended up with a very shameful product. If Heger wanted to portray Nevskasa in a favorable light, then he would have to take a note or two from Alexander Penney. Payne just likes to use Nebraska as a backdrop for her movies, when Heger integrates it with the plot of the Flower Ride and is so confused by the awareness of where she is shooting, that the garbage from there exposed external exterior. Hogar lived in reality, you thought he knew better than him. Finally, I was frustrated by Hogar's first big movie, and I hope next time he thinks about a few different individual different ideas.
