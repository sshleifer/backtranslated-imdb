The final straw in this movie. As two dedicated fans of romantic comedies, this movie has finally come to our attention that there really is no such good thing since love. Whatever the film was good about nothing. It was an unpleasantness of love, death and everything in between. With horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry in the characters. This image took out Sparks of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can not work to save her life. She was reluctant to laugh, cry, and dance to her. And she needed a good haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Protect yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
