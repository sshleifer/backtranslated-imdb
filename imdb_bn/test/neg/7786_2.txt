The BBC murder thriller is about the heterosexual loss of deception, you know that the killer must be: homosexuals <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br? Let's see, can it be that mother who (in all the general sense) lets her teenage boy visit the unexpected visit behind the serial-keller's father bar? Could it be Moody's boy, who is influenced by his feminist attitude about his parents? Could it be like a serial killer, who is able to use the incident from La Bar, a La Haniab speaker? Could it be a mother's boyfriend, a teacher in school whose ex-student's wife is sued for her? Or can it be a girl of lover, who throw everyone's secret in school? No, this is probably none of the suspects. This is ... gay! <br /> <br /> The only mystery for the audience is to guess who is gay. Of course, this can be someone, because the only characteristics of homosexuals are shameful secrecy and the tendency to kill and otherwise make life difficult for "normal" people. Homosexual society is the invisible root cause of disaster; Only when this person is exposed and cleared, the fractured family can come back together, and things can go back to normal ... whatever it is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Justa Redgrey and Robson Green are now officially past their date of sale. The world can get surprisingly again without seeing again on the screen, but as long as the BBC plays The Aggressive Woman and the Miss Understood Man, I think they are returning to such movies.
