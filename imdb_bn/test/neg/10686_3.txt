Animal-food (GAYC) scenes were not as bad as your opinion. After seeing Mando Can and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. When the man ate the head from the mouse, it was the most people. But they were so fast and some did not disturb me. No, the movie was just interesting. I always like to listen silly voice over. They do not even listen to the actors / actresses who do not feel like they really enjoy the real life. I like the bright colors dressed by the princess. The strange looking bug shot was very cool. The youngest princess really young, looked at about 14 or something. The fight scenes were not as long and annoying as the fight of the fight, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
