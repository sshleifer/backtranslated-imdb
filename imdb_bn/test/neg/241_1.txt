Mexican 'classic' Aztec Mummy was the third entry in the series. As soon as you find out, this movie is nothing but a classic, instead, it's like a movie that deliberately tries to force you. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal Aztec's wealth from the grave, but the tomb that is protected is the commercial walk of the toilet paper: Aztec Mummy. He does not know that Mummy can beat, then he builds a robot, and that's a very bad one. We're only in the last rail I saw Robot, he wandered around and fought with agate Mami. <br /> <br /> I've seen so many sunny Saifai films, the films I've seen are frustrating, but this one, it's 64 minutes full time, the worst movie I've seen, coming close to Furan ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
