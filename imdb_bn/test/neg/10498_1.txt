I could not stand ten minutes in this horrible movie. In the age of DV and cameras, it seems to be shot in VHS with a color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the limitation of filmmakers and even doing it <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that the film has been distributed because I saw quite a good movie At least still domestic or international release I guess the box is selling it ... it has good box art, but it goes down from the bottom. <br /> <br /> Side Note: Looks like the director has 11 friends, because this planet will give this image "10".
