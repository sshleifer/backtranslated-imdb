Once a month, I invite some friends to the "Rite Movie Movie". We are looking forward to movies, which are very funny, or they have no plot and only show a lot of chests. Last night, we were unfortunate as one of the fighter planets in our movies. Cinematography is similar to what we're using, but the acting was a different story. The main role played by Johnny Depp / Rob Jabber - who can not take a role in high school play, leave alone the load-bagget horror movie. This is a miraculous hero who can not tell whether our unwanted hero, who wanted to be this scene or a fearful coward, was the 30 year old film that I had to stop at a bitter time. Movie night It was a great possibility to have a great twist on standard zombie infections, but they take a completely different direction based on Johnny Zumbia. I personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. However, sadly, yesterday I invited some 80% of the film with me.
