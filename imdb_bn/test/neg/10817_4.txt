Some scientist people go to the cave for some reason and there are some animals to lose their lives. <br /> <br /> I usually plotted more detail, but I did not pay too much attention to it. Overall, it was absolute and you're only paying attention to the time of the action scene, which made the director wonder. <br /> <br /> Acting is ok, but letters are so humble and forgotten that they blend your mind. Those who have forgotten you and who have died for 2 reasons: 1. The killings are annoying 2. The characters are annoying. <br /> <br /> If I knew who was the end then the last one could surprise me more. <Br> <br /> So you're looking for an animal-in-cave movie? Check out the breed instead.
