About gorgeous air is so much fun to break your legs. It is of course a terrible example of a film. So awful that I do not even consider it a movie. I describe it as a thing more ... a giant thing. One thing that must be stopped is the cost. My friends and I first discovered this thing ... Video tapes at my friend's house were buried under a big box. It was a late night and we were not good at doing anything, so we decided to watch some Chess horror movies (we unfortunately liked it). All right, playing this thing in 90 minutes, we started to laugh so hard that we almost torn apart. The meaning of things is literally meaningless in every sense of words. It's just a cheap, bad Evil Dead finish rip off. The whole "story" does not seem to be anything more than some people inviting some people to her abandoned house and trim the monster into pieces. I have a bet that the writer writes the story when it is being pictured. I have seen bad horror movies before (Manaus, Troll 2, hob blogging !!!) (shudder) I would like to say that Damon air can clearly oppose this and with a film on the basis of uninterrupted silence. Check it out if you enjoy making fun of stupid movies. <br /> <br /> Have fun: This picture is like a joke in steroids! Uzhi is like a board, when we try to get rid of it, it always reappears mysteriously. What kind of scary haha?
