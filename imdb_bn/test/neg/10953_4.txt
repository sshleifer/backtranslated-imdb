Below the movie gallery, I just had to see a glimpse. It looked like a fun low budget horror / action / west that I could get. Yes, I knew it would suck, but I hired it whatever it hopes for laughs. Only a few smiles are available. It was a very stupid movie. This is a monster hunter, starting with our hero, perhaps the weakest main character in film history. He works / looks like he could take Chuck Norris, but he can not. Her dialogue sucks too much. However, he goes to a village, shoot some zombies. You can try to do more to keep it in this annoying scene where they take 3-5 minutes to reload or to see some zombies. At least zombies look cool. However, however, some people shoot, some bodies die, and finally, everyone dies except our main character, who died in the beginning when four people shot him dead.
