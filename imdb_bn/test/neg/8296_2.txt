Uggh! Hana repeatedly in the 60s and 70s! What's that lousy and unwanted cartoon that is pressed on us by this hack! The "Hannah-Barber" meaning in the 1940s and 1950s is really embarrassing - because they created so much Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, in the late 1950s, with the main cost-cutting efforts, cartoons generally look very bad and budgets are reduced. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by the MGM and replaced by a group of check animators who even the cartoons have never even seen! So, at the end of the 50's, the team had turned away from work and "If you can not wear it, then join the MMM" - and with horror animations, backgrounds and writings - started to create terrible little cartoons. <Br. <br /> This is unfortunate, but the production of Craft Cartoons of the group has worked very well - the cartoons of the 60's and 70's made their rich and most successful producers. During this time, the production costs were their norms, and a long list of many forgotten cartoons were made. In this case, the amazing bad inches high personal eye - a completely irrational and stupid idea. If you want to know what the program was, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> We found humiliating evidence and strong evidence at the court!
