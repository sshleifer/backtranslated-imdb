Wow ... Such movie that makes you wonder what that concept was and now they are eating soup kitchen. <br /> <br /> When I saw the name of Gutenberg in the TV Guide, it seemed that it was bad, I was bad ... probably it should have been. Can be made for a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the middle flight, with the open door of the aircraft, where they look for the scene and there is no wind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never seen without a Sunday
