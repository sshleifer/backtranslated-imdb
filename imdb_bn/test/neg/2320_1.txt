For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think because my big uncle, Body Bar was the demon of this movie and my father-in-law thinks I want to see it. I was a child as years ago, and then, do not like it. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, saw it and was hooked. The moment of every wake up in front of the TV, this horrible video has played. I went to work with an inexhaustible song stuck on my head. The two "Leeds" were worse than a junior high-level review. The dancers were rejected by Ed Wood Hickick and Abbott and Castello felt their parts on the phone. Thanks, I was able to mislead my son enough to lose this videotape. Really, I think it was tapped from "The Ring". <br /> <br /> To correct another critic, UnterLife Jethro (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) UNCLE is not his father. 10 out 0.
