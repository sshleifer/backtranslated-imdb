I simply comment on really very good films and trash completely. My goal is to spend a lot of time looking for a great movie - and money - with wisdom. For their help <br /> <br /> I want to waste their time in the trash and want to reveal the truth that this garbage film director / producer can not take it for a very long time. We will know who you are and voted on feet with feet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture clearly falls into the garbage category. <br /> <br /> Director and writer John Shibir. It is always a bad sign when the author is also director. Maybe he wants to check two payouts. She will not get any So remember the name - John Shiban. And if you see something else with it, forget it. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot - others have already. When I'm crying, I'm a little worried about how much zoom the director wants from the mouth of the poor girl. These long duration shots can be a little worrisome and say something about Mr Shivan's state of mind. Maybe he'll get mental help. <br /> <br /> Enough already. It's crap - do not waste your time on it.
