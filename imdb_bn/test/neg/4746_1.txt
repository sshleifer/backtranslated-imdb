If I read the reviews of Alex Sander (Seq) instead of seeing a 6 rating from a favorite choice of people in unknown philosophy, I would not see this insult. Alien was a superb, dramatic and well-made horror / Sci-fi. The hunter was a great sci-fi / action mess. I really blamed myself even though I saw 'Alien vs. Predator'. This image has the average grading of more than 6 stars from the conifuers, which makes this site more frequent. <br /> <br /> If you have been given a plastic plot in this competition for you, just read it now. <BR> <br /> This picture was ridiculous from the beginning. No explanation was given for the Predator ship and the overrun by the Aliens. Okay, maybe they went to throw the alien on the earth and there was something wrong in looking for them, but how did it become alien / predetermine hybrid, and why did the others not understand quickly despite their wonderful technology? The beginning was actually the most cohesive and interesting part of the film because we were who we were and what was and why, perhaps, why. Since then it gets really ridiculous I always leave my disbelief before leaving the screen and keep it tightly suspended on the screen door before collecting it. I could not stay here <br /> <br /> <br /> Father and son are hunting in the forest. The damaged ship crash will land at least ten odd miles away from the land (from the given scenario). People and boys alone track and find the ship and get to hug mouth. Even at this moment you feel very little for them, mainly due to their movement and activities, rather than the sunny, sunny and dad seems like an unlawful, stupid redneck muppet. <br /> <br /> A crazy, thriller-type scenario is a bit embarrassing to the former Con, who is returning to the crash site, and now the friend will see the man from the bus on the forehead. When I said, I said, there is no sense of weak effort with crap actors and no feelings. A slasher / horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and normal supposedly nerdy or somehow unwanted trick guy who gets beaten on by protective, crazy, nasty jock types (American athlete is not a Scottish man). Hey cute / intelligent boy is not on the way to the former cons of brother. Yes, they are clever to these directors, whose name I will search again so that they can avoid any skirt again. Then a modern role is inverted, so the PC's annoying effort, the role of the replay credential type character comes with a female soldier coming home with her husband and child. <br /> <br /> guess what happens next? I will not tell you a lot about real things (most recently, the smiling smile about the story's story in most recent movies) Plot if you get this far and not the brightest star of the aliens-rayed universe <br /> <br /> Previous poster The hunter is stupid due to the reasons described by me, whose post I was too late. Aliens are annoying. Hunter-Eli√≥n funny At the time of action is exploitation, undesirable, hateful nonsense. Hospital with pregnant mother?!? Oh I was just shocked. How many people will be surprised? A fear? Some shocks? Retro headline? What? If you are not really pregnant or do not expect parents and do not have their soul, instead of panic, do they want to be disappointed, headlined and afraid of touching Allyn / Pradyator Sasi women and teen girls? There is no depth in the characters and do not intrigue. It is shooting and paced badly. I can blame them that it is not working by frustrated humans. It tarnishes more interesting and well set of science-fi characters. This image is trash and if you enjoy it from it then I really have to think about you. If you have not seen it, then make good decisions. <br /> <br /> I have mentioned in such a way that trained soldiers die within about 20 seconds and americans live their life all the time?
