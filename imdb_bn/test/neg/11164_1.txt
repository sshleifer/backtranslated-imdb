I do not know what was bad, audiences made dots, or those of the movie who looked like dopes. Do I believe that this woman has raised this child for seven years, and the child never noticed a little in the dark? Can I never believe her mother, her father and her husband, this child looks a little darker? When I believe that parents have instructed parents to look at their parents' records, then Lisa Hartman's face looked at her face when she said her mother, Christopher's half black! What! That's real, for Gee you think so. Not only that, grandmother and grandfather did not just mention Dopi and Fool, but I guess we were surprised that ... Humham OMG is half black! Completely stupid movie, even an embarrassed to see it!
