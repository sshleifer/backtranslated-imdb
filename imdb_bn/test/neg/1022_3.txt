Formula Films of an affluent Chilean girl, who becomes a fate heir and mixes with bad boys and are in love with the beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It really looks very like an exciting TV movie. The only reason I was bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was at it. There is no real surprise here, though Vargas is beautiful to look at. The spectacular spectacular spectacle of the display is great, but Malcolm McDowell's section is very small and does not add more to the movie. Michael Ironside plays normal as a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. Chase Scenes are the standard fares.
