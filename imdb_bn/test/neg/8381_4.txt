One man, known as Quinlin (Robert Barson), known as Quinnling Mountain Range, Southern China 20 years ago, seems to have the magic power of a man, where Quinnin founded a religion, and when a member of him (Kaji Ghulobob) For his own self-sacrifice, when he devised his evil plan ... five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), at the current college, Cambridge (Terrence Manning), Bailey (Glen Dean), Alex (Joel) Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) have been known as 'Quinling Genocide' for a school project that has been studied in the event of twenty years ago. Unfortunately, Morgan has decided to kill himself, which weakens the weakness of Owen Quinnilne because he had done so many years ago to complete what he had started claiming to be the soul, so that he finally achieved the poorer power for his evil You can Use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Koni, this is not a good movie and it's kinda like it. The Benjamin Oren script seems to be very important to yourself, it's a very famous story about a genuine leader who comes back a few years back from the dead to finish the story, as you would expect that the character of the character is what happened now All years ago and it's as shameless as the word. The character is silent and forgotten, the conversation is as much as possible, there is no proper harassment or exploitation, it is running slowly, it is expected, that it eventually closes the railways completely and does not do much. In the sense when you think about it. This story does not make you grip or busy, it's not exciting or especially interesting and I even want to struggle to make it. Here's a little bit, through which I can recommend kulatake, do not get bored with this. <br /> <br /> Directed by director director Cannes, the film has seen the appearance of the TV made for this blood-on-video. This, it's completely forgotten and covers flat stuff. There is no fear, there is no atmosphere and there is no excitement in it. There is no greed, there is definitely a fair amount of blood splatter, but no true actual special effects effect is a grave scene. <br /> <br /> Not to be cheaper with an estimated budget of US $ 950,000. I've recently seen some low budget horror films. Acting is not even significant. <br /> <br /> Cult is a poor film that did something for me, I want to struggle to call this mean. There are many awesome films out there.
