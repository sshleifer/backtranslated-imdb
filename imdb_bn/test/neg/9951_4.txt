1943 George Zuko film "The Mad Ghol", a film not to be confused with the film "The Monster", which appeared in the previous year. In this fairly color-wise number, Junko's wolf influences a way of turning his intellectual elephants, petro into wolf / human hybrids through wound injections and waste a little while to kill transformed Dophas. Ex-colleague who was scoffed in his exams. This is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low budget production. Here the golf strangers, who played man / wolf, soon became more popular by playing the Frankie giant in films such as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Castello Mitt Frankenstein" (1948). The makeup work on her here is quite tall, and only to succeed him see bad teeth (like a 1957 "teenage monster") like a hippie. In addition to the sets of this film, it is fairly unreasonable, and the allegations are sudden and vague I've given the film a lot of liberal 4 stars, because it's the love for the horror movies of 1940, but to tell the truth, most spectacular visitors probably think this as a ridiculous frog and I think it's about it. It's definitely a precise universal thing or a good LeTan masterpiece, which is sure! Yet, Zucco always see such funny piffle even fun to watch. If you can give 72 minutes of your life, then I think you can do worse than "mad mind" (of course not too bad!). Oh ... one other thing. This DVD comes from Alpha Video, and you know what it means: Blurred images, Lauie Sound (in fact, I'm the worst word in any alpha video DVD) and no extra. You have been warned!
