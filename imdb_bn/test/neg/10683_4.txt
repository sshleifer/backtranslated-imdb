I was ready to hate all of this, but it became surprisingly tolerant - even though MTV-style (shooting, booting) most of the eye-fat filmmaking! I like the script's self-ridiculous style, as well as the central concept of doubling the female vampire lead as a contract killer. As Cast, Aileen Daly (who is known as the "star of the" Liberation War "tones") has a screened screen presence - and despite her age, quite sensual, however, Christiehner Adamson's Hammy chief villain is insulting. As a doctor of David Warbeck, there is a brief introduction to W. ("The Har-Movie Man" Doubled!), Who conducts an unholy behavior on one of the victims of the vampire; In 1997, Warbak's death seems to have taken a lot of time to shoot the film! There are plenty of nudity and violence, but there is not much sense (especially since the mistress of the power-intensive infiltrator vampires involved in secret society is rarely developed); The film is also broad for its purpose, and finally slips in the tidium for the last half an hour.
