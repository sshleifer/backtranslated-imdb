Mood and gentle Edward G. Robinson (as Wilbur Winkle) will decide to give up his bank job and want to do it, open a "fix-e" repair shop behind his home. Mr. Robinson married, but childless! He made friends with local orphan Ted Donaldson (as Barry). Young Donaldson is an interested workshop assistant, and Robinson is seen as a father figure. Robinson's disgusting wife Ruth Warwick (Emmy) is dissatisfied with Robinson's choice of job, and is excited to return things to her ideas of naturalness. When Robinson was drafted, his life was further interrupted. <br /> <br /> Robinson's character can be an interesting story like a struggle against a supernatural, disrespectful wife. Perhaps, filmmakers have shown how the fight can save marriage and positively redirect life. Robinson and Donaldson are a favorite team. Robert Mitchell has an evil bit part. The last "tactics" that were ended by Miss Warwick and Donaldson were predicted in a predictable way.
