This movie is so bad, they will not buy it in my local CD / DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought the best composition for "depafalf". The store buys two other films sold from four disc sets, but they do not buy the underworld and redefine the other two films, so what can be said about this movie? So I tried to sell it again in another store, even bought a budget DVD for a dollar in a local store, but they would not buy the windshield again. This film is bad at every level, and in the mid-90s, Tarantino-Clone Glut came in. Danny Larry is just a little redefined material that tells Joe Montagna, he is a "staine friend" and called him "Mr. Stinky's Friend". That line is very joyful, I can not help but quote it at least once a strange friend by describing it. But now with the quote that I enlighten you, you do not have to overcome the pain of seeing this movie.
