It's so bad that I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good start. This is a supreme Mary su character, which is something common with the original one from the book, which was somewhat believable. No, this is beyond the incredible, incredible, irrational, and hugely perfect values ​​that the "dog with the sword" era that our intermediaries are late. He seems to have a naturally enough authority to trump someone as a prominent top model, still thin as a rich match, already a leader in his academic field, a Kung Fu master, a natural sniper and slim FBI agent. He is God <br /> <br /> To make it unbalanced, it is considered to be socially painful (usually by transforming it into "talk" as a result of hard work) which gives us some delightful moments, where he surprises "Star Wars" or " American Idol ", but it is really important when he can easily express himself as a top speaker and a diplomat because he is so extreme, because he knows. Leading it, he is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> More intelligent Boreanaz acts as a fire-valoir token for this construction, acting as a abstract comic-relief and house "Watson". In fact, everything there is a pop-parody of good works in Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-files, from which it tries to imitate sexual tension among the main characters. However, it is cheaper because it is supplied with all the symptoms of rib velvet, but millions of poor factory factories will buy it suspect, so it gets a crazy rating from Turkey. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common indicator is a long way in this sad puppy, which analyzes sexual details from the sideclicks leg, which makes it bold and trendy, when the overall sound of the show is a clear new-conservative Carries <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the story, here There is no such thing as an offense (which always starts with some terrifying residues) When the "skints" are so solved, so many mistakes (less women than boys) move on to many theories, all their main characters start from the beginning, and once it is established it goes out and then pushes the man. , Usually with a spin kick and a slapper on a real solid atom.
