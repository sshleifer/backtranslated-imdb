"I think you are here to damage your mental circuitry." - Val <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson has shown me this ... He mentions "Movie Megachies" in his book. I asked myself, why would Mike Nelson mislead me? I know now why the bots did not believe Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is John Williams, which is probably part of his wealth to the Devil. Actually, I'm sure that anyone working on this film is probably in the league with all the 'sluuput', or is now cursing the trucker from the executive director outside the studio. Do not look ... for God's love ... do not look !!! Even creating a copy and showing it to someone else will not make you uncomfortable ... I am now ruined, I understand it. I took this. But save yourself ...
