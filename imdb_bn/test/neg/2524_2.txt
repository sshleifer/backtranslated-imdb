I was reading the online review of this vague outing praising as lazy horror pose, quirky black comedy and art-house border artillery; The film has elements of three elements, to be sure, but they are in a very cruel proof service (title immediately gives the game) ?? And to make amateur production boot ?? Due to lack of proper distribution due to its long-term negligence? Basically Cult Epics to pick it up for DVD until completely released after 30 years! ?? There was no great harm to the movie or even section (s). The bed was apparently built to accommodate a giant's anus with a woman; However, a dead man who uses four posters and even draws it leaked onto the wall behind the canvas (!) And gives a rare comment from 'action'. A few people (in the gangster-hiding age at the age of teens) provide pasture on hungry beds; Is there a threesome of the latest girls in the menu ?? One of them, however, remembers her mistress long ago and as a result, the bed is afraid of her! Seeing different objects ?? From fried chicken pieces to cigarettes ?? And the people are melting (the bed is painted as a vat of honey-colored fluid) the film makes occasionally gently (especially when the hands of a young man reduces the formation of their skeleton, which seems more than it seems to be easier in its motion. !), But repeatedly repeat ?? So, even a short 77 minutes, the whole timeless exercise seems strained and desperately frustrating.
