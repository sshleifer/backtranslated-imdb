The Wings House and Son, Cole Hauser team has targeted a gay man and created a team to create a movie about Neo-Nazi Thogs and to make a city terrorist. The hero of the wings is the drama, and his real life is the son Wilson. Fairly low budget movies that do not have many feeding features and no one has seen it for some reason! Perhaps it's a ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and because of studying this in the studio! Perhaps the Wings Hauser prevented the distribution of 'Skins' himself! Maybe people do not want to comment on such a bad picture! Okay good I usually like wings and coals as actors, but it was a movie which they both should have skipped. Wings operated, wrote and skins top actors! A very bad and stupid film! ***** of 1/2!
