The biggest forgotten monster film of the 50's is really awful special effects - the question "fake" is a giant doll that wants to kill Jim Henson. I saw this movie on Thursday and I can not even tell you that it was. That's a bad sign. I said that when the movie's premiere audience smiled the screen ... and in the 50's, when the special effects values ​​were very low then Originally the words produced by Sam Katzman should have walked from the theater as "I knew what was produced", but then I was sitting through "Haram Scarum" so I guess I deserve.
