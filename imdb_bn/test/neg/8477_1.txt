The son of the mask is a terrible movie. I do not like children and do not like dogs. Jamie Kennedy and her wife are not able to retrieve a tricky couple but sitting through this garbage. Even in 88 minutes (or so), the film could not end soon enough for me. The only real smile comes from a short form of Ben Stein in the beginning. That's it. The rest is only the first movie repeat. Indeed that just rehashes is a shame. Why create this sign ?? This movie can cost millions of dollars. Why do I sit in a movie with a child and a dog, will I try to run mad madly? Jamie Kennedy is talented but she has nothing to do in this movie. I'm not bothered to be beautiful in this movie. 1/10
