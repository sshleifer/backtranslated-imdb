Frank Felinskic: I'm not sorry that I killed them; I'm sorry that I killed them seriously. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great plot with a great throw and endless possibilties ... how are you that f_ck ?! Well, apparently John Dahl found a way out. In addition to reducing the fun features of malaria due to epidemic and dialogue, it does not like any of its characters, 'You Can Kill Me' may be the biggest movie failure of 2007. On the positive note, another great alcohol in Ben-Kingles is trying to get the performance clean as the hit hit man but the material he has worked with is shit. Tea Leny is good, such as Luke Lynn Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philipp Baker Hall and the rest cast. I think the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good performance. Grade: D +
