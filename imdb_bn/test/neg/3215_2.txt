El Pedro: Latin Godfather - Although it looks straightforward for DVD / video type movies - my entire frame copy was definitely being cropped - so maybe this flick was running a limited theater. And the title character is displayed more than the Gingergo than Mary. (I'm half Honduran). The list of B-list actors is Sunday Wagner, Kathleen Quinnlan (Crusading Judge), Tony Lester, Gary Bus (Child Rape), Brad Derrief (White Power Jailbird), Stacy Kitch (Condemned Governor) Joan Pakalala (the convicted Milf), Pha Dunnay (Crusading lawyer) and Golo Make Canot as an unwanted party guest. This movie is quite lengthy - I just saw it already spent time playing Skins - the only thing that was to save Jennifer Tilly as an insane Latina drug assassin killer - she was at the top and sexy-graduate that was fun to see her scenes. No rental or searchable. D + K
