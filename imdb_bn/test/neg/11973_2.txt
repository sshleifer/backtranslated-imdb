How nice! Here's another simple-to-video squarecraw movie to keep cinematic mascot happy. The cheaper opening credits do not tell you that you are on the road, then scary "writing" will be sure to be scary. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is part of his initiation onto a legendary Scarko baseball team. Then scarecrow goes to the nut and people start off. I want to say more? This movie has a powerful effect that was edited with Iovovi (remember that the color of the wonderful color) and the actors apparently were not good enough for the cinematic scene in the late night. Actually, it is not fair enough because actors do not have enough room to work around the mandatory script. Parts of this movie really seem like parody, especially when a character takes off his guitar and sometimes starts playing the worst song made by humans, the worst lip combination to go with him. Here "gore" is also a big disappointment. For most B-movies, there is a thick layer of cheap FC Ghoro to create stories and lack of acting. Here, stuff is so cheap that it is not fun. This movie actually makes a lot of fun by comparing "Jack Frost 2". <br /> <br /> If you think that this movie is "the worst you've ever seen", but you're probably too vicious of deep video to video. However, this movie does not matter to you in your background, mental torture will be a great deal.
