"Hardbodies 2" is less harmful, purposeless, and intriguing. I will add "intimidation" to that list, but the movie-in-off-movie gimic, even though it did not work well, it helps to avoid labeling very rarely. The scene has changed from the beaches of the Greek Islands to California and the only returned cast member of the first film is the memory of the memory of the memory of Soulas Picard and Roberto Collins (who at one time was in the mud hay), "Big Doll House" with classic catfight in Palm Grayer). All other actors are new, but obviously Brad Jootaut seems to be playing the same character (scoti), Grant Kramer has done in "Hardbudy". The sequel lacks the strength and appeal of the first film and does not come close to meeting in the "warmth" section. Of course, both Brenda Bacak and Fabiana Udinei are very beautiful, but Til Roberts - Syndi Silver - Cristy Somers' team is impossible. "Hardbodies 2" is not the worst in any way, but if you just want to see one of these movies, the real one is one. (* 1/2)
