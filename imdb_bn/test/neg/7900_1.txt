This movie was just awesome. How can someone like this movie, and for those who like it because of humor, they can really take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself that stereotype is not bad. The ethnic stereotypes overlooked the face, this was just awful. This was not his moment, if it paid homage in the 1980s, "Aircraft!", It would have to give more. For terrible acting, writing scary scripts, even for a film of Munic or Tom Arnard. This movie was bad since the beginning, but people might have seen the whole thing that the plane crashed. One of the worst movies ever, stay away
