... BREAKOR MORANT AND RUMP PUMP. It gave us a spectacular film such as Bootemeni and The Audi Degree Shot. Unfortunately, Wang BOY will not join in any list as soon as it comes to anybody involved with this obstruction. <br /> <br /> I want to see this film because of politically incorrect title, so politically wrong that when the night was broadcast on BBC2, the announcer did not even mention the name of the movie, so I was hoping for a slight offense that my jaw fell into disbelief. Going on It was in disbelief, I could not believe myself that the financiers thought it was going to be a major international hit <br /> <br /> The problem is with cast and script. I know that there is not a big pool with Australian small communities, so I would mostly apologize, but it does not stop the criticism of Nick Jianpolos like Steve. To do this kind of comedy, you must be impressed with the main actor's jokes and I want to say sorry but Nick Gotta has no skill. I have never heard of him and he has not seen anything else, perhaps he is better at other performances. Here, however, he just lost the normal, irritvincing and counting times I mugged for the camera. Jokes are very flat and predictive and seem like going back to the script, I mean, what is the opinion of a woman who thinks of brain work, who is behind it, limousine? You feel the feeling that someone of the producer was more honest and said, "Look at the partner, this playlist is not good enough and go and make more subtle and structured." <br /> <br /> I worked hard and hardness for this review. It has been said. I gave four films out of ten and it only got three, if it was not for a real funny sequence where Steve simply flashed the screen for himself and watching an existing issue show labeled "Dolphin Blazer". It shows that the screenlines were informed about comic time and social comment. It is so sad that they did not come very well written movie
