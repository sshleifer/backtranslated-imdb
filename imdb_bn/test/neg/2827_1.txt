Yes, I do not know how everybody else was a teenager, but I did not know those people I knew and left alone. And if you are frustrated ... .. Well, we were not old / clear cut / pat tiger teenager. (If ever there was such a thing !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not saying to be a teen. Well, well, this time the biggest movie "Fast Times at Redmondmont High" Now the kids I knew and they were realistic to return to reality. (<br /> <br /> It was a low rental version of the Fast Times and even did not do much for me. It was a few moments, but it was enough to recommend me No, even claiming "what was it like in teen age in 1982." I can not be related. The main girl (girls) did nothing for me and if they really want to keep their virginity, please, in their case, in this case Citrati would not have been made. Early in the 80's in the teens / young adults as a time-capsule movies pure strap and a bad back will be paramount.
