It will be difficult to fill 10 lines ... but try it ill (try to avoid the same mistakes as others - see this (terrible and annoying) movie. <br /> <br /> I'm Patrick Sewage Like - He has performed exceptionally well in movies such as the Hast - Dirty Dance - Point Break - North and South (TV series), but in this movie .... ARGH .... This movie is so wildly afraid, the fear of acting Love - the script sucks - well ... I could not even find a good thing, nothing, nothing, even nothing. I was watching it with another 2 friends and we all agreed that it was one of the most annoying movies it had, and it was also 3 more For hours (which we do not know) for a long time - when the part 1 ended and it said "continued", we almost cried "nooooooooooooooo, we have seen more than 90 minutes The picture of this movie !!!! !!!! ". <br /> <br /> This movie is difficult to see: At any time you do not get an idea with the actors Russians, the action scenes are extremely bad, only good scenes are when the e-truck Explosion! The rest tremble! Instead of watching this movie, clean up your toilet (and not running, if you cry to see this movie - you are warned before!) Personally I would suggest Patrick Soze to call his agent and suggest to take out his movie - that's him Bad
