I just saw the Congo in the DVD. In most cases I like this kind of movie but it is a different one. It wrote me my first comment for a movie on IMDB. I am surprised how a team of experienced filmmakers can come up with this movie. You see lots of money for this product but you can not make a good movie if you do not have good scripts. And one producer Frank Marshall gave us plenty of movies to watch; He was not supposed to try to be another spielberg. It shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, you probably have all the ingredients but can not cook while in the kitchen. Do not make a suggestion if this one does not spend your money. If you want to see it, then first watch it on TV and create your own mind.
