In fact, part of it I liked a lot. It was some interesting twists. But it just left me there, it seems that the sub-films are all about feeling afterwards. The supposed end was different from a normal jaw, but let's face it ... a group of unknown people (or they believe) gathered in an abandoned chemical factory .... <br /> <br /> But then it lost something. There is no intensity, poor groups are dynamic, there is no sense of instantity. <br /> <br /> After some nice twists, and nothing else on your plate, definitely a clock value, but it left me empty. .. pass the time, but it is not satisfied.
