If someone thinks this is a great sports movie, it's probably the only movie movie. There are several aspects that can take a sports movie. Whether it is professional or college or high school. I liked the examples of sports movies (and I did not see much) Jim Thorp: All Americans, All Right Movie, A given Sunday, Eight Men and Rockies, among others. These movies were a little more than just ordinary games. Whether it is a man passionate and then dedicated to greatness, or a dream by a man influenced by a vindictive coach action, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It does not even seem that the movie was starting or ending. There was no character development, all of them were forced to force us. I can summarize this movie by quoting a very bad coach: "Go out and try to score more points than other people."
