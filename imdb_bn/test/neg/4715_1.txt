This movie was a big disappointment. This plot is great, half-human, semi-leopard in Africa, which has become a documentary by young American adults, is also great. When many members of the crew died, two were questioned on the survival question. I will not call this horror movie too, because most movies are actually mentioned above, among the hungry 20-somthingings (inaccurate) events, which include smoked dung for sex and smoking (it sounds not entertaining - believe me). You rarely see creatures and the main actor (who can be the director, screen writer, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I finally never interrupted so much that I was ahead of the precursor that dialogue dialogue I guess to finish less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was fine. So, this horror movie is completely predictable, too - like it was not bad enough. Morality of the story: Avoiding movies, acting, directed, edited, produced and similar movies. And to avoid this movie, until held on gunpoint.
