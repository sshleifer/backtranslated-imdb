I would say that I had low expectations for the movie before watching it. People around said that it was great, but I knew exactly what they liked. They like the songs of Aerosmith, which is really great, they like amazing special effects, which were many coastlines, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course there are many girls who like the likes of the Apache, who, according to my opinion, really bad actors, who do not try to be one, Failed and now he has nothing to do. And these things plus reviews and ratings I read on the internet, give me an impression that the film will be frustrating because I'm a big fan of the movie fan. Well, I'm fine, but at least I was ready. <br /> <br /> This movie is really commercial. It has been said, but I would say again. We have # 100 million budgets, our Hollywood star Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors have romance, who are popularly known as having very little to agree on becoming Cast Cast of a Commercial Movie. The screen is not written with large letters. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Bussy, which is a highly respected actor I like so much. They can play many characters in many different types of movies. They could improve, they could turn tasteless lines into idle jokes. Overall, they can turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and always love. Fargo or a simple plan such as Buscemi's case - Thornton And to be honest, I'm really frustrated they took part in Armenund. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I think correctly. Bushmim is a member of the deep core drilling party, which has been sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid to make the world invisible. <br /> <br /> I do not like that - well, I guess I already understood. I figured out the bad reason The story is dull, timeless and stupid. It is so clear that the movie depends on the dominant and dramatic endings, it is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that can be considered as art. At least it is not clear that the film is intended for financial purpose. Other than that, the bigger the performance than the big stars. The joke is not funny, the lines are weird and sometimes, they do not understand in any sense. Actually, I've read in this stage recently that Ben Affleck has asked him that if he teaches the astronaut to drill, the drillers will be easier than being asteroids and the answer of the Bay is "just stop!" Which is a really funny story that perfectly reflects the frustrations of the creators. <br /> <br /> and stop, I'll give an explanation why I can give this movie 4. Well, I like "I do not want to miss something" and I was the only good thing in the movie that was influenced by special effects. The first scene is memorable. About this movie, I like only two good things. Michael Bay was an average director, but The Rock and both of the bad guys were better than Harmmododon, which was always a big bad movie.
