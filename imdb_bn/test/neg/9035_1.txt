This movie was just finished while playing on TV and I have nothing to do. The IMDB went to the right side of the triangle page and the user looked at the comments. And what can I find? Every fool fools in the sky! I could not even write anything, but when someone took the time to spread the talk about this suck-ass movie then I thought I could. <br /> <br />. The worst one is playing Brian Wilson (think I've got the right name), because he was ambitious, especially when he was high. The rest was not as bad as her, but nobody was good. I'm not an expert on the beach, although I can not complain so much about the story ... except this apart. There is no motivation for sending a letter at any time, but they were probably stupid in real life. And the worst I got was that I thought it was going to be a movie about beach boys, but you really got a firm about a few characters. I hate the same thing that they do in movies, even though I love that movie more. There is no other power left for writing ... it sucked! Do not buy or see it!
