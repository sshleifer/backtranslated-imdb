Wolf's desecration begins as reluctant, Veruolph Dakota (Rene Purdada) escapes from his 'pack' and he is working on a vet six months in the city. The rest of the Dakota pack is unhappy and wants to get back to it, their leader Michael (Todd Husses) says that he will return to them, but Fat Wehrolf Franklin (Brian Hepheron) likes his perfume and the pack strengthens this problem and brings him back. His love for his human friends, including his boyfriend Danny (Dennis Curver), uses his love. Can Deco save Danny and finally get rid of his Waverolph followers? I suspect you will take care ... <br /> <br /> Lenny Kabiniski's production was produced, written and directed, which had a major role in the film like Stick 1, Kabbinsky was afraid to see the curse of that wolf. Behind Swap Lomis (2005), one of the worst movies ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and someone will say that Wolf curse is a real horror movie both conceptually and technically. Wolf curse is such a movie that indicates what will happen in a low budget and the script refers to the budget instead of the script. You've got the idea that everything was written and was supposed to take advantage of some sets and actors, you can often imagine the makers that some of our actors, some basic tools and a few places have got so much fun to create. Film around them. The story is horrific (Michael Mc finds Dakota's location where two women are walking to a big dog watching), the character is awful (a big fat beaver man who is far away), the conversation is awful. The line in the thing) and what has happened is not any inspiration (why the pack is so frustrating to get Dakota back?), People do only random things, and the director is in the background of the cabinsynsky's background martial arts, but he fought the series of martial arts in a lot of random plot. There is no crime, but it can be a horror film that is not martial arts, is not it? In fact, along with the presence of a few verruves you will work hard to describe the curse of Wolf. It seems like it's almost two hours long that it goes forever and it's not too slow and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Director Kassinsky was certainly working in a low budget but this should be the worst thing to do for filmmaking. There is no continuity in the shots, the scenes of war seem terrible and it is driven as untrue and it is running unbearable and it is running incomplete and poor camera corners or sometimes so dark that it can not really see a thing impossible. There is a lot of time in Wolf Curse, where the screen is completely black and you do not see any thing, through it I'd hate to see it in VHS, a Fiji low resolution. The sound is very awful, you can hear the air and air against the microphone! There are plenty of other unpleasant and unwanted surroundings during almost every view. Does this actually produce any light gear while making this? It does not seem like it. Special effects are mostly associated with the Weoorolf Mask, which sells things like Halloween for kids in stores, which is basically terrible. <br /> <br /> Volume Technical Curse They are so bad, sorry, because I know it was a low budget but it was really terrible to sit through and tried to collect some entertainment. It's high quality student quality film, I'm sorry if it seems innocent but it's a fact. Acting is good, perhaps you can guess so I'll stop myself before telling myself something negative, that means I've already done enough and I really do not take any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> Wolf curse is a terrific trick to sit through both horribly, conceptually and technically. Wolf curse is the type of film that seems to be standing while watching your time, it's a kind of movie that runs for nearly two hours, but it seems like two years. You or one of the worst movies I have ever seen, definitely avoid one.
