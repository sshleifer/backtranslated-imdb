If you are an average person like me and enjoy for good acting, good plot, good script, novel ideas or entertainment, you can avoid it. I was annoyed with opening credits for the first time, but I tried to give it a chance, and I saw all the way through it - I was just frustrated every time. <br /> <br /> The acting was incredible by sub-par, but I'm not sure whether the actor is blaming himself or it was ridiculous wood and horror conversations with even worse scripts. This plot is very vague and proponent and I think it should earn some deeper meaning from the audience, or be able to see it in any other way, but it will be time consuming for honesty. <Br /> <br /> The film has such pornographic sex that does nothing other than displaying tattoos and lingerie. Nobody has ever really explained which does not seem to have any motivation except to make money from the "investment" deal. Links between letters are not very clear, and it is not too low for any character development. <br /> <br /> This is a subtitle movie that you enjoy for a very specific audience or a whole condom to enjoy, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I've given it a 2 because it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's probably not the worst.
