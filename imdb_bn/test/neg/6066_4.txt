Amadeus am the only person who saw and felt. "Copied" Each scene is with Mills Forman, our opponent - The golfing carrier with Fenzied String, with the entrance of the dark entrance, through the entry of the dark halls, in the very dialogue of conclusion, before La Marate's death, a La Sallei on Beethoven's legs Does anyone remember the conversation in that script: <br /> <br /> Salary "Time?" Mozart "General Time" ..... "We start with the string ..." and so this is "copy". Remember that Cynthia Nixon is standing in front of a door jam, the tears fall below her radioactive face - the same scene, just replace her with the nephew of Beethoven. Even fart jokes are the same. We've even followed a cardinal by a sweet cookie plate that thinks celevery in the banquet hall. No one else remembers? <br /> <br /> <br /> Where Anna laughed to God, "Why did you give me this gift?" Salli said the same thing! <br /> <br /> We have a children's script that can be read as the identification of character in your child's story with the opening of an opening. "I am Mr. Beethoven, I am the author. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Compared to technically restraint ... which is not comparatively developed - it probably does not mean any, especially when it comes to Bethov, who was technical expert. <br /> <br /> Just one great scene - playing the ninth 1. First, music, Which itself takes tears. But then Anna's very loyal interaction is the copies First time and Bitovean management that exceeds the most explicit sexual intercourse. It is so embarrassing, it's almost embarrassing <br /> <br /> But, please - the rest of the film - Where is the collective memory of the world? Good!
