Salin's event director Dustin Reicher's best movie --- which is not saying much. In his past films (and I use the term "Films"), the director took ideas from blockbusters and severely restricted them. The incidence of saline is not different. The film originally converts the airway to the average of your average film power generation. This film is associated with focus shots and is influenced by special effects that cause problems in competing with high school school animation classes. For example, almost every screen explosion has the effect of fire on the same screen. <br /> <br /> The poor impact and production quality are compromised by only faulty plots and rocky conversations. In one sentence, the story strings together as exaggeration of exaggerated Hollywood clich√©s. The movie started with the worst CGI Alien Ship, which has created the worst CGI ever created in the world, and a team of the army is going to investigate. Later, a bus of the worst prisoner across the country was overthrown by prisoners, with the help of armed surrogates with silicon implants. The captives escaped and festooned in the city of Salin where they meet with Alien ... shock ... escaped from the disguise fishermen, which is the worst worst of all in the galaxy. The prisoners, and their detained police will only fight off armed forces with guns and sad puns and escaped from the city before the international aerospace alliance * In the eyes roll * city bomb bombs <br /> <br /> The only real movie The enjoyable parts are when the actors (those who are clearly reduced by the script) are given the freedom to improve them and when they are fighting with the gun fire, Fighting with the small war of For the other reason, the film is not really worth any time, which puts the DVD out of the plastic. How terrible was it? Let's just say that the Secretary of Defense, about 90 years old, works in a room which is located in the real estate office of 1950 and wearing a lonely tune tie. Yes, if it is not clear enough earlier, then the person around the Pentagon is wearing a tiass with a Bungee and a radar runner on it. The movie basically ends (Ahahahah: I say to the end ...) The last remaining soldiers are walking with the prisoners and guards, and the newly formed party is moving away from harmful aliens - which brings them to some strange reason directly to the Alien Ship Back? Yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart but terribly bad camera works too much. Someone deeply slapping the DP and tell him to have more repetitive, postponement, cinematography than chest level shot. This movie is not really worth renting (if it ever gets away from it), but it's not terribly bad like the latest movies created by the director, which reduces the humorism, but it is nowhere near the clock-like movie.
