I do not know where to start ... Dragon Hunt can only be the worst movie in the history of the movie. Even Anas Magilick was even better, because it was deliberately bad. Showgirls? No, it was pricey and technically there was a well-made film. But Dragon Hunt accepts the cake and eats it, then it vomits back up and returns it to the homeless people. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said it is not an invention, so it must be scripts, but it's poor quality Almost sent through malicious tone. A number of lines have been distributed which the actors (or those screen-screen figures) apologize for joining the film or are thinking of Saturday Night Live, especially the ridiculous joke, which they saw before going forward. Camera. I can write more than three paragraphs on the quality of this film, but you and I do not want to hear it both. <br /> <br /> Make-up and special effects (which, with the majority of movies, the only good thing) were ridiculously bad. The rival, whose name is so ridiculous, I can not remember, a monk has glued over his head. Yes, her head glued. And you can call it a very glooded, if you see the spot where it meets its insect pole, you can see plastic strips, not like fake eyelashes. Fortunately, he is the only example of make-up non-nos in the film. <br /> <br /> It has some terrible character development, to keep it lightly. Women, who are weirdly operated by the weirdly ugly brothers, (and I mean, they really push), not only ugly ... gaspost ... they do not know what they are doing! In one scene, they turn their offending lovers, join the bad guys, and then some coke revolve. Apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine because they all went to their nostrils before they started shaking and laughing. Great time to girls! Plus they wear some really awesome stuff, clothes in the late 80's and early 90's. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film, this film, I want to say waste of this film, this is also the waste of time. Seeing it will hurt you, and not only will the suspension of your faith, but also your entire brain. If you want to throw stones at your friends and want some good smile, then see if you can get the movie (maybe download it), otherwise do not worry about it. I hope I was helpful.
