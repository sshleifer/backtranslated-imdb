Just a few days before the premiere of the movie, its printer returned to the project and claimed to remove his name from the credit, you know that it is not well disturbed. <br /> <br /> The books, which are based on "Wizdom", have the potential for a vivid fantasy film ?? "Guerratt de Rivia is a fool, his only purpose is to destroy the monster that strikes the earth. But is not everything appealing, bad, or everything is not fair?" But it does not matter, when a Polish movie crew, with less budget, and no, or little gratitude for Sapkowski's work, decided to find it out in a 13-part mini series. Most of the two-hour film profit, their action is a derivative product. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to mention in this case, people label this movie as bad. Plots (Inconsistent, thanks to cramming it with many stories), acting (except for Gibroosie's exception), conversations (blood), editing (sticky), special effects (intolerable) and dancing photography (poor), add to the film's overall bad experience. The only soundtrack by Gregor Szcoski highlighted the beauty of "Wizemin", which was never brought to the screen. Even the grandoose flora and fauna of Poland (where "The Chronicles of Nerania: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobes" was shot), almost an important element of fantasy film, was not used for their full potential. The more I think of this dead loss, the more I'm going out of the word. At least, it is a consolation to let go of "Wizemin" director Murray Broadzky, since then only managed a film (moreover, in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, we have left behind most imaginative stories about fayadjamin books and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007). But I'm sure that one day justice will be done for Wisdom Sagati and soon we will be considered equally well adapted to the film.
