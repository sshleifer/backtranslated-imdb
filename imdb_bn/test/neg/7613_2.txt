I love muppet Muppate Movie, The Great Mupp Pet Sipar and The Muppets Tech Manhattan are good family movies, funny to be written and fun to watch. I never thought that that day will slip into the sledged bandwagon of Hollywood, but here it is: The Skitter is a Caged Rave Dancer, Making Pep and Counseling Comments for every five minutes - This is not your father's Muppets. This is not Jim Henson's Muppate. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful life "It is a wonderful life" movie, but it is not enough to save. I cringed while watching this with my children. I still have hope for their next movie, but this one certainly was frustrated.
