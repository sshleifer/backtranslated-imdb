This movie is okay, as far as movie goes. It could be made as a crossover of secular movies. However, it was not supposed to do anything with leftist books which it was supposed to have. Major stories were removed in the premises, and new main stories were added to the premises. <br /> <br /> How Nicola was portrayed disappointed me most. He showed by the supernatural power that his books are not present at this time. Antichrist is not Satan, omnipotent and omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Beliefs and beliefs were portrayed in a strange, most recent way, which meant that the film was simply silly. <br /> <br /> There is more ammunition for those who do not believe in betraying Christian faith.
