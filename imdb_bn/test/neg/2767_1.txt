This movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> Try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this sandfly about this little girl (Joan Woodby), because she is involved with 'Underworld' because she needs money (and why she offered him Lazy to take a job from friends). Allan Ladd is supposed to be the star of this item, but he is not available for the first half year and when he looks, he stands like constipation. A really ugly scene with unseen scenes and unlike (as well as stupid) characters, if you want anyone to shoot, it's really quick. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
