How do I deserve to see this shit? worst. Acting was terrible, when I read that this comedy was laughing at least, once or twice, but ... if you want to loose one and a half hours of your life, it's the right film. I just recommend seeing a wall or something, but watch this "film" in something else. Yoy can also see a documentary about pregnant women (if you are a man), I guarantee it will be more entertaining :) This actor (I forgot his name) is not bad, and I'm surprised how high-accredited role is. Anyway "I want to eat cheese with somebody", if you want to punish someone, then the right film.
