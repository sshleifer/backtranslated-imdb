This movie is not kind as it is poorly operated, played, played, danced, painted, etc. ... but it is really difficult to destroy the movie using an ABBA soundtrack - unfortunately, the film is only successful for this work. The music rendition of SouthPark in Movie Mia was very good. Mama Mia's director proves that you do not need talent to be a director - all you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a sampling of horror: An elderly Meryl Strip has been shot off to stop harsh sunlight and just to destroy the song with all the confusing wrinkles in his mouth. Why is such a gifted actress?
