This movie was a poor movie. The plot was poor and they came out weakly in the "try" comedy. The accident seems to be felt and expected. I think actors have tried a bit but with this movie, it was so long that it could go so far. I have seen the worst movie and do not recommend it to anyone. Mr. The only accident of the accident was the release of it.
