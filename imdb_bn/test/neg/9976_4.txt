Colleague Giallo-fanatics: be careful and / or proceed ?? It does not look right for this movie. It seems like Giulo, its juvenile VHS cover (a busty naked girl and showing a big bloody knife), Latphus title and Cast two senior Italian actors (John Phillip and Fernando Ray), but it is basically just a plot Erotic thriller The version I saw is probably harshly sensor ?? With an ongoing time of 77 minutes ?? But still there is a serious lack of the mystery, character development and most wickedness (and usually Giallo) killings. The "eyes behind the wall" can be collected briefly as a detailed collection of distorted characters and their shortcomings in brief. This is an interesting attempt, although the author / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tries to do something special, but overall results are dissatisfied and sadly tame. Inspired by Hitkoc's "Rear Window", the main character is frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound author. She and her many younger lover get their sex kicks from single male renting spouse living across the road. The tenants, respectively, prefer to perform housekeeping exercises while having both desires both nude and definitely bisexual. The wheelchair sends his wife to her and she has sex. Then, Otvi Butler repeatedly raped girls in school. Is there any common character in the story? Well, of course not! Movies with the Moody soundtrack and Nifty photography are consistently beneficial in a bad environment, but none of it ever goes anywhere, so it is only sex without flow and significance. At the end of the story a genuine malicious package has been made, but it comes very late and very randomly for overall quality improvement. It is not recommended to fans of Italian horror / rituals, but it may be a great visual, fraser-style character for psychology students.
