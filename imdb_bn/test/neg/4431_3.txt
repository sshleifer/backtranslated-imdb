I say bollywood I think the lights seem good musical dance numbers, with gorgeous outfits for men and women. And interesting tune. The horror, thrillers, mystery and suspicions, though do not seem to be. And this, my western eyes, like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think the authors and directors had a specific choice but it was a small film, even small. Both of them have gone for a thrilling mix of thriller-horror, comedy-mystery, supernatural-suspense or music-romance. <br /> <br /> Once said, the director once saw, "I knew what I did last summer" and tried to give it a Bollywood twist. My first picture was Bride and Prizoodis. Which I played well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Western thrillers, but when you try to break their dramatic cry, scream or fear, it feels from place to place . <br /> <br /> The visitors were surprised by the audience looking at the camera. More than just being afraid of the audience, we could only encompass irrationality. <br /> <br /> I see many foreign films, though I do not know Hindi, I say they did a bad job by subtitling the movie. Sometimes the white letters against bright background were difficult to read. <br /> <br /> Villain was especially entertained, at least to me, because he came with his own moody music. Amazing wonderful bend, actually felt like a police out. <br /> <br /> The main couple was handsome / handsome enough, and the number of musical instruments is the price of my rental fee. I recommend it to someone as a musical-comedy, but I was not worth the effort of reading it because I would say that the rest of the movie was ahead ahead of the movie. If you are determined to read a full subtitle Hindi Flick, then look for the best romantic drama 'Namastey, London'. <br /> <br /> But I was not afraid until they thought they were horrible in India. 1 out of 10 is how it is being said. Of these, 6 out of 6 unknown strangers and illegal laughing power, and this is the number of songs / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
