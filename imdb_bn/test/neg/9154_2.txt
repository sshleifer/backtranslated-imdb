In the form of a novel by Kim Edwards, the memoir was a very successful Belsler, and during his circulation it was probably more readable in the group of texts than any other novel. So what happened when the novel became a television movie? Perhaps it is the middle-level screenplay (oops !, teleplay!), Which is by John Paillmeyer, which removes all feelings of reliability of the story with a painful pedestrian fashion. Perhaps it is a cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses pissing and character collection. Perhaps it is suffering from an unwanted source cinematography or 'liquid tears' musical score by Daniel Lich. For all of these (or all) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it makes a good case for public education about the ability of the public to have Down syndrome. And for that it's worth the attention. <br /> <br /> David Henry (Dermot Mullrini), a successful orthopedic, married to beautiful Noura (Gretchen Mole) and their life changing in their pregnancy. A storm in Kentucky, on a winter winter night, goes to the clinic near Henry and Labor, where David is assisted by his old friend Narrator Caroline Gil (Emily Watson) with his wife (the doctor is caught in the storm). After the delivery of a perfect son's child (Paul), the labor force continued and (surprisingly ...) an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately acknowledged that the little girl (phoebe) had a 'Mongoloid' (before using the term Down syndrome) and David has kept the history of losing a small sister due to birth defects), decided to send it to Phoebe a refuge site for psychological challenge: delivery to Caroline And Norra is said to be at the time of second birth. <br /> <br /> Following the directive of Caroline, look at the conditions of 'home', where to submit to the phobes, shrink into fear, and decide to keep the child. Helped by a friendly trucker, Carolyn changed her solo existence and mother's foe, her trucker's Pittsburg found new life. Nora emphasized a formal funeral for Faub - a fact that deepens the feelings of David, and Henry's life takes only one child to Paul, which falls into the water due to lack of presence. Dora presents David with a camera ('The public life is like a camera, where they live - in a room occupied by a moment)' and David is obsessed with photography. Knorr suffer, drink, and lose David's attention; David Phob searches for Caroline's existence - Send money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Jamie Spilchuk from Tyler Stentiford) grew up, discovered the betrayal of his mother, and became angry with the lack of communication and understanding of his father, and decided to complete his goal of being a musician and went to the jewels. Meanwhile, Coventry Hope Nesom has turned into a highly adapted young girl and Henry's broken marriage has happened in the way and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul's life has won the courage that Carolyn Gill supports the struggle for getting the world's acceptance of the world with Down Syndrome. The film contains the finishing touches. Cast of well known actress works hard, but only Emily Watson can revive a credible character from this skial script. A young actor proves with a promise from Jamie Spilchuk. Dermot Mullrony and Gretchen are offered to portray compassionate characters that create genuine lines for their payment. The film is a mess, but messages about taking Down Syndrome children and adults are an important one. Grady Harp
