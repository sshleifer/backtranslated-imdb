I really like shots, but this movie was frustrating as a signal. Above all, Travalta is not available in Chile Pamma Shortcuts by any means. She did half of all these performings as she did all her latest movies. He is not completely smooth or has a public presence about him that makes you harmful for him throughout the movie. Trivola seemed to be moving around in the bed and she decided to play well in this movie. Not only was the highlight of the plot that the plot was not exciting or tricky, only the entertainment that was similar was seen by Cristina Millian's execution and The Rock was fun. But anyway, short story short, this movie was in the trash and I was stressing myself to get it through myself.
