To get started, I'm not bothered to see the conviction. The preview of that movie did not make me jump, did not fear me, and did not entertain me. But when a group of friends told me to see The Groove 2, I accepted the invitation, it was a little curious to see what the movie would look like. I mainly walked due to my friends. Not even 5 minutes in this movie, I realized I had thrown $ 7.50. Acting from Get-go is awesome. At first, schoolgirls seem to have never worked in their whole life. Then, the film takes on the plot. I told you, I could not stop laughing out this whole movie. It's just so stupid. I'm pretty sure they try not to make it scary. They do not do anything or jump out or anything. It shows the kids, then shows their "attack". It creates this, it is not an "all-sudden" thing. Even in the middle of the film, the film's original, yet terrible acting. It gives a lot of time in the dialogue to add their own comments. This movie is one of the most fun "horror" movies I have seen genuinely. Bad writing, awesome acting, awesome script, awesome "unable to act", and a terrific idea. The film becomes black and changes more frequently than you can count. Eventually each part plays at the end of the movie and is related to it. I do not have to pay to see this movie again. I do not even see it on cable, even free. This is a joke in the movie. Please do not provide your money in this movie !!
