Connery climbs on Moore Train in this stinker of a movie. The film dropped the bond character into the category of Inspector Gadget, which omitted Bond to succeed in the first place. Do not get this smart. There is no style here, only the second set of cheap set performers is the actor. It is embarrassing that Connie could not borrow an element of the class here but it does not come across. With the damn cap of the Connery, everything here revives the middle class. Perhaps I had a choice of snowing and "sometimes not say again" and "Howard the Doc", but I would prefer the previous one. If you want genuine James Bond, choose an Ian Fleming novel.
