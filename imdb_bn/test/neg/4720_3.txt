In addition to the shootout scene, I think the film was a celluloid waste. Robert Duval, Kevin Coster and Anne Bening could play this role in their sleep. The dialogue was a bit tolerant (and there was a lot of it - no one was sitting quietly in this movie), the plot was on the map so that they could not decide how many themes were compressed in the stories, there was no benefit completely hurt before the eyes and most of Through the story, they led you through the nose (I think you miss something They all added to ensure that the conversation), and editing is strictly necessary (it was much more than the quality of each actor's screen time - again, very much dialog). <br /> <br /> The whole story took place within a few days, but what happened in epic proportions took place everyday in high school, but it was not really important in the grand scheme. Yes, the bad guys killed the beats, they hit the button, they killed the dog - everything that got Bose and Charlie's blood. But this film was reduced by the deepest, meaningful "conversation". These guys have worked together for 10 years and they are talking about this stuff now? There was never a dialog in the gun battle scene - perhaps I like it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gives ante baying hair brush! There were curious streams of hair around her face (I think) to see her a bit more romantic, her face became a little scared. If he used to work outside the house, it would have become more knowledgeable. Plus why is she not already married? Along with Marshall and his chronisms, there were several "merciful and gentle" (his words) single men in the city. In fact, no bad people want him (a common plot device in other movies). He most of the time entered the house and the city does not seem to have much connection with the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the stars the screen is felt like a star with lots of time, but despite the dialogue, there is not enough character depth for my interest.
