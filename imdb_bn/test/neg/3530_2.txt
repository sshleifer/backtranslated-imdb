All right, let's see ... the town is a handsome young stranger new, and walk around the local boardwalk. He met a beautiful girl, met with infamous leaders at the local Hip Youth Vampire's Club, to show them the courage to follow them in this cave, a clash over the beautiful girl, the epic war took place ... <br /> <br /> No, it's not lost guys, even though you'll be strained to say the difference, because I think even some of the carnival songs are the same. (Will you have to give royalty for a movie sample?) Even these stinkbomb endings are robbed from the Lost Boys. Make-up is equal to low-budget thriller, the lower characters are one-dimensional, and exactly how many "Oh, I had this terrible experience", which movie is needed in the movie of teen movies? Humor is flat and stupid, and all others are sadly predictable. Yawn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only terrifying thing in this Turkish is the promise of a sigel (threat), it is expected that every distributor of the country will run a steak through him.
