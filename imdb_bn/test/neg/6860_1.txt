I enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and have tolerated some bad actors in poorly-written episodes because when it's good to lose, it's really good! But Mr. At Eco's death, this episode had many drain-out scenes with bad performances closeups, which I saw myself tapping the fast forward button. This episode is far too far. In fact, the difference in the quality of Lost was so inconsistent, I often wonder how many writers they are using. <br /> <br /> I'll continue to see but hopefully things will be better and hopefully they will die off for the sub-sub-actors of the series.
