In 1872, the film was a great start with the violent, bloody war between Drama (Christopher Lee) and Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is stolen and dissolved in dust - van Helsing also died. Someone collects dracula's ashes and kills them on a church basis. Cut in 1972 - where the film is separated here. <br /> <br /> We got hurt from the head with a loud, bad 70 second music, disgusting fashion and stupid conversations. When it was making Hammar was losing money and decided to try to get a hit. Ductula was not a good idea in the 1970s. Fashion, music and conversation horror movies date. We got to know a bunch of annoying kids in 20 of those who decided to make a black count - "for a glove". Normally they are at church (now abandoned) and naturally resuscitate Dracula. The descendant of Van Helsing is a good thing ... but Dracula goes after revenge by his nephew (Stefani Bicham). <br /> <br /> Lee and Kushing always have their role and whenever they get a shot in the film a lot of energy on the screen. Highlights of the film's opening and final wars (though the end is hiding the music for the 70's). Also the main character of the children is Johnny Alacard (Christopher Neme) - a real stupid name in the early 1940's. The film also screamed Queen Caroline Munro is looking absolutely great. The film is well-directed and well-played, but the plot becomes stupid, 70-second fashion, dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and I became largely innocent. Most Hummer fans agree - this was one of the worst Dracula films - it was the worst of the followup (Draculaic Santational Rights) - and the last Hammer Dracula movie was. It gets a 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
