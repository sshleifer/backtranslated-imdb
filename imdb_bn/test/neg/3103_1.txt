Crazy six tortures, it's Albert Pine's worst movie. Even the blast and the ticker are good! I can not believe how bad this picture is! How did this get even greenlight? I have seen this movie about 3 years ago and how bad the only thing to remember was. This is not a bad movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie <br /> <br /> Out of 10 (Â½ out *****)
