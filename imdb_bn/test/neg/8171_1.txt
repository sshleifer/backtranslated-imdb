Two days ago I had the opportunity to watch this movie Cable TV (Asia-TV). I have been very annoyed since then. The movie "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only part of real life. It is very partial to parents. Have you ever thought (kids) on the other side ?? There are some parents in this world who give birth to their children but do not care about their parents. I'm a victim of that Why do you (parents) want to have 5 kids in your life if you earn only 2000 paisa per month? I had to work alongside my siblings in the street as well. I have no idea how I was managed to reach the IIT there. It's been long since then but I still do not believe. Now I'm here a research scientist in the United States. I have provided all the necessary requirements to my parents, both of whom cared for my parents. When we were kids they could not provide basic things. I find this movie very annoying. Its very partial It hurt my feelings very deeply. I firmly request the producer / director of this film from the perspective of Indian society in another view and to make another film.
