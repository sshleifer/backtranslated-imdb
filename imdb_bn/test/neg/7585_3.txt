I chose this DVD from Wipart's Chipo Bin because the cover showed a plane flying during Vietnam (C-23K). I did not fly for Air America, but I was known as a C-23 pilot, I knew a lot, who went back home after returning to my reserve unit. I'm not a film critic, but the director and the authors are surprised by this tremendous inspiration that made such films. The best part of this movie is to go to cameraman. Flying shots and stunts (though completely cartoon-like) are excellent. The film started in 1969 with the Hollywood fallout of the fall. But actually Nixon did not start America, he did not start a lie. Johnson had inherited Air America and Nixon's lies, wars, and America's heirs. It is not fair or right to portray Nixon as a liar about America. All the president has inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody smart enough to fly the C-123 was not enough, but they did not have enough to know what they had joined. That makes the Downey character incredible. A C-123 was a curled aircraft. It can easily fly in one engine, or two auxiliary jet engines. Three stooges of a duck shooting with one shot are probably likely. Traveling pilots with Air America were CIA's civilian employees, they were not destined soldiers. There was a good reason to behave and believe in the future if they survived their extremely dangerous work. They are given double time per retirement pension. They did not need to sell dop or guns to get good pensions. Dop was legal and the way to live in Saaye, it is still in Afghanistan today. When trying to earn money on individual pilots, it was not a CIA policy. The CIA has fought against communalism, not medicine. The author is based on his story of "war stories". Pilots love BS who will buy one beer and listen to them. Writers and directors such as Kumbhika in Vietnam and Nixon. Watch the film and remember how it started - it blames Nixon for the existence of the year. Remember, he did not become President till January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the jungle landing mountain. Air America pilots keep an airplane in aircraft aircraft designers never imagined. There were lots of fun stories that were shown to them. Instead, the Director CIA chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how stupid. This scene shows that the director and the author fall for some pilots' talk and rage over them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
