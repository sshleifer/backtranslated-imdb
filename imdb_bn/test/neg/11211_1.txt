This plot is very basic, but acceptable: A young American soldier, studying Asian martial arts, uses it to use the defense of the general's daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, three main actor teams (soldier, girl, rebel) combined IQ amounts 3: one point for the soldier, one for the girl, a large number of ninja fighters will have to divide the third point among them to lose against the former two.
