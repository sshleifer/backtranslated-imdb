I know it's hard for Americans to find European movies in videos / DVDs, especially in the 80's, but please find the original version of Vanishing - titled Spurlos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of the vanishing screws, especially at the end stage. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kifa Catherland, and especially Jeff Bridges, but it's so taller than the original. Where are they thinking? Gainith Palto finally thought of a happy ending with Brendan Brendan Seven in the arms of Brad Pitt? Due to the frustrating end of the whole point, the whole point was largely international success. So why do you take such a shirt remix? Really, avoid this and get to the original.
