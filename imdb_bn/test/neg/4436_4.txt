Quintet Paul Newman and director Robert Olman are both identified in the science fiction. Newman was told that he could not do a comedy, but in the end he tried to not achieve real success with that slap shot. But due to the failure of this picture, he was given a gunshot and he did not try again. <br /> <br /> It's one of the biggest diner films I have ever seen. It is brought by a future ice age, who knows, but it is probably a nuclear winter. Even in the ice age even thousands of years ago, the equatorial part of the Earth has survived animals and human life, but apparently it is not here. Seals survived and Paul Newman hunted seals outside. <br /> <br /> But the hunters need a little more and Newman goes to a predictable town where things are so annoying that there are six games with children of any kind and it is a kind of Russian Roulette. To win, you have to kill five other participants in your game. <br /> <br /> Is it tragic that what the man came down to? That's one of the things which I could get into this story. The atmosphere is silent, the story is silent, people are silent, that's all dark. This item rarely comes in the box office. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that everyone thinks will not be in the top ten list of Paul Newman's top ten list with me. <br /> <br /> This man's future, what a bomber
