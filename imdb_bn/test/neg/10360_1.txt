Yes, I appreciate its independent soul, but it's like a bad cast and a road trip with a budget. <br /> <br /> I see an American comedy when I do chocolate, I do not smile. This movie has made me laugh, but due to a lot of explicit effort to imitate American high school / Pot-Flicks of high budget, if you have a good independent American comedy with pot reference Want to see Kevin Smith or Richard Lincoln flicks or something. <br/> <br /> I mean, how you can take these comments seriously when most people are not complaining about smoking smokers! <br /> <br /> However, in Norway it is called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
