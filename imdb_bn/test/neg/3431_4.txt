If you are John Crisinsky's fan, this (very few) low-budget movie is fun, but otherwise frustrating. At least it was small, so I do not think my time was too much wasted. John's scenery is fun enough, but the 'deep' scene with Lacey Chabbert is quite impressive. It starts to seem like a fun movie, but some characters are only so resorted to, others are too serious that it only falls flat. Do not start me from the end. It was completely impossible and did not fit even with the rest of the film. I would say that I was not disturbed, so I gave three rates above it. John Crisinski's fans would enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stocking his head and watching him eat a chase-brick. Oh, and do not forget to check out the deleted scenes, they are actually better than some of the movies included.
