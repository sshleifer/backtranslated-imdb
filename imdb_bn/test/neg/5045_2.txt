Do you know that the mouthwash commercial has a face full of people's Listerine or whatever else he's trying hard to keep from spitting it into sync? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, though it was really hard. But to keep the face in the mouth you will have to leave with a tender fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. When I had the chance I should spit it out. <br /> <br /> The court fair enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, Gergiel came back to Romania, and the priests who knew how these wars were fought and killed were long dead. Until the gargoyles run amok things get down to Michael Pare and some other secret agents. Unfortunately, misfortunes has been completely lost in bad conversations and people are less than enthusiastic to play in Lead. Best acting is done by Cgi Garglas. Finally, this movie looks like Van Helsing of a poor man. If you check your brain at the door, it can get you through a nightmare on Monday night. I gave it 10 out of 10 stars.
