Talk about false advertising! What was this in the comedy section of my video rental place? I think there was a ridiculous part of the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but it was only blackout without any comedy. The movies were usually annoying and non-funny. Yes, Kevin Spacy was good as a body and the rest was good, but usually the film is different because we do not see enough good reasons for Gaya so that it gets worse. The end was frustrating as well. What will Buddy's motivation for letting go away with what God has done? This is not really explained at all. Why would body go for such a plan? Would not it be like a badie to hang the police in the gaudy whole screw? In the end, I do not think it does not matter. <br /> <br /> I usually dislike this picture despite acting. Spicey mostly shouted the scenery for most of the films, but eventually he gave Badki some of the necessary humanity. The story was not just as well as cast.
