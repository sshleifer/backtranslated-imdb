This movie, which I hired under the title "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horrible flick; But what I got was a very dull, standard "Scratch extraction vegence". In this case, Ghost was a religious monk leader who tried to refuse the treatment, but whose application was ignored and he died in operation. Result: Her soul posed nurse Sherry and forced him to do the murder. The only Voodoo connection was one of three black characters, in this case a blind football former football player, who practiced mother's voodoo. The film is very slow and very dull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, and a non-funny, just stupefying way bad. Do not do it at all costs.
