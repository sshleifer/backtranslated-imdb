I could not believe how bad this film was and I believed, I'm not expecting a wonderful creation from a movie. I like ZenTemo because I've tapped it. I have seen him enough that he is a successful actress, so I do not know what happened here. Characters were shallow, fix dialog, bad acting, and yes that included Seymour. It was nice to see her play against type, but this is not something bad. I noticed that he had taken credit for executive producers, so he can not avoid the blame for the cruelty of this movie. And oh yeah, they were playing the male lead of Barry Bostwick. 'Said Naf.
