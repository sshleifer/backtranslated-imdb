I just saw this movie and it has become quite tall, as mentioned by other user reviews and the thing that made me most annoyed was that there were some letters of southern accent, it was not south in Wisconsin. As mentioned by another review, Ed Gain was not a big dude, so why did a man playing Jason and Leatherface painted him? <br /> <br /> I moved fast through most of the sections that are very slow. <br /> <br /> I hope someone will do homework in Ed Gine and the city and make the right film
