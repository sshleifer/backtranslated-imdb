I appeared as an additional and had a position as a journalist covering "The Dane Curse". Jim Tharpe, p. I was involved in this movie. (Jim Thorpe was one of the locations of 1969's film "The Molly Maguyers"). I reported the 'Action' of the Emmaus Free Press Newspaper where I was editor in 1978-80 (published by the magazine, 1990). I remember the details of the period, costume, automobiles, etc. Jim Therp's modern roadside streets were covered with a wrist to illustrate the rural city of the 1920s in the south. At that time, I interviewed the producer and briefly briefly gave the speaker; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment for me. As an aside, I present a brief on one snap-hat hat and a tweed jacket wearing street scene. The producer told me to "jump" and it was a real thrill. I still have black and white steel collections for the production work for the magazine. On Monday, they might be interested in movie / television historians. - Lu Verricio
