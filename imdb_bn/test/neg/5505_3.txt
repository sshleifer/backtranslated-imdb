Generally speaking, I am not a fan of Jesse Franco's filmmaker, but for some of these films, I really have difficulty understanding the motivation behind them or the reason for their existence. For example, this is like a sick puppy. "Sodomania" is not a cinematic value, it is badly made without any type of plot and some of the worst types of sled footage ever captured in the film. This is another dirty female-in-jail movie where rape, lesbian-action and violent torture games daily routine. Keepers are crazy than prisoners and the organization is protected by an oppressed governor, who creates sexual tension while harassing a dog (!). Girls are all very nice and nude throughout the whole picture, yet you can not enjoy this sight with moving all the disasters. In a suspicious highlights, a barbaric predator game (you can predict what you have hunted), a guard and a double death between the prisoners and a free girl's picture includes all of the injections through her breast. Auch! Avoid this sick mess and you will save the problem of taking two baths to wash yourself.
