After starting to watch the re-run of the old Columbu film, I thought they all would get the same vote from me (6). But apparently I'm starting to see the difference in movies now. It happened in previous episodes, which showed some pretty genius instructions and it shows it, but negatively <br /> <br /> The movie was so annoying that I would have kept myself occupied sometimes. Instead of looking at the papers (never before in the Colombo film!), And sometimes it was so shameful that I had to stay away. The command seems very naughty. "Oh-in-mature" scenes of a neighbor-girl is a wrong place. And generally the lines and the intricacies are weaker than the average. Then the scene where they debated that the Trumpeter would be murdered (who was accused of being accused of murder) is a real folly, true fool. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the applause should be given for "begotten". In this episode, how the killer tries to protect his aliabis and tries to hide the evidence is given a lot of attention. I really like it. But lazy, Columbu has no focus on how to express it all. And "proof" that ultimately is the silliest winner of Columbo. <br /> <br /> Ratings: lie between 4 and 5
