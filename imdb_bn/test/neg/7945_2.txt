Los Angeles, 1976. Indie Film Brat John Carpenter, a new film film and a movie - was a class-known non-budget spuper called "Dark Star" in 2001 - under his belt, a great performer known as Atal on Princeton 13. Nearly a solitary police station blockaded by an invisible LA gang, it was a minor injury to the drive-circuit and received little praise from a few critics, but at least it burned the film in the world, Up Smut Halloween (1978). In Princet, the presenter still uses low-boy actor to learn how to exploit his almost non-existent budget, keeping a brutally small position and editing the film, running intensively with intelligent camera coordination. Working and switch-on general intelligent. No one wants to be Hollywood or hungry any more, especially if the 2005 version of Asvest on Pricastate was more than the original cost of the week's food supply bill. It translates into a certain type of laziness in a filmmaker's part - you're a stupid big union crew, studio and a marketing company that cares for you. Twenty years after watching Carpenter's film, I still see the glorious moment, the little girl fires cold blood while buying ice cream, continuous crushing signage. A week after AST 2005, I remember Larry Fishburn's overwhelming ping pong ball eyes and something else. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten Popcorn Staff" fits perfectly on the poster. New Year Eve Hall at the age of 13, a station closed with a skeleton staff watching its last hour. Jack Roenick (Ethan Hawke) on the call, a former narc was deeply disturbed and hopped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners had iced in the opening scene; Iris (The Soprans' Dreia de Mateo), an Enamoff of criminal nature, and a retired retired retired Jasser (Brian Denhey), a crusty old timer. Like a carpenter's attack ..., four buses were sent back to the bus prints with a criminal. All stupid eyes Gangster Kingpin bishop (Fisborne, who has been stranded since the Matrix), has secretly tried to kill a murderer from a secret police and surrounded the lid of local corruption unit of the organized crime unit. Marcus Duval (Tired Gabriel Byron). Soon the phone comes out, the power line is down and both the miscreants and the police are seriously armed with a serious police operation and fight against a task force of Dual corrupt police, while the red bullocks compared to the white ballwalk, bullet wands, infra-skywalker ranks More high tech gear. We hope that the top rockets of the police station are expected to be trusted by helicopters in Windows, a secret operation to cover twisted tracks. He also took Billboards at the Hualoid Boulevard. <br /> <br /> The resurrection of the recent seventeenth century is the most important plot of John Carpenter's origin in the 2005 Don of the Dead of Real, and to quote the seventh, "It's Your Own Good, People". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenter is a worshiper of 1976 continuous culture, but rarely branded in the collective consciousness of the public. The presenter was busy with Howard Hanks's classic Western Rio Bravo, only $ 20,000 in tight, clustrophobic urban thriller. French Wanderer director and rap producer John-Fran√ßois Richet, who feels less anxious than to pay homage to John Carpenter's self-propelled fan, Hawks or Jesse - though the script is drunk with references to cowboys and injuries - and seems to have cost millions of dollars As opposed to squeezing into as much flash and flame. As a result: Handheld Pov cameras, some unexpectedly high (and bloody) body calculations, some of the momentous moments, some simple plot twists, but basically a B-grade urban worker with an increased value tag. For the name checker, it does not provide true feeling in the filmmakers section. <br /> <br /> I told Monsieur Reichte, traveling to the forest, and I wish you luck in your music career.
