Maorin Oahara is always beautiful and attractive. Here he finally plays a sick actress. We do not know. In this honor a bit of precedent of "love story". <br /> <br /> Well, like William Bandix, most supporting cast. John Payne is meant to be mourning but he feels sleepy. The child who receives the child and the wahra makes it the best with a great plot device: Of course! Take an orphanage. She will live after passing your wife. This is a sweet movie but it does not feel sincere. I was hoping to move. I was by the gentle performance of Wahra. But I do not like to feel manipulate.
