Oh, where do I start? Give a brief overview of the story? No You have already heard it, or do not want to. Both ways, it sucks. I liked a lot of movies. I would be a semi-big horror movie aficionado, and I would certainly say one of the most unexpected and most brutally executed movies to watch it. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story is absolutely very fast starting with build up in any mystery or minimalistic. If we used to provide the smallest shit for the characters of that torture, it would have been much more effective. Since teenage girls meet Captain Howdy, the first scene in this movie is how will we be sympathetic to them? First, they seem stupid to go to a party with a person they do not know, and secondly, we do not even know their unique names! Why should I care if they survive or die? Are they really frustrated to show their sympathetic attitude to Captain Howdy after being "reformed"? Please! I was just happy when I got her desert! He deserves them! Hell, he deserves even worse! Also, we were forced to sit straight through a continuous wrong instruction removed from "silence of the Lamb" (and here it happened violently! Of course he will give them a false address! Even if he is also real to them, what are you waiting for and some people Do not think that you will not break?) <br /> <br /> There are conversations then. Everything is said by Captain Howdy ridiculous or just plain fool. "The dead are so deadly dead, when they die" ?? What is that kind of painful?! DE Snyder at one point said "knowledge power". Well, if this is true then this film has no power. <br /> <br /> Then, there are plot holes. Yes, I know it's a horror movie (well, wannabe scary film), but not! You could drive a semi truck in this hole! First off, this will be the Dumbaic police I have ever seen! Ever !! I mean, dear God, these guys are fake! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how did the brutal septam ring fall from Captain Howdy's nose? Secretly, this drill expert says, "What I saw is the biggest", but if it is not so big, how can it come out so easily? Did Captain Howdy leave it only because he wanted to get caught? They sure do not feel like it. Also, they will never be released by Captain Howdy and I know that this is an extraordinary truth. He will be in prison for the rest of his life, and there is no one around this. He will go back to his old home where he was killed / tortured. Impossible and impossible. <br /> <br /> and now acting. Dear God did not succumb to these people. Linda Cardlin is the only good in this film. She is perfect and amazing. Very bad he rarely gets a better chance to work this piece of shit. Emmy Smartte shows up for about 10 minutes and then goes out of existence. Even the generally entertaining Robert Englund is here underused and ineffective. De Snyder plays crazy guy with no talent. I did not feel threatened, afraid or scared. I would rather see the role of "Chakir Wife" Alexis Arquette role in D.D. Snider. It's so much fun to see this talent-less hack to get it by this gifted psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Da Saine just sucks plain. He can not act (among the least frightening villains I have ever seen), he can not write (Did he write this sleeping movie in his sleep?), And he is definitely worse than disappointing Jessica Simpson! This movie is a way to show all the strange shit of Dr. Snyder, which he himself knows about self-separation and modern primitives and about Allah-Allah-Allah. Either it was done before or it just did not need to be done. I was bored across the whole helpless thing. <br /> <br /> acting sucks, sucks music, sucks script, sucks pacing, sucks special FX, guide sucks ... Basically, this movie sucks. This image tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror flick and it unfortunately fails. It does not manage to shape, shock, or disturb any shape, way or form. This is probably one of the greatest influential and completely irrational films of all time in my life. A piece of captive synthetic garbage on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strongland" gets 0 out of 10. Avoid any and all costs. The least fun is not.
