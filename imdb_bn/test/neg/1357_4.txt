I'm sorry, but I can not even agree with some of these gritty pieces ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language, because I am a German citizen, so please do not blame me for my inappropriate grammar I do not understand why the film got so high ratings? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me <br /> <br /> When I saw the comment about The Da Vinci Code, I think - almost the same rating, I was pushing my head on the table, because I saw Scuder directly in 2006, after the sequel, and my God, They have the world. <br /> <br /> Most posters on this board have broken into each of the hipped films. 6.3 With this rating of filmmaking and marking heritage as a talent. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the main point of your opinion is that German is not your native language and you just ignore - sentences. All right, I must admit that some scenes are fun, but lastly, 6.3 is too much for my friend!)
