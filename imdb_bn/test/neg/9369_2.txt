I do not usually write reviews for shows until I meet them completely. But there was so much positive outlook on this event that I think it was consistent with reality. <br /> <br /> This event is violently bad. I do not think it was meant, but it's I see a lot of praise on the show, and I can not really say why - this event has done so bad, the dialogue is so awful, and plots are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting that it is a standard litmus test for your values. Some elements of the show, and perhaps more important to some people than those elements do not work, which make the show almost unatchable to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy watching it, if you see it, a show scene, closed lines and like this, it could be an enjoyable show of ridicule, if you have that kind of time in your hand. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a beautiful example full show. If the nongroos Saccharine cliche ends, you will not mourn a cell phone, then it may be a show for you.
