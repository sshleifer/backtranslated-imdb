How does the world get home on my DVD player like this one thing? Even how will it be packaged and delivered? Is there a zero-screening of a movie (and I rarely use that word) before it can be left in a video store shelf? I'm about to make the DVD myself but it's coming! It does not entitle me to get together with my friends and relatives, a painful camcoder, a terrible story and keep it together so that it creates a hiping pill and it's a movie. And I want people to quit using "indie" and "campi" to describe such movies. They are not. Any other profession would be considered acceptable to something like this. If someone tries to sell you bad car like this movie, you'll take it back and say it as a lemon. It was a surgical procedure, you would be suing the doctor for the evil. I'd like to get my time and money back after watching this. These types of movie shops are shame those video stores. They closed a rip for the public. Do you like "campi" Friday 13th movie (even the latest) or get a dead-alive sequence. At least those who do not want to kill yourself. This is because of movies that automatically makes people free of garbage.
