I guess it's going to be a "alternative reality" tin flick ... more precisely the character of Ferrer Bueller type as a cheat ring leader. Yes, I know that it is not compared to Ferris Buller, not at least "orange-to-orange" way, but it will not be reduced. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: It's far from being a classic classic even away from the galaxy. It's worth watching, though you do not expect too much. That said, the main character has some charm, but the compound wear thin because the writing is not tricky. The film did not just give enough smiles, twists, or tensions to my interest. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I'm seeing to be honest ... and suddenly seeing some of what I will see. It's not So, as stylish, I will not recommend this movie. BTW, it seems weird as Mary Tyler Moore's Principal. He really miscast, I hope the paycheck was invincible big.
