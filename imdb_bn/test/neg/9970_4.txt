As long as there is a TV movie, I also strike me as a routine. I can believe that this is based on a real story because the plot does not seem to have written with the expertise of the story. For example, good old John Ritter (now rather big and bearded villain) poisoned his wife to make his wife ill, then blamed him for psychological and immediately left another young woman to get married. Fourth year before the story comes up again. Why fourteen years? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rapar's first wife, Helenberger, paveing ​​through her hatzer, stamping across the old electrical device, and there is a score between the black and white flashbacks, suddenly she remembers Happily, fourteen years ago, he had discovered a reel-siving Selenium filing from a rectifier, be careful Their collections, and their shampoo and its petals liner (or whatever it is called), putting them. Later it develops that he also kept it in his coffee. <br /> <br /> Really, I do not believe. I do not believe that his special epiphany was or that Ritter made selenium shavings in his shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the film as "toxic metal" and I think it is adequate, but it is an anti-oxidant that is sold and eaten at the counter of the drug counter. Someone has to show - since there is no one in this movie - it is a poisonous poison. Many people have tried to try nicotine patches. So how does some Helenberger merge and sophisticated headaches to merge some selenium into her shampoo? And when his eyes applied makeup becomes painful as boils? I think anthropologist eBay Beller called this simple-minded concept "sympathetic magic", but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. However, Rotor apparently tried the same stunt with his second wife after fourteen years, although no evidence of cheating was made when she became ill with the same symptoms. Wife number two is taken to Mexico and is apparently cured, but after her return, the dead are suddenly dead. There is apparently evidence against the genre, who plays villain with all the stops - when his first trial was dismissed, then he was reminded of Helenberger, who initiated the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helenberger was a good friend with Rotor's second wife and was very annoyed with his death and his methods. (I bet.) And she is preventing the same thing from happening to young young men who are standing third in Rotor's marital schedule. (Surely) Detective Funny - Does Lawrence Done give the best performance? Everyone else works by number. They are passionate and thinking projects with a warning subtlety crossing a railway. But Dane is not that little thing originally. "I have been told that you want to report the murder. (He has a long break while sitting and waiting), then suddenly put his face towards Hallbarger and asked with a reasonable and enthusiastic voice," Who was killed? "I think the historians I do not mean to avoid the bare bones of the events, the characters, or their work, in the real life. What, Ritter is still in prison in prison and Helenberger's character is dead, so whose stuff? I hope the forensic staff has been cleaned. It seems to have used so much toxic and toxic metals - I see, selenium, cyanide, a large dose of chlorine, And maybe something else - which I confused, I'm not wasting it for the rater, here's a PhD with a mathematician who Who claims to be a "doctor." He also corrects people who call him "professor." Most PhDs get the brutal problem very fast behind them. "Jess" is me, though, how do I get a standard deviation and You do not know. "The average TV rental.
