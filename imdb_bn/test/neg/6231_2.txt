I like most of the Jet Li movies (except for Romio Must Die) and I bought this movie three packages of cheap with "The Master" and "Twin Warrior". Twin Warriors were very impressive and I was totally curious about it, and the master was a little "karate kid" but was enjoyable, I thought the movie was impossible. I'm not saying just because I'm using good movies. I'm saying that it was almost with "Kazam". The war scenes were terrible (unclear camera and no real war) and the plot was your ideal "stupid kung fu plot". If you are going to make this fool (see, 'The guy will fall in love with Jett Lee when he becomes the Almighty'), then there is some great fight for you to walk well with. If you are looking for a original hack Jet Li, I recommend you rent "Shaolin template 2" (Shawlin's Urmi Kids).
