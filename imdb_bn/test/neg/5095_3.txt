This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. I am in my late 40's, and saw it with my father-in-law (first 20s) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We saw it almost an hour and turned it off. I spent more time with my iPhone, which I actually saw than the movie. I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; Otherwise I will give it a 1. I am sure that those who are really "art" in those who find those reviews will get humiliating but we all have our own opinion right, so do not? If I thought of a "chick flick", where it was the focus of the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for boys, then focusing on war and courage. In my opinion, it did not succeed in both cases.
