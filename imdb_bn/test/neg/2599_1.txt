Family Guy is one of the worst shows I've ever forced myself to see (though not below - I saw Jersey Shore). Popular popularity with high school and college kids, who make mistakes for ad junk, this show is unreasonable and brutal. <br /> <br /> It's been dubbed as a comedy show, let's talk about its "humor." 1. Random flashbacks / celebrities or movies or politics or something that can laugh at a knee-jerk. It got old after every episode 5 or so repeat. Simple Solution: Every time you "get worse / worse than this ...", plug your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Incompetence for its own field. This show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags with the overall conspiracy. Solution: See South Park. They did it right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that your family is not worth your time and there is no candle in Simpsons.
