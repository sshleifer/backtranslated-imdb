Se7en is not suitable for a bare-facing rip-off and cleaning its shoes. The word 'predictable' should be discovered for such an occasion. Lambert is always woody (his 'passion' moment smiles laughable, as his pronunciation). 'Climax' is not that we have many signals, and in the end we can only prevent body, rotting and otherwise. Together a real mess.
