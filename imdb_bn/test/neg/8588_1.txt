Another crazy movie "Retitiy" and "Attractive Thinking" - whatever that means hell. Al Pacino said a lot to them - "Television killed football." Yes anyway Another movie that is showing the confusion of Oliver Stone's Grandeur. Stone is trying to show us that football will fall on us or something, why did he insist on romanticizing the sport with his strong camera movement and Kid Rock music? He also trapped Cameron Diaz for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Posino have to meet in such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Because the authors and directors "Panino" used to romanticize their beaten line. His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices which are usually ineffective and annoying. She needs to reconsider herself, showing how she can work without yelling. With the chessy lessons like "Organized Football has been upgraded", she must feel sorry for the hockey scripts and have a good story to work with.
