If the movie is humbly entertained, a negligence of neglecting the many inconsistencies and lack of credibility of the plot. Bruce Willis did not appear as "The Jackal". Instead, he bubbles around in the light of day, shaddy disguised parading a mishmash. Why this person has never been caught before (or even marked) is beyond me. Not once the visitors are impressed by his cleverness or courage; Considering the value of its services (an additional $ 70 million), its methods are fairly low budget and fools. <br /> <br /> They are laughable at least in their behavior to pursue them. They show no sense of efficiency, instead of half-baked ideas, which rely on their travel across the country to send them transmissions. Incredibly, these remote assumptions (perhaps he bought a boat, probably in Chicago, etc.) will lead directly to their jackal, who again run away from their strange perception. <br /> <br /> Irish accent fades inside and out of a remote radio station, releasing from a fisherman who is released from JB, plays an unused role as well as working with the FBI. He actually made a suitable partner, only because his medium is as amateur and ineligible as his professional partner. At one point, he actually tackled the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although they believe enough to get him out of their sight, failed to equip him with arms or communication. What kind of operations are they running here? <br /> <br /> This movie seems too dependent on violent violence, which is completely irrelevant and no doubt. The supposedly stolen Jackal works like an abstract and stupid serial killer, eliminating people from playing games and writing on the victim's cheeks. <br /> <br /> The film's action scenes are both expected and unrealistic, with melodrama that has destroyed both moments. This movie is poorly executed at the same level, it is a bright spot which is synonymous with Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you think you are in the mood to look at it. <br /> <br />
