When my mother took me about seven years old to this driving, which was thirty years ago. He had no idea that a family movie would be so violent. Behind the back of the back behind me behind the back was behind the back. This picture haunted me for weeks. I have learned that I live in a world where a man can knock on my father sometime. How can I stop them? How can my parents protect themselves? You certainly realize that this fungus is not a seven year old imagination. It is as real as witnessing a real event, and there is no place in a child innocent mind. It is tragic that we still do not understand the impact of bringing violence between our children and our children in our society. If only parents protect their children from violence, similar emphasis will protect them from nudity and sex scenes.
