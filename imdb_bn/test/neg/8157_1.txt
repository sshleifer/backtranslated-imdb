Although I'm a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of the old bikini posters somewhere, I can honestly say that if I see him as merely "cyclone", then I can never guess why he made it to show business. <br /> <br /> The direction of Fred O'Nein Ray (this is a good omen to see the pink circle on the head in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) must be a "B" film for the protection of a high-tech motorcycle from the untouchable type (e.g. Fred Ollen case, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> Cast yourself will tell you something. It is not a movie that combines Thomas with the ability of the actors to have the ability of Basswieck, Hall, Combos, Donohu, Tablin and Landau (!!). You are lucky, not very few movies. And they seem to be having fun, that some of the fun should not pass over the audience? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, probably this is looking for one. I would be pleased with myself, the old "Fall Guy". <br /> <br /> One star, hopefully, when another "cyclone" hits the town, Heather will run for shelter. I know I will.
