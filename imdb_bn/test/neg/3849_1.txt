I was unfortunate enough to see this image in a friend's house. What time does a relish waste? What is the whip of this movie and a whole piece! Absolutely nothing is not funny, from German scenes of insulting and humiliating screenplay. There is no plot, the acting disturbed me, and lastly, I personally wanted to beat John Leguizama with a stick. I thought John's movie was bad ... this movie I've ever seen is the worst movie.
