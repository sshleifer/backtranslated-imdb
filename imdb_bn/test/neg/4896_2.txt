The 20th-century carcass seems to be one of the first literary figures of MacCallers to lose a story that he needs a lot of talent, but this movie shows that it can be done! How to become an actor director? McCalla's poetic sympathy is completely well-organized, tropical, helpless, totally unconcerned, a frustrating and frustrating movie that has been frustrating with my jaw and mistrust, has never been able to find money and background. The only freedom fighter features have performed quite well, (although it was said that Vanessa RedGrag permanently gave similar performance, which played her role), and some good cinematography, but otherwise it could be a bitter, bitter disappointment, and, in fact, a contemporary Masterpiece has been Shimon will be hanging in the face of shame in the clown!
