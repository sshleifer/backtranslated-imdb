All spoof films require the lack of pure stupidity and any kind of humor intelligence? Even what's just a genuine FUNNY parody film? What I see is a zero-quality movie that gets annoyed with a video camera like a couple-stone high school students. These movies are not funny, they are not clever, they are not entertaining, they are simply fantastic, vainly vain. <br /> <br /> Camelx was a movie that tried to hide at its harmful level, calling itself "Sports movie" It's the same thing though. There are a few different authors for these movies, Wein did anything, Freudberg and Saltzer did something, and I'm sure there is another pair. I can not say the difference between instructions or humor to be honest, it seems like everyone wrote the same and gave them instructions. What I can not tell by the coconut who made a dubic movie or an epic movie or someone else did it, similar to all other jokes. <br /> <br /> If you do not see any movie of taste or value for your humor, this movie. If you have self-worth, do not bother to see it. If you have any respect for making movies, do not even consider seeing it. If you can not break anything, the theatrical theater still can not carry, rent it, do not order it at Netflix or Pay-Per-View, do not redBox it and do not even watch it for free on the OD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> If you want to torture yourself, there are very few good ways. B. Seeing a major example why to avoid anything called "fox atoms". C. You are being paid a lot of cash <br /> <br /> If someone gives me $ 100 to do this, then I will not really see the whole thing. It's just psychological, emotional collapse. <br /> <br /> You can also see Jhan.
