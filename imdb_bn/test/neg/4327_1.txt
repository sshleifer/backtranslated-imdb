I felt that I spent two hours watching this movie to go to the locally used bookstore and to serve the old fashion magazines and the Halston ad, the film was even better served. Or perhaps by watching the dry paint. Those two activities at least involve my mind more than "India songs". The most frustrating part of sitting through it was that I found that trying to create any mood / atmosphere and if they became more faded then their idea might be interesting. Instead, what happened was a rendition of an incoherent, silent chainsaw chain - the same scenes give up on us and hurt some points in our senses. <br /> <br /> I was encouraged to give more time. This film is written by writing in a variety of ways, perhaps without warning other people against this waste.
