I do not know where to start. Perhaps the complete concept of this movie is a disaster waiting for the event. There is little surprising about a kidnapping. I know I was not more aggressive - the topic or "performance" of David Arquette. It was like looking at an ox, it felt close to penis, even though I felt good after Bull. Filmmakers will have to find something in the synagogue than to kidnap his son (for example, I do not know, his talent as a king !!!!). His family will not have that terrible survival. Thank you, it was only shown in HBO and was not released in theaters. If you have any self esteem please do not watch this.
