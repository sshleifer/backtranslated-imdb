Uwe Boll again came back to his filmmaking skills to offer a merchant's story about a CCB and to suggest journalists carrying super soldiers on a remote island. A perfect actor inspired by the excellent Udo Care is inspired by Bowl, which works which creates the worst scripts. A researcher is investigating the crazy scientist, but this script was quite fun that the plot should have worked, with additional impact and their dead living eyes, there might be some depression in the design of super-soldiers but whatever the ball is about to manage the film Everything in the way of the transfer It does not really bother to think about how it actually works and instead stops stock camera placements and thinks it went away. Apart from this there is no spark or life in the gathering of the scene, I guess that the ball takes only one or two and uses whatever it was. It really stinks. Obviously Bowl became a disappointment in a reactionary film of his time where he learned anything about the movie. The bad movie that he made was the serial killer movie that I have ever seen, one of the worst movies. It's not that bad, but it should be easier because it should be better. Then Woody Kier is so good that he is trying to watch his scenes and making it almost bad for his good movie. Until the night is late and you only catch it on it, I'll take a pass.
