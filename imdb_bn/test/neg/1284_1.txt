I had to meet this 5-year-old film. She did not laugh once during the whole movie ... and she loves the dog and almost laughs! This movie was terrible in all respects: poor script (even children's accounting for a g-rated movie), poor production (jacket camera shots let me feel nauseating for the first ten minutes), bad acting (perhaps they were "directed" cartoon act) , Even poor sound quality (audio levels are parts that seem to be good, then what the next actor is saying is up Person can not hear). I was ready to do a lot while watching the child's movie, but it was worse than having a stick in my eyes. I prefer not to be deadly on the head with the gods-heaven-believed thing. Finally, I had 90 minutes of the best waste in my life ... and some critical time was lost on my day!
