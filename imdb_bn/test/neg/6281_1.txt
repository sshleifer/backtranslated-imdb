I did not see a movie, how I was seeing an example. I think the director will hear his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> scary script <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two bad CG effects and then the rest of the films roam like a junk yard. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews in movies, but I warn them all about it <br /> <br /> This movie will have to spend life to waste your time!
