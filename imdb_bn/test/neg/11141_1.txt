This is the ultimate drill, 60's mentality designed to shock and titillate. The act is completely wood, which is mainly composed of advertising-lobbying, which makes sub-standard actors think again the first thing, which they can remember. <br /> <br /> The last result is a poorly written play taught by people who have no idea and they can not care. One exception is that the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dalsandro), who spent most of the film in a nude studer (with a Stone, or the only piece that can work!) Please do not think I get "get" from Warhol - it's definitely And simply a stinger that should not be made from a film class.
