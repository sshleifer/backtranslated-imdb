Do not waste your time or money to see it or even rent it. It's the worst action I have ever seen. You are not coming back two hours (too many ways) in your life. If you are looking to be afraid, go see something else. We went with someone that still has nightmares about Gremlins and he was not afraid at least. <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this movie incredibly poor for making money. Before starting now, tell me that I like the first blunder! But the second is something of a different story. The plot is very deep and complex But ultimately you are surprised that "this hack was about or not." A B-list pornography film considered to be considered poor. I can give several examples but I do not want to loot it for punishment, but can add two awesome hours to two simple words .... It has spread.
