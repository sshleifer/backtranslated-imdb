The height and height of this film scale suppresses me. About a week ago I posted a commentary in silent epics Maxsein in Hell in 1962, which it referred to as "surprising". Then I encountered the Polonia Bros's Blood Red Planet. Wow ... <br /> <br /> Scale of thinking behind it. Polonia Brothers and colleagues John McBride Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick are thinking so much about 2001's songs: A Space Odesi is lucky, it was released thirty years ago before this sweetheart. In fact, it was easy for the main studio backing for the Cabirik modeler, a budget, real actor and his small "Star Trek" Recipe, and everything that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was disrespectful. Is so difficult about muscling around a typewriter? On the other hand, the Poljani brothers started radical, outside the box and started thinking quickly. They hired half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - bought a bunch of colorful lightbulas with a hot look 'chick, old dump supplies, monitors and hands-free phone headsets for each keyboard, they could find out, they were all the same. Black tartlinens, each cupcake closed with tin, they learned 3D modeling and texture skinning, to spin a few spaceships to fly-bikes, the script spent a few hours to drumming, which is easily the most horrific place monster doll that is a terrible little monster Jabba Hut was taken around her by the R2D2, her VHS camera And the image of the drawing and to perform ayamiga literally spent days and came to the winners. This is the best D.I.Y. Home video Fan is directly in the space aerospace space, which I have ever seen, and even more than the talent and asset's abolition of the filmmakers, even the LOGANS run or the ballotter: GALACTICA (the original series) is a cool look in the future, just like a media wearing a wrong match, Wearing a second hand case of fitting. As a species, we are destroyed. Seriously for a minute, this is a huge improvement over the next epics, such as Denosur Chernolix or Prialion: Alan Predators, which was already made, it's fun. Both are skills. On the other hand, Palonnias themselves started making it easy: This film is executed with a firm determination that lets you believe that you can breathe a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker fountain bottles. And the scene where a minuturized crew member of a well-liked creature remembers me instantly where I have seen before: Godjilla V. come. The Minister of the Sea, where the giant rampaging giant Crab consumes two canoers skewers and cameras. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All have fun, indeed a lot of lengthy fiction in the real feature length Create a cool color light, a hot cock and a colloquial slide projector named KAL. One of the flight crew gets her to wear gloves along with her kidnapper baseball hat and her kidnap with that goatite Metallica. Is this supposed to be a joke? No This is an epic statement for humanity, humanity and humanity, which is the ability to meet someone, in which it can not be taken seriously. Find out for a disc discount box set by your favorite discount retailer, a 2x box set named Galaxy of Terror, which is probably where it is, but how many of us can say, "Yes, they have some box sets for our movies." /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone in the sense of humor might try Silent Running or perhaps TRON. But someday the alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will inhibit an infection of this film and will decide that we will not really be mad. Good work, guys !!
