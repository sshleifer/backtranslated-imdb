Yeah, imagine the fantastic. This thing is brutal. Horrible voice dubbing, even more awesome acting and no visible plot. Perhaps there are some great chase scenes but the problem is that you have to go to that point first and I simply 'I feel like a root canal more than 20 minutes or more minutes. I think I could go faster, and I suggest you do the same, unless you suffer a lot of pain or have a mascot. No classes fall in. Still there is a migraine from this thing so I'm going to perform some dental surgery without anesthetic. Just the lines of migraine.bottom, horrendous release. 0/10
