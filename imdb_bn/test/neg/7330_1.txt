Well, there's a lot to say about this movie. Its simple trash. Very poor act, poor script, and hairy story .... Well, actress, (I do not know her name) who plays the PM (not the blonde but Latin one) are acting well, but the blonde who played the main character's friend The acting level is like high school, so one of the film's actors Also, zombies, as bad as acting, too. And, the story itself really has no point. Well, if you are really annoyed and do not really do anything then you may want to kill any time, perhaps you might want to watch this movie, but eventually, there are millions of good movie still in this crap. Total waste of its meaning and time.
