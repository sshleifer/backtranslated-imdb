I have waited a long time watching this movie. The IFC finally ran it in one night. I think it will be something like "Barley" from Barbet Schroeder. Wrong This movie does not revive the undergarments of impressive, filthy, foggy-filled characters in your story. It failed to catch Bokooski's attitude that Mikey Rau did so well in the above mentioned movie. That's the natural smart ass attitude Supporters of Charles Bukowski will enjoy watching his book on the screen, but strangers with his books can get a wrong idea about his work. This movie seems to be just drunk and its relationship 'Movie of the Week'. If you want to get a better idea about Charles Bukowski's world clock "Barley"
