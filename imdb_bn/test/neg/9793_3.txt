A tiring sharpness of a movie that does not hold anything from its predecessor jing and desperate, "Gold Diggers of 1933." During the liberation war of this movie, the production code was firmly transferred, so all humorous humor, Waqqa-Waqa diversity and gone dry one-fishing device that would close the lips of the public lips. First photo A story of second-tier star and character actor goes through the motion and "Putin" Motif appears to be heavily composed in a show; Instead of Broadway's make or break world, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. Who really looks or the show is going on? The score here is very soft. However, the large number of movies are "Broadway Lullaby", which has long fantasy dance numbers related to the last death of much of the Soviets of New York - the equivalent of using the "Forreston Man" number is not exactly the same effect as' end in 33. Busby Berkeley manages corioagraph alongside this movie, and the commitment made in the movie's opening scene quickly decreases. Unfortunately, no one has learned any lessons from this, and two years later there was another Gold Digger movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
