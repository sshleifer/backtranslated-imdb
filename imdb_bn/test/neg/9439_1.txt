This film was completely awesome. The stupid court, and the terrible acting by all. Anyone who wrote this trash should be leaked. A hack student film, but the work reminds me. Who has to release this now. I know the opinions are subjective and all, and some may think of this as "fantastic" by considering "nice" (1984) ", well close your horse and see some real movies. All right, the acting was tolerable, and well done very well, but it can not enjoy it either. I do not know how much more I can say about this waste of film, than just trashing it. Anyway, it was terrible and I recommend avoiding plug-ins, if you come somewhere near "Dreamland", rent the movie instead.
