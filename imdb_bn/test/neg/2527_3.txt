Although everyone works well in this movie, I agree with another comment: It's like a scrip-less test with very loose and isolated, really talented actors. For example, your attention is not enough. Saying, there are some really funny moments, I would find as funny as I think anyone that has been drunk that involved a Dylan McDermitt and a flaming shot glass; A split-second with another splatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover tears his usual brown chest and makes it fine, Harry Dean Stanton is his usual nutritional grandfather (repo man, anyone?) Good cast, it's not enough to keep going. Just a few gems, seconds long.
