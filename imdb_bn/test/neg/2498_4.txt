Well, since this is known as Pole Holocaust and directed by Joe Di Amato, I went to the hope of Sludge ... and when I got a bit, then Porno Holocaust was frustrating because it was so worried. The title recommends that this movie will show pornography, and it is not wrong - Porn Holocaust is mostly only pornographic, and most of it share the same thing, I was moving fast towards the end. The first sex scene is in two women and it is my expectation, but then it just falls into ordinary porn and the rest is talking (the first hour!) For the movie and you can imagine how much fun it is to sit through! Do not believe, where the plot focuses on a deserted island, something strange is going on. Naturally, it is not a group of people - some men and some scientists, all of whom seem sexy women, play role in the island. They have sex several times and some strange happenings, then an hour later they are attacked by women with a mutant zombie creature ... <br /> <br /> It certainly feels like the idea for an original - a zombie who Choose to get it, but uncertainly it does not work well at all. This image is moving within just ten minutes of two hours and it's too long for a movie. I have no idea that porn Holocaust is long; If they ran into just one minute of each sexual scene, the film was under the ninety minutes, and it could be more tolerant! Zombie appears like an eternity seen (it's quite long before it actually has enough sex breaks for them to travel to the island in the first place), and finally appear, it's a huge disappointment! I understand this is a low-budget B-movie trash, but D'Amto must try a bit harder and bring something better than that! I'm not even going to bother to mention acting, atmosphere etc., there is no point. Porno Holocaust is basically just a drilling with a horrible drilling of your average gentle porn flash, and I can not recommend it!
