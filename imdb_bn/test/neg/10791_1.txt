This story is about a Safari in Africa that meets some people called Trent - who believe in them looking for a tribe of white babes. Naturally, they become the Amazonian warriors and take men away. The rest is predictable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is expected to be found in the basement movie of a door in Africa. All of them - the most important use of irrelevant stock footage, movies of non-resident animals (such as Aurangutan, Moj, Cotamandis, and Ground Hogs), a black actor, who is interested in a native, bad performance (especially with Trent - Balasa wood personality A white actor, a white actor, comic relief (a word like Chico Marx), a gorilla suit and a woman dressed in a bikini-clad white woman, like a wild jungle warrior - angry women like women Tarzan According to its appearance, my assumption is that the film was made for $ 49.95 - for the cost of developing costs and Gorilla suit! But, what I expected was not an IMDB score of 4.9. It is poor, but not poor, that it produces a scalp in every possible sense and it does not have any convincing reason why this movie is rated higher! Now I'm not saying that the movie is not worth it - it's a campie and a fool, which is enough for enjoyable philosophy - especially with friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Ulema want strong white people ... "<br /> <br />" I-Tonga .... no, .... kill ") People"
