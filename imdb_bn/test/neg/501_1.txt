I recently saw the Gate of Heaven. I saw this 3 hour 40 minute epic western, which is not western, I read the book of Steven Bach. After considering all the facts and movies itself, I still think this movie is a waste of time all the time. I believe someone will ask you to see it, actually, they are trying to raise you for death. For some reason if you can think of this bad husband as a real bad movie, then why should I ask? Although it is not the reason for hate, it has historically closed. It claims to be a hellfire County War on a situation that happened in Voemming. In fact, the cattle of that time wanted to kill all the cattle thieves and claimed that they were all non-residents. You can see that you are not just concerned about these people and hope they all die because at least, something will happen. Each of the movies discusses the event and it never seems to be seen. After you sit down during this huge giant waste, you wonder how nobody actually happens in a 4 hour epic that does not happen. Oh and Johnson did not have any war in County Wars, it did not happen. Indeed, Johnson County War was told that it almost happened, in fact, 2 people died. I can not warn you enough to close this movie. However, if you're like me, then it's like an interesting case to read the idea of ​​watching a film of United Artists in a lot of things to destroy the carrier and "for sale" and, after all, this terrible, racist, no sub-text film, and many more photography. . (Which is sometimes beautiful)
