(spoilers) horrible enough, I actually saw the film that was a horror movie of this movie. It was called The Fighting Eagle, and when I just saw it at the age of eight. It has such a terrible impression on me that I have never forgotten. I've been a fan of MST3 for a long time, so when the cavidwalls came in tape, I bought it. I was so scared that it was a series of actors that I had seen a long time ago! Atter's costume, the way I've seen him, has never been skimpier than ever. How can he wear that small bikini? He does not care that he shows that there is no error ... package? And poor thong ... he gets no line and no girl, and almost always have to follow that frizzy-haired girly doofus ator. Does anyone else notice that Miles O'Keef is walking like a woman? It's no wonder that if he does not have anything nice then the fair will be there. Bad but professor bad guy Zor more of his taste, I'm sure. I like the emphasis on the cardboard spray painted Hanel Helmet, and thus, trying to touch some parts of the attic all the time. The scenes of war are so badly danced that it is astonishing that the swords never manage to connect. The dull old man spent all his time standing around looking depressing. Atta drinks him from a cup that hates him, and then he is surprised to find that they dug him. He must have been very smart - he invented a hang glider in five minutes, then placed it in a jerk in space / time continuation so that he traveled short in 17th century Bulgaria. Because he was tearing the giant snake doll, and saved the post Queteel Mela when he was not doing anything at all. The original protagonist of the movie was Thong, who saved Atar several times from his limitless brutality and killed the rebellion. Thong Codos, the only qualified person in the whole film.
