Gene Claude Van Damme's film career seems to have gone to hell in the handkerchief, how damaging it is to act in a character that literally fills the same fate at the beginning of the movie! It is also noted, regardless of the producers, directors or screenwriters regardless of the plot of their films. Van Dam generally plays a character living in France, then a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the world where one of his brothers dies and for vengeance it has reached Van Damme that he was seen with a character. AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other movies that feature the title "Starring Gene Cloud Van Dam" feature and they have almost the same structure structure. This does not mean that they are identical, just the same and if you've watched a Van Damme movie you've basically seen them all. It is the same with the highest risk
