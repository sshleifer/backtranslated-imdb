Basically, the spider was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; They are usually ludicrous, convoluted and inactive. There is no alternative to it. In the first part of the spiders, 'The Golden Lake', a wealthy entrepreneur accelerates the plans of a gang-spider for criminals to steal gold from Inacus. A cynical love triangle ensues with some cowboys and Indians action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and, along with the movie 'Siri Vampires' (1915) I'm better than other serials I've seen since then. In spiders, the camera is not static, and this movie is fast, thanks. Tinting and light is enough, enough. That's something extraordinary, though. It is almost unclear, however, how closely the series has been met with the Louis Fualied Serials; Criminals behave like gang dresses and 'lace vampires' - only names, and in small amounts, the situation has changed. <br /> <br /> For more comments on the Spider series, see the Web page for it.
