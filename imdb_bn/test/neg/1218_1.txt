This is the worst Italian movie, probably the worst movie ever! Joe Di Amato is certainly not the genre of any film, but most of his films are attractive and visible. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Its sticky and annoying .... Waaaaay boring. If you want a movie of MST3, you can get a troll 2, if you want to keep the movie out of the mouth, get deep blood!
