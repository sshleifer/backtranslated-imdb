<br /> <br /> I saw this movie during the festival of Munic a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. A group of viewers were sleeping in the middle of the movie and the other part was frustrating. The annoying dialogue, the sequence of war choreography badly, an awesome fool story and even bad special effects. Well, at least actors did not have much to do, without worrying or (if they were female) showed their breasts at the right level. Even Gotz Auto, the audience who later acknowledged the GE could understand the frustration of the audience. Be careful, the fancy most popular fantasy cinema ........
