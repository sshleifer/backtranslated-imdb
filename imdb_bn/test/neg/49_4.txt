The horror film icon starts with the director and then before giving his servant a break. This icon, with whom some Christopher Lee has his qualities, then people around him become frustrated when the filmmakers of the horror film society steal his body in his brain. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are good shooting, good writing and potentially abundant for the killer superlative. But the film falls in the middle (though not as grateful as "death's house") and sometimes the power of that energy does not increase. <br /> <br /> Most of the deaths are confusing, as if they see a floating coffin or other weird things just when the fear is falling on. Twice we see toxic gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star has played the monsters that he has played. The boy does not lie, until he plays his annoying aged men and shows "matlock". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> A modern equivalent (Vincent Price or Peter Kushing Excavation) will make a great movie. Perhaps a remake is not so disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not come along with applying, and this film gives that example. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I saw him and thought "Jeffrey combs" but it seemed that the box I never mentioned was wrong. But enough sure, combs were present. (A note for filmmakers of this movie: Specify combs on DVD covers, if you cheat customers, you will sell more copies.) If you are jealous for the combs then see this basic role. Otherwise, I could not offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Let me recommend "Intruder" or "Popcorn", who will stand both fairly decent and time-tested.
