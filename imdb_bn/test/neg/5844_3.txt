I recently saw a good example of the differences between American and foreign movies in the television: Indent proposed film. <br /> <br /> Two of the pornographic titles, David and Dean Marfy have played Woody Herrerson and Demi Moore. . I'm not sure whether they had a total lack of chemistry or they were not acting well, but we should take so much care about why we could not have both of these together. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction ?? <br /> <br /> Because I knew that Robert will finally show up in Redford, from the beginning it is clear that, the good part, the flesh of the film will be between him and Demi Moore. The poor Woody Harrelson could not just force all the emotion for the film. She seemed to be coming back, her hair long hair, long hair. <br /> <br /> Okay, so fast forward. Do these two (Deane and David) fools think that they can return $ 50,000 by gambling? There are no acting mistakes, just wildly bad, lazy, unworthy writing. Of course they lose all their money. Surprised? I do not know I was not. Write Robert Redford (John Gaze in the film) ?? A romantic, perhaps emotionally frigid man, an updated Gatsby. A very good introduction and though a great, great actor, next to them, looks like Redford Olivier. She fell into love and desire with Diane immediately and we feel it once visitors. So love a woman! Not the way of David, the face of the dame is in the face of a thin peacock. (Did I see it?) Like a gauge, Redford puts a suit and ties into every scene. Yes, it is meant to instruct the dead audience in the brain that there is a wealthy person here, but he looks very good and at the moment the deadly visitors of the brain respect! Other clothing symbols include David's iron shirt, defining restraint at the end of the film, and combining it after getting a long shirt of a lost shirt. What is it as the <br /> <br /> and the galleries in California garden? Hollywood movie? Suddenly everyone looks British, lacey dresses, three-piece suit for men, hat (hat!) And of course parasol. Yes Dine, Rich Man's mother tongue has completed her transformation now, there is a parasol twirling auction in the auction. Although he insisted that he could not buy, he committed suicide at the end with sexual tension. Here is where the film closed pure branch in America. Of course, David and Diane must end together, my question is: Why? Dianne was bothered with Diane, why not let him go to Robert Redford's wave? And I mean a long long time? He can easily remove himself from this adult man's sexual-romantic romance, because Woody Harlesen brings his litter hair line to the garden party, sitting down himself and seeing Demi Moore in front of the eye. That's not how it's going. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our moral education must be destroyed. We're still not sophisticated enough to do it otherwise. Director Lynn Jovi tried to create a deadly attraction for the set, young people <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties, Nary has a SV, T-shirt or baseball cap, such as a reliable public transport system that connects California-based cities and municipalities. How is the symbol of the life of the middle class or the working class again?
