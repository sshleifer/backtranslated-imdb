The genuinely impressive script, and I was very disappointed to agree with Mark Singer. <br /> <br /> I actually went out in about 15-20 minutes in the theater and wanted my money back. I really came out of my life (32-year-old) movie and this is the only reason that made me crazy enough to demand my ticket price. If I could, I also got back to Popcorn. It was a real laucie movie, and there was no excuse. <br /> <br /> For one, how would anyone who is trained as a pre-tech savvy learn to drive? California !!!? (The drive is a little clever, and California's even curiosity ... I should know, I'm there.)
