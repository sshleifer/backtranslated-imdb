Many things were wrong with this movie, I have kept them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if the awakened bathroom is a person lying on the ground, then when will Jaap be seen? Did Jepke be killed before going to the bathroom by Danny Glover? Does the landscape just get up and walk out? In the middle of the bathroom can not be a jigsaw, but another part of the game of Argo? If Jeep killed the wife and the child, how does the mess make him poisoned for awakening? Finally, the doctor is waiting for the end to cut his legs, why? It was too late, six years later and as far as he knew that his wife and child had already died, it was not the best time for heroism. I have only a few questions about this movie, but I can be missing something or everything as I have only seen the movie. Help!
