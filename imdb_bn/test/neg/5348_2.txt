So many great actors, little value in watching. But a script which makes this book especially miss so much, I do not keep it against anyone on the screen. Although flawless, the book is the only issue of Grisham which I really like, especially how it tastes the southern city of the deep south, which is like the coastal city like me in a slightly different world. Naturally, I liked the real love of what was happening in the book. The character of the film has been given such personality as "generosity" which is so inferior. Villains and foil plane and 1 dimensional. But as Joel Shammer's work is as accurate as possible, authenticity and authenticity are definitely missing, and each point must be delivered to the middle of the sledgehammer. So the evangelist, stilted, and an awesome sponsor about a tragedy, I'm willing to do a rebuild and get a little more rights in the story.
