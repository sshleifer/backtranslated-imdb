It contains some satirical information, but the film is not viewable anymore ... <br /> <br /> Why Allen Barkin and PETA Wilson are on the lookout for a writer-director Damian Harris as part of this frustration. The story is complete with unreal police investigation strategies, among which a person is going to a team with a suspect and invite you to suspect in your home and close with them. There is a male psychotherapist in this story which seems nothing but female clients - and he sleeps them all. <br /> <br /> Even more prominent is the idea that the girls' terrible S / M crime is a big, yet secret, group of S / M lesbian executives. <br /> <br /> Completely bad edits and continuity flaws, the film is sterilized at all its chaos - including Barkin's detective salary apartments. And lame dialogue is appropriate for one sleeper. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and sometimes failed to create a nightmare atmosphere. He could not even give Alan Barkin 110%. I firmly believe that he realized that the film was unfortunate and tried to try. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Very low-quality character actor, Marshal Bell always gave her as the greatest. <br /> <br /> And since Damian could not reach any level, it was difficult to feel any kind of feeling of character. The most important thing is that he does not know much about the real world of BDSM and has created a fair and dangerous male and female general "Hollywood reality". <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and braincells and pass this one.
