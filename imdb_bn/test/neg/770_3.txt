It was not a very good movie, the acting was quite fun and the effect was mostly bad. But there were some fun moments, but most of them were not meant to be funny. To me, the most hilarious part of the movie was the wheelchair's little goat (which is not the interesting part you think of me), and the child goes out and starts crying for his older brother. The brother is running and the way the kid is running, so funny, he was all disappointed and I had to be reviewed several times to perform the role, so I could have had some more mockery. So if you are looking for something to rent but just can not find something check out this one and watch for the running part.
