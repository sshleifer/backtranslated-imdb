Sorry, this movie is not very good. But is it really matter? We all know the main thing for the story, and this is nothing new. But I love less budget horror and classic science fick camp ... so I apologize to this one. Anyone who remembers this movie, the little Leonardo Dipcroo about his debut. <br /> <br /> She is okay. The part did not ask for a very good acting skill, and the side probably did not give him any chance to give it ... Little Leonardo Di Capri was also very intelligent ... and the girl was also there. The movie is fun, if you love horror and science fiction camp classic and are experienced in seeing them.
