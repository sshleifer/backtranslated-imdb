I struggled to see the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a comedy but I do not smile once. The storyline is one that is interesting in a good film, but it is played by comics, so the result is absolutely incredible (should be comedy). The comic strip series were very hits and miss, with episodes, and all the people involved in the US went out to do big things. One to avoid I just found out that the comment should be 10 lines long. To indicate whether the whole point of these comments is valuable to the movie: Do not write an essay that is related to it or isolating it. If you want: Safefield, Larry Sanders, Young Ones, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Karb, Red Dwarf, you can pass it. On the other hand, if you like tail jokes like friends and dosages, but enjoy watching it!
