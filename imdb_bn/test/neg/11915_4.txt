Based on Fox's Charlie Chan series in-house Dell Bigger's novels of 20th century, apparently proved to be the favorite of the audience - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio was afraid the spectators would turn against their Asian hero. It was a misconception: Actor Sidney Tollar played the "poverty line" in the Monogram studio, where she continued to portray characters in 11 other films made in 1944 and her death in 1947. The 20th Century Fox Chan was considered as the cheap "B" movie, but the studio took great care with them: the plots were often stupid, but the pace was sharp, the diversity of the dialogue and the cast (which is the lugosi choice). And Ray Milland) are always expert. The result was a compassionate charm, which stood the test of time. Monogram was a different topic: Chan Cinematic "B" movies were easy and easy. The scripts or cast were taken very little care, and as a result the films were flat, moderately worst, virtually unwanted. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a sufficient cast and some interesting plots device, Shanghai Kobra makes the best monogrammed Chan films - but it only guides to achieving just the mediate. In this particular entry, Chan (Sydney Tollar) is called to investigate the killer, which seems like a cobra-like bite; At the same time, he agreed to ensure that the public supply of radium surviving in a bank vault is safe in all places. Do these two seemingly irrelevant plot lines come together? Well ... maybe! Sydney Tollar is always enjoyable as a chan, but most of its monograms appear to be "phones" - and this is also true for COBRA, like any Monogram Chan movie. Naturally, the really enjoyable actor Montr√©al is in. Due to the changing times, we looked at the joke of the brand of Moorland as a tribute to African-Americans, but he was an expert actor and comedian, and in the context of the black actor in the decade of the 1940s, his extraordinary attractiveness and innocence took place. <br /> <br /> Fondue fans of the 20th Century monogram Chan are a significant disappointment and the new faces who like monogram images will probably consider their third rate after facing Fox films. Like other Monogram Chan films, Shanghai Kobra is the best left point for scheduled collectors. Four stars, and that's being generous. <br /> <br /> Gft, Amazon reviewer
