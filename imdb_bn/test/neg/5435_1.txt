Anyone who knows the title of a smoked cloth vapor called Kongo understands my headline. And I think for you. This movie was not just bad. It was very painful. The book was stupid, the script was even fig and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? Your rumor spread as Jumia Roberts has made this donkey so bad. Huge diamonds? Killer gorilla? Gorilla talking? Hmm Words like a hit! Oh! Tim Curie's pronouncement is so bad in this movie that I want to be deaf! I recommend to the bubbles to leave this film after heavy heavy food or cavical patients, who only need another reason to die. If you are trustworthy for this book, I would like to tell us to burn an old fashioned footprint book and destroy every copy. If the future generation looks back and finds this garbage, how can we explain ourselves? Listen to those who hate this movie! Do not look at it! Escape! Do not watch this movie! If you think that it is full of action or suspense or cool effects but you are wrong! If you hit it more than Nick Richer, you'll be right. So if you're still going to see Cropo .., I mean Congo, I said that after you do this, you take 50 Tilelal Prime Minister.
