This movie was provocative, foppish and not exactly funny. The filming technique reminds me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But what did he think? Considering the matter, this film can be considered so much. This may be a genuine theoretical war on good and bad, but Hartley, it seems to use viewers' attention technique.
