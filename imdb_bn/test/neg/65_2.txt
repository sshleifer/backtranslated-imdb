I saw this movie purely for setting. It was an old hotel that filmed a friend's shares. The plot was predictable, the act was always mediating, the fears were the greatest, the real fear was not. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a lot of this plot, and it seems because it was not 'a lot to remember. They did not even use it for the full potential of the hotel ... beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. In low tide, you can walk about 1/4 miles from the bay, which is actually late in the night or late in the night, the first thing is a scary scene, when the air is cooled through the cracks. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
