It's a time in 2005, my friends ... amazing special effects and technology era. So, why do not we watch movies which are a little more than the Chess low budget film. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that shut down my socks, but this is ... it's almost trying to be terrible. Just ... do not look at it ... If the acting itself was at least good then I can see the special effects and the lack of computer generated scenes. I think this small film is like a little child. There is even an original plot line. Vampire Assassin tries to mock himself a big plot hole. Can anyone tell me, perhaps, it was designed as a comedy movie and I do not know it? This makes me wonder, who has liked the first episode for us to store for us?
