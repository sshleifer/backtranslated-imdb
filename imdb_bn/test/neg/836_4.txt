At least at least among the Spaghetti Westerns I see: At least in the lower part of Leone's The Good, The Bed and the Eulogy (1966), by separating each other, with three different letters (and sometimes forming a Shaky alliance) their search for hidden gold. Leonard Multin is a BOMB rated; Although it is quite useless, it is a complete routine and, unfortunately, the three major stereootypes, which are said to be uncertain: Eddie Byers is an employee of his bank who deals with his inventions by the train; Gilbert Rowland is "legend" but the old Mexican bandit (obviously its constant presence in Spanish!), Obviously, is essential for women. George Hilton tried hard to imitate Clint Eastwood's Man Number Woman Women as a mysterious monster hunter. Director Kastallari - I saw the former Italian B-movie competition in the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he performed the best of civil film directors! - shows a little genuine feeling for Westerns (with the power of the two on the effort of General Franco Nero, I ordered to cooperate with the Cassellary Cowoma [1976] ... I'm now passing my finger!) And the film's tongue-in-cheek method is equally mourningable Is.
