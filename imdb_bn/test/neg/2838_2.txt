Now, let's see if this is right, I'm going to kill a crazy serial killer estate agent ... okay ... what's wrong with that scene, I can stay with him. <br /> <br /> Next, a slasher Butcher with Tax Inspectors? Traffic Warden cut the death? Do we feel any sympathy for the people of the empty and shallow, money-obsessed property? ER ... not <br /> <br /> Sad, this is not a very well-made movie with unpleasant acting and crude effects, especially the climate scene is stupid. You can often shout the director, stuntman 'action' as he reads through the window's glass. <br /> <br /> Another critic just said, after acting in The Fog, it was Adrian Barbeau's carrier Nadir. So I was happy to see that he was resurrected by the voice of Catwoman from the Batman animated series, Live live action catwoman kept an eye on the film. NB: Not a terrible movie, it was made from the road. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, 'Kozak' or 'Street of San Francisco', and you get an idea of ​​what you offer here.
