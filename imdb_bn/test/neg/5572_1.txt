The tenant (thank you for free rent) is the city that I'm drawing in the city .... for all the things that can be shot in a tunnel! Dark ninety percent of time, and low budget flick is a terrible attempt, which can be good if right. About a bunch of young adults who are briefly witnessing, and later Lighthouse is caught by aliens on the island, their helpers and wives help. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - Acting = Awesome <br /> <br /> - Writing = uninspired <br /> - The story = make several times before with several settings <br /> <br /> - Production Price = OK for the budget (light) <br /> <br /> - Disadvantages (animal, digital, other), looking very chips, so you can see it. To add injury to humiliation, there are end credit filming bloopers - Carefully now ..... Distributed under a universal company, even after they are shocked will have to do it. <br /> <br /> Finally, try "crop" as an alternative. Low budget, but good writing, good acting, and fairly, well, awesome!
