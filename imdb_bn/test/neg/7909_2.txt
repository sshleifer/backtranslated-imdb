I sincerely agree with Greig in Ontario. I have seen a friend of this movie today who actually went to the theater manager and told him, "Perhaps this is probably the worst movie." I have seen several movies with this person, and he is quite forgiving, so I was really shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was frustrated with most of the film's humor (yes, the baked potato was at the top of the scene!). My friend and I saw the film with white and a mainly black audience. For a while I thought, maybe I could not get this movie because I'm white. Then I felt nobody smiled. Writing was bad; The direction was bad; The time was almost existent. <br /> <br /> There were some fun moments, okay there was a lot of time between them. Even the airplane was more fun than it was, and it's saying so much. <br /> <br /> I was so excited by Snoop Dogg of Starsky and Hutch (like Hogi Beer) that I thought I could enjoy this movie. Napa. <br /> <br /> Dale Hughli was funny as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had a number of funny moments as "white guy", but was far less than one of the humorous attempts. <br /> <br /> Sadly, I could not give this rating a rating with negative stars.
