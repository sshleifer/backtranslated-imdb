I saw when I sat down to see this scene, straight straight R-rated graphic, sex, strange teen-comedy ... it became fairly accurate ... only this was much more sick and obnoxious than me. . I do not know whether director / author Gregory Poyeria is ill or deeply related, but I suspect that a common man could make such a movie. If I could fix it then it was wrong, if the only thing was wrong, but it was a tough stomach ... but not so. The film is awfully provocative and annoying ... On each screen there is more than one full-second character on screen ... sexual, psychological or physical. I do not know if it's just a comedic idea, but I found it ... wrong. Just wrong Even in a comedy, some are supposed to be serious. The plot is stupid Acting is bad. The letters are inappropriate and weak writing ... all of them. There is no single favorite character in the film. Humor is disgusting and very far in the way. The film is so incredibly poorly done that I really do not think it's valuable any time. If you like R-rated, uninterrupted, and graphic stuff, weird comedy, but look at The Garcman, or better, American Pi ... or a road trip, my personal favorite. But do not see this. I can not possibly describe how bad you are ... You have to take this experience for yourself. However, this is one of the time where I will say that you are wonderful off well. In this way you can imagine that this film has gone very close ... without it and much less than it. This movie is mostly found by a group of horny teenagers, they put together a film crew and each one of them got an idea, they painted it, and then put the whole thing together. It lacks structure, compatibility and taste. Horny teenage boys only recommend this to me who watched everyone who watched every other single crude teen comedy and did not care about those quality. Everyone else ... not knowing things; Avoid this. It's not even worth watching booty. Trust me 1/10
