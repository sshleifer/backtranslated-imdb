The PDQ batches did it well. Most of the "batches" write letters to different patrons complaining about the amount and speed of their payments. Anna Magdalen's diary, in most cases, the concept of children's death and other family issues, it is even more compelling. The music is disconnected: the 17th-century chapel orchestras and the 20th-century concert hymn singers. A junior high slide show of overall production quality reminds me. J. S. Bach was a bright person, whose music itself is called. This film adds nothing. Netflix did not send me 2 discs, so I flown the movie. Clearly Netflix is ​​trying to tell me something.
