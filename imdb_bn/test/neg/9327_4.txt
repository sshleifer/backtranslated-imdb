I hate to admit it, but they were empty right to Schrader. To draw an audience in a movie, here is the opportunity to create an atmosphere. It was not done. Characters weak The story was weak. The instruction was very poor. Schrader was out of its depth and it shows. I have seen at least a lot of times now that I have at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next step is probably to be a major remake or it is expected that it will go alone. Anyone who wants to know what the Exosistist's best sigel was to say 'Legion', it is written by Blatty that it is best to follow a real piece committed to print it. Sadly, it did not translate very well into the screen and I doubt whether it might ever happen. As the Dominion, start. To avoid all costs.
