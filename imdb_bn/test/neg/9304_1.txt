This is the worst movie of all time, no doubt, and Schindler's list, actually has more smiles. Not only this, how awkward this film is and how wonderful it is, it considers its heartfelt and has 1 smile. I hope I could have met "Yahoo Serious" so I personally could throw it for myself and all other very, very bad movies. There are very few things to say about Australia, stupid results that they like it. I did not find the wrong person (Mel Gibson) from Australia, they brought us Mad Mac. It makes me very annoying that people like this garbage, (I reviewed what I read, it was "very funny," sick, not it). I personally boycott this movie and will start a petition online to ban all the Yahoo serious movies, and I emphasize it, so the returning. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, Clockwork Orange Style, call me for free euthanasia for you.
