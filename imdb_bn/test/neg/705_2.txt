First of all, I say that I'm Lorele and Hardy Baugh. I've read every book printed about them, and all their available movies have been viewed more than once. I even once got a chance, and called Stan on the telephone. He was very kind and had talked to me for more than ten minutes. I followed with a letter, and he wrote a letter to me. I still have that letter. <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful comedy moments in this movie, but Stan and Wali are not up to their normal form. During the production of Stan, he became very sick and looked bad after ten years. In my opinion, a Laurel and Hardie movie are valuable. <br /> <br /> But the commentary on this film came from Great Stan Lorel. To quote him, "This image should never be made."
