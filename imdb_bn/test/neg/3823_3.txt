Critics of this film were extremely "generous" with praise. I was personally disappointed, because of those reviews, I was concerned that the opening credits were started. <br /> <br /> All familiar story lines are like this: Distorted boy and his father are living in Louisiana. Local boys laugh and torment him. Local boys started guruscik, oh, sorry, Victor Crowley's cabin was burning with fire. Father tried to rescue his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, Elephant Mann, but eventually accidentally kept a hat in the head of the children. Victor is a murderer who goes into his domain and hunts the wicked. Oops ... awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was grateful to the fact that it never took itself seriously and a little smile smiled me too. The thing is, I've been tired of Hollywood-polished, B-horrible slap-sticks. I like to laugh and I enjoy good fears, but this film does not offer any solid dosage. Crowley is next as Michael, Jason, Freddie ... Pumpkinhead has a good chance.
