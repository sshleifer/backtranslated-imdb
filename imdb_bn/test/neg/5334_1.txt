Try not to see this one. I thought it was going to be good because I enjoyed the 80's fan and I enjoyed Linna Quigley's work quite a bit. I was roasted. I should say "no" and instead saw Gogli, maybe it's a very good movie. I was trying to humor my biggest problem with this film. It was not funny about the fun even close to it. Bad acting, even 80 films for the queen. No stories, only random clips. I think I should not hate so much because it was made as a funny and stupid piece, I had no fun and was not invited once. I was even ahead of the end to get all of the shit even faster. I'm sorry, but I do not find zombies doing the aerobics fun.
