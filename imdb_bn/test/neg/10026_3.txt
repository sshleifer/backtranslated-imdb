Supercraptastic slasher rental, which seems too long over the 80th minute. A few years ago, a bunch of "Gypsies" living in the cave of the mountain were burned in the fire. After a few years, the campus is absent from the fire area. A bunch of horny kids, of course, this area is the route for a deaucherous camping trip.
