This film is Larry Bishop's 60-year-old, messy and not well-looking, he's like a drug towards women in his twenty. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been claimed to be sexually explicit, but if the movie is entitled to this title. <br /> <br /> I can not count how many boobs I have shown in this movie, probably spending more hours a day writing Larry Bishop script. The script is ridiculous, the bishop and his gang argue, bicycle, party, sex, killing people and the next day they argue, bicycle, party, sex, killing people and on the third day, you Get the idea. <Br> <br /> I like ERIC belwer and considering what worked with him, he did a great job as a commensurate. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is about Larry Bishop's character Pistolero, which is not only the only dimensional but also interesting. He is also a horror actor, and apparently he never intended to lead himself, but he asked anyone he said, so what will he do? Once he realized that he would lead himself, perhaps he could write the script again so that he could touch more women. <br /> <br /> Although apparently it is good to see, at least half of Biker-Scenes and Eric Balfour are not bad, this movie is simply a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope you will not see Larry Bishop again in front of the camera.
