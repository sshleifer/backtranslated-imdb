A blind person can shoot this movie better ... seriously! The director is definitely a bride. Dennis Hooper's coke dealer must surely have something to satisfy in this movie. I feel very embarrassed for Dennis. <br /> <br /> John, the director ... please retire from the instructions. Your contribution was not needed or wanted. The medium of the film is powerful without you. You are terrible at the instruction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie should be omitted directly from "Video" and "Hit Trashcan". I'm seeing this movie being a dumber person. If you respect yourself and respect the film's structure, do not see this movie!
