This film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie was over and I almost stopped, but I gave it a shot. I did not expect anything great, but I was much expected than this. The best thing I do is work in a video store and it's for free because I do not spend a single dime in this movie. I have given this movie a 2 only because I have seen bad. If I were you, I would stay away from it, far away.
