This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Acting God was awful, the story line was bad. But it was a good idea. If this film was better than cinematic and had many good actors, then maybe something good to say might be. Adger Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie has destroyed it. Why do people make bad movies and always kill good stories The only good part was when the killer kept the head with a tape down the floor, that was quite good. The swinging fog was just awesome, there was absolutely no mystery. And when the killer finally turned everyone around, he was going from one second to the other, it did not give any sense.
