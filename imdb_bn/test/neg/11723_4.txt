This movie is awful, just awful. Someone bought it for Christmas gifts as a gift because they knew that I liked a pretty awful flickr. I do not think they understand the "good" part. I can say that this person is getting slip socks from me next year. Avoid this movie - it makes you bitter. Peace <br /> <br />
