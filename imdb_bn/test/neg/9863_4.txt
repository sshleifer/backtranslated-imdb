I was a chess player and I wanted to like this picture. The problem is, the content can be fitted in a 30 minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were many shots in Kalidor and Kasparov won the world championships from there. The other shot from Caspova runs around the 1997 match, and it is known where Deep Blue was located. This looked just like filling. Also, I did not see in detail where Deep Blue was now and IBM tried to tech, it failed to 'open'. However, what we saw in interest - little lady? <br /> <br /> Recent matches against Carpow Too many professional chess followers to know when and where I was. It has been said that it was very nice: Was it just 'for money'? Was it part of the World Championship cycle? What was the final score? There were two games in the movie's light. ISP Kispov was given to 'see' inside the machine? That was where the focus should have been.
