*** Big spinners! *** The "Flush Feast" of the 1970s is more than the ineffable conclusion of the wonderful Veronica Lake career. This is a terrific stinker being a widespread reputation, and just so, I would say. As a huge fan of low budget / exploitation, especially in the 70's, I chose to see this issue, mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site, but after watching it I had to admit that the film is actually nothing to do with the film. For This cover is on the cover of a DVD collection of DVD titles 'Flesh Feast' featuring Sergio Martino's "Mountain of the Can notal God" and Dal Tieni's "I See Your Skin". The collection, however, is not included in this annoying turkey. "Flush Feast" is not only a camp and ridiculous, but mostly tedious, which is more than 70 minutes long. Also, do not fool by the title, the film does not lie in all. Despite this, it is simply observable, only for its trashin and, especially, very stupid, but so is the end of some entertainment. This is the picture. Ellen follows a ridiculous plot about Frederick (Veronica Lake), a scientist who can regenerate young people with meat-eating magnets (how to ask). The criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are funded by a fundamentalist political party, appoint a doctor to restore the young man's 'mysterious' commander. After an endless hour of overwhelming drill, it proves that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was quite obvious before, but I still had to laugh because the end of the film was so incredibly stupid and funny that it was a smile ... This is a film which is very insufficient as a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronica. Lake. Apart from the lake, the performance is ridiculously bad, even in the production of such a zero budget. Bad performance, however, is something I can easily forgive on such movies. I can not forgive, extreme boring This watch can be made for hardcore fans of the final five-minute camp staff, but I still recommend avoiding it.
