This movie was a waste of 3 hours on my precious time. The first 10 minutes I was already annoyed because I was familiar with the original version of the story according to Torah (5 books of Moses) ... but I decided to get my moneys worth to see it and see it sucked too badly. Well it sucked .. We thought more then I thought it. The first and most of the scripts and characters that makes up a movie body lets start with the skeleton. If you read Terra, you can see that the story is wrong here. There are some flaws here: Mozes does not work for slavery because he was among the Levite tribe, Moza did not kill anyone in Sinai hills. But still the movie is whipping Mossa and killing Harun and killing people ...! When Moses speaks in the flames, he knows who is talking too much, but the movie looks like stupid, he says that he does not know who is Bush's GD? ... Whatever Haroon knows his brother well, his distance is growing, Harun is known for his calm, protected nature, but in this film he still portrays as angry and arrogant. Moses looked like Christ in this movie ... how ridiculous .... Faro was actually sitting on the pyramid of real and ugly dwarf stairs, so he could grow up and he was in the 10 feet and was in the movie. Repeat long and hot with light eyes! The maje Israel women (Israelite) covered their hair and body money and they could not dance or sing before the male, they did not participate in the golden childhood, so they must not dance to the public or film the cinema. Moses's wife, Tijipora, married Moges, and so she kept herself covered and humble because she did not hold hands or hold hands in public. Farehus daughter of Batia (who took him and saved him from water) was actually converted to Judaism and so Moses was proud when he said that he was going to free his people. With two sets of insane tablets to mount Sinai Mossa ... with a scary writing on it ... at least put the sacred tongue, Hebrew or English, and do not set two sets on a tablet. The bottom line is that the movie is horribly written, directed and all wrong in character. Indeed everything about the movie is wrong ... the old one is wrong as well but it is more realistic, and they are credible to the actors. Israel!
