After linking her husband's sister to death, it is worse than an intermediary thriller about an insulted wife to go to Lam. Determined to prove her husband living, she led across the state, increasing her every stumbling block. His back partners are 'good-cop' and 'bad-cop' partners. One is more interested in making the case closed by confirming his innocence. This pair is often not able to capture their suspect's corner but its quite well. All major players meet in a remote town in the desert and some of the truths reveal deadly consequences at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a bad movie. The lead worked as if he was quiet, if the police were in the police station, the suspect could not find (this happened twice) and the rest could be one-dimensional. Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
