Dr. Markoff is a crazy scientist who is trying to remedy viral causes of acormal. When he was in a piano concert, he beat the beautiful daughter of Pianwani and was ready to enjoy her. But when she does not want to do anything to her, she transmits her father with acromamous virus and tries to exchange his daughter for healing. <br /> <br /> This B-grade low budget thriller. I would say I was overwhelmed by this movie. It was not terrible- it was not, but there was nothing particularly significant about it. It was quite entertaining to watch but there would be no one in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialog is sometimes somewhat intelligent and the medium is only acting. The story is fairly predictable and does not really give us something new. Of course, I can not make too much allegations about a movie that is a gorilla suit, who has almost failed to shock a victim with a genuine purpose and culture-like conviction. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of movie it can be of a watch, but do not go to it with too much expectation.
