This is about the Ed Wood region. Yes, that ridiculous relic of a flying giant looks like a bad day in a cross and dentist's office in a Turkish beef. And the effect of that word makes scratches fingernails across a blockboard sound like Mozart. And why the giant claw gobbles his victim with his mechanical jaw when the dirty critter rises. We get big stars up to ugly chicken legs, but nothing more. I guess the producers think a more well-titled Big Face might offer a Jerry Lewis comedy. And talking about comedies, the "anti-fat" glove-gook funny from any of the movie's movies. I guess the writers were stuck because a common puck hunter could not take care of the flying loss of the 1950s, so they worried the original anti-object from other galaxies. This harmful movie from UP, KFC is believed to have penetrated the back of the sloping anti-object object from another galaxy, as explained in a strong statement by a talented genius of the film. In this case, it is Jeff Morrow, a pilot who I gathered in his off-hour, advised Einstein about the secret of the universe. Unfortunately, it is also Morro who continues the humorous work of the bad movie of Shame, because he actually supplies his lines directly with his face. What's more, he even believes them as he sounds. This is the first sequence to win a movie. To hack with the Oscars, Moro is entitled to a battle medal to overcome responsibility and under the circumstances of the worst movie in worst. See the leading lady Corday, then you can gauge under her energy fire. It seems that he has just woken up in a bad dream and if he is standing on a stock-stain, nobody will notice him. I'm just good, for the first time I saw this drive-in disaster, which was with a seed smoke in the back row of housing development. I learned my lesson and this second time should break out about 12-packs.
