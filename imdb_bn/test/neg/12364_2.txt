My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. The Independence Day and Godzilla were seen as the directors of the movie, but they were even more. The special effects of Independence Day were even better in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting to show the spider up. The rest of the story was really annoying. And when the spider came, they had a very amazing appearance, as the films made in the 60's had special effects. I did not see the whole movie. It plays almost one hour when I switch off my DVD player. I watch almost 3 movies almost every night, and I never went away from the movie, even if it was boring. The good thing in this movie was the pretty Sheriff :) So I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So do not see this, instead you have to go out and rent the Starship Trojan, it's the same as 10.000 times better.
