What I can say about the American version is that Zen Zener Turner and Gina Rally have to be involved with the money for this frog. Yes, American Rip-Off was shown for almost two episodes in Australia but not rated; Perhaps by the strange audience, who would have been wondering how bad it would be. Answer: Delay, complete waste of time. Actors are relatively unknown and they do not easily take the nuances of Australian written scripts. Unfortunately for them they are submerged with this turkey. My suggestion is not made to the US viewers. <br /> <br /> Americans should give the best advice on finding DVDs of the original version of eBay, but be aware that some DVDs have been issued in a different 'zone format' in the US. Otherwise, some DVD players will run the disc from both / all zones.
