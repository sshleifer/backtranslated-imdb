One of the critics of how I reacted to this movie was happy: it was very good at 10 or 11 years of age. <br /> <br /> After watching it for more than 30 years, it's still ok, but it only tunes me gently. What was so funny to think was that it was just silly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Also, I'm not surprised at the age of 10, just like the fool. For example, Trinity walks in one scene and burns her revolver behind her and even kills the two without looking for them. In fact, after seeing his death he did not see, because he knew that he hit the mark. Um, yes, all right. In addition to <br /> <br />, many conversations are quite wooden sounds. Sorry, but after 35 years, it was not really good. <br /> <br /> Although I've been watching it for a long time, it's probably a good Terrence Hill film. My name will not be anyone.
