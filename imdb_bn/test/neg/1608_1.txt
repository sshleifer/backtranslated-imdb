It's too bad, I can not tear myself away. I asked myself, "Why?" "Why?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not worry about things like plots or characters. I'm annoyed, and very worried that CAG looks like a Richard Priory. In such a terrible movie, it seems to be the same to show Prior the same. But I can not pull myself away. This film is the first movie I've ever reviewed. That's how surprisingly bad and bizarre it is. It inspired me to join this site. I have 50 main characters to count. Perhaps if I was stoned, I could have followed it, but as it seems, I sometimes do not end a bad dream, where it was always 1988, and we were the world's greatest crocodiles.
