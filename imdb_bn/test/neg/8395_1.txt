This movie is the worst piece I ever saw. This is slow, low and boring plots. Cinematographers deserve to be shot. There was a strange comedy in different aspects, of which there was a gorgeous weird camp. Many smiles but many yawns raised. Do not watch with any place at any time. If you hate anyone, then they can buy or rent it. Large waste of time and money. Thank you Gass Van Sant ... If I do not want to see this movie, I can not think of saying anything else, it will want you to jump from a hill. I hope Goss and his friends will read this comment before it's too late and they will create a seagull or other disaster that is shot with camera phones.
