This movie was a complete disaster for me. To be visible, films must have a thing and it * mentions * some of the character's credibility ... unfortunately, here it is not. Main characters behave illogically most of the time and even if they have a reason for such behavior, it is not published by our directors. The character of Sophie Marsaur is especially annoying, creating everything throughout the movie, when someone can expect something more reasonable (for example, meeting her soil in the hospital) ... and why did she marry this man? (No, it is not a spoiler) At times the plot feels like some rubbish off soap opera, and when the actor's performance is not bad, this does not help much. After all, I could not find a way to connect to this movie. Although I did not try too much after the first hour, though. During filming, I have never left the movie, but at the moment I was the closest in my life.
