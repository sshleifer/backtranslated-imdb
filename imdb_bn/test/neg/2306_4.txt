Although the film was not something special, I was ready to comment at least one factor which was ruled by him - the main female actor Diane Canon. Despite the humorous story of the film and what he is going to do here, he works best in the film, feels incredibly more effective. His cruel view with gay photographer David Hemings was believed. Good work, Dian.
