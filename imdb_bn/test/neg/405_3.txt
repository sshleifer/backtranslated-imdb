36/100. It will not be confused with Arakanapoobiya civilization, the film is a very low budget and a cheap rip off of the film. So one of these is so bad, it actually has some entertainment value at that level. Many strangers (I think) have laugh out loud view. I did not expect much from the film, and I was actually worse than I had imagined it. <br /> <br /> This is a clich√© ridden and video mess directly expected. Fortunately, it's not very seriously. As acting, expected, there are not enough qualifications of Oscars. Special effects are poor, worse than worse than I would be. Badly edited and the score is intrusive.
