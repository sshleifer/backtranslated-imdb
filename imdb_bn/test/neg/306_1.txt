"Fat Girls" is one of the worst movies of indie gay genre. <br /> <br /> Predicity is committed: In an average-eye-catching teen tinker, the small TX city is trapped. Her only proprietor, Prafullaa, another village's HS Muphistas: Class 'Fat Girl', a gentleman of Cuban, and sensitive drama teacher. So far, interesting. According to the theory, this plot line has created a beautiful set of stories for a modern era with a luxury audience - thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and saw this adolescent's concern with their first hand, with the level of anti-self-pity humor . Unfortunately, instead of the dramatic drama, Ash Christian tried to weaken his autobiographical subject to the absurd and dark humorous death penalty. Unlike the results, derivative, a cast of two-dimensional characters that can not be indifferent to the viewer. Sabrina (Fink) is a Kosi-Goth bitter navel-gazer. He is such a coincidence, unsympathetic person; There is no doubt as to his friendless condition. Chemistry zero registration between her and Rodney (Christian). It may be poor casting, but this is because of a screenplay that is simply ineffective. As a result, someone becomes frustrated if there is such an existent bond, perhaps it can guarantee continuous consistency near the story. <br /> <br /> Subarin's new lover Rudy (D. Jace) and Rodney's mother Judy (Baker) have been stripped of dozens of the majority of the majority of the clayed stock carrier. Rudy is directly a horny elite migrant / Nerd encouraged directly from every "trick" teenager "comedy" created in the state of TV or film. Judy was born again with Jesus-words and big hair. When you think that Tommy Fay incident has been completed with death, Christianity has added a scene where Judy Mosk continues with her tears! Does anyone in the civilized world think that this tired old stereotype gog is interesting after seeing Ed Nugum for 20 years? <br /> <br /> Apart from unsuccessful attempts at Saradnik, there are many confusing stories incompatible. Rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" damaged. However, he managed to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts together with public school Jack / Hank, Ted (Miller). Although these liaisons are without emotional fulfillment, most gay teens (like working hard with their Temposteroon, just like their hetro brothers), instead of the more general option of this unintended reputation, it could be rather a brutal arrangement. <br /> <br /> Rodney Bobby (Bruening), an exotic replacement from England finds an object for her affection. Against all credible obstacles, this little Tx Hamlet can not only contain the child's land, but Gay easily to boot openly. Like Sabrina, Bobby has a lively, angry smart look and the visitors have left scratching heads as her magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> Many of his joy, Rodney was invited to his new Crash in the Gay Bar town, where Bobby claimed to be DJ. After the arrival, Rodney-Lloyd immediately became Rodney and went to the other area of ​​the bar to face quickly with a lovely young man. Rodney's feelings suddenly arise from her exclusive existence in a parallel city, because it is one of the ridiculously inappropriate plot elements. Are small like the city, do they have open students in high schools? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian mom? A gay teacher? And it has a gay bar downtown (patronage of attractive men, no less)? Obviously, the place is not so much water back. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, Tod's Stephen's "Sevenine Edge" covered almost the same material with more creative, honest, sensitive, and ridiculous movies.
