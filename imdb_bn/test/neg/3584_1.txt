Awful, terrifying! Awful, terrifying! Awful, terrifying! Outdated, predictable - and with all the usual suspects The Irish film industry should not be made properly. And with an aerospace coating added to the end bonuses. How to pass on the side of favor of an almost aggressive mediocrity of talent and originality is a sick example. Yes - baby sweet. Yes - it seems almost like a professionally accomplished. But this is the number of movies, direct deception and directors who clearly think of it as 'success' - a film that patronizes and despises the audience. It's extraordinary that the working title will pour Â£ 3m into this garbage. But then, they actually paid for love. Do not waste your money.
