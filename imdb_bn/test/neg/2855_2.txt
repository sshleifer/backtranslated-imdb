This movie is just plain stupid. It does not bother watching; Believe me, you're good. <br /> <br /> The plot is long and short: a defense attorney represents a person who killed his son and other children. While protecting him, he came across Pinchocho's wooden doll. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people. <br /> <br /> This movie came very slowly to only a weak end. The plot is very bad and the music score of Dennis Michael Tenny is kind. The story of Kevin S. Tenny is not only about pointless and no fearsome or intimidating. This is a lot of crying from the work of Demons and Witchboard Knight, which is in the vicinity but nothing to write about at home. His instructions are okay, but with the help of such a bad story, nobody can make the movie any better. At the conclusion: 2 out of 10, probably the most modest, most annoying movie I've seen all year.
