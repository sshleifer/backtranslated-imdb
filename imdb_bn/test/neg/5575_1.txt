This has to be the move step that I've ever seen !!!!! It was not just annoying, it was stupid to "mock me with a spoon". Where did the actor find the corner? Who has a special effect ... Maoko? For God I could create a better movie with my cell phone. And if it is not bad enough then you have an extra space at the end of the movie so we can see how foolish the real actors are. Who has ever made makeup for Alien ... to spend $ 5 in your local used apparel store and should say it a day. And in case of DVD, the film details behind the story should be shot KK PUHLEEZ !! It is described as what is 1/8%. This description is sucked on to buy, rent or pay the people only. It was no wonder that it was not a trailer .... ya would take them all away !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad actor ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake fire ... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) < br /> <br /> While watching this movie ... complete waste! (I should be sued for it while viewing it)
