I have seen both the version of MSST3 and the version of the unicode. I enjoy it rather No way, it was not that bad in a movie. It is sure to move a little slow from time to time. I like it <br /> <br /> As far as MST 3 goes, they only make movies that they can get right. Bad movies where they scattered all the movies, it was so easy for them to have fun. Take the SoulTaker for example. <br /> <br /> Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so vivid and annoying silly I could not help but smile. I could not take them seriously. Although it really made a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling with the script is a wonderful job. In today's theater 95% of waste is better than waste. His role played well. Not very impressive but just right. The camera really loved her in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whatever the movie, this movie is worth more than that. See the missing version if you see MST3K It deserves a lot.
