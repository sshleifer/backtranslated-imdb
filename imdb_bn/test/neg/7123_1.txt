The Gross 2 is a film that I wish for in English to have more synonyms for the word "terrible". Once a plot is completed with more holes than the trailer's net, this film fails to see even the most compelling movies for a fan of movies. Until I got out of entertaining entertainment of Â£ 5.70p, I was forced to stay in the movie, although I felt I would be there for a few years. Better movies can be made out of the first installment of the disaster, although I am not completely sure that it is not the result of such exercises. As expected, for this plot of a terrible example of washed celluloid, which passes without any resolution, producers release the option of 'The Grayge 3' on the public when the time comes that they still think of another pang as true for civilization Hate
