I have to agree with the previous critic. Although Christine Arson has done a great job to play her own daughter, I do not seriously think that the character she played was in Izabel. I have seen psychological interruptions due to sexual abuse, and made clear that they never abused or abused their parents. To clarify what the letter was saying, I had to look at some parts again, I have not yet made clear what happened, whether or not they have happened, whether it is real or not. I'm trying to find the "original" story to really compare, but I can not find anything about it online. <br /> <br /> It was not bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. Specially influential, the film was not bad for grade b, in most cases, and it was all valuable in the capture scene ... that is, if you do not have anything good to do. Hah hah
