What a shocker For beginners, I can not stand constant pitching and noise panning all the time. It does not make me afraid, afraid, or not sympathetic to the characters; It was just boring. The movement of the jerky camera was also annoying. The plot was pretty much the same as every other cheaper horror. There were some cruel attempts to give some depth to the letters, but it did not really work in the left intriguing. And then there's the end. I'm not really sure to confirm it yet. I think it was supposed to be clever clever, then run some light on the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> There were few small award winners / nominations in this case, so I will. It can not be very bad figured. I was roasted. If you see it, you should probably leave it in the shelf.
