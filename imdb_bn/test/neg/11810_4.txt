Ken Burns' "Baseball" is a decent documentary film ... it represents a clear source of the game, it is a great illustration of baseball's early years and heroes. This movie has a lot to do for a baseball fan ... which says that this movie has several defective flaws. <br /> <br /> For 18 hours, only 20 hours of people's attention. It is clear that Barnes expanded his film to fit the "non-inning" concept. It's not tough for even 18 hours ... the speed of each segment is slow, almost fun ... the music is always nostalgic and alert. Baseball is never exciting and fun? Why are each player and their achievement presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking about the head after talking, each pitch becomes a mental heartbeat, as a metaphor for civilian baseball, Baseball as America, the psychology of the baseball and theology ... is enough! These syrups are drivel, in Makkishi. Billy Crystal came here to sell us all. Kenny Burns Series used the National Anthem as the theme song and managed to play "Belmem to Tek Gag", so you can turn back many times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, who is not like open mind like today. You are not ashamed! He knows the baseball for thirty to thirty shares, but did not realize that they are different in America America! Barn O'Neal, the former Negro-League Player, and every part of the foot, falls in love with Drolls on the Helles, among which the adult O'Neal has a poetic effect on his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> "Baseball" as America promotes incognito, stupid, civil rights as wind up. It's clear that Barnes is not a baseball fan ... or he'll know we look at the sunny and happy games, not crying and sending soliloquies ... Are you listening, Mr. Barnes? Baseball has no tears.
