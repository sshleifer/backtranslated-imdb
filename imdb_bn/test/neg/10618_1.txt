I picked up this movie because it was like a beautiful flick and I've always been a fan of foreign movies. However, for anyone who likes movies, I was surprised that I hated this movie, hated, disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although it is published in Lima to reveal to young people, the lower class people and the other as soon as it succeeds, the letters are frustrating shallow and the audience sends the wind without any feeling for them. <br /> <br /> While the story is mainly moving around M, he rarely speaks, and his dialogue is <br /> <br /> *** Warning: some of the less spoilers *** <br /> Basically, the story M is going around a young man who is looking for a job, but about success (he gets a job twice, but he is not "for him", when you are poor, but your last option is to become a pikki ) Left. Some time is spent with his friends, the "funny" concept is about 14 years old rape, shred the pieces of shit to pieces for weed throwing and some other slightly annoying activities. <Br> <br /> By running a cocaine in Mackay, M's friends come together to cut the $ 25,000 piece into pieces to move to the United States. When the drugmaker gives them jobs, three friends are considered to be extremely laminated with the purchase of clothes in the background with some songs playing in our background. We tried them for 200 dollars in the store, trying different clothes like little girls, wearing hair, and then stopping to look like sticky gangsters (one character, Carlos, wearing sunglasses this night ... even at night). One day before they left, the leader of the group went to make a fool to talk to the drug lord M and his friend. They are grouped, they take a number of samples of medicines that are estimated to run, and break into old school, act as animals and destroy everything. <br /> <br /> M is trying to call his girlfriend, who hangs on her. Then the friends burned the stomach phone in the fire, which gave a bunch of kids and guns out some old people. M and Carlos's friend, who is in charge of drug-driving, drives his motorcycle and they want to stay with him now. Then he takes by himself, and gets that shot by the old man. The police shows up and arrests M and his friends (but not the man who shot the gun) and keeps a famous friend as a musician and feeds on credit. <br /> <br /> * *************************************** I have seen this movie for a second time, hoping to see some fine, redemption factor for it, but I did not do it. A 102-minute full waste. Although I'm certainly not going to give credit for being straightforward and moving away from annoying material, but the cast, acting, and overall aspects are still much more, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a movie that was conceived about this, instead of hiring God's City (Sied De Deuce). Avoid this trash at all costs! You've been warned !!
