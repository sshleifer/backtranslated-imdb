There are some of this stupid fighting scenes all the time. If I was scared of any war, I would cry because I see this movie because I do not remember being in Vietnam, because it is a bad representation of any experience of war. Although the army is carrying M16s, the film is nothing like VietNam. Viet Kong also looks like the old residual Japanese uniform from a WWII movie even in uniform. Setting maybe some crappy Hollywood back too many. The worst scene is fighting a US military soldier with "Martial Arts Hand", such as in a bad martial art film. After sending several enemy soldiers, he said, "Hey come here and jump some butt!" To a helicopter in the air. Then he was shot. This movie is trash.
