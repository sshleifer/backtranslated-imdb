This movie made me mad for the general truth that it was made because of Shepherd's homosexuality. Those who killed him are clearly misinformed. What happened to the poor people is really horrible and a tragedy. However, in Hollywood where four religious white children were executed, after killing their murderers together and two evil black men on one another, just two years ago? It works for political purposes only when celebrities only mug for the camera. Also, Laramie has been portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo-documentary, of course there must be no surprise because they have to be educated by the all-knowing and illuminated California people who are background hicks. Still, it is always a treat to see Laura Linney.
