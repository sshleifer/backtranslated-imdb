Regardless of the low budget scientist without any charm and appeal. Even the scene related to the fall of the asteroid was stolen from other movies with the same plot. It is a bad rip off of "Asteroid" (with Anabella Cyoura) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. It seems anxious to turn away from this vain and dull science-entry in Hoop. <br /> <br /> I can give it 2 (two). And do not say I am not a good man!
