Nine fools go to nine streets to escape and feel good for captive captives and movies. Especially because it is meant to be funny and I guess some weird ways heart-warming. The problem is, the film was rarely funny and often seemed fair and inappropriate. It seemed as if the joke or interesting scenes were resurfaced, but no one was reluctant to leave them - there was no salary. Also, the film was not only brainy and was a crime to travel around Japan, although they kept many criminals alive, but it is impossible to believe that they were not caught almost immediately - especially they continued to use the same stolen camper. For the last day. And as far as it is going on, I see guys on the road noticing the scene after the scene. Plus, do not believe, there is a scene where four people are raping the sheep! <br /> <br /> I really hate everyone in this movie. And it's embarrassing, because I like almost always Japanese movies - just such a poorly made and unintentional.
