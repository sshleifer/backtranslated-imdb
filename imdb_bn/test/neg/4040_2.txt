This is the same old shit which is inspired by amateur picers, who have no way of making any movie - perhaps it wants to make a movie straight from the video! <br /> <br /> Guess it's really my fault to spend money (one of the worst decisions I ever made). What a waste I usually like B movies, some of them are really quite good - but it's too ridiculous and fool too stupid. <br /> <br /> This junky makers should be left out of business, making movies that waste every time and money that are not worthy of the film! These so-called filmmakers have no talent! <br /> <br /> Stupid plot, awesome acting (especially drug towers - can you really find that sexy?), writing in the lam (if there was also script - Kinda looks as bull **** someone made up on the spot ) <br /> <br /> This movie is stunning about everything, all the good things are lacking. <br /> <br /> <br /> How much attention will be given to ensure that each frame of a film is far from any reasonable standard? I do not think that such a bad movie will be made deliberately, and it is unlikely that the worst fate can create these terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> However, spend this cost to avoid bombs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
