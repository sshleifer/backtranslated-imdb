On his carrier evening, Charles Branson has several directors, longtime J. Long-running partnership with Lee Thompson and Michael Winner created. He also made two films for one-time bond director Peter Hunt - the first of 1981's Best Actor Death Hunt, the second is this indifferent political sensation Thriller. If the truth is known then the murder is very neutral, and in the end you will find yourself with some more emotions and speed, for example the Willi conspiracy (for example, according to plot, this image is similar). Bronzance plays the role of her bodyguard J. Kilian, whose duty to protect Lara Rouse Craig (wife of Jill Ireland, Branson's wife), the wife of the President of America. Killian believes that Mrs. Craig has been targeted by the killers; He thinks he is a very protective, paranoid pathologist. Turns out - Wonder, surprise - that Killian was with the right and someone really was eliminating her. Their partnership can be run, operated by the killers. <br /> <br /> Everybody knows that the American president's wife is known as First Lady. For some reason, they named him "One Mother" in this movie! None of this can be guessed, but it totally indicates the stupidity of the film. Most of the film's performance is lazy, and the script takes a hack for a long time to go. I was labeled murder in a certain sequence, I thought it was supposed to be a "thriller". I want to say with some reservations that it has some thrill of valuable as a thriller.
