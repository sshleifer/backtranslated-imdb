I understand the painting and painting of such a variety of movies and I am a huge supporter of films with little dialogue, but this is absolutely terrible. I went to Scottish Highlands and the letter frustrated the letters found lack of Scottish pronunciation. This plot was strong enough for theory, but the lack of cheap set and single realistic characteristic prevents the film from being away from the ground. I think the use of silence to build the atmosphere works only when your actors can act like something that can appear somewhat without speech and this actor does not rush. If you want an uninterrupted movie that captures the present, try it (Le Dronier's Comat). There were some movies that I was not able to finish and it was one of them. Absolutely drill!
