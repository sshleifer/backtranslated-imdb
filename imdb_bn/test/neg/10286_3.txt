If you found an image of violent killings and violent police brutality, which is published in amateur low-entertainment painting, but you have to take surveillance. This image was junk for both mind and spirit. This is a "thriller" concept that is ridiculous; That tension and twists would be meant some kind of. The story is actually waiting for the "start" to finish. It is not weakened by the weak psychological violent criminals and people above all ends of life, a pride of the people. Imagine all violence in "Old Man for All Friend Man" without any backing or sympathetic characters. Thrill killers Amok Run Well played, mostly, but a pile of scripts. Do not disturb and do not bother your friends.
