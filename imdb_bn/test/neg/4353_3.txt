A dark film on the dark motion picture industry of the Hollywood film, The Big Shife, is as diverse as the drama as compared to the film. Along with a few short exposure scenes, this activity has played the role of Jack Palance of Hero Living Room. He is a film actor who wants to go out of the contract with his studio because the pictures he has kept lack quality quality. His again, again the wife is disturbed with the studio (Ida Lupino), not to mention her husband's philandering ways. Unfortunately for them, the head of the studio (Rod Steiger) is a real busy. There is a blackmail element to force a growingly harassed actress to sign the new contract. But it is only a matter of time when people push far away. <br /> <br /> This picture is not silent, I'm not a film. Rather, it is an exceptional theater's room-room. The plot reaches a snap speed and it is so complex and confusing that it is a violent helplessness of blocking blocking of static setting and tolerant scenes. The acting is extremely extremist, and intense veers in and out and out of histrionics and soft, but no less uncertain, soliloquies which are clearly meant to be brutal but especially come across as naughty twaddle, especially in the hands of the sad miscast Palance. Aldrich was probably going out for a stylized "something" here, but I was skeptical even knew what he was doing, and certainly never viewers. <br /> <br /> Here's the main lesson that movies and plays are very different medium. What works in a play probably can not even come across as remote or legitimate in the film. The result? A big waste of time. There's a little to enjoy here.
