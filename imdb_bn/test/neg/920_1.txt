This is absolutely terrible. It is everywhere and nowhere and there is no point. I did not understand what's good about Jeff Galeline or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is much more than this drill, she must have been involved with friends because there is no way to read this so-called "script" and any part of the thought, "Yes I want to do it!" In most movies I can find at least one or two things which are free or fun. This is ZERO that is there. It's too stupid. There is really no other word in this description. In most cases it can be seen that this film is perhaps the greatest amount of money waste to create the film. To avoid this at all costs, you will be happy.
