I do not leave an IMDB comment about the films but ... this picture was bad. very bad. I quickly proceeded through it, where I hope the performance has improved over the last scene, it will only continue with faster progress. Formula Plots - Once explicit killers were given exemption, there was only one left. And that was the first five minutes. Seeing the scene in the scene, I want to read the script beforehand because there was no surprise, there was no mystery. Tori character ... bad bad acting. The real waste of the DVD and the option to 'go to sleep on the bed' option if this is the only subject matter of television. If you look at this movie, you can realize yourself that you will not be able to get back the time you have lost.
