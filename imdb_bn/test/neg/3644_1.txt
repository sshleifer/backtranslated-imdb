I tried to like this show, I really have it, but I can not find why anyone likes it. The story line is weak, acting weak and incredible. Each cast member member seems to have been sorted out in the street at random. And I think the whole show is just a car to go to Jamie Lynn Spiers movies. As a daughter of every episode, she shows that every girl wants to be her best friend and every boy wants to date. She always feels like that anyone in perfect and real life. How can people make a Barbie doll that relates to a character? Jamie Lynn's performance is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have a lead role in a series. All the show's fans are young girls who do not know well. I think if my opinions are too strict, then you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that is not immediately directed towards a beach party - please take my opinion and look for something suitable to see.
