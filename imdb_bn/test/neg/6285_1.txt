The perfect 6-step recipe for the boring medium of road movies: <br /> <br /> 1. A burn-out, ex-ex-police with a bad attitude, yet a sensitive touch (pianist in the closet concert with a pet cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Bit-up Porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavy patchy leather jacket and a few "cool" retro gadgets of cowboy boots, including a hole in solos; <br /> <br /> 3 Mix in some "free-spirited" locations such as A conventional sea side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office; <br /> <br /> 4. Spell it with the "deep" social-romantic themes like the reinstatement-ex-wife, after the divorce - secretly-and-so-forgiving-waitress, a gambling-former-fellow-cop-only-one-of-one-that-really- -One-complete-quarrel and a good-friend-a-suitcase-full-invalid - $$$; <br /> 5. It should be "fast" for about 90 minutes to be bright, but not logical or internally functional performances, cheap tender moments and lazy advertising-cracks; <br /> <br />. Help it to sleep right away with a comfortable pillow it's all or something more interesting (do not worry: even yellow pages!).
