Some of the names are actor (Lance Henriksson, David Warner, Joe Dawn Baker), why did Jafri combs lead? Henriquesen was good for leadership, such as Warner Napster, Baker, or even others, in the movie like Charles Napier. Combs was miscast in this, and it did a poor job. Everything he did was fake or narrow. <br /> <br /> The script is poor. That is, if Lance Henriqueen (or another) had the main role, she might preserve the image (it has been removed from my "waste time" section), but it was still a bad movie. The screen game was completely lacking. The director should recognize this and help the movie along.
