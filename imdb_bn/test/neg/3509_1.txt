I've seen partly due to "good reviews" on Netflix, and I've read a valuable lesson from this. There is no lesson about racial diversity but ... what I have learned is, "Do not believe in reviews". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but those who really want to see this movie are going to be those who at least see it and are affected by it at least. For good reviews, I can remember that the only reason being that it is being reviewed by people who are not used to thinking or who have seen their first thought-provoking films, and in some ways Haggis has invented this concept. In fact, he originally created this film, which can be called "Racism for the Dummies", creating a potentially mentally twisted, apparently to give to those who think that the idea that they have discovered some fundamental truth before a film is not covered. It does not have the Jane and motorcycle maintenance industries ... for a vague community, a later school cut off the extra-damaged Ham-Fide pieces of bite size to make it easier to melt without being too self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> As they portray everyone as the worst possible extinction, only makes us happy that we are good people, because we do not recognize characters. Let's face it. A letter identifies these characters because they are all cardboard castouts and stereotypes (or predictive reverse-stereoeptips). It worked well (even if the dialogue is frustrating) and cleverly executed, then "Where's the cow?" Until you can say that the movie is rotating. The flaming car scene was as effective as most of the movies, but did not go anywhere until the end. <br /> <br /> The messages were very heavy elephants, and "behind the scenes" from Blobber, the creators were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to smile in this movie, even fun parts for time. I think it is not entertainment, like high school diversity lessons ... it is known as "blood on highway" in the description of racism. Although they are not for the "side-naked" shot of Jennifer Esposito, they can show it in high schools. <br /> <br /> Everyone in this movie is a quarrel and everyone learns a lesson (without Michael Pen, who plays the best role, but the most anticipated story). <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, bad writing and good actress .... An ugly cartoon created by Paul Haggis, which is something in the story 'without a brave stroke. Some handles ... painted with crayon. <br /> <br /> The crash is not a bit of a sad thing, which provokes emotion, but if you already know racism and bias then do not teach you anything. Bad things.
