It is hoped that this movie is so vague and unknown that Jupiter's most popular love falls in spite of the 80's B-movie queen Linda Blair's acting: It sucks! Trying "Chiling" heavily ?? Way too hard ?? While there may be a story with depth and real background, it should have been a light head and a grave-packed horror of frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something interesting or remarkable remotely happened. There is a lot of drill about krzinjics, which I learned in my physics class, research on products and their behavior at very low temperatures. So naturally, this film is deeply frozen when a dead body of people is studying the behavior of the bodies of humans. Not saying that it is very annoying, if two smoky night watchmen do not make decisions during electric power failure, it is a good idea to set metal-made cool cells out of the thunderstorm. Coolers hit lightly, obviously, and bodies defront instantly and a killer zombie comes to attack. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprising (for at least 80 attempts, at least) a cow-free horror film that does not even use up to one quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to build the atmosphere of mystery and generosity are impossible and I can not remember why Zambhi-attack was so bloody. Despite the low budget available, they could work well. Set piece, make-up effect and costume are unfortunate. For example, the laboratory looks like a suitable apartment flat, when zombies do not feel less sensitive with their green face and foil-wrap decorations. How Linda Blair still managed to get involved in such an embarrassing low budget horror flick is a complete mystery. He is attracted to sweetheart like Beebee B-movies.
