This picture is about complex friendships, romance and cheating between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> "Love Edge" to see the right time. However, I think this effort is too much, especially in terms of color tone. Most of the first half of the film is processed for a strong blue tune. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> There are three or four pictures of the same scene, such as Three Care Nightly Sunshine Face or Four Pairs Surgery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story unfolds all the way is not comical. Sienna Miller's troubled character is annoying. In fact all major characters are annoying and unlike. It is impossible to understand the Kaito Knightley's pronunciation, it also creates more obstacles to understand the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding "Love Edge", unless you only see movies praising big dress, beautiful set. And light
