I have seen this movie because I read every review that it was one of the most horrific films of the new millenium. I did not really understand what the hype was about. For one, the dialogue in this film was ridiculous ("Any strange thing is going on?" ... what ????). Stop playing off my socks. It could be because this script just gave something to work with actors ... the letters have two dimensional dimensions and I have not seen any disappointment about them. Another thing is that the movie is extremely annoying. Extremely Sure, there are some "holds" here and there, but for the 112-minute length of the film, it definitely does not use the time wisely. In most cases the film has been talked about, which had little to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am out of how the events that are happening in this film happen Also, most of the film is played in small vintet, which makes it hard to follow the story at once. And even the end does not start with me. Okay what happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credits to keep some awesome pictures across the whole picture. Scratch and other unsettling images have very awesome shots. If they are more reflected in these pictures and elaborate on them, it would make the movie even more powerful. But they did not do it, but made more detail on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, it was very neutral. Yes, this is a message movie. Okay, fun. I can only find the message of my review here: Finding a better way to spend your extra time than seeing it.
