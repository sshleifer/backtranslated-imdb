This is the first Chan film made by Monogram. What is the FOX standard and value to come down! I was surprised to see my first monogram after watching the great Fox movie. The moon is quietly uninspired with this annoying and wild music as walking across the road. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service instead of the Hululu Police Department. He assisted by Benson Fong who played Sona Tommy No. 3 for the first time. She has a daughter, acting by Iris Chan, Marian Kuan. Montmartre also made his debut as Birmingham Brown. In Washington, DC, he is in the next film, instead of Chan after Chan, a cab driver instead of Chaupura.
