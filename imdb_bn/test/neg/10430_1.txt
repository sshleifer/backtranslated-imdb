Looking at the release of the Blu-ray Brothers DVD, and the reference to "biological" biological biologist, my boyfriend and I was hungry for more information about John Belushi. I heard "wired" but I did not know much about it and found it behind the local rental store. I understand that Dan Oct was really p *** ed on this film and I think it was because it did not represent them in a good light. But there was nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is okay, until they move to the public's wheel morgue. When he wakes up at the Otps table and decides to run for it, then the film's complete stupidity starts. John has seen all of his life and he "Anne", who created a Puerto Rican cab driver with a mischievous humor, tried to criticize him and try to overcome him. <Br/> <br /> Two actors portraying John and Danake do not see anything near true distance to real actors (something related to this matter, Lorraine Michaels), making them hard to try hard to concentrate. How they were in real life ... but that iceberg's tip. <br /> <br /> I believe it was supposed to be an "artist" film - the public was tormented by constant drugs (ie, powder soaked in cocaine baths), it was difficult to follow it in such a way. Flashbacks are sticky, it makes it hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most shiny scenes were when John (literally) was forced to stroke his body and was suffering from pain while waiting for his heart to lose weight, say drug use, obesity, yes it was unusually big Do not keep it, we can get points without diverse illustrations. <br /> <br /> We rarely know other actors in the movie, (Where is Kerry Fischer? For example, they were incredibly closed and Jim was a great man to show Baluishi), It looks very cheap, (We think it's Graphics 80 It seems to have been in the late 70's or early 70's), if it seems to have been portrayed in almost a week and above all, John was not shown side. I felt I knew more about watching episodes of Night Live on Saturday. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The story For the person who was thought to be very ambitious about Nixon's remains, he might meet a personal author of Calibu National Enquirer and therefore lose interest in his work. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. If you want to see more of John, see his movies, watch Dan Acrood's clips about him or hope someone has a taste for making a film that goes along with "John Moon" which we finally had the hope. I think it was a "moral" film - you know, do not drag it, but I think the makers of this movie do not realize that because of his death many people (like Cary Fisher) stopped working,
