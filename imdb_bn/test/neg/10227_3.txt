It's one of the single, cliche-ridden movies I've ever seen. Even if you do not like the ancestors of this movie 'The Bad News Beers' and 'The Matte's Docks', they are bound to do better than this. At this moment the new teacher greetings his class and they say to him, "Do not disturb us, we are all losers," you can see twenty-two miles away for all the pictures. <br /> <br /> All the common suspects are here. Along with a lively teacher, we have a group that is very proud of parents of children (they are brats, yes, but not respectful), a slow-shrinking small town Sheriff that they like to suffer, winning rival parties, etc., advertising nausea. As the new teacher only shows Olivia de Abo any likabilty. I did not care much about Steve Gutenberg before and did not change his performance like Sheriff. J. Sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, does not leave him to work with him. Let's hope the author / director Holly Goldberg slogan will bring something better tomorrow.
