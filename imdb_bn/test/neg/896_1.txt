Sometimes it's fun to watch movies from your couch, but other times it's too scary for both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: One of the rare examples below from the last minute, when both your eyes and mind are requesting to stop the film with you. This final installment of the House Party series is the worst, not just the sequel, but Hollywood releases. It has become very "clear" that director Chris Stokes liked off the day with Felix Buller in an emotion. I am saying this because it has become very clear that there is no problem for Stokes making the bowler's originality in John Hughes's hands and creating a complete comedy. You think that with an "stolen" themes and images from an impressive movie, your own movie will be able to create at least one goggle or two. With House Part 4, Stokes proved that he did not have to handle a lesser Sigelier than the Huelvich film. From his misleading and quick story, the inability to understand his characters, and reusing moments in old / tired clips, all Stokes house parties hit a big nail in a coffin that holds movies. This reminds me of a student who forgets about his project within an hour and quickly slips the glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and strass together and presents it as "hipal alps crossing". It looks terrible and you're feeling embarrassed for the Creator. <br /> <br /> So, where is this picture first junked in the state of humor? Sincerely, I do not think most of the places let me talk that long, so instead I want to hit some big things that make me the toughest blow. To get started, I still do not shout off the bull's rip. Director Stokes House was ashamed to handle another sign of the party and agreed to bring a completely random formula (from a great movie) and see if he can put the original series elements in that formula. That was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this, eventually the audience gets confused. We think we are going one way, but instead we head one another. What you can see in House Party is exactly 4. At one point we tried to make a record deal even while trying to make John-John the "largest party of the decade" (OK, Kinda reminds me of the main house party), but then we can look at this random island where Uncle Charles flies Fear is frightened, grandmother becomes drunk, and with some stupid psychological fantasy killers. Again, we start somewhat strong, and last chaos. This is the confusion which I talk about. Director Stokes did not have the power to keep up with the ability to tell the story of humor. He would rather have angles, keep the jokes cheap and think that the audience is stupid than to resurrect the deadly series. Someone would think that when the director was handing over the filming of another house party film, he thought that he would revive it or bring it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to pay. <<br /> <br /> I understand that I am getting old gradually, as the day goes on fast, but I believe that I still keep my hand in the younger generation culture. I heard Rap and R & B rising, but the group "unreasonable" did not make it into my cassette deck or my cd player. Why? I do not think they have followed most, but apparently near director Chris Stokes, it will be beneficial for them to lead their new house party. Do not understand anybody going to red in any studio? Or how Stokes can be managed as an alternative to his comedic car repairer, a comic timing like a director does not throw himself as the only source of possible humor. I really miss Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd call any movie. Outside of a bandwidth band playing a limited role, I also thought that the rest of the film kept the life beyond this film only. Uncle Charles was boring while trying ludicrous. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for his scenery (both literally and figuratively) ?? Good ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, not for special guests Because some of the film may be proud, but no one was present at the "unforgettable" house party, and a possible dream that could possibly make a child or play a final look was also not present. The House Party 4 follows a predefined design, which eventually destroys this feature from the foundation. Can anyone explain to me why the "fleeing murderer who has been licensed taxicab driver" needed to use humor's routine? Stocks reached deep bottom of the barrel, and produced more mac than substance. At one time I can not accept the value of paying a price in this film. The House Party has buried the 4th series, and when I hear that there might be something else in the pipeline, I only realized Hollywig that the series was dead. Need to finish this series of Hollywood, forget past and move forward in the future. I think who is man? They will start from the right direction. <br /> <br /> Grade: * ***** Outside
