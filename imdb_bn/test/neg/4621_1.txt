I want to believe all the new horror films come from Japan are these days made for intense and delightful observers. <br /> <br /> Do not Spider Forests <br /> <br /> It's rare that I end up looking up to end some time and waste time, but Spider's Forest was an exception in this case. I was teed off too. The filmmaker was successful at one stage; I could not stop the film because I wanted to see the mystery touched by the story. I can not stop watching. Why am I so angry for the end of this picture ... they dragged me all the way with this pod for 2 hours with TiDium? Warning: Spider Forest is one of the Japanese "Ghost" stories, although you can not understand that it's going to be. <br /> <br /> I never want to see the Japanese ghost story. They are gorgeous and arise. "It's a ghost story" that has become like a big hole under which you move any and all unsafe plot drops in your story.
