Since Paul Craci was running the smallest race to take revenge on the real relatives, the third installment in the title "Death Wish" is coming back to New York to see the old war friends. He only came to Brooklyn completely transformed into a puperized gangland and that young man thugs to kill his friend and all other tenants in a ramshackle apartment building are continuously finding out to be awesome. An agreement with Kersey Local Police Commissioner, to win the heart of her blonde attorney, pushed away many villains with an impressive Wild Magnum gun and slowly inspired trains and refugees to stand up for themselves in New York. Okay, there is no other way to protect the "Death Wish" series after watching Part Three. The original 1974 is an excellent composition that was reflected on the social drama and as soon as it was a proper exploitation, the section was still a few freedom fighters and at least the event was associated with those events. At first. Number three often seems like a completely different franchise. Apparently, Cursee is not an architect, he has ten times more social and conversations and suddenly no one is against the police, even the fearsome activities? All these changes and other aspects make it more evident that Michael Wisneri and Charles Bonson have reduced their "Death Wish" success to a completely foolish and exploitative action series, resulting in physical progression with each episode, which becomes more and more explosive And the criminals that get nastier, sleazier, middle and much harder to kill However, the lady does not realize that the troubled spatula of violence actually creates the opposite effect, as this is very neutral and is much more annoying than before. I once got a brilliant review that is known as "Death Wish 3", as a pure definition of cinema masturbation. This description can not be more spot-on because the script itself is removed from a series of overwhelming execution. Especially for the final twenty minutes of gunfight, explosion and execution, homework is a complete "orgy" perception. Yeah Haaa! The series has a very interesting supporting cast, in which fatigue neighbors, including Martin Barsam ("Psycho", "12th Eddy Ad Man"), who are also the ad louter ("family plot", "longest yard"), and a little overwrought copper and even Alex Winter (from "Bill and Ted's extraordinary adventure!") As thugs as his first role.
