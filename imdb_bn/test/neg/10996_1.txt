Bad editing, bad production standards, bad continuity, impossible, bad conversations ... This movie is bad, bad, bad. However, if you want to make a movie fun (a LaMTS 3000), this is your movie. I do not recommend spending a lot of money on this, but if you look at this movie, make sure that it is with lots of diverse, similar friends.
