Another series! Why do they keep this in the world? It has always been the weakest 'franchise', yet it is still funding and rising series. ScarckroWWONE WILD - That's what I just saw so I could officially trash the whole series - but could bring back the bad guys who again pushed some college kids ... It's basically this. Acting (as usual), death scenes are not made out of pain, and are not fooled by the title, as this thing you can think of as many nudity. A couple beautiful cruel girls, but nothing too tightening the pants. Ask me to end my continuous humiliation (or review) in this movie: If I come across a Fraudi VS Screekro in the space or in the vault of the video store, then I would be completely surprised ...
