The sacred vacuum, where the beginning of the first drop (good start) Then it goes downhill. You've watched TV and you're switching between this teen soap opera, a Predator movie and some painful detective shows. The characters that are presented in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or more (teenage soap opera and actual alien story characters). <br /> <br /> Finally the producers were going out of the money fast and decided to finish the film, so they decided to throw a nook in the city. <br /> <br /> PS- Why so much pain with the camera? Can you say that's not going to zoom in? Seriously, filmmakers do a good job in the fight scene and do this where we see war.
