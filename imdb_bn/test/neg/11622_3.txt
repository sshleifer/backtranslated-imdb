Outline the plot of this movie is similar to the original. Someone is abducted, the princess is ineffective to save her, the oddtid swan, turtle / frog / papinin can first make it as a "bad" magician, and finally ... Anyway, there is nothing new here. With a lack of well-known voice talent exceptions. Sorry, neither Cleese nor Jean-Bob was thus a disapointment.
