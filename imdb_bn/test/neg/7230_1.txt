Oh wow, my name shares the name first name! Nick! If bad is not as bad as the first movie. Well, at least this film has a genuine octopus. An actual octopus that makes this film a good look. Well, I mean, "Longer" acting is quite dry and it's hard to sit on. Just to let you know, when this ninety minute movie ends, you are free from your couch, but you are able to breathe. Not only that, but you realize how foolish you are and then commit suicide, realize how horrible life is after seeing this movie. Indeed, it shows how frustrating today's horror movie is, such a lot of bad words are being realized and where there is a terrible master of horror? This film should have been a final stroke, so we can bring back the genre genre in a horror movie, which can actually create some modern horror films, biting the film.
