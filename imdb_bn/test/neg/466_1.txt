I'm going to see this in high hopes, I always enjoy the performance of Paul Bettany. I thought he was just as good as Darwin and considered the terrible thing he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book On The Origin Of Spasses The book is the most fragile, controversial and innovative publication sometimes, you will never feel it based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is almost nothing about the Beagle on the Galipos Islands in Darwin, for example, the most important thing in the story, as it came from Wildlife's investigation that he began to form the theory of evolution. <<br /> <br /> It's just a long, decent, domestic drama, Darwin is portrayed as her little curiosity, seeing her daughter's attitude throughout her and being given a cold shoulder by her emotionally bound wife. Jennifer Conley's Emma Darwin's screenplay is nothing but horrific and gives birth to a little relationship with the historical narratives of Emma. Activated by Jeremy Northam, may have an opportunity here to explain the creator of the Earth from Emma or local pastor (a dazzling and-you miss - it's a talented actor of a complete waste) Darwin's views act as a counterbalance, but it takes Not been done. <br /> <br /> The story paid more attention to the constant Macquisim's feelings on Darwin's grief for her daughter Annie, and Darwin was too much of time to wonder if her book was about to be written. Finally I was very annoyed it was hard to care about. <br /> <br /> Everyone had some time to make a movie about Picasso and was concentrating two hours to fight his girlfriend and he was not bothered to mention as an artist.
