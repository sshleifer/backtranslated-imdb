Oh, I smiled at the first couple of scenes. A 11-year-old gunman distributing drugs to his mother and his friends, and then killing a man, buying a car, robbery, robbery house, money from other children, buying house burns, shoot shoots, medicines. What a great comedy! But it was not intended to be a comedy. It was intended as a social drama. How could it be? The facts in this movie are weird and funny. All stereootipes characterize the 4-year-old comic-strip-inspired drawbacks. The dialog is ridiculous; People talk like morons This is a very stupid film. <br /> <br /> The first wrong scenes are very interesting, for all the wrong reasons. But the strange humorous generation goes on for a while, and after that the smile rarely comes; Then the spectators can not believe what they have seen and are surprised and upset by following (if they have at least half-brain cells). <br /> <br /> A small film, but it seems like eternity. The film is really a young reporter, a serious motivational effort to imitate more fascinating movies than "fan". There is such an air of soundness about everything; Children, adults, lack of credibility of both their actions and conversations. Through the film, the child matches his path though he has seen Jimmy Cagney films at least 100 times. And, generally enough, the child is not portrayed as a temple reservoir, but rather, it is misunderstood as a little artistic genius. But of course. Every young goon misunderstood - the society has made him worse. Poor children <br /> <br /> The picture is shameful; A collection of kids, sometimes lively clich√©s put together to make a movie of intelligence and lack of money. The intellectual level of the photo is zero.
