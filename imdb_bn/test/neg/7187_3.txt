There is not much to say about the end. One of the directors who had long hoped for a lot more than the good movie they made. It actually feels like what it does without care. Actors are doing their job (though Belmonds is far from amazing), but you will not only get the mandate. A word, it's annoying It's a lot of frustration because I've heard for a long time that this film can be considered as a response to all the major American blockbusters, which are considered as threatening to the exception of the French, who can not just acknowledge that they should go back to work. I tell you, if we respond well, boy, I'm going to be sad soon ...
