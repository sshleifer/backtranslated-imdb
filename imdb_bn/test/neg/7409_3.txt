It debuts as a director first and Jonas Quastel, it shows. It seems that he has spread in every kind of camera he learned in film school and wrote for writing some style in badly written script, which he wrote! In the film, Lance Henriquesen and another team found an aircraft in search of the Pacific Northwest, which has created a special instrument for a special device made by her daughter and her company, which she wants to recover. The first 5 minutes of the film is frustrating or out of focus or focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with these types of shots and they are very tedious increments. And there is a PV shot that is OK from "Wolffen" and "Predator". This shot is from Sasquatch's viewpoint (PV). The scene seems to be moving in the middle of the middle, very sticky at times. I have heard that this film has been shot for about 12 days and I think instead of "starting from one" instead of turning it back and restarting without editing the scene. And the rest of the picture fade-out from one scene to the other. They are like many scenes in which I have lost count. Now, naked scene with Andrea Roth. Not her You can easily see its body double. And you see a "B" movie of your choice when a hot chick in the middle of the Pacific Northwest decides to go to the nearest hot spring and take a bath! ******** Spirir Alert ******** <br /> <br /> <br /> And Saskat is not bad at all when you do not see him and it's just a vague image behind some trees . Or bushes but eventually your disappointment of course when you finally see him. First of all, he is not that tall. Playing the Sasquatch is the only stain on the body of the stain to his body. This is a partial case! And she's cold! I have heard that a make-up person dies while filming and probably explains why this dress looks fast. Some sound effects from Saskatcheck are nothing more than a known fox that we have heard in all other movies. I must admit that Henrikson is not bad. Yes, he is working on the bad stuff, but there is an interesting face that can actually grow in a few moments of the film. People say that a good Bigfoot film was not made but I do not agree. I have always said that animals from "Black Lake" are a good film and I highly recommend it. I'm a chic for Sassouach film but this one is just amateur.
