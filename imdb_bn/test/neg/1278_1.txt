Are you alive All right, I think I'm an intelligent, educated, generous, and indeed in movies. I really like and have a great sense of humor. I was under the impression this was a bleakly painful comedy. They used to get money to make them, gasoline is used, electricity is burnt, food is eaten, set ... why? I blame the current state of this movie and all the people associated with it should also be included in the public. We blame all and whatever is coming. It's not funny, not much, it seems everyone is annoying or annoying. Have no conversations, contact brief. As far as I am aware there is no plot. I actually lost some minutes and 89 minutes of my life. I will never get back that time. I have come up with the only message, probably life is not too much for a human life, very small life ... and then you die!
