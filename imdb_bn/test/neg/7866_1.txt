If this film is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, then he must create a new rating system, because it should not be qualified. The plot of the film, (if you can call it) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Belvedin), a former special operator agent, who was still working for America, was targeted by a brother killed. If it sounds like an interesting scene, please do not be fooled, because this film does not offer its activity-based story. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that seeing a performer, a bad actor who wants to send an actor $ 50, said that the actor must be frustrated for the money to perform such poor quality work. After seeing this picture, you can send $ 100 to Stephen Belvedin. <br /> <br /> Looks like Baldwin did not make any effort in his role in this film. In this film, Belldwin was forced to run his "Hanimbaab" (wife) across Los Angeles city to protect the murder of a person who was murdered earlier. However, Baldwin that appears across the picture can stop to maintain a little light. The image behind its backs has been successful in reducing any mystery. <br /> <br /> If you're a person who sees bad movies and laughs at their losses, then this picture is for you. However, if you are looking for a well-made action thriller, then instead of renting this movie it would be better to look elsewhere.
