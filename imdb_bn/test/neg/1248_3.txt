20 people rated this 10! That ballot box was a better stuff than a Christmas turkey! Not talking about Turkey, here is a successful tradition of the story that expects pig-pocket of the current poker eagle - successfully. Completely linear flashback is called, and when I say "spoken" I mean talking about death, this image is never enough when the words can be used to expose. <br /> <br /> The association with Stu Finger Card and her childhood hoodlums can be words like attractive movie material, but the manager manages to suck life out of them. I never felt the sympathy of Unjare at any time, a talent in the cards that thrown into each other's gambling, where he was not so skilled. Of course, through the mensage of these three musical instruments we walk through the inevitable spiral spiral, the loss of the family, and finally its release (sort). Big tide!
