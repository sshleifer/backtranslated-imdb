I honestly expect more from this movie. That may be the problem. There was not a time when the camera was still not there. Close up, shakes the camera, move matters, and I get a headache. The cut is so frequent and fast that the viewers often think of themselves / themselves as it happened. (See, Spirit Alert) and at the end of the film, when you hope to be happy through such a vague idea to understand what's going on, then they lose. It was a terrible movie for me, it crashed by an ADHD camera user, and a lack of meaningful plot.
