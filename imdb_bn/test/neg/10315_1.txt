This film stinks over limburger cheese! If you find it in a garage sale, then leave it! I love Sandra Bulk and still hate this movie ... Even though I'm ashamed, I have a copy and the studio has changed this cover that Sandra Bullock has in the same way. They run it from "A Sandra Bullock Movie". The whole film has only a small part of it and she works well with her, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well everyone has to start somewhere ...
