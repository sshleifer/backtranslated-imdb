The film is a great start with a cheat instruction film about Swedish housewives. Then we can get detailed remodeling with postcards, Scandinavia's many amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; A short jazz score, excellent cinematography and stylish title. There are also some interesting scandinavian competitions such as Van Tears 'Rigget'. Sorry, after setting up, "Kitchen Stories" broke in 9/11 like Twin Towers. Just look at those who try to portray this emotion, 'jealous'. The to-do conversation is filled with barbarous gay symbols: "I do not like white relatives, I like beer and wolf ... do you ever want beer beef?" Yann Tiersen cheesier at his worst <br /> <br /> It's a great pity director to put all this great set up effort, just screw it up after the ward.
