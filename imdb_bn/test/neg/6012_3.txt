Heinwei's Low Key Love Story Awesome Adaptation During World War I, Italian American soldier (Rock Hudson) fell in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy. What's wrong in this? Virtually everything. Hudson is way out of his depth here. She could not be a good actor but this movie. Jones is too old for his role (he's book 21 - here he is 38 ... and it shows!). Her acting wavered in overdone and underdone! They took a simple love story below and blew all out of the proportion. The film is fairly long (less than 150 minutes), padded in self-motivated and ridiculous degrees. It seems that producer David and Seljon thinks he has "gone with the wind" again. Some of the visible is really really stunning (even on a small TV screen) but there is not enough of a story to match the images. <br /> <br />! Ending where Jones is dead is sad but bad acting and overblown theater did not fight to laugh at me! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, actor-based De Sica has a real embarrassing degree. Overblown, self-motivated, badly thrown and slow. Very terrible It's (understandable) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You want to finally tune into some scenes but it is not really worth it. I give this a 3.
