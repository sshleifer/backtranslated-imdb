I feel sleepy after the first 20 minutes, thankfully I went out and saved my remaining brain, people should watch good movies and why they are not given a lot of ratings, not only due to film or special effects, just good acting and simple things are right , And most importantly - not LAME -, but I guess it was produced without the taste of this shape and "a bit Good movie "is not clear whether or not. For the low rating rating movies, please save high scores for 'one-time' in your lifetime movies. Keep in mind that using IMDB for many reliable reviews and opinions does not ruin the torch by sugar roots.
