Ugly, heartless Hollywood shit that expects nothing but ugly and heartlessness from his audience. Scenes without the Spacey really reveal the film terrible. But with Spacy, the scenes are so entertaining that you can finally hang on there. Yes, she can play this part in her sleep, but she does it well, she is so happy to see, so trustworthy and surprisingly psychological. Enjoy it for its performance, but do not expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evil of modern Hollywood, see Robert Allman's "Player". This sad pitbola is not a remote location in the same league.
