Spinner can have been a prolific fan of Ali Ji for the past four years. Cyber ​​Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very interesting and intelligent man and in my view, his best work is Borat, who is funny and fun as he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> However, in the movie. I am not bothered to pay money to see this money in the movie; I think because I did not expect much, but after renting DVD recently, I found the whole thing pretty sad. Mikey was one of the best parts of Ali and most of the script was a scrip and it was very dangerous. Hooking all car batteries together to blow safe - really !! ?? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The syrupy sweet end of the movie that I came to expect from a British movie. Where did all the good British movies go ideal? That said, Ali was a funny dog ​​like a dog in the bed and commented on "Shane Heaven - Repect" Ali's audience gave HM questions. So, in summary, I got Ali Ji and Borat fan and I enjoyed many interviews with her (especially with Anita Radek of the physical store) but the film has really flashed with me. If there is another movie, I hope it is much better than the old Tripe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
