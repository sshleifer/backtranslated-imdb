** Speaker ** With the title of the movie, the name of the killer fish is not twice, once you want to see their activities and almost everyone ate the character's cast. Instead you will have to wait until the movie ends to see the movie as a visit to Piranah. Yet you see the water bubbling and stirring around, because a poor person feels that he is eating whole and alive with the fish. <br /> <br /> This picture starts with "Piranha Piranah" showing the credits starts scary Parranha credits but **** Spirar **** is the only time in this movie that you never see killer fish or fish which you Piarana does not see that movie again. What you see is Venezuela travel and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River Basin Together with many beautiful and exciting photography, people and wildlife also take it. <br /> <br /> There are some stories with this type of white hawker, which is William Smith, which is playfully spoken in the local language called Piranha, is the title of the movie "Piranha Piranah" really meant? "Caribe Caribe"! Caribbean actor Legendary Hollywood Heels Engels Bike and almost all the hardest people played by William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, American tourists Jim Pendre and his sister Terry, Peter Bonna and Ahna Capri, and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, going to the forest in Venezuela, to meet Terry's pictures with return . Terry is terrified fearful because we learn that a young girl saw that her father was shot by a gun. Even when the six-foot-long Hirabac saw Rattlescake's attack, using art articles saved his life, Terry still belts him to keep the gun. He will not take with him what he promised him along with him. <br /> <br /> In a jungle rest or bar, in three Caribbean we saw the first monkey in the jungle in the movie. With the half-baked philosophy of his own forest knowledge and life and death, three welcomed him with expert skills to go deep into the local diamond mines in the Amazon basin. <Br /> <br /> Although somewhat strange at first, the man had so much in himself that he did not think that there were some people around him, Karbie attracted a scent and favorite man for a long time. And motorcycle race through stems and jungle friendly with art. Carib also shows Terry, who often threw his teeth at the time of the film, the shooting point of the shooting and the excellent point of shooting which he believed he would not really die, but after his death he would be part of it! Somewhat crazy but you have to accept this guy's imagination. <br /> <br /> It has been mostly in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe she can drink alcohol, Curie suddenly becomes insane and rapes Terry and is her hazardous brother and suffers to feed. He's deadly Paraneha. The hijacker tried to escape from the mad and was forced to fight with him. The industry is so badly beaten by the carnage of dirty war that it has become almost unconscious. Finally, when Caribou was killed in the end, Tori shot him to death, after seeing this crazy nuts, it was finally decided that guns are really necessary and very rare but should be used to kill life-saving events. <br /> <br /> Observer is valuable, only for observation, only for philosophy and nothing else. It is a shame that the film should be advertised as a killer fish, or piranha, a horror film when it was honest about itself, but with Smith it could be a low or low average wild adventure flick, it was created for African, Jungle No, Venezuela plays Tarzan
