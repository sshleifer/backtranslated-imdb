Whoever filled this stupid concept of acting and filmmaking on the face of this Himesh, which always hides under a cap, his face covers half his face? Just hope this is for the first and the last as well as for God! From As Salam Vaalakum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything to make his so-called singing talent aura, which is nothing but the unreasonable words of words in Tanhayya, which completely kills the beauty of these conditions, so the song used for love is usually used. Why not smile? Easy, because he does not use toothpaste! Now his friend, surrounded him everywhere, and the city's number one lawyer who tried to make himself a sexual intercourse and tried to tempt Himesh, he could meet with the well-educated German people, perhaps male lawyers curse their fate in this part of the world May be given, because rigorous, unnecessary lot to decide! Action scenes are so funny shots, such as a thief attacking event designer, riding in a car, etc. It seems very early to get rid of his daughter by marrying a wife and marrying his dad, he wanders. Most hypocrites, he praises HR for the distribution of love among the people of the world, as they were sweet, and behind him, these shows traded peacefully on the women, giving lectures to their daughter. When Himesh proved innocent, he again unknowingly pushed another person, as if it was a chair of musical instruments! I did not move away from the poor people, right? It looks like the role of Hayasica Rhea Roll is to check eye for her eyes! The role of a friend is well-off, who has played quite naturally, and for example, Sharman Joshi should be in good film. The child artist is sweet, but wasted in the short form of Trishu. It seems that young people of today's nuts have gone, because they love this type of song and musical hilarious, and like the Gospel with it, for example, if you sing azza once, the ghosts will come. This music is a strange taste, and rather fun. I wonder, such classical musicians like Gazzar, have chosen the people of Himself to provide music. There are stories of Panchanant, that a crow attached to a peacock so feather, beautiful appearance, and birds appeal; But feathers finally fall, and real dark cries are revealed! Hope hem would give a hint, and refrain from making nonsense, and wasted money by paying his small nose! His friend would tell him, how would you sing if you cut your nose? Thanks for showing Jim Himesh at a reasonable cost to rent the DVD! And who spelled wrong, you? The movie is an extra e, and no e love! Old pictures are also a famous number from Sholi, Mehboobba, who again screamed Mallick Sherwat, but with Hemes at this time, looking at him, and conveniently Rhea, his so-called true love and his new bride are not around! Now that is very clever, Himesh! This film has at least one thing that you do smartly for fair play in Sheraton. But he is not washing a little?
