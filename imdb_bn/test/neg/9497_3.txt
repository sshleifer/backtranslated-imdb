I love Ustinov's distinctive, literary description. And photography cool down. We have kept our 3.5-year-old movie that runs out of the room and outside. So for our first viewing, we only saw 1/3 of the film and were quite common. When we saw sitting for family time, we all entered into poor automobiles in violent and deadly situations. Through almost half the film, dead, bloody animal animals have a rack. Lots of blood, or just a little. Then in the end, there is a wild struggle with the dog, then the blood water cloud. If you think, G has given rating, you'll see that ... that they will die in animals. No They drag the dead body out of the water and clearly show it for several traumatic seconds. Personally, I love horror films as an adult, and fines with fierce films Al Scorsese, Crowneberg, Tarantino. Hack, I love wildly violent warfare royals. But those who are not kids' movies and are not advertising like themselves. If you are intentionally raising your kids for the rigorous realization of the lives of cute animals, then this is your movie for you. Although you are my wife and me, you may want to abandon your child's nightmare and avoid this one.
