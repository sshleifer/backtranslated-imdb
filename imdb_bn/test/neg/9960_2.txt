All right, this movie seems to have been well-covered by the previous opinion, but I would like to add some items. Crazy scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a harmful animal to make a man a barbarite. If we suspend our unbelief that is enough to buy, fine. But the animal in the cage is a quote. That would be a heckcoyote. In 1942 did the audience know the difference between a wolf and a quote? They're easy to say different. It's weak. Second, this movie was covered in third episode of MSST 3 (Comedy Channel). Joel and Bots took a number of episodes to reach the entire mountain, and they are still not too far. To add to the end, they added enough to this snooze, but it was not one of the best festivals. They did not even mention the glaring exclusion of an actual wolf, and that the joke was hanging just waiting for the smacked air.
