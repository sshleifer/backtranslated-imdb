Although it was a good story, I found it very unpleasant. The main thing is not to see child abuse, which is fun - a sordid subject. Adding a lot of immorality by a gd by a drunken abusive husband and a little child - and not less - and this film turned me so far as to see it again. <br /> <br /> There were also two short stories described here, other unexpected viewing experiences. The real life of the story sounds vivid, when some people flee to home-made aircrafts! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive, enjoyable part of this movie is seeing a nice, loving and sensitive relationship between two young brothers run by Eliass Wood and Joseph Mazello. Over the next few years, Jurassic Park, Shadolands, and The River Wild came to know later. A decade later the wood did not hit big, but he grew up in the Lord of the Ring Trilogy. As told by the two kids, and an incomplete Tom Hendes, I'm the only side of this picture.
