I am a person who does not sometimes watch animated movies, but I do exceptions for Thamblena and Swan Princess. With absolutely love in the first installment of the series, I bought it and sat down to see it with a very favorable mind, it was strong for love because I spent money by buying it. I finished the movie, and all the horses I can think of !!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I have tried very hard, it is very difficult. But I could not enjoy a second part of this shocking movie. The songs make me like tearing my ear off my head. The conversation was so long that I was hugging myself with frustration and irritation while opening my mouth. The villain was so happy and I felt myself dead to Derek and Oudet ... and I was in love with them from the first picture. <br /> <br /> I'm going to try to memorize this movie, because it destroyed almost the first one for me. There is a song in the movie where there is a series of first movie flashbacks. The differences between the two animations have become very clear, and I started provoking for the first and did not want to keep eyes in the third party. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself and please do not waste time.
