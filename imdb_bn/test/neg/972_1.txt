Every big name comes in time for the actor's career when he becomes sloppy and receives a project that does not touch his 1,000-foot pole in his golden days. Remember "taxi driver"? It was a fine film. I can hardly believe that the "actor" of Dot Nero is also the same actor. <br /> <br /> I would like to double look at "Time Chasar" rather than seeing this image again. If someone lets you see "showtime" or gives you free passes, or whatever, you can go as soon as possible.
