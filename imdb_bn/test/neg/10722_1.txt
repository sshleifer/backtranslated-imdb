The lower rating section of the film emphasizes the unemployment and the sufferings that we should suffer. Although it is good for this drama in the comedy, we know the pain that we need to focus on. As a result, the fun with Dick and Jane is not the appropriate title and I was just disappointed because I could not see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of the film of the same name, but it failed to be effective and the title was not suitable for the story line. However, if the film is repeated, the emphasis on "The Art of the Steel" and the slopstick comedy fraud will be more robust and stealing plans (stupidly) to make the film a big boost. Although, at the same time, the film must be shown at least accidentally by the CEO, so it will be easy for the responsible person to project the pain and release it. The film is facing a point of view and keeping in mind, a comedy can not work if the scene is not done properly. The Road Runner's Will E. is a skimming spouse. Quoets will be more fun than, with slopstick comedy. But in this case, instead of the capture of birds with complex compression theft would be very interesting here. I could make you many of these and keep them in the movie. But due to the wrong approach, the robbery section was limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the first 15 minute movie (during Jim Carrie's big rise), but to solve their problems, it should be more ridiculous than a comedy, that is a part that requires a major overhaul. It may be fun to face problems like John Travolta's civil action during the fall of the public. That movie was a serious but the problem they faced was somewhat ridiculous.
