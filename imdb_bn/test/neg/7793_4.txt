It seems to be one of Knell Cowar's less known movies, and why it is easy to understand. It's not a bad movie, but it's not so good about the face value. Nothing happens in the entire essence of the film, it's just a story of Chris and Leonardar's unfortunate storytelling and Barbara's reaction. The only thing that keeps the film interesting is that we already know that it will end badly for one reason or another, due to the first scene. Strangers, there are many perfect opportunities in the story of conflict, and none of them is still used. For example, when Barbara was disappointed with Leonardo, it was even more interesting and credible, but instead she had good positions throughout these two films. Barbera's idea of ​​betrayal with her friend was not fully investigated - she was not betraying her husband; She even encouraged to go on a holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries, his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who can be close friends of both Chris and Barber, are never forced to take sides. In fact, the team has moved away from the conflict by telling Chris that he and Barbara loved both of them very much. Despite the weird lack of contradiction, the biggest mistake in the film is that we are not concerned about whether Chris Lionora or Barbara ended up with. Both women's personality are not at all different from us, so we do not know which of the two is better suited to Chris, as well as Barber's license letter that he is taking care of the matter in some way. Moreover, I am surprised to see Chris and Leonarar's relationship a bit strange. I can ridiculously look at short periods that they fall for each other because it is very common in movies of this era, but still the relationship seems shallow. The character of the cover was very cruel and lazy to be in the subject of Leonorara's perspective. He reminds me of the "very important person" film, from the socially inactive genius Sir Innerwest, - I'm sure the two will also get along. Chris's coolness and intensity seem to disrespect his love for Leonor. I think the cover should be sitting outside of this one and a young person should share it - as I think the beauty of this young man was so intelligent, most of the heartless, molten middle-aged men. Despite all my criticism, the film still continues to be attractive - not just terrible. None of the characters that are specially enhanced give them a mysterious nature which is a bit playful. Astonished Heart is certainly worth watching, but it's a flawed piece of movies.
