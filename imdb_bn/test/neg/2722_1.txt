I was taking this movie hated by positive reviews and uncomfortable. It's not just haiki, manipulic and melodramatic. It's a shameful attack. The radio 'Gooding Junior character' is paraded around as a cute puppy animal, so beautiful like a puppy that you just want to take him home. 'This mentality is shameless; The radio is never treated like a human, but rather as a manipulating device to gain sympathy from the audience. Even the countless moments of the film are turning even more heads that hit the head / travel / crack / etc on the radio. At this moment in the slopstick comedy, the audience just became laughable because of humor, because 'the funny thing is because the radio has been damaged', it is shameful, now I do not think that the word mentally inactive is the word "cries" But this scene seems to be taking the picture, 'Radio is disturbed, but it's okay because he is beautiful and we like him.' Guding's screenplay seems to be even better than John's film's inspirational family drama. Unable to indulge in the insult to hurt the film, Debra Wingner does not play as a 'stereotyptical housewife' that is very reminiscent of her serious involvement, everyone is happy to see this movie. John Horner's score has always torn some void on a tiring movie. Ed Harris was content with a role that he could have slept, but he was driven to keep the audience's attention throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself as a decent man, then ignore this quote of a movie, read the book, but otherwise this terrible film avoids an interesting character in American history.
