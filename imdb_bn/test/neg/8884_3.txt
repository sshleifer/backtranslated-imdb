I was good at this movie different people here. Plus I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem and director Miles Forman. Yet after this movie I did not really have anything to praise about it. <br /> <br /> The first acting was very close. The performance was quite strong enough to feel casual by what really investigate what was. Javier Bardem gave a strong performance and was probably the only one as Spanish accent. It is very obvious why this was the only bird. Natalie Portman, who I think is very good and the upcoming actress does not feel sorry for torturing her. There was nothing complimentary about her performance as a movie. A very effective acting like Stellan Scorsgard, which I like, offers a boring performance like other actors. This movie was about him since he was acting in Goa. Yet he did not become what he wanted to do to make this movie better. What about Randi Quaid? You just have to make fun of me He is playing with King Carlos IV. He is cool in the joke, but he plays a king who just describes the whole film for you. <br /> <br /> Instructions in this movie were very awesome. When a movie is a mess it is generally responsible for two people for it: the director and the author. I feel Mills Forman really does not want to put Spanish accents on its actors. From here very little battle scenes they appear all horror. You also have to feel the shock of the investigation as a director. After this movie I felt that I am indifferent about the incident. To add it all he shot in the scene and confused the actor. <br /> <br /> The composition that Mills Farman did was worse than just guessing or perhaps worse than direction. The same treatment is available in Baram, where the character of Portman has been achieved, there was nothing memorable about the film. Another movie does not give you a sense of time, and at least it can be made for two by a quote. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie, I was just watching TV just thinking why I should care about this. I care and are very interested in history, but when such movies come in, it seems that the producers hide some good things that can be taken away from the movie. When the movies are bad, the film's many technical flaws are good. Like the pronunciation. I'm not sure if this film was good, but the lack of Spanish language insisted on emphasizing. <br /> <br /> The entire point of this review is not just to see it.
