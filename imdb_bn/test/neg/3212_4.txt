There are some scenes in this movie (like the first interview with Hero's first Super-Villains Sheryli Eaton) in which it breaks sexual tabs and its court (women want to rule the world by making slaves of men) in trial, but it does not dare. The result is a film with no sexuality and some violence. Despite the sticky plot, the film is not too bad until its climax, where its amateurity is widely performed (terrible editing, excessive use of stock footage). Only viewable as a Curio. (* 1/2)
