All right, I recently saw George Junkoos at least four different horror / suspense movies because I worked through my 50 collection of packs, and I had to say that the man had a limited range, but he was good for what he was. He was not Carlough, but the PRC was lucky. <br /> <br /> The poor man was stuck in a kind of back-film veto of horror films, and he was not good enough to take it to the next level of interest .... not with threads - he displayed under screen and under the direction and budget he Work That's the case here. <br /> <br /> This picture is mostly good, slow, stodgy, and unreasonable. The "heroine" seems to have been destroyed since the rental-central version of Judy Garland, "The hero" is soft like white rice, and the poor man playing the giant does not even find a good transformation scene. Her make-up effect is not all scary - she looks like a little bit of a farm hand, all the way. <br /> <br /> This is not total waste. Jacko looks good in the camera, holding down the scenes while giving some horribly influenced and compiled set speeches without losing spirits or flows. Some Moody B & W shots do not suck here and there completely. <br /> <br /> So everything ... This movie "Z" level actors paid their rent in another month to "C", and it sometimes does not go down to the standard quality hacked-out quality. Once you like George Zooko, once you see it, or just feel the need to watch every Wolfman-theme movie ever made.
