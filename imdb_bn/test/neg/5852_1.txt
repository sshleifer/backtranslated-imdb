I do not know whether I am wrong or no one is saying this movie is good, sincerely I want to express gratitude only to those who see it, hire it or even make it worse. That's really!). The trailer and very basic previews may seem funny in some ways but it's not funny, it might read in a series of your opinion smile-here scenes that tend to get that really bad joke Bad, very bad acting, tasteless scene, fat effect; <br /> <br /> The final comment was fun because of the original idea, but believe it really is far from me.
