I've always been a fan below, grabbed a lot of videos that I can find here a series of states. Chemistry between Rick and Aid is always gifted, and the combination of smart writing and complete stupid humor fails to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ade!), but with some perfect bright moments. Unfortunately, these sunny moments can explain how low-bright than the rest of the movie. Slopstick fun is closed, but eventually it becomes somewhat annoying, only adulterated sex jokes make things laughable. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie ('green' scenes, who saw it for you) I have probably seen the worst outcome in the last decade. Really tell me. It was repeated almost a hundred times, then a sudden ending which did not make any sense (which does not bother me) and was not funny (which did). <br /> <br /> I was frustrated by the movie I was collectively disappointed. I'll be stuck in a few brilliant moments, to remember what I can do ... but I have to warn you if you are going to pay extra for your NTSC conversion tapes from the local importer, do not do it. There are many good things to spend on your money.
