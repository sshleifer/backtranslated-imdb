<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I have never seen bad movies. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it matched "how bad film is finding" at badmovies.org, there is no real story, no movie is back, and I have never heard of it , Will be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (Spokler, but this movie does not matter so terrible: P) <br /> <br /> This is a real bad movie, coating 4 and the purpose of Jack Frost Fool, it's cheap And despite the efforts of the stupid joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" starts a lot like EveD, even the actor has the same look and the same style of dress. It does not achieve any speed against Evil Dead. It's pretty cool for a "slash" movie, in which 6 people die in 80 minutes, but they have spread so far that it quickly becomes annoying. <br /> <br /> The director hunted many animated shots, definitely go along with the entire "hunter" theme, but they do not make progress in the story and are quite annoying. Gore is terrible. All these additional shots were created for a script and lack of stories. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are shot in slow motion, but there is another way to add it to length. "Climax" is just a joke, it's hard to laugh at. The back of the box says, "The end will scoff at you suddenly." Yes, it will put you in jeopardy that anyone can "hit" the movie in such a bad "plot twist" and because you do not believe in paying for watching this shit. <br /> <br /> Also tagline "It is not human, and it has a fog!" One person dies with an ax in the whole movie and it is close screen. <br /> <br /> One of the 10 is true. I love to smile on bad movies, but it's so bad that it does not have camcillosity attributes. Night of a bad movie competes without real-life building Flickr: P.
