20 years ago Dr. Chopper (Yes, he is running a helicopter as well as man trimming) disappeared when his body was found in his clinic. As people have disappeared near Lake Tannoka (or some other) and the bodies / body parts of the body are found everywhere. Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and they have been accepted from non-residents, such as lesbians couples and 5 surrogate girls in their initiation (you get the picture) travel with Tanoka Lake. When a group decides to go to camping, they are confronted with a doctor ... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste some time then this is the right choice. Acting girls have changed from middle to bottom to really bad with tripping and falling for all reason all the time. Every opportunity to show the skin is taken, but without actually showing anything. For the same special effects that are suppressed, each corner is represented in a corner so that you do not see it, but many parts of the film sink into blood (perhaps how sad they are). The plot is quite faulty and the dialog is rather sad. Only when I laughed. Chopper said: "Howdy!" When trying to be scary If you do not have a hack'n'lash freak do not see this one. Even then I would suggest you see something good.
