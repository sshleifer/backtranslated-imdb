I am reviewing this film from the point of view of the monkey film because it is the founding father of the monkey movie club in my region (it includes apps / chips and orangutan). It's about the whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for the monkeys that they can do, the evils, Shengings, Hygienes, solve human problems and teach us about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. The little poor boy wants money for whatever he wants. Fortunately, there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) who have large amount of dumb bursts or dogs (Duenche Chapman) blood flow. The boy tries to catch the monkey, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local miracle, flirts with the girl's age twice and teaches the animal way to tackle bullies that anyone shows a shotgun near him. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> There is so much focus on the boy that the chimps are not eligible for the screen time only. Chips are not gifted as chips (s) of legendary orangutanans who play Jack Tristi's Jack or Dustin or Claude (1 or 2). Do not watch this movie to find the next big thing in this chip chip. Chip has some sweet flips film which is more of a hit. The houses of the poor families have an epic scene of shrimp and destroy all the works they have done. Critical monkeys enthusiasts will only want to rent the film for this scene. <br /> <br /> Therefore, serious monkey films are not enthusiastic to stop this movie. I will not recommend this movie to the family because it encourages children's rebellion against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for the loving monkeys loving adults and well-supervised children.
