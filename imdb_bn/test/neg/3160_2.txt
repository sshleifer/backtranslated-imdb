Spheeris punks used this documentary to push a stereotype. This document is favorable and directed, not intended. Interviews can be used to take the spoken words of outside interviews in the context of cutting techniques that jump to the interview. When you watch the movie, the sticking ideas that comes from punks interviews are they pretty stupid. Band members and other punks may be less intelligent and unable to explain their motives or to give detailed or consistent answers or even replies. I am very doubtful that some of the interviewers knew that what Spirits have created or watched would allow the final product to be included in the project. This image keeps punks in a bad light by feeling them intelligent and simple-minded. Spirits' film should not be taken as a representation of LA Punk scene. You want to see a good punk documentary watch "The mind of another state" featuring youth brigades and social distortion.
