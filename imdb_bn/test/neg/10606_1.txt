As a fan of the series, I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should not be made. Why the series is called a rimak when there are only three main characters in the same match. Pet character in this series was not like a little girl portrayed in the movie. Apart from music, the only good thing in this movie and Claire Dances was quite beautiful. What is that dance scene with ??? The only reason I did not walk through this movie was because it was so bad that it was fun. That was probably the plan! The cheap 60's TV show is better than the 90's $ 20 million film. El Mariachi just spends $ 7,000 and this is a better movie. It does not waste your money even when it comes out of the tape, it is not even worth the rental.
