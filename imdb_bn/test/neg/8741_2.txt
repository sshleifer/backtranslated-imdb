I started watching this movie on TV. A few weeks ago, but giving up after the first 10 minutes or so. Initially, the person in the witness protection project located in isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his external guards, and then inside the house, asks the guards that he can make a telephone call - just can not find the line. After a short time, shortly after the murder of the witnesses, Roy Skaidar became one of the murderers and correctly witnessed and sentenced his wife to death - on which the character of the Ray Square character favors the kitchen wall telephone, dialing a number and then speaking : It is done !!!! It was for me!
