It was just that the editor and the photographer were only 40 minutes running time. It is supposed to be a Chinese movie remix, which is a lot more likely than this trash. It is clear that some intelligent Hollywood suits or writers have decided that Mano will be a man, man against humans, instead of allowing the story to play with the personality of characters made in the first 40 minutes. At this moment in the movie, the characters do not behave like regular people and even not like their own personality. It makes a little sense. Why this film flopped it quite clear. It's just not trustworthy and it's very bad - it's starting with a promise. Do not be fooled.
