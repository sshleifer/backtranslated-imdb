What a great documentary survey, how wonderful these actors have done and how it is difficult to make a negative statement here after all these abuses. I did not like the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, without drugs, sex, sex , Sex, gender seems to rule their world. I guess the director looks like a madman suddenly.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I'm surprised these people have taken this story. And above all: Who care? <br /> <br /> The technical components have not satisfied me either. The word is poor, so edit and "direction" is missing. Actor must be fine, but guess what! It's their job! Their work is done! No actors have done a decent job if you need to jump off your seat. If a bus driver comes home safely, you should thank him? I see it <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all these things I could not write anything. B movie charm? Camp fun? Nudity? I do not know.
