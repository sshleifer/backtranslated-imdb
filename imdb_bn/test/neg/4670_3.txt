I think that due to cast, subject and director, I am going to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Like taking my seat step by step in the theater, I was a resident schoolgirl like me. Expectation for the opening scene <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated with opening and felt that I was really going to love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movie and give away the view that something may be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give something really important, but it can be seen as such, so it's alert. <br /> <br /> The spellar can be included below, be careful. <br /> <br /> I think that the first scene really hit me as a ridiculous Russian Space Station scene. I want to tell the truth, supply the fuel to the shuttle without any previous warnings, and then only showing the station so fragile that a common minor mistake could explode the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It is possible, it felt to be the way above me. I'm not sure if this is the case or it is similar to the Chess acting, the stereotype of Russian technology, or the Campi's attitude of the scene. <br /> <br /> It has become worse after me because we tolerate 2 hours of constant high explosion in space ... You know, that place is not a word because it is a vacuum. <br /> <br /> The grace of the coup was for me, honestly, the gun scene. (spoiler chances) - Before the film, we used to see that when Bruce Willis saw the separation of the separation of their land vehicles (their that they would reach there and they would use the drive to help drill), they used to say that they did. He has broken pieces and complained because there is a lot of heavy on it and it is not necessary to do that. So, when we are moving into the asteroids, we see they have decided to add a huge gunning like a gun in the car ... You know, the honorable NASA rental is a heavy weapon in the space mission, but you know, Alien or something <br /> <br /> Explosive 2 hours, refueling the shameless Russian space station scene, Chess love scene at the end, Bruce Willis character is nothing more than most of his other past characters, but Steve Buscemi is going crazy and places all the shooting places in the gun and destroying the vehicle / Damage, causing me to throw the whole thing at the top. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meter movie, see the deeper effect, if you want a fun place movie with extraordinary special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter, avoid this flash.
