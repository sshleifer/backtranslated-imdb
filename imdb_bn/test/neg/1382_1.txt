All right, I want to be suspicious. I saw his show. <br /> <br /> This is not funny to me. I was thinking of all "strange" and there was a lot of yelling. I do not think even crack a smile. The only thing for some humor was her Angelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston Bit. I think you can get dumber by minutes to see it. <br /> <br /> Also, "White asked?" Section? "A gay dude?" Asked / Black Man is a ripoff? From the show of Chapel? Is not it obvious? But when Chappell did this, he revealed the ignorance of the matter. Like Borat But what's up with random white people picking and yelling at them stuffing? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I heard some "joke" somewhere else ... It seems that he has 'plazed' bits and pieces. Some "loudly" <br /> <br /> However, it was not funny. Seriously Do not waste your time even
