I rent this whole piece of cat $ 5 dollars. The most awkward lead character I have ever seen The film has filled up any clay fills that are not the only OUNCE of the original. Generally sexually depicted by helpless foreigners, all the boys were like 'grandfather' grandmother like Frookake, 'very proud of taking advice'. The idea and the death were really calm, but once the giant was released they once lost all novelty. (Refer to SPOILER at the end) Even though nothing is really revealed to others, the biggest cop-out of the end you've ever seen is Before that I predicted everything, in which to die and how to. Lack of dialogue, and that's until there is a understatement. Most are just random yelling, thoughtful staring, and chunky sentences. Actor only Allah is a miracle! I do not want to talk about this movie anymore, it makes me angry. When I was thinking, the director also saw it. <br /> <br /> (Giant Alert !!!! 5 Dollars!) The giant is just a bunch of "evolved" ants that they now need, so that they roam, (which does not give any evolutionary advantage and that it was available No one was available, though the movie was working as a working person.) This movie has ruined me. The main stupid mother is an ants (a big blob thing) that destroys all the other charts. Beautiful cliche eh? He wues up almost to the fact that he has a sudden mental attachment in the motherland that win over him. Give me a break.
