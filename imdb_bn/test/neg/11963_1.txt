So I and my friends are enjoying our local movie rental shop and trying to find something to go along with the Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind, so why not take the third schedule of the Scarecrow series !!! Remember that this is not only Scarecrow three; This, Scarecrow: has become wild. Now we both saw the first two scarecrows so we felt the obligation to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we look at a cover of Kem Shamrak ("the world's most dangerous man"). Apparently, he used the movie as a "lead actor" in the market. However, he has at least screen time for any member of the credit group. Next we aim a picture of a very interesting and very gently clad woman on the ground in the middle of the cover. I can assure you that he is not in the movie ... during the rental time we thought that this horror is going on "going towards flood". In the background we noticed a large carnival on an island in the ocean. I can assure you that there is not even a Carnival movie ... all. Look back at me and my friend should have known something was up there. I really mean, someone puts a carnival on an island Now the real movie. We started when a young man entered inside inside a diamond field. Do not ask me how they were involved, but when Brandon Lee wakes up from the dead in Kroto It's just that stupid. But the defense of the scarecrow, he "has gone wild". Anyhoo, scarecrow, who now lives vicariously through the young man, who takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who made his mistake. Yes, in the Scarecrow world, the beaches are easily located in the same common neighborhood as cornfields. To make a long story short, the scarecrow scarecrow is a slashing signal that killed those who stand in its way without any warning without the fulfillment of the scarecrow's trademark. It is impossible to believe it because the face of Scarco's cloth is clearly closed. There are some tracking shots that will keep the grave after grabs and we are among the worst third installments in a series. In addition to the good third matrix. Joel Siegel will say, "This SquareCro is very bad."
