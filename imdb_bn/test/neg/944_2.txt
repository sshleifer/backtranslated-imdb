Actually, Justin Long is increasingly becoming popular, I do not understand. He was also the best agent of Hollywood, or recently sold his soul to Satan. She is almost intolerable to watch the screen, she has no cracked little, and terrible comedic timing. The only film he enjoyed for the way he enjoyed it, is waiting for him ... and this is the only reason I worked in a restaurant. But I have no hesitation. In addition to its terrible leadership, this movie has other debit loads. I understand that this is supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean that it completely insults our intelligence and writing is so incredibly hackneyed that it is invasive. Lewis Black's extraordinary talent also gets ruined here, because when he is illiterate, he becomes the most liberal, which does not allow PG-13 ratings. The only bright spot in the movie Jonah Hill (who will be known to the latest superb fans, because of the amount of interim weight). His one liners were fun on the occasion, but of course this was not enough to be anywhere near the bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better but not the one) then you may enjoy it, but I can not recommend it anymore.
