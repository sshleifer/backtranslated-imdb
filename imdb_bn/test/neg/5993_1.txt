Animals? Yes, this movie and its movie has grown. If the enemies are forced to see it forever, then the hell would seem even more dangerous. Before dedicating six college students to the hospital, to save money and to finish the death of an ancient monster, five claims should be claimed that it "came from the shadowy world"! In addition to major logic and logical problems (plus seems to be incomplete), this disaster is widely edited, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalters) and directed, and makeup FX is almost incomplete. It's significantly smaller than the claim (in only 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. From the full moon production of executive producer Charles Band, I saw it as the worst movie and that boy was BAD! Remember, I was not bothered about a review, but it has received unusually good reviews here and I had a modified opinion order. Proceed with caution!
