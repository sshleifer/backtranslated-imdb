79 'before the airport this movie was rather good. Their excellent special effects, all stars were cast and played well. This movie has destroyed the franchisee, and there are many reasons for this. Wow lets talk about special effects !!!! They were awesome, what was thinking about the director I know it's only 1979, but other very good effects such as Star Wars (1977), and Muncher (1979) see movies. I like the concept of Concord and it may be the best airport movie, but they do a lot with it. How Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) hit the Concorde and the cockpit came out of the window to prevent the erosion of the missile missile. He's also doing 90 degree dives and loops. This fetched away completely, and the unreal WOW !!!!!! Believe me that these special effects do not help in this scene and really out of the poor ... they almost look like a cartoon and thus the whole movie !!! !!! Finally let me talk about my opinion is very poorly played very poorly .... This movie, especially George Kennedy is a major problem .. which I really liked as an actor, but did not cut this movie. The full guilt director has to go, who has done very poor editing, and really hacked the airport franchisee. The worst concomer is not used today, it was an amazing event in the Air Tour ...
