Elderbish Gilchill was a big disappointment for me. I respected how great it was, how important it was. It just did not hit me. It was a dim-witted storyline, as well as some moronic and sadistic American American characters which were severely offensive by today's standards. D. D. Griffith's films have depth and solidarity, it feels more like a formula-seamless program picture. <br /> <br /> I saw Lilian Gish and Mother Marsh in the role of a nation's former birth, as well as some staging battle scenes were quite good. According to the future Griffith Cameraman, Carlson Brown, the spectators are standing in their seats and scales and roam the horse in the end. I did not feel anything. And save me, I lve watching Griffith's initial work in biography. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this picture is that it has lots of touch with Gryffith for all its flaws. He handled his main actors well, the scene where Indians encircled the cabin, it is memorable in the memory of a nation's birth, this is the longest film that will send shock wave for more than a few years throughout America.
