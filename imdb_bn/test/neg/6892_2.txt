I must admit, I have seen that many thriller movies out, it will be the worst one. I shocked to discover this piece of work was a 1.5 million budget. When it started, I thought that the opening sequence was good, there was a fair standard for such a film, but anyway it is quite good. But with the lack of the speed of film progress, I began to feel very uncomfortable, each order took time within hours. The reason for this may be that the film has already torn me in tears, confusing flashbacks and bad temperament, sometimes with nothing but radical complaints. Well ... after all these scenes are felt like a lifetime, we finally reached big finals ... all the songs, the lack of imagination, can be a good movie, the dancing show that can completely destroy it. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I found this movie guessable and tiring, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than the person I personally dislike, but if you have to spend a few hours and you see such a thriller Do not want even distant fears, this is the movie for you.
