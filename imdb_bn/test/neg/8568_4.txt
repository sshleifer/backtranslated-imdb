I'm a huge horror fan, especially Spanish horror. There was so much potential to be good in this film. It's a wonderful idea, a vigilant ghost salt, which has come out of the mind of most of Jaju Bellungoro. Both visual and sound effects were very good. But everything is shamefully damaged by bad aspects, horror casting and painful (exposition, exposition!) Scripts. very bad. Maybe you have to write Bellungoro and write yourself a remix ... <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why it should have been spoken in English, why English could not speak English in English? , They make it very bad to only make their performance more fake) If you look at contemporary Spanish horror movies like El Orphanoteau or Rick, the performance is fully protected with this stylish ghost story - and it is a realistic, real person, like someone like us, because it's the only way horrible to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, La Monja failed everything.
