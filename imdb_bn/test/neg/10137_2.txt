My parents can enjoy this show, but I can not find humor at this. Being so impregnated by the Captain of a Haiti school football team is so much fun about a health care doctor in her hygiene assistant and impregnating the oldest girl? Absolutely nothing! This is a shock for me which sometimes people think of humor. Blaming the show like "The Dating Game" and "The New Moon Game", which brought the issue of sex in front of the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still no excuse for that content that went into this series. It's nothing like family-based days of "I Lucy" almost five decades ago. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I absolutely dislike the character of Kaira, the daughter of Reva Heart. She is best described as a ditsy and nasty teenager! Interesting, if I'm acting actress in Cairo, wonder! Scarlett Pomers, acting like that away in real life Blackhead, former husband, dentist, playing Christopher Rich, is not very good. Barbara Jean, Melissa Peterman, acting herself, is addicted! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Anything else that disturbs me, so decided to set series in the series where Dingbat-of-a-series maker Alison M. Gibson, I live in. 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McIntyre, not from this state, he is Oklahoma! Why did one season or more time they decided to make concise music sound like a pig snorting? What does that mean I can say where we've heard this baritone playing with drums with drums, but tunes are largely stupid!
