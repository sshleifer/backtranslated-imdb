I bought it because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Kerry was in it and it was a friend of mine and how bad could it be for $ 1.99? Then I read some comments here in the movie and started to get excited - perhaps it was a lost gem, every one of those horrific little B-movies forgot, but it was worthy of being resurrected. Wrong! I'm not sure that anyone else could appreciate this item from some quarters here, but I saw it that I've ever seen the most tedious and gradually filled with bathos. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's hockey Texas Accession (directly from the part of Georgia, Texas, I guess). It's just stupid. None of the movies behaves like the real man. Nobody. And no one can do something credible or interesting. It's not even a clich√©-festival. It's just 80-minute going by some frame. Even Harry Kerry, Maria Ospensky and C. Nobody could make Smith bitter. Now that's incredible.
