The only reason to buy a DVD is to satisfy my curiosity, while leasing (Kim Basingay) hold Joe Kakar's music: You can leave your hat! That was the best part of the whole film. Because the scene was not good; Just songs I'm not saying it was not a bad movie very bad. Frustrating so! <br /> <br /> Especially when men and women can expand on sexuality. Instead of spreading the dangerous side of passion, passion and cruelty, and the heels of where it could move towards it, drags vaguely from one concept to the other. For example, when John (played Rouge) was able to leave him at the top of the Big Wheel, then Lease (Kim Basinge) surprisingly made fun of the zombie feeling of a joke with a sense of humor, but he was less engaged in sexual intercourse with him. Willing lease; And like a reader it has been mentioned that a woman has to enjoy the dangerous side to enjoy sex. This "dangerous" side is not sufficiently absorbed in the film and one sees the anti-climax feeling from the scene that it can all go wrong. The theme of slavery often creates a look, but only takes it to a corner of danger and then everything is good. The film sends the message that this kind of "foreplay" is ok! The film creates a point about the problems of slavery and creates a point due to the sadly confusing confusion, but it will create a good moral point. Instead, the film oddly fed the king to the king with a "painful" scene and blinded others. In a movie that might be good, it flat on its face because it does not extend and extends the film that is trying to connect to the movie; Thus for me it is not a plot nor a theme is just a mix of ideas.
