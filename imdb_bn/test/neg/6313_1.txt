This movie easily falls into the funny section, if it is not actually humiliating. What do I think the filmmaker and studio option would think of this universe? From the beginning to the end we bombed Quirir's habit and ridiculous facial expression, "Tearing a loose cannon" worked a little thick. My other picking point with the movie was the lack of realistic storytelling that will increase you to connect with a character. I think Luis is playing at a bar before he grows up there, at the top of it, there is only a part of every citizen in the city that is just totally weird times. Lewis then started to begin the presentation of "the whole of the shaking" and everyone immediately forgot their differences and began to dance abominable so that it is the most common thing in the world. Such scenery, many of which have, have led me to a real laugh with lack of any character in it. So one of these films is not worth to filmmakers and their actors for anyone who is not interested in making decisions for one hour and one and a half hours.
