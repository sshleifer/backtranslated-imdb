Monday, October 2, 2006 So I always stay with my dad. We order some Japanese take-out, stop the lamp and push the game. I'm an enthusiastic fan of horror movies. However, this October CAVA released on DVD was certainly a landing. It seems committed to all the standards of a horror movie machine: Starting with an antigonic character, no sex scenes can be dropped and all known pre-speech (when they surprise you unexpectedly, it turns out to be a stupid friend). Then finally when it came down to the utmost satisfaction, I was ready for some real raging action. Director, I was afraid to admit. Of course, you have to complete 81 minutes with people walking behind the 10 feet wide space. Some college bound "cavers" still get together for another cave dive when it all starts. They all feel like the cave experience, very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience. At this time they were brought back, some boring photographer was blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the full dangers of the cave diving. As they come down heavily as "hell pot", they soon understand that they are not alone on the death penalty. If you waste enough time not to pay attention to my advice and do not waste your time, I would kindly leave a wounder. Although the atmosphere and background music were pounded; And when many of the moments and assertions were confirmed, the moment some real hijacking came to meet, it was like an obsessive observer without a full frontal. The camera work was intended dark and sketchy. I guess the director used it for effectiveness. The thing that I liked most about the movie was the running characters. They deserve the Acadamy Prize for touching the bickering scene. When I finally "got it", I poked a tear ... a tear for joy! You want dry awful, soft porn, and you hate Braveheart. Then this is the right movie for your next Saturday night.
