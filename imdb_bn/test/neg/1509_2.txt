Really terrible nonsensical trash. Without a one-hour running time, this movie is a mistake. Gore FX defy gravity and logic. There are no scares. Acting lazy, with everyone present to read their lines. An amazing incident happened that is simply silly, where we find that the events we saw have not happened. I finally hate the police! They do not have anything interesting but pad this thing with long drawn shot (like setting up makeup or talking about it forever). Will they have to find a movie for an hour? Ridiculous The story itself is fantastic freakin 'thin I think this is just a variation of the movie Arriel Flowers Day, if I remember that movie properly, and that film is not the biggest one. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have been a good shot. There is nothing very bad that is very exciting.
