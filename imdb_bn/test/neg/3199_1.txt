Perhaps the greatest waste of 100 years old celluloid. It does not only suffer from painful (and widely expected) discrete scripts, but it is clearly a carbon copy of Alien 2. Within five minutes I accurately predicted who will die and who does not (and by any order). Special effects are ridiculous; There is a scene in which a crew member is stuck (incredibly) a pair of teddy bears with two wrists, and ironic humor is wrong and terrible. To see this movie there is a better way to do it with VCR remote than to use it.
