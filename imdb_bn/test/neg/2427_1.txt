Well, from the perspective of Americans, I guess there is not much to know about rugby. It's a great movie for them. Firstly its heart, good morals, good trainers try to change the bad boy. Where we live from rugby is a game of numbers, it's a way of life, it's just a great game and congratulations to the winners as heroes, though America is for their baseball / basketball stars. It really knows very little about budget or cheap director or actor Rugby, and I am not sure that even before acting in the movie, I am not sure that Ragbi did not even know about my whole life. . To me it was a terrible movie briefly. If you look at it and think it was cool, please take time to go online and probably Google "All Blacks" it is the National Team of New Zealand and who has been famous for Hooka. Believe me, they will look like the girls in Highland Boys.
