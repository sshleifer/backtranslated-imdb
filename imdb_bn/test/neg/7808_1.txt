This image has caused me so much anger that due to my stupidity I felt the need to create an account on IMDb for sharing your opinions. I like Ashton Kutcher "love a lot" and because of this I still wanted to see this picture despite having 4.2 ratings. It's too high. I believe that an actor (none of them) will judge the script and will not agree to participate in low production / quality now. It's very frustrating. The theme of the house is better used in "Diss Biggles: Male Gigolo". Things which can not be understood here: Everyone is a handful, the owner of the house leaves his precious pets with someone who does not know anything about care. Second, no one is allowed to enter the house, but the house fails to follow these simple rules. Do not lock the door?! And so ..
