How nice. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the most terrible and shameful first sex movie. But I have forgotten that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, well-known German film producer Bird Ichinger succeeded in creating a worse shit. Heart jams are fools, not trustworthy and predictable, and most not funny. This is almost a tragedy that many children in Germany (and, panic, Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Shane is very talented, not a girlfriend at the age of 19, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke tries hard to believe us that he does not know anything about sex, but that does not help. Al-Bundi sees and takes him very seriously. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Perling and Jurijen are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. Still, their performance is relatively 'best' and 'funny'. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
