The title directs viewers to believe that it is probably better to see under a fun movie and influence, but it is not good. A 15-minute sequence with Jack Black is nicely stored in this movie while playing a song and venturing through the witch while Tripping on Acid. Every actor in this movie is going to do something good, except for the main girls, I did not think of any movie before, where I saw them before. I hate to make movies but I do not hate to find something suitable in movies. The film was sad, not very funny and was such a potential with its awesome cast. It could be nice to be re-written and written on it. If you want good movies to see the stone, see grandmother or boy, or half baked or dazed and confused, but this is not seen in a movie.
