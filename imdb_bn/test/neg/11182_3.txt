The last stand beside the pure theater was great, because the review and soundtrack are very entertaining, but one of the best accounts of this war is that until the longer or shiny, the more historically broad. <br /> <br /> A small description about the abuse of the word "hypnani" for the Greek haploty shield and the mis-governance of different names and words, has really eaten me. My guess would be, because "The last stand of 300" was preceded by the release of "300" theater, because the history channel tried to travel only to the movie promotional quotes. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for potentially accurate images of all the potentially possible cases, you would want better luck elsewhere.
