Star Packer is one of the 152,000,000 Westerners John Wayne played in the 1930s. Well, the number was used a bit more, but it seemed like many people. Because these B-movies were created secondhand, or less in the theater, with very little budget for features. Most BSs were quite cheap and tend to cut corners to keep costs down and no exceptions to Star Packer. In order to save costs, accessory music is not used, the running time is kept in an hour, writing often gets derivative and the actors are mostly less talented - and Wayne himself was away from the family name at this time. Some of these wine features are quite good, others, like it, are viewable but more stupid and incompatible. I've enjoyed this image and most of the other, but perhaps it's because I pushed a lot of BSK. <br /> <br /> Wayne Star as Yen Traveler - A US Marshal is investigating the smuggling of the local gang's action to the local out and stealing from the platform. This is strange, because apparently it was in or near modern times, as they used telephone and modern machine guns - which you do not expect to find in the Old West. Such acharyism is actually quite popular in B Westerns - such as gene atri movies (for example) a lot with them. Wayne's Sidekick is starring Yak - Stuntman and the real life friend of Yakima Cantt. <br /> <br /> Bad guy is an unknown figure known as "shadow" and he provides his instructions with a black screen. That hides his face! It sounds like a movie serial - kids love children love kids but grow up because they are so stupid and Bluffeld or Dr. Like Evil! The problem is, if you listen to his voice and pay attention to it, at the beginning of the film it becomes clear that this "shadow" is George Hays. Now speaking to Heace, this same guy who was later known as Gabby Hayes in the films, but here and here he saw some of the earlier films of Wayne and did nothing like Gabby. In Star Packer, he was well dressed, clear and clean-shave - imagine! In real life, it was obviously more George Hays - though I suspected that he was evil! Now you can tell from the last paragraph that there is no mystery in this picture. You have played (passable and nothing more) and left with stunts - which was actually quite amazing. Another amazing stunts have arisen after the rise - as men are going from horses to horses and some great war scenes - everything is done by the cant and his friends. Cantt was often twice as John Wayne in the film - and this has gone for decades. But some stunt problems, it seems that filmmakers have actually done some horses to get the "Suddenly Horse" bits seen in movies. Until 1940, filmmakers often tear off the thin metal wire and run the horses across it! In this process, the legs of the horse are broken and the horses are euthanized later! The worst example of this is Jeff James - where many horses were brutally killed - led by the American Human Association that the representative of the organization depends on film shoots that animals do not hurt production. So, since about 1940, this little waiver film. Star Packer was well-prepared before the waiver and I did not see how these horses made without killing these horses. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a poor plot, sometimes poor performance and incredible cruel attitude towards the horse. I'm not the heart of any bleeding, but only a poor old animal can not understand this negligence.
