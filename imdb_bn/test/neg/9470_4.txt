Tele savalas hams it up as the Mexican revolutionary (although he is a martinet met by Chuck Connors) yet famous historical figure in this jokey is boring pastiche on life and time. A previous effort, Villa RIDES! (1968), with the role of Eul Brenner and co-actor Robert Mitchuck, took these events more calmly and on a larger scale. Thus, in spite of his ideology, Pancha Villa is a very common European initiative and a prominent person in it; The end result is often stupid rather than funny - although in a few moments, especially a set of pieces of work and a rebellious scene inside a church, some give light pleasure. Oh, and Savalas gets the last title too!
