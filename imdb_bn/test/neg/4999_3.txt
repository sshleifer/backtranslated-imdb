Okay - I gave it "3" because they probably did not have any money to make this film, but I could be able to get a "2.3" rating here. I'm actually helping to raise this rating, even though it's been annoying for the past one and a half hour. I will be saving "1's" and "2's" for the punk high budget piece. At least "Rise of the Audid" manufacturers did not waste so much money. They led me to waste 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This film is very clutrophobic for me. The whole movie takes place in the same building, dark rooms and hallways. With such a setting, more action or character should have been developed, but there are many nonsense. I do not know any letters There is a schoolgirl and a goose chick but we do not find much more about them No character really seems to be a favorite. <br /> <br /> Great movie made in the zero budget. No scary special effects There is no doubt. Truly everything interesting here, folks. I admit I downloaded this from the net. It was free but I'm throwing it. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the creators of the picture. Good luck next time. It's more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
