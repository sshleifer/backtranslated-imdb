Guha Doverer, or The Blood Matar, or whatever it is called, in one word: VILE! I saw it at MST and I just did not laugh at the wonderful running commentary, but it was displayed to create uninterrupted movies. Sunglasses, tires track and ather have any hang gliders? Then they picked up a few shots from another movie, where Iglesia Dare points out as Tom Sero. To demonstrate how cheap this movie is, see the scene that will fight the invisible Terrorists at Atar and Thong. Or even better, that must dress up the attire that is dressed as a monster hose! And what credit would that scene just do with the movie?
