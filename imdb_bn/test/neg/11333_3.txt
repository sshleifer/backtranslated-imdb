I do not understand why any sub-parameter manager will allow such drill to be inserted like celluloid. This movie was made at least twice, which was even better ("Here Jordanian arrives" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). For skating fans only, there is some excellent ice skating done with a professional cast of the savings factor skaters, but it does not happen only. The earliest thing to see the good skating of the audience is when the groom takes on the character of Lipinski's character for a moment early. Others like Nancy Curling and Elvis Stojco are hiding in the background and do not sketch an image. There is no real emotion shown, and there is no reason to protect this movie for TV actually produced. My suggestion: original rent.
