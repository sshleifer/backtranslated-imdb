Every time I have seen this movie, I have the same idea: some of these are so wonderful / stupid that they crack me, they are not deliberate, and they have many; The rest is just plain bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead received credits to get worse than its own expense because its purpose was - it was stupid and silent because what Sam Raimi tried to do was successful. The filmmakers have been so sadly unsuccessful as the film is not excuse, it is stupid and sticky. The shit result can be shocking and penetrating at the top of the performance of shit, it is shameful that the lowest rating of any movie can be 'horrible'. This movie has the same effect as listening to the Billy Madison article - "Everyone in this room is now figuring out this." I should be able to give something around this movie A-5.
