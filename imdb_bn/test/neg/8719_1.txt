If you do not read the classic science fiction novel based on this short series, it may actually be good. Unfortunately, if you're a fan of the book, you probably will not be able to see the first or two hours. The picture has been taken out of all the political conspiracy, the most important scenes of the book have been found, the letters have been completely changed, and the words from the wrong characters face them. The novel Paul Ateredies, where there was a young man with incredible political expertise and worked in the world, had a bigger understanding, in this film he was frustrated and frustrated. Avoid all costs to this movie.
