The tagline of the film is "You think who you know, you have no idea." I reject the proposed idea that I have no idea who I am and no idea that this film tells me who the people really are. If people are really like this in real life, then people, we are drunk. <br /> <br /> A bizarre movie that I went to late and has gone unexpectedly. A movie that has become so popular in the direction of being the Race Film of All Time, that it can see the tools that can be used by a movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this way, the gun, which worries the girl about buying her father, will find her way in the second half of the story. Making Hollywood a 'real' conversation of rules - an idea that changes in every decade. How is this 'real conversation' less cheesy than Kevin Smith's original dialogue ten years ago? We firmly established the laws of the Hollywood State, and the process is increasing, the camera has gone closer to the face - this film mainly we can see shame, humiliation and primitive realism of characters. String increased, frame rate decreased, and breaking our heart means <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am against El. My own bias, which I accept freely, so I will not say to fight against this ancestor that it is the natural situation saved from the position, rather perhaps from the writer and the director. The author, Paul Haggis, already showed a million dollar baby's taste for the spine on humanity, there was at least one director who summarized the best of script ideas to understand how to compose a film's perspective. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hand in the camera, it has become clear that he does not know how to write the real, natural human drama, how he or she does not even know it directly. Paul Haggis came from TV's Land, we will not forget: Low Hope Land <br /> <br /> Everything is similar to a TV-movie, presented with a simple, simple mind - Hughes drills in between us and again, the surfaces that people feel terrible, are hidden secrets. This is a wonderful idea, but they have presented Hamstiftley that the whole mix of bad / good groups has a amateur feel. The film has traditionally broken into Magnolia and other earlier films. The edit can be as general and popular "cinematic" - if there is a dramatic movement, such as opening a door or driving past cars in the subject and camera, editors use the extreme movement that cuts them present in a more dynamic quality. The problem is that the thing is out of the running drive, there is a very small idea behind the idea and the plot - everything is kept by the book. The dolls of displaying these hateful ethnic powders and judicial systems are not conducted suddenly, even the curtains are reduced and raised with incomplete. <br /> <br /> The film tries hard to present the reality, but there is no talent. Some of the actors are good, some actors are bad, and all the performance get muddied together, the film is brought down by low, less aesthetic. We have cinematography, which is technically clear: We can see the scene, there is a clear understanding of what is happening to us. However, not only is the movie unselected, but it is incredible camera-work and structure that believes that it is actually inspired. The fruit is a little stylistic crop which recognizes one, but does not actually add anything to plays or stones. For example - and it's an explosive - just like a father holds his dead child (my father also wanted to shoot, I did not want to find out), the camera looked at his face and gave us the famous Vertigo track / zoom. Vertigo Shots !!! At the moment the movie became violent and I had to leave. I had to leave because I was so bad. Because I was in the middle of the crowd theater and I wanted to reveal to the audience that I was sick of the empty Hollywood industry, which was in the word and anger, still not understood (Bird's own language). I hate this extraordinary bad stuff like Shakespeare reference waste.
