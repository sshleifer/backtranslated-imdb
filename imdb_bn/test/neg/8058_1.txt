This movie was incredibly bad ... it is important but violence seems to be very fake and predictable. As everything has been shown to you so there is nothing left to imagine. Plot ... what plots? There really is no! Penceing is incredibly slow (despite the random activity of violence) and screenwriting must be written by killing the killer for fun by the 12 year olds. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of Gore (annoying and annoying) but it was a terrible movie. It was supposed to be banned from existence. Avoid this one like the plague. 10 out of 1
