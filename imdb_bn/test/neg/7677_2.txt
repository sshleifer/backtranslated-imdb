All airports are stinkers of the movie, but all of these are their biggest turkeys. The formula was different for that because it took two devastating flights and many plots on the ground, while other movies focused only on one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. Concurred stunts are laughable, though special effects are unlikely to expect me for a movie that was created in 1979. George Kennedy's sexist remarks are uncomfortable and loyal to Paris's prostitution totally unnecessary (and blur me). Poor Mirth Raya was played in a role where she did nothing without her bowel relieving over-over in the congress's bathroom. This film is not a big star compared to previous movies, it gives you another reason to look at.
