I did not see a movie that made me bother a lot. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I would say that the plot line is awful. I saw half of it so I did not have the patience to visit it, but it was enough for me. Characters are not very inspired. Just awesome boring This movie is about a cruel person, who is trying to make a command with the daughter of his tyrannical wife. Finally when she was directed to talk to her, she told her to go home at night to see her father's kite, and she thought that she invited him to accompany a group and stay at her house at 6 o'clock. She must take care of that ape and that she has to find out that she is very frustrated and she has a boyfriend. After leaving his home after leaving his father's house, after being cared for by the home and his favorite bird, there is no secretory, a satirical boy and all kinds of interesting things to be seen. But finally he hooked up with his boss's daughter. Trust me in this movie !!!!!!!!!!!
