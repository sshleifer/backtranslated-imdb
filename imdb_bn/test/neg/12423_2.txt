Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> To remember that such films have been made, and perhaps enjoying thousands of them in drive-through, it really makes the mind buggle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The hero is very wet you footsteps his squishy damp in each scene You can listen. My Lord, but he is one of the deadliest, horror actors a complete killer that appears in this Turkish. MST 3 does not like it. For example, around the center of the stock car driver (who is so incapable, you really believe that the actor is running the car) he gives up and "get involved in the wrong crowd" oh! Scary stuff. However, the wrong crowd is equivalent to the Three Stuggs Bike and becomes a "hand-me-round" whore of a bik dog. For example, how much of this whole thing is the writer, the authors obviously bring their brain with a terrific name for the biking gang - if four people are called gangs, that is, they are called gangs. The result? Gang is called Devil's Angels! I do not kid you <br /> <br /> With such humorous scenes, such horror acts and dialogues, wonderful beer and chip films. But otherwise it's just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> I said. Once, this may be considered to be good. But today is the day you laugh (and crunch) with each minute. Without a good smile to avoid it. And you're more than half-drunk!
