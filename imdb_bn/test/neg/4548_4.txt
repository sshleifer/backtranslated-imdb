The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to create an awful fan excited about this movie. And once you see the cover art of a frozen jumbo that comes out of their quartzial chamber, you think you were in the movie B-Movie Horain. At least in the way I came to this photo. But boy, I was for a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I love b-movies Nothing creates more than a hungry small film about my day zombies, monsters, killers, that sort of thing. But there was a lack of saying that this movie was an understatement. This movie was pure trash. You might think that jabby can look a bit like the box's cover-art key, but instead, you will find actors with clearly sold masks in a Halloween display counter. In addition, the script is beyond unfortunate. Our main character, Joseph, is suffering from the loss of his wife and son, and Blair's passion for the warm heartwarming love of Maria. You never see any sadness or discomfort in Yusuf's character. Instead, we are the chief of the Cryogenic Labs. A person named Miller, interested in examining the bodies and their organs. There is no emotion or anything that convinces you that you will be surprised at any person in this movie. <br /> <br /> All and all, very frustrating. There was all the ingredients to make a great awesome movie. You were your zombies, your decent actors, and your story. But lack of good writing and slight direction if it is objectionable on the streets. Overall, 10 out of 4
