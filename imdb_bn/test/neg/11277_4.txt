An earlier IMDB critic said that 'Robert Romance' is a German musician 'Rip Off' (this is the name of another critics), a 'm-by day, you by night'. Apparently the critics are not aware that both of these films borrowed their capital from 'Box and Cox' in 1847 by an English play written by John Madison Morton. This game relates to two traders, who hire the same house from a dishonest landlord, every man believes himself the sole tenant. Because two men have different working schedules, Ruja was not directly discovered. This game was once popular in Britain that 'box and cox' has become a common word for a format, in which two people have voluntarily shared the accommodation for the sole person. <br /> <br /> The invention of the left romance (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who certainly develop romance. Naturally, in these Convalesy films, people and gulls hate each other until they hate each other. Oh boy <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was played by Landlord George Sidney, a character actor who played a special role in running Jewish stereotypes, which was sympathetic. George Sydney was never boring as Harry Greene (Jewish equivalents of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidney's imagery of Jewish character is still too much and embarrassed to see. <br /> <br /> The single most notable thing about Robert Romance is, 'This is my first Hollywood movie about Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this movie, Landlord Iqam (Sydney) discovered that his teenage son Julius was involved in shining gloves on the walls. Eckham and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish. In 1933, none of the Hitler was planning to make plans for the Jews of Europe ... Still, it is wonderful to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager, who thinks the sorcerer is a joke. His parents are very madly mad by this display of Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> An embarrassing aspect of Hollywood's history is running a business with Hollywood's third verdict. At the end of 1932, Hollywood's leading women were registered as medical 'Aryans' so that their films could be distributed to Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men are documented as 'Aryans and uncircumcised'. Apart from Twenty-Century Century-Fox, in addition to Darryl Janak, all executive executives of this Hollywood studio were involved in this policy ... but apparently there was no objection to trading with Hitler. I am surprised that the movie 'Raftar Romance' has been shown to be inappropriate in the film, because this sequence gave the film Vertabotan in Germany and Austria. (Perhaps the scene was spent for the liberation war: It is not for the film's plot.) Also there is nothing remarkable in the film. Robert Benchley made his usual strange curiosity: I never understood the appeal of this person. I'll rate 4 out of 10 'romance romances'.
