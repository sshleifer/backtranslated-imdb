First thing first, I'm by watching any picky movie. I'm not one of those people who find movies to drop flaws and criticism, I like the others. I would basically look at any kind of movie, no one seems bad about it (sometimes a movie is created so awesome and written that it calls a shocked humor which I came out). All that aside, Lil Pump was simply benevolent. I saw this on TV and I do not know what I'm looking at. It was a very badly written and fat adult movie, and had too much sex, stupid and sworn from a children's movie, in fact, I suspect that even the kids would be surprised at it. Humor (quite bright and even calling it) was so motivating and camping, I could not see that with half a heart somebody might find it interesting. The only thing to laugh at me was how people like Barney Mack and Ludikas could hit their name and time so that some of them are disappointed. The character of the Luder was so cheap to smile, which rarely misses its goal. The plot did not give any idea in any way, the story could be the worst sequence of events kept on screen. I could continue, but I would like to see what people would think about my reaction, I could stand before that I started discussing the sad scenes. I just want to say that there is nothing to be surprised about the time the writers are trying to spend on kneeling. <br /> <br /> J.
