If this is the best commander Hamilton movie, I have no interest in anyone else. <br /> <br /> One of his greatest instruments of film actor is his eyes, but when Peter wants to show great passion in Stormer, he closes it. In five or six seconds, we appreciate his glance when his feelings are unknown behind them. Lauci acting tactics <br /> <br /> Stormer also sometimes fires guns, turns his head away and closes his eyes. Look carefully James Bond can easily rest with this kind of competition. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting support from other actors, but not enough to hang the whole movie. Beautiful look of cinematography, Nordic cold capturing is doing a fine job. Even Sahara looks cold in the air. Probably Hamilton carries his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> Here are some good verbs. Unfortunately, the only concept of humor on screen is that of Villen, which makes Hero a bigger one. James Bond's joke may not be particularly good, but at least he does not always see the wrist. <br /> <br /> A positive side to the movie is the psychological, divided, hateful hatred of Guillou's Israeli people. Books have been omitted. He showed us how to worship a quality, heroic PLL, without the knowledge or supervision of the dictatorship in Libya. This imagination is hard to believe because the Khadafi actually took the PLO for four years from Libya in a year. And at the end of the film, Hamilton gave a very annoying gift to the PLO. Where would they use that gift? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, though Henning is selling Manekel's books all over the world, John Gilo will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is Blaiyahahhhh.
