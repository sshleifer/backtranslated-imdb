OK, so this is not cool, but only because of Lorel and Hardy's in the past. If the total overhaul of this film is available with the increase in the quality of the film, then add new dubbing to W.W. words and add a nice unwanted background music, but this film will really start to take shape. As it is, it has problems. The boys are able to see the age of boys. Be surprised They were in the 60's and were led by a 'life'. However, to me yet they came across as the bucketfulls of curiosity, and this does not even come close to their classic tickling feet (I gave it a 4), it's just a clock price because of them. Otherwise thinking would be impostorous !!
