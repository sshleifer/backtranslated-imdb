If not for Colin Firth, the film will be ready to dust bent! So farsighted, so stupid and so badly played !! Just Colin Firth, as always, shines as a single light at the end of the tunnel through this tension !! <br /> <br /> The worst was Jennifer Rubin's acting, sure! Perhaps it was due to this script (did they actually write a text or it was created "on the right track"?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br />> <br /> This should be seen only by Colin Firth Fantasy (like me) because she's incredibly sexy and well-played (this "mental challenge" struggle hard against the script). Colin-Screen-Time This minute is a lot of these movies. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much money on it. Try to see or get it as cheaper as possible (an auction or something like that) and then stick to the Colin Fest scene. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie can be dangerous for mental health.
