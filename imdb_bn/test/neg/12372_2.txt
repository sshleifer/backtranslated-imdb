This terrible moovie is a lot of fun - Moost definitely hangs around cheap set of long, false set-bird dolls, which flaps around the ever wings (like it's a string, perhaps?), Model trains and toy invasive cars. "Science" Asinine - a mechanical nuclear gun ?? And the huge amount of brychricam all in the hair? I think there were slimble 50's! Well, this bird's doll is clearly coming from "anti-God objects universe", and it is here to make eggs by making eggs in New York. Seriously That's a shame about that they manage to kill dolls. I give it 1 hoof out of 4 - it's stupid and stupid, but chicken fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
