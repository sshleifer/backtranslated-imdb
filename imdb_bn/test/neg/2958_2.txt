The film reached Ingrid Bergman and Paris to New Orleans, with two lazy bonds. Apparently years ago, his mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid tried to provoke his forgotten relatives unaware of his daughter. Because if he is frustrated enough, he will stop him for getting rid of him. Then, with this money, he will leave New Orleans and find Millionaire elsewhere, because he stood as a council. On the way, Gary Cooper looks and finds out perfectly from the place as a love interest. <br /> <br /> It is extraordinary that this film was not the reason for the collapse of the film Egigrid Bergman's film career - his acting and the character that was bad! Instead of a classified and tragic woman, she usually acted in movies, perhaps one of the most annoying characters in the film. His counterfeit Contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly stupid. She felt a mystery to anyone capable of how to fold, she looks less skinny than little nuts !! I have never said that he has behaved like that, sometimes with some of the symptoms of serious mental illness and personality disorders, and all of this together thinks "Who will love this world in this world?" . Actually, I could not stand watching her superstition and brutal behavior and she looked more like guests than a guest's "Jerry Springer Show"! When I think about the misconceptions, horror and short words, I think they think. <br /> <br /> The rest of the part was surprised by Bergman's gems and violence. Although Gary Cooper is usually an excellent person, he is influenced by him and only lost. And, surprisingly, they made two peculiar strings of Flowers Rovers and Jerry Austin as his priests. Mrs. Robson is famous for her Queen Elizabeth debut, but here for some strange reason, she cooped her in makeup and the end result was similar to the love of the Indian children of Aishwarya's shop and Azee Jemimar! His face was very wooden, he sported strange eyebrows and he dressed like a slave. For Mr. Austin, when he was a dwarf and when it was not supposed to be done against him, his role was written like Jasser of the court such as this - a highly versatile role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! Overall, the dirty acting, writing, and the limp make one of the big stinger of the ages - almost timeless and dull, such as the famous Turkish parlor and the swing your lady.
