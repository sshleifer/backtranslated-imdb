It's hard to see some hair, repetitive, and lazy series launching a terrific movie. It is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Anyone who has pre-authored that this great movie has decided to turn into this garbage, should have researched some of the liners and open new characters, and instead of classic jokes of the first movie and on and over again. Sure they're a little creative, but want to see the same episode with a small twist. Creed, or Nickleback a lot like listening. The bad guys have to stop themselves from failing, Ijma has made a complex plan, but it is an easy way to save time and decides to use a smoke, some ask the monkey and the bug, and the rest come in the background, Kuzko flirts with Malina, Ishma herself As "Principal Amy", he called Kunk to mischief, and he forgot that he was in Ijma. I admit, this show has its momentum. Another problem is that Ijma looks small and looks fierce ... odd. Also, no one can replace David Spad and John Goodman! The people who made the khukko and knit bastard and fad! Sorry, but I give these shows two thumbs down.
