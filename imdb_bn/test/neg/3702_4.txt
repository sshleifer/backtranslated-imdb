Movies of science fiction channel (Sci-Fi Channel) have become annoyingly anticipated. Looks less on budget, originality, and plot. <br /> <br /> The government is helping the government get a bunch of teleconnecticities and employs a poor soul in an unfortunate way for help. There are plenty of twists of work recycled on the theme of evil government institutions. Black coats, shadows, small nonsensical lines make this one dimensional cartoon. <br /> <br /> Daniel Die Kim stands as a good actor in a small land. She brought a bit of her "angel" character style to the role. His "crusade" character is difficult to miss a telephony link and it is a film of telinetics. Was this a sci-fi cast to try and draw fans from another show? Who knows Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to visit. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly low budget. This sai-fi channels reflect current model of Canadian location, some well-known characters, some influences, and harmful horror plot and character development. Someone will think that they believe science fiction fans will see something labeled "seismic". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telecom movie, see "Furry" (1978).
