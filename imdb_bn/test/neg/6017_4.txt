Christopher Guest Mechanic Master Werner Herzog is one of the great documentary there. Jack Pen is not good but he can certainly take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays with reality and story, but the lines between the two are always clear in his films, essential with a piece of equipment. Pen The Blair can take a lesson from the witch project. Even though you knew that it was a fake documentary that completely bought you filmmakers around the world. Viewers think that the whole thing is real, but you know, deeply, you are watching fiction. In other words, it was the falsification of true truth as well. Actually watching it many observers, Sundance and other premier audiences feel it was real. Pen, whose fan, by his own admission, writing the screen, probably should that stick. Of course, it is not possible to create a documentary or concert film (and which is the beginning and the ending of the movie). <br /> <br /> Penny tries to sell a documentary film as a legitimate documentary, which sets the stage for a matte-documentary sort. However, Pane, misguided the viewer and lost his faith, before the film of Harrige's Harrigez film "Loch Ness's Inagma" before the film, the story of the story of the ghost story (suddenly a movie that had never ended? Probably because Pen's interference). Although apparently the film we are watching is Director Pan, he watches the cameras and starts saying, "What is the movie crew doing here?" And start to sleep away from them. She works this alongside a couple other occasions. He will stop and stop the cameras to stop filming, thus allowing the camera to hide in the shadows to select the snippets of dialogue between the hedgehog and the pen. It seems like a hostage, but it has never been cleaned, and apparently apparently being kept in the dark. The audience shook their heads and said, "Who is charging here?" Penny is working against her own film crew, what kind of a world are we? It is just one of many examples that confuse the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> I feel like typing completely in the imaginary world (I think) when the evil demon appeared in the crew, then he has his views. But during the first appearance of the giant, we have come out completely from the imaginary world, which has tried to create pen, so it seems all stupid and vain. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially impressive film and the opportunity to create a genuine opportunity to document a master's work, but completely lose focus and instead of filming it becomes a movie about Pan and its antics. A documentary. Pen's presence spreads and the movie starts all other shadows. <br /> <br /> Harjag interviews are believable and we actually believe he is not acting. We are even guilty of punishing him and others by his crew, even if you start thinking about it, even if you're not even sure about it. Pen, in his interview with the camera, tried to be fun and strange, like the letters of the interview in the guest's concert, but he was successful only by boring. This effect is a delight in a guest's picture, here it comes flat because you are never sure the pen key As a result we, as the audience, crew definitely start to dislike him as. In addition to the beautiful scenery and unexpected appearance, outside of a beautiful model, the film has been cast for spraying, there is nothing to recommend here. Perhaps its only release quality (its a strange idea) is why it's important to the audience? And ignore ignoring the conversations doing them completely a diservice. For this reason I would feel a good film to show students of film film alone ?? A kind of "Do not Do" Movie Types. As long as it is done efficiently, it is nothing against me as a film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,. Remember that the bad industry always seems to be good, this image reminds me of the Lillian Ras "Picture" book. "Rosy Wheaton" is a "brave red badge" and it's brilliantly recorded for New Yorker. It will actually make a great movie. Read this if you want a great example of meta-art.)
