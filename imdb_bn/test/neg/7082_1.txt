I'm not from America, I usually see this show on the XX channel, why do not we know why this shrimp program in the main time slot on this respectable channel? Hollywood Money is made by Jerry Br√ºhheimer, this time he is spending a large load of cash on small screens. In each episode, a group of two group members travel from country to country for a large amount of money; Where the camera crew shoot their trip. I do not know who gave this stupid idea to this show. There is nothing to see, in all the episodes we see people running like a beggar, occasionally shouting, crying, crying, deaf camera ... it is harmful both eyes and ears. The most hateful part of the nation is to finally see the audience that each team members can not enjoy their race / travel experience. However, to add ratings, producers bring ideas with Gays on one show, American Reality is sucking the show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see, better switch to another channel. <Br /> <br /> Amazing Race = Disgraceful Show
