OK - Some colleges in Southern California have a movie making class. And some people were just named for movie girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were plain stupid to use drunk / rocky / or just a camera, and they launched it for their grade. And fail <br /> <br /> This is the only explanation for me, this thing. Well God they left the counter and date time some time. The picture started on the new scene before the sound and forgot a plot. Well there was a seemingly one and the 3-hour roles were completed when they had to tell you all about it. But I was happy because I could never get it to see it. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this.
