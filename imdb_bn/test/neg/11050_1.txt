This movie was terrible, plain and simple. This is probably the one who will see "movies" and will not see "movies" and will be sorry for such limited understanding of the dramatic illumination of this movie, but I say to stay safe enough in my intellect, this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully painted-out movie was two hours And nine dollars waste. <br /> <br /> I found that it was received by great reviews and the theater came out of it, thinking that these reviews were written by students of high-tech filmmakers and those who are avoiding regular movies, perhaps by their predecessor, probably scared To be that they can actually enjoy one day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was released immediately and gave him only five days to discover the identity and cause of the person in prison. However, the super concept soon gets separated into a kind of joke, such as Oh Dai-Suu Kyi, trying to have sex with a young girl trying to use a toilet and eating live, lithing squid (probably for dramatic effects , There is absolutely no reason for it). He is always trying to find out this terrible thing, he was able to purchase himself for fifteen years, and finally when he found out it was both ridiculous and a big lockdown. Dedicated to him, a young man, when an old man went to school with him, looks like a 20 year old art rebel model. Hey, I know Oh Dai-Suyu has worked hard in jail, but it takes so much time to find an actor that his age shows a little more? Everything is wrong with this movie, it seems to be the easiest way to fix this. <br /> <br /> And big secret - that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes, when I was going out some productive - a plot line involved some jokes and started a high school, a rumor. Come on! Throwing a bone here - were they really good? I sit through stupid dialogue, extra acting, frustrating sets and awful violence for this? (Anyway - if I think of the story, I am not against violence in a movie, but in this case it seems that our hero has been forced to throw his teeth in front of anyone and throwing his tongue out. I'm watching a terrible piece of garbage in the afternoon scanning to figure out Scissors). <br /> <br /> Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your no-dollar and see a humble "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy.
