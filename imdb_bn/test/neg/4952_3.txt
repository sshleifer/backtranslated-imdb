It is fairly enough that it took me to the old days of the 80s and horror tricks, but it did not help in any way - it's still 'low low budget - less Technology - Bad acting - Bad story line - Not all scary and funny enough ... Actually I can not tell about it a lot better. The so-called monsters are just suddenly bad! I mean, that when I left the giant out of plastic and got the fame in the frame, I was back again ... I really do not understand why anyone would invest money to make this script in a movie - but I think it's a It was almost right if big budget movies were there. <br /> <br /> to be recommended - if you do not want to get tips then do not mistake to waste your time. Make up a bad Halloween! Personally I enjoy independent films and some outside the box but it did at least not for me.
