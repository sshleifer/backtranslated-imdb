Always enjoy classic horror films, however, this film was really a big waste and if it does not have a demented person for John Carrenine who is capable of controlling people through his testing. This image was created during WWII and John Carradine was German Nazi to find a human weapon against the whole of Germany. Bob Steele plays a role as a cowboy or gangster, and Bob was worried about his role in this film and played that it was his first film. Montana Moreland, (Jeff) has done outstanding performance with extraordinary comedy that helped attract viewers attention. I hate to criticize a film I made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. You played John Carradine and role plays in many movies throughout the 1940s, but you might like John to see his best work.
