Go to get your camcorder, your younger brother, and the next bitter neighbor neighbor to get warm water on those raccoons; And you got yourself a film! Well, that these guys thought anyway It was so bad that I could not remember most of it compared to the person traveling in flashbacks 'bow'. Regardless of the true title, awesome quality, horror actor and clich√© writing, I think I have never seen this movie. I'm saving that slot for everything for Steven Sighal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Cloud Van Dam. However, if you go out of options when you find new options, you have not seen 1000 times in advance (as I was) and you are debating about it, I will still leave it. It was absolutely no redeeming attributes. This Mike serial killer thriller was a puny effort in a weak, even a B film. If they are really lucky then it could be Wal-Mart $ 4.50 Bin. But, I doubt it too.
