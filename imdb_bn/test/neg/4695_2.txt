This flick, which is "Life at KG Fast Line", is one of the fewest entertainment movies I've seen for a long time. I think it's sick, rolled and awake L.A. Women who remember about 100000001 representation of the state's population. All of the letters are one dimensional, even lead. Some scars hit his lover in the head with a cork stick on the forehead's forehead, and a cheap laugh (and incomplete) was done to stop blood clotting. Oh, cute! Patrick Dempsey (whose movies are often a class act - Circumus) changed this "devil" to his life - but this was the trend of Vintet's beginning of his life from what he saw. No emotions, no laughter, no story The only reason I give this one 2 is that Jeffrey Jones has a bit of style (albiet zero material) in camera and just as camouflage and camerawork. Otherwise, I've seen 5 one of the worst movies. An A to 2 A grade 2! I think that even the most impressive Junkie will laugh at this photo even in the toilet area. I can not put enough pressure on how far I should stay. <br /> <br />
