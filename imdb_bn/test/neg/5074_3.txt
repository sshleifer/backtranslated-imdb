How? I wondered why I could not see a single commercial for the theater or even for it, and then after seeing the movie I realized that I had cheated the hard drive. I have a big transponder fan, and a big blade fan, so when I saw this I imagine some killer fight scenes in a bunch of two bassasses, lots of gunmen, a whole bunch. Instead, I got Ryan Filipp's film with a short camie of Statham and Snippers. The audio and video of the crime lab's video that got more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie that got Kung Fu's bunch and Irin Brokawich. I hope bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snippets and Statham should use the fan base more effectively.
