One of my children probably had a brain fert while renting it. Anyone who actually purchases it, will enjoy using this as a coaster. Probably a frisbee? This is a DVD where I can actually find it in front of the kids where it can be found. Since the DVDs in which the DVDs contain HHS tapes do not seem to be considered to be rooms of the story room, so it is annoying to stick to it beside a boring movie. Yeah, are we going to dinosaurs going downstream, we think Disney is right? I havent 'stooped that still low. There is no acting here. The old 1973 movie trailers are just as interesting to the strange old lover films, which I am surprised to be saved from burning in hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allows zero 0/10)
