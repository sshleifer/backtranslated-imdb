All right, I wanted to see it because it had some good reviews, but this movie was awful ... just plain horror. Character 1 was dimensional and the actors could not breathe any life in them anymore. The story was frustrating ... the airplane was almost half of the plot ... it was completely forgotten. The scene was sooooo pulled out when it was cool ... 5 hours on a clay a guy, putting a girl on her makeup for 3 minutes. I do not know how this guy tries to drag ... there was no conversation on the platform like him and the film was needed to run so long so the scenes did not allow editing ... without using a lot of great conversations to create foreign movies, This movie reminds me that America Cinema never can do it. I want to leave the movies together ... bad bad movie!
