This show has been live live with different types of cast throughout the country. For the first time in the summer summer summer, the Provincetown Project I saw it - it was previously banned in an oddly gay gay resorts (the code that was subsequently amended, then corrected). I have again seen off-Broadway again, New York's long-running production. Surprisingly enough, the production of p-town was much better than New York - together, humorous, more enthusiastic and funny - but it was only in 2001's exhibition; The next attempt to clone the production (in 2007, "Bare Naked Lades") was clearly the third rate. This portrayed production is a Los Angeles production, casting features, and other opinions, is not good. Last year, I rated it in the last production of Po-Town in 2001 and the third summer "Bayer Necked Lows" P-Town Show.
