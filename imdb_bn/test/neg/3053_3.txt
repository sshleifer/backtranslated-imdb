And you know why? Because they thought (or at least awful fans think) that it is absolutely obnoxious, stupid, screamed teens, some stupid monsters (where do they come from? What their purpose?) And a dark palace will all make you a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You need to discover a script, some logic, some rules, and some. This flick is a scene in which his fame (of course, in the lipstick scene), and a few funny moments (the younger brother's description of his mother's cookie, Linna Quinni's "Do not look at me" scene) remains. I have found that it is more scandalous than a movie that I saw as "Reservoir Dog". Literally every fourth or fifth word is a "f ***" or a "b ****". Then, when a movie starts with four false fears in the first 5 minutes, then you will not expect anything better to create good movies. (* 1/2)
