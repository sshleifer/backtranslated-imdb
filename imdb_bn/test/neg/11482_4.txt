I expected this film a lot more. The preview looked interesting so I decided to test it. The bottom line is "Sebastian Cole of Adventure Tourism" was just a good thing: Adrian Graneer. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenia and its performance is very enjoyable. The character is well-designed, but all other types just drifts along the movie duration. Clarke Gregg is really good, but I do not explain his character very well. I mean not too much to explain; She wants to be a woman. Still, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The picture was pretty nice to see the lower budget. I've enjoyed the movie being portrayed in just one script (it's a bad one) and only a few actors. It was a beautiful change. <br /> <br /> While the original idea of ​​the movie was right, it was frustrating to see many scenes, where it was not just thrown here and there. As I said, the script was committed and I must say that I was interested in where the director Todd Williams was, but basically it was very slow film that was not very good for dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" starts looking good in the end, but again, it falls down in a hole back down. Acting was mostly good, there was some need for writing, but the movie budget helped it for a long time. <br /> <br /> I want to silence anyone in the movie with a strong lead character, but the other that I would stay away. Personally, I will not see it twice.
