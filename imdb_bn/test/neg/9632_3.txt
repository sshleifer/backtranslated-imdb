I saw this picture a few times and I did not really like it. So I'm a fan so "nu horrible", so I can not dismiss that account. I found it a little sleazy, I think that Hammer irks me does not feel sexual sex, sex, but sexploitation. I am amazed at how many people amazed me with so much ratings, so I will see this once more. But for me, it was not surprising, there was no atmosphere in it, just look at Omgad, the bad / stupid London prostitution women, and that unexpected unwanted Anna must be raped as another painful man, oh! " I finally guess for me, there was no depth in the film, but there was only a bunch of nasty generations of men and women for the value of tilechellas. There were no degrees like Victorian England, but the sets also gave the feeling of very strange and absolute Victorian danger. On the other hand, the horrors of Roger gradation, now that style, atmosphere and eerie horror are horrific. For me, this was just exploitative, flat feet trash.
