I think "Rosemary's Baby" is one of the most horrifying horror films in the world. Fearful, interesting or not. It is managed properly and Ruth Gordon is wonderful but it's about it. But this signal seems to have "gone with the wind"! <br /> <br /> I returned to TV at the age of 14. Unfortunately, I still remember. I think that the child of Rosemary's baby Andrew has grown up now and Coen wants to start taking him (in the world). But it is trying to stop the forces ... and Andrew suspects himself ... <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 2 for a few reasons: Gordon is (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually good as Andrew and Rosemary (Patty Duke) is "kidnapped" on a bus ... with a driver <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . The original did not need a signal! The follow-up of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was not very good. <br /> <br /> Drag to the beginning with the dive ... then tune. The effort is not worth it.
