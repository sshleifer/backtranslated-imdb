I can not believe I actually bought this movie! It sucks! ... Mexican movies are not always available in Mexican movies, even available ... you can not find them in regular rental places ... so I had to buy it ... I really like the Mexican movie! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are different from what they normally use to you ... but it was absolutely expected !!! You can guess what's going to happen ... I'm not a horror movie! It just was not worth it for me! Zaza ... but if you have time and are really annoyed then you have to walk. But if you love Mexican movies and love the theater, then it will not be painful! Hah hah
