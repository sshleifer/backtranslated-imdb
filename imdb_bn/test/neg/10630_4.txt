I have been a huge Emmy Adams fan and have been for many years. I'm a big fan of musical instruments. That said it is not a good movie at any level. It's quite dust and the overall performance is very poor. Amy Adams is painful to watch acting with Scott G Anderson, because she is in another league while acting. All performances come off as very amateur. Music performance is beautiful, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scottish G Anderson is just a bad actor! I think he has entered this movie because he has a great voice, but this is not the only one. She has an average voice and singing key, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> I guess why Ammi Adams did this song with singing, which I do not want. I may get annoyed with other poor stuff in this movie, but I'll give it up.
