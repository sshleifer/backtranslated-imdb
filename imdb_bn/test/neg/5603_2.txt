Beautiful <br /> <br /> Beautiful actress and actor. Pretty bad scripts Quite often "Let's strip our undies" scene. Beautiful fair f / x Beautiful jering position decisions (college dorm room looks like a high-end hotel room - maybe it was shot in a hotel). Beautiful bland storyline. Very awful dialogue Beautiful location. Beautiful annoying edit, unless you like the music video flash-cut style. <br /> <br /> This is not a guilty pleasure - it's a shameful issue. If you see it, choose a good dance / techno album and close the sound in the movie - you can see beautiful girls in their beautiful black ends and maybe follow the story just fine. <br /> <br /> - Cast may be able to work - I suspect that anyone can acquire skills with line / plotted skills.
