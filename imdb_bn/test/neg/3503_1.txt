I am surprised that anyone likes this picture. I have never walked to the movies, but my friend had to physically stop me to leave the theater during this humiliating disaster. White letters are honest and Asian characters are practically unhealthy and the stories are in vain. They exist only as objects. Other race characters have a lot of good rental. Twists and turns were ridiculous and anticipated. But if you are reading this, you already know that. Paul Haggys Hack. Hollywood can not even make many culture movies. Do yourself good and take more honest action on nation relations, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle!
