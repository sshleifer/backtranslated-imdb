I'm a big fan of the "holiday" franchisee, and I love Randy Coed as Casin Eddie, and at least some scenes were associated with this project (mostly on Matty Simmons, who produced or executed - all 4 theater releases, as well as "Animal House" produced ). For these reasons, I can check out the spin off of this made TV in addition to Sugar Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I did not want to be very good; I could just be a little divers in it a little bit. Therefore, my high level of frustration proves how bad the curiosity of the movie was. It was narrow-minded, jaw blurred, heart-tearing, horrifying to head blasts. Yet, how, I could not stop watching it. It's a sickness to me; I can not walk to a movie or leave it on a TV show before it's over. I never wanted to return to my life two hours more than this life.
