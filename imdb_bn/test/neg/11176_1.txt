I admit, I was taken from this image to Charlotte Lewis's provocative status and there was a comment on her comments to the IMDB Message Board, the film was called the "Great Inside Movie". And so I got so much trouble, my own copy "Dial help". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lewis loved to eat his fish, we know we know what will happen later). Even Luis could not save this film with his beautiful hair, big and bright brown eyes, full and soft lips and stunning images. Lewis fans will be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist" or even "Golden Child".
