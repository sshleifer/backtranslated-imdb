Pre-Ottoman native Aranaj Jr's ex-silent Robert Caradine and almost pre-bride Melanie Griffith take the head of the street and the alaskan with rich romantic dreams of fishing. Well, this dream is exciting like this crazy young road movie. They are not particularly attractive, and most of the movie is not a point, 'We got together some famous people's spawn and made less budget films about their ill-treatment.' 60 and 70 street movies and insurgent youth films, it is a middle-class, developing, continuous letter, not very intelligent, not very fresh for the story, which is soft like the ugly landscapes of films. <Br /> <br /> For those who care, they walk Alaska, and apparently like the wild west of Alaska 70, because everyone carries guns and rough and melted. Robert Carradine said, 'I hope we get a shower, my nuts will be sure.' (And he was one with Griffith!) They were quickly plundered and forced to take jobs and local robbers kept their employer on the Melanie and finally fired the country for not giving corruption. When they are not smart and do not leave the city, instead of trying to eat dog food or be hungry, boys beat them with powders, and then they are happy with big cats. The final half of the film abandons the evil rebellion, as it robs three robbers, and robs the kidnapping project. The film ends only in the end, annoying and hesitant, but how did they see it in the first place because of the development of many characters and not being worried about the story. If you have a 70 percent share in a low budget, then a look is valuable, but the best forgotten.
