So, it starts at least with an interesting and committed fundamental idea, immediately and goes in between, Kerry has a good unclear role, but at least your performance is expected, Joel Shammer's weak side is with some plot holes, "detective scenes" show the fate of our creativity. If you do not have great expectations (due to negative reviews) you probably will enjoy this. Finally, they teach us about morality (who remember "falling") and "family happiness and healing" which creates every obstacle and finds the film PSS to see. It is clear that "killer"! I am surprised why Wow Samro (Carey) did not solve the mystery since the beginning of this movie ...
