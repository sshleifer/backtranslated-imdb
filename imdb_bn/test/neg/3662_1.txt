This movie looks like it was shot with a video phone, it was a little trick and unnecessary nudity. The film never gathered or gained much knowledge, and there was some unnecessary bob shot for a movie like this. The director obviously tried to make the film separate and different films, but not enough information was actually about what was happening, even at the end I was in the mix of anger and confusion. The lack of plot and the confusion of anger, because I wanted to return my two dollars from Blockbuster and stayed behind my 1.5 hours of life. For those who hired this movie accidentally, they should have a payment program.
