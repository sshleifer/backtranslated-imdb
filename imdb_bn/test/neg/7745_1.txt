In 1990 I personally saw Casey Ireland - I was in Denton's UNT during the filming of "Essential roughness". Surprisingly enough, the voice that is being used in this movie is not far from the voice of its true story. However, the plot has happened: Cathy has received a letter telling her that her father had fallen. Severe holes in Africa She goes and tests the site of her father's death, stopping only in a small world that is part of the nightmare of partnership, part of the fantasy, and rejects from Plasmatics. This film really spoils Linda Curridge's talent, who, in my opinion, can make someone a bigger role for her. However, the main protagonist of the story is Gass, a very long mark "Jacko" Jackson Rip Off. The original is quite annoying to start, but this man is actually torturing. Finally the newbie came out of his shell from the store and ended up wearing a bikini top and a sarong. If you're going to have Kathy Ireland in a film of skimpy clothing, it's good to be a bikini. However, the film was almost all bad and skewered properly by MST3K <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid it if possible.
