"Twin Effect" The worst movie I've seen! Not only the weak support, but also the characters as well. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Qazaf has seen the weakest vampire in my life. I'm sorry; Your role in this movie was frustrating. What Edison does not fight in this film, and I am sure that the film does not have a cage, the plot will not be different. The main plot of the movie is not quite explained, and the whole film focuses more on Helen and the growing relationship between Cassack. I mean, who was a cage and why do they need blood? Yes, he is the prince? So what! <br /> <br /> Some scenes in this movie were simply stupid. Yes, the action was great but its complete outline was stupid. In a scene in the end, Duc Dicots says that Qazf is the strongest among his brothers ... yes, now it seems that he is full. Why will he wait until the objection? Another scene was with my personal favorite Jackie Chan. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen how they followed them. How could you be so terrible that they did not know the vampire? People are killed around them with bite marks on their necks; Definitely the news will be faster than you "vampire." <br /> <br /> There was still another mistake in this picture. Helen, Charlene Choi, Cassatt's girlfriend. Which kind of girl is not afraid of vampires, especially if your brother's job is to kill them? If you search for your whole life, then I can bet you because I can not find a brave girl like Helen. Helen boring, bitchy, and movie full play queen. He tried very hard to be different and eventually failed miserably. I have seen a movie among any strange and most annoying characters. Why do not you be a vampire, especially if someone bumps the throat? Qazaf's confession does not stop him from responding to him. It is very strange. Kadaz plays Edison Chan, another stupid character in the story. How frustrated it is as a young actor to play a movie with such a ruthless role as himself. He did not stand up for himself throughout the movie and did not fight. Although I am a fan of Edison, I do not want a man who will be lying on the ground for the whole time. My favorite characters in Gypsy and Rivo movie Their love is pure and sweet. The gypsy does not try very hard like spanking and helen. Rev has played Evin Cheng, wisely and is the only person to create sensation in the movie. A plot failure was the death of Reeve. The film was not a substance, but it destroyed itself by removing only the letters of preference. Another character was Duke Dictots. The story did not pay much attention to him and therefore it is uncomfortable to get Qazaf's "rock" as irrelevant. It is so sad that at the end of the film I would like to see myself. I was forced to. Qazaf was so frustrating to watch the war. The end was so sudden because the whole time was expected to grow so big. Kazieff, who is not supposed to do anything for the film's supposedly vampire prince, and I'm sure that the film will not be so different if he is taken out. I highly recommend you to not waste your time in this movie as well. I was very frustrated. If you are looking for a great movie why not see "Ring of the Lord" or "Caribbean pirates"? Preferred characters with a well written plot.
