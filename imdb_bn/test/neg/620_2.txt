I could not I was bored because the acting was not terrible, and the tragic story was just a B-movie, whose plot was about cancer, but in fact I was watching a subtitle foreign movie, which does not bother me all the time. Was still dubbed. <br /> <br /> "Special effects" were awful. Once the back of the plane is divided, you can see the model empty as a "break away" in the snowy snow. Most movies take place at a firm level that is not clear and seems like a game, because the whole "ice" sound is heard but it is not actually the scene. <br /> <br /> "But how can they eat? They do not have any food" a military person (does not clear how this person works and why he is in charge), I am not sure that no one will ever really Did not say or think about food, because they were worried if people were alive, how they would not eat. It was just a stupid line that indicates that yes, their bodies will have to survive. They finally decided to eat the body, a man finds a shirtless body, who, despite the snow in the snow, is not frozen frozen, actually his flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cut off fresh meat from his back, and it is not frozen or cold, and this scene goes for five minutes. That was where I was to stop. Remake "Aew" was a very good movie about trying to survive in a horrible situation, I'm sure that genuine survivors were appreciated, though I do not think anyone among them likes to talk about this version. It was just about eating corpse and all the other were secondary. To avoid.
