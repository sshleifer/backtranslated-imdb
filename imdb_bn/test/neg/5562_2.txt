Yes, absolutely horrible, and it's coming from someone who likes bad movies - but there's a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / suspense movies and saw some wonderful works from European filmmakers. Broceliande is not sadly among those wonderful pieces of film who created. The camera work is worse than amateurish. Fashionable, shiny, not MTV "Cameraman needs Retlin," many filmmakers use to use the camera to work on their talents due to their lack of talent. Simply compose frames and create terrible images. Harmful acting when it is not completely two-dimensional. Conversations are stuttering and irrelevant - your normal run of the match Miller / Suspense movie is more than confusions in pseudo-mystics. I think the one that kept me far is the horrorly organized battle scene at the end of the movie. The point being ridiculous was that the point was bad. I can see what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. It was just making bad films. Very sad
