In the different tribes of India, the balance of Western-style feminism has not existed yet, neither the two bodies of the world and threats (in the name of tradition) can never be met. Unlike industrial life (or so is demanded), and not the popular Hindi cinema exception, which reflects an underlying misogyny, sadly, most of the composite Indian culture forms the foundation. but why? What is it about female sex that it has expressed so much hatred towards the culture that women regularly 'dowry', subject to the most unimaginable horror of names including rape, murder, infanticide, impiterated illiteracy, betrayal, and subjugation of spirit? The last offering of Rajkumar Santoshi, "Lajo", asks the same rival questions, involves the tortures committed by three different sections / episodes against women, of which it includes the shameful journey by his hero Vaidi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> Instructions in Santoshi's part are not equal to the level of claim. Describing the glory of sadness, he failed to attain the necessary sensitivity, and instead faced the problem of misogyny from the side. Recently Santoshi said that he did not make the film for the international film festival but for the people of his country. Unfortunately, the flick shows, and the film is often divided into action-blood-cow style, which is particularly related to Santosi. The film is its worst, epic momentum, and its ending becomes even more transformative. <br /> <br /> <br /> Female cast is given much more merciful and more circumscribed characteristic than their male opponents. The character is played sensibly by Lumuncecenti, beautiful Monisha Koirala, who has proved in Lajja that she is one of the leading ladies of our time, and has set a proper role and it comes with a truly commendable performance. He wondered how a creator made the film about the creative motive and praising the issue at hand. Mahima Chowdhury keeps a pretty performance and she continues to show that she is an untapped genius. Customs like Junky, Madhuri Dixit, a performance and congratulations that qualify as real 'acting'. A street smart actor who has enjoyed comfort from alcohol and has maintained his marquee status in the last decade, which stands as the biggest risk in his canon of the song-no-dance commitment of an unborn child. That should be the feminist singer, leaving the final and most annoying performance, the gifted line forever. Lajja Monisha Koirala's picture, there is no doubt, but the line is going through your bones and influences the activities that send terrorism through the gesture of your heart. Ramdulari such as Remodeleri, as well as great horror and congratulations, which is filled with truth and consciousness, which becomes the mantra of this part of the spiritual nudity film. Comparisons are actually illogical, especially when one of the world's leading leading women is presented opposite, but in the presence of this royal screen legend others fade in its shade. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Proto-Feminist plays: It fulfills its feminist goals in two initial moments: Her father, who has done an offense other than giving birth to a daughter by marrying her in-laws for the exploitation of Mahima, her father. He erupts, leaving the marriage procession in shambles. Seeing his father crashing, he started crying, blaming himself for destroying starvation in front of him. He said, "Why did I say something? I have destroyed everything! It's all my fault!" His grandmother said to the Witness of abusive silence, "Why are you crying? There is no reason to cry, you have no fault in me." Those who came before you, because what you said today, if we had the courage to say today, then there is no need to talk about today. "The importance of feminist succession in this scenario is clearly shown by the words. <br /> <br /> Another fine moment comes soon in the film when Bedi (Monisha) escapes from her humiliating husband. Shelter in her parents' home in India. It is quite reasonable (actually natural) that a humiliated woman is protecting her parents To look after parental authority, however, it is a social ban of India in the previous culture. Once a woman gets married, her husband and her personal property (family, business, children, etc.) For a serious social sin, which does not really belong to the West woman, then ding her And is considered as 'harmful product', which has been totally rejected by his own actions and denied to submit his role. He is not such a person as a symbol of family honor, his father blames him for his actions. , Worried that her family honor would be unexpectedly spoiled by the girl transferred to another girl. Her initial concern is the possibility of upcoming marriage of Vaidahi's younger sister, unlike the possibility of a divorced elder daughter of the same family. He feels uncertain that he will return to the person with whom he is legally involved, but he can be violent and suffering. He levies against the old expression of his age, "Every household resides in the hands of his daughter." Silently and impressively, he replied, "Yes, the daughter of every house is in her daughter's hands, but she has no respect for herself."
