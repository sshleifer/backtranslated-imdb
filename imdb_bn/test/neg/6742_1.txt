This movie is so bad that it does not have words to describe. If I got a monkey dance video camera for one and a half hours, it would be a much more entertaining hack. The plot is not too pricey and unimaginitive to mention it too much. The best part of the film was when the credit rolled up and I got chocolate to name the names known as James Bond III. Just trust me and stay away from this trash hip!
