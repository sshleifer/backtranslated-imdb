This is the main error in Spanish slashher / shocker in his script. In the first half hour it is a good effort, some mystery and fear and build an atmosphere of fear. We even get some nice killings! Then it is completely encouraged and active in a complete catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I must admit that I was very disappointed because the trailer gave so much promise. The final thirty minutes consists of a lot of moving around some killings and a abandoned convoy. It was so good (though the final scenes in the flooding room are ok) <br /> <br /> <br /> We have the first dialog. This is quite awful (most of the time here and there in the audience there were a few screams when I saw it) and just enough elsewhere. This is very audible in the very scene, sinking under sound effects and soundtrack pressure (but the foolish lines that we want to hear may not be such a bad thing!). The whole movie has a line that "I know what you did last summer" -Movies, which indicates that the filmmakers wrote it as a big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> and the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me, this was mostly the former question because the final packing did not come from anywhere! Some of the sources of the mental status of the audience have been given to the formula, I might think otherwise. It throws all the logic out of the window, because some of the murderers could never have been there to kill! But as a terrific fan, I learned to live with the inconsistencies of Spanish and Italian movies. <br /> <br /> But not all bad. The movie has a big budget presence, especially due to the great cinematography (the past scenes really shine here), tight editing and atmospheric soundtracks. Although most actors are quite bad, the absurdity is the exception, which makes them the most to work with. <br /> <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, the killers are poor enough for the fans of the staff, and they usually come with very good effects, including water pictures (but "water theme" <br /> <br /> So, to finish this review, it's a movie that makes fun of "bad-it-good" kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye, but do not expect too much because it Possible It will not feel like a man, to judge from the trailer and plot descriptions.
