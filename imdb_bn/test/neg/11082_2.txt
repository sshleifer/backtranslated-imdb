Cavern: 10 out of 2: Blair Witch meets the cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> All my films have some to ask the school, teach you how to keep the future operators in the camera continuously. The camera, like Ante BTi, has a headache with about 12 drawings. <br /> <br /> Movies can also direct a visual media director general direction of their actions. The film also needs light to work. Perhaps a light source should be employed so that the screen can see the action. I know it's a cave film but is not afraid to see pitch blackness for a moment. <br /> <br /> The image shown in the opposite does not indicate confusion on the screen, it would indicate a confusion. Edit booth. <br /> <br /> A last note to the director was that I was sure that having a terrible fake CGI camp fire was a good reason. I really can not think about the life of my life. <br /> <br /> Now on the screenlit Try to make a character likable at least. I like two or more but I can route or care for a suitable person. Also, if you are related to the story about flashbacks, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> some fancy spelunking terms in a cave movie Try adding. If you wanted to start with spelunking <br /> <br /> Cave is shot badly with a bad bad film, a confusing, impossible and anticlimactic end.
