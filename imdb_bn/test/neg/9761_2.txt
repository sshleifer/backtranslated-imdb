The courtroom of this movie is not good because it will not be taken in. It's not a good film, but that's it. <br /> <br /> At least one well-respected script and efficient guidance are needed. Sadly, this poor execution has not been executed. Lekin is not a good director of other styles, but on his humorous distance (another example of the Les Bronze series). <br /> <br /> Comedy timing is terrible. Some joke is telegraph. Some other movies are replayed again. Others just sit there while they give you time to laugh. This plot contains dirty suboptages (allergic girls, gay co-owners) and do not develop or raise the viewers. It's not funny and it's not trustworthy for the second second. <br /> <br /> Compare it with Billy Wilder's comedy (It's Hot, A Foreign Afai, etc.) or Lekan's colleague, Francis Weber, French Comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Pluckard, Les Comperes, La Cheve , La Grand Gold, etc.) and you will see the difference between their tight script, great comedic acting and timing. Seeing the client twice; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> I said,
