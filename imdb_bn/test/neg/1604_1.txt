Very dull show What's worse, its very racist. The white boys are stupid fools and only romance is between a black guy and a white woman. There is nothing interesting about this romance, it's not exciting, it's not fun, does not seem to care for each other, writers and directors wanted to launch another different thing. Why are so popular in the media today? It will not lead to social programming and profit, when there are many people who want the same thing, there is always tension. This show is worth 20 taka for season, waste time and harmful for society. At least when they use TV shows for selling products, they are more intelligent, selling any agenda here is quite clear, and with no clear thinking, some people may think it is wrong to oppose it, but some of us know better.
