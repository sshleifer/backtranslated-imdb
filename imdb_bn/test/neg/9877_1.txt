I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. The first one can see the movie and never read the book and it is never the first to read. There is no one else in the second. <br /> <br /> (Movie Without Film) From Movie Stoppoint, it was a good movie. Better than underworlds but better than Ultravieve. And I'm not just talking about the plot line. Many parts of the wolf were iffy, although the wolf transformation was very nice. Characters have developed a very small development and Vivian did not feel true care that his "love" is turning off the residue of his species. Other characters may have five more times like winds. The plot was like the underworld for my taste. Many people say that movies and books are nothing but the title, the character's name, and a few minor parts in the same way. Gabriel was very old in the film, and Raf's father was (thus, Austrude was his partner). The book was about 24 years old, was not associated with anybody with love for a wife (Austrad is trying to win her love) and Ashley was Wolf's mother, not Reef. Another important issue is the position. The book was held in Review, Maryland. Also, why they move from West Virginia are very different. The film appears to be Vivian's fault and his whole family was killed. In the book, Five Basic Leaders, Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters searched for wolves and many of them died (included Vivek's father), forced them to move. Also, Viv's mother, Esme, was a major character. <br /> <br /> One thing from the book that made the film look better was "anxiety dance". For those who do not know, these strange phenomena where all the bits (pack female) fight to become the new leader (since there was a fight for men before) to see. Vivian won it, trying to save his mother from Astrad (who was a horrible evil woman in the book) and thus in keeping with Gob. There was no prediction! However, if you read the book and you like the book, I do not really recommend this movie.
