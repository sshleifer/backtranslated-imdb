The letter was as unoriginal as it hurts. Small skinny Darky computer gaique, funny African-American stupid clauses Poulanyines, a beautiful white man with compassion for someone and a handsome leader who ended with a beautiful girl. The actors are the best medieval. Nortel from Norton does a fantastic job as bad guy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is stupid and time is lost. It's all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as all their Play Grounds, where a large home puts everyone safe with food on their table. I mean, why do you work for a living that you can rob people? <br /> <br /> And, .. who f **** messes with traffic lights in a European city?!? And the middle of the day of fridge? Think of all the losses and do not say death among innocent citizens. What about all ambulances and firetrucks? <br /> <br /> I do not create any sympathy for the main character, and the weather Mr. Wahlberg does not drink his bloody gold, I could not give any enemy less.
