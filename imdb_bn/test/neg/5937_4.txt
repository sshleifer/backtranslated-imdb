After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and leader of Al-Salem (Alon Ashbul), one of the main suspects in Amsterdam, Under the supervision of CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who operates in the Middle East, Llanly Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) monitors the "safe house" in Amman under surveillance and joins the security chief in Jordan, Hani Salam (Mark Strong ). Roger does not publish the entire operation in Hansey and it fails because of the interference of Ed. Meanwhile, there is a feeling of Roger's local nurse Ayesha (Golshafteh Farahani) and she is close to her family. While plotting another plan of Roger to capture al-Saleem, using innocent architect Omar Sadiqi (Ali Sulaiman) to nurture al-Salim, he also endangers the kidnapped kidnapped scales, not just Sadiq's security. After Sadiq's execution, Roger tried to discuss the liberation of Isha with terrorists and offered to encourage himself to save himself a nurse. <br /> <br /> "Lady of the Lease" frustrating a pyrotechnical tour through Europe and the Middle East. Despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo Di Caprio and Russell Crowe IMDB User Result indicates that there are many visitors who like high-tech, satellites and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of the nation, like the speedy movie like spy movie that does not give time to think, but that is not in my case. Fat receiver with a cell phone, like a partner, is disrespectful and ridiculous to see Russell Crowe, when his partner risks his life risky. The rich character developed by Leonardo de Caprioos has developed poorly, and in my opinion, this great actor has misconstrued as an operative agent in the Middle East due to his biotype. But the film does not explain its connection to the Middle East. The survival of Roger Ferris was also very stupid and a little bit. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Red De Montieras" ("Lease Network")
