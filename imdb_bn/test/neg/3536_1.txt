Champion !!!! Min Riper Humham .... I have seen nightmares in Elm Street movies and have learned about Jubilee Ribbis. I thought Geovanni Ribisi did not do any terrible things, so I tested it. I saw "Tippo" (min ripper) for that I checked my tivo. There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was set. I came to prepare my pop corn and got set on the sofa and this? A freakin bold guy is running around yelling blue sweat pants! Nothing awesome about this movie! If something is fun! What a fun budget is low, funny how funny it is, how bad and funny acting, how much money is earned, it is fun Okay Giovanni Ravi is a good actor but this movie is stupid. It's so stupid. They eventually killed him and then they went to this plane and "monster" over it. They shot in the head with a shotgun and made a long way to the ground. And <br /> <br /> - GSP killer ends, still alive! WOOHHH! Scary! woooohhhh! Mid-day meals are narrow fat fat. <br /> <br /> The line below: You have to go somewhere and you have to kill some time. Min Ripper does not consult I want to sit in the picture nude for the second time in the picture. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: F-- - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
