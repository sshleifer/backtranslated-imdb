Now do not get me wrong, I love to see half naked girls wiggling around. This is a fun part of a Moroccan restaurant: lazy dancers beaten up. But it does not have much of a plot. <br /> <br /> My first major problem is music. I have a feeling that when Anne Rice wrote "The Vampire's Loss", the therapy she had chosen was the style of music (although I could have been wrong). I think the current "Goth" music might be a good idea, but they included it in an awesome job. Lestat was probably an actor with a pretty good singer voice. They like Jonathan Davis to choose his stage voice. Second, another person said, in a painful film, two complex books torch bad ideas. "Lestat" This can be a movie of its own right and is an extraordinary good done properly. I do not really say that "Queen of the Dead" is very good in a movie itself. Although I want to see a movie that includes a creation story, there are so many things, how can this word be said, "inertia" in the book can be a very interesting movie. And retelling they melted it quite badly Now remember, many days after reading it I always considered "Lestat", "The Story of the Body Burglar" and "Menonoc the Devil" and made better films. <Br> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, I've included myself), who thinks that many Chess likes vampire shit, it's basically the worst of a big motion picture. I tend to agree with them. Aleya: Though there was a beautiful body.
