All right, so I'm a Singaporean and I want to say that now stop stereoeting in Singapore and make such a movie. Some of the actresses / actresses are geniuses, but sadly this is not shown in this film. When I saw my seat I was afraid, then at that time I was very young, my parents came to see me. I can really say that I'm asleep. And this was the proud son of the West, who got on my nerves. Overall a boring film, and a general waste of actor talent. I saw Singapore movies better than this. Chicken rice was good at war. However, I can not believe that it will be considered as a good Singaporean film. Sorry, I would not recommend it.
