Of course, you can place a model plane against a black background and call it a scientist and it is enough to be interested in it, so if you're like it, then black Horizon will be interested in seeing it at least. The best part of the movie is when they reshare some actual footage of the shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like a series of nude songs, plays bad plays and plays with bad performances. Unfortunately, I do not think they wanted to be funny, the actors really made up of the cardboard, the dialogues really suck, so they have to laugh with them, not with them. <br /> <br /> A side note, rare, half-earth is not rare to see a movie performed halfway on Earth, and is not mixed with expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. I really have trouble for more realistic plays based on our space efforts.
