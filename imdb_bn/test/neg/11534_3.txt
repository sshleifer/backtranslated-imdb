Henriksen's a fan (I like him in the "Millennium" series) and of course, Lorenzo "Renegade" Lama, I at least expect something from this movie. Sadly, the plot is predictable, bad acting, and most computer graphics used for stunts do not work. Sometimes they seem to have got some shot from the Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography also feels good. Initially, unnecessary camaraderie camcorder starts (from Chess conversations) and it gives a cheap, made video-look. It works on HipHop-Movies and Jet Li movies, but it looks out on the Flickr. <br /> <br /> I liked this picture 10 years ago. I was then 11.
