This movie is worse than "Planet of Heaven" or "Plan 9 Outside". I do not know why it also received an Oscar, it got a million raspberries, just like the viewer or did not go outside. The hospital was a financial failure for the first time, but I am convinced that in the classified classified classes, the Gartar-Muthad intellectuals were convinced that the American public was a great proponent when they saw this, praising the bitterness of social statements, and then thereafter. George C Scott, one of the most inhuman and embarrassing roles, along with older sex symbol Diana Rigg as well as most of the films attempted to shout with a growing plot as well. The poor old George repressor and the phenomenon have only been crushed, but after many dirty language between him and Rig, he raped more than once in the sophisticated NYC hospital in dirty night, which I find very annoying that I do not want it to be treated to a pet rabbit. There are also some sacrilegious junk-dialogues tossed about here and yon, as well as laced with lots of cussing It portrays a faulty idea that unnatural stress without physical exertion always brings cardiac arrest. Again do not want to see another minute of this terrible movie.
