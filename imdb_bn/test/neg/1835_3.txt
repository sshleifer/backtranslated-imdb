To start with this movie was such a good premises. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you could actually find out who the bad guys were up to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it was the most stupid clichés from the worst American slasher / horror movie. Now, I like slash / horror movies, but all of the oldest old American films have old clichés. For example, the old "I heard the crypt on the basement and I'm alone and the basement light does not work, so I'll go down to investigate." Clive. <br /> <br /> 3) When Patent knows that surviving medical school can have a secret society at work, then he will ask the question and everyone will say - very publicly. Actually, he says, "I found you, kill me, because I'm all telling you secret." Then he was surprised that he had to tear his blood in his bed and his roommate's thorn was brought in a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Two weeks before the separation went to the table. He found out this secret society to be isolated living people, he went to the lab where all the bodies were preserved by Herself for 2-3 times a night for investigation. <br /> <br /> 3) Her roommate died. He knows the murderer, behind him, does not report him to the university or the police, then he leaves school and goes to visit his parents. Then he returned to school, apparently thinking that this man would try to kill him, leave him and will not try to kill him, although he knows his secret. He was, of course, wrong. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wanted to be so smart (he was studying to be a doctor in the best school in Germany), he acted like a ghostly Vimbo in horror. Movie <br /> <br /> These things have created a potentially good movie, very frustrating, and ending me that the ending will come sooner. Halfway through the film, I stopped routing for him and if he wanted, he would end up in the separation table.
