I started with a personal note as a movie and television buff, in terms of life: I love what I did and what I did with James Woods and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this horror, sad , True crime "article. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has really written this photo, is actually a real culprit with real criminals Ever spent talking: Yes, some thieves have a very small career as well as thieves, but true thieves are rarely caught because they do not "junk" or any drug before doing any job. <br /> <br /> James Woods's character at the beginning of this movie was true for this ideology, and then the script completely fell apart.He turned into a raging, drunken maniac. Excellent work for a strung person, but at least bit is not trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people are beautiful, self -Ready, drug addict Nervousist damaged. They could not draw the real score in the real world, the real world where a large and poor security guard who strikes the living hell from a skinny child (as happened in the early scenes of "DEOG"), keeps him down and does not wake him up. Ever <br /> <br /> <br /> How many ways have I found this way to hate this image? Many Even the complete porn people - like even the most shiny thieves and junkies - have a big vocabulary than these cretins. And the 'rip off' scenes with the Neo-Nazi bike? Puhlease. Not all the rednecks are neo-Nazis and those are neo-Nazi speed dealers that just do not fool that !! <br /> <br /> This picture has earned two, because Natasha Wagner's role as Rose Rose was very good and because Melanie Griffith is still "special", or at least it was for this cruel and objectionable stupid film. I am not singing for the praise of genuine criminals for any reason, but the reality of this horrific film is that they will all die or be jailed on 2 of the law. Scene 1 Good time to spend time .... things ... and I hate zombies.
