It was like watching an up-and-coming movie trailer, without coming until any movie is coming. The film is so dissatisfied and obviously almost as ridiculous as it is incomplete. This film is very short of time and clearly, many things happen in the 90 minute minute of the screen. I was waiting for an Australian movie about the safety of our soldiers in WWII and how they fought against the incredible curiosity in the terrible conditions. It certainly is not. <br /> <br /> Not saying that the acting was great and the place was pure. It can easily be a great movie given a lot of money and time, instead it is not even middle and I can not always recommend it.
