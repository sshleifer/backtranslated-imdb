I really do not know why I agreed to watch this movie, but I was shot for him like a fool! I saw the original kilos, I said it right ... I started to look at it but it is bad that I ended up watching it at 4x speed and got rid of it from annoying dialogue, but I said, I'll look at it and at 4x speed But I do that. By <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, I mean full and total dirty bags are known as acting and cheap. I have nothing against low budget movies, I actually enjoy them, they are different from mega budget blockbusters, but this movie is just terrible! The acting is weird and the script ... well I think you can give Steve Winder a pen and paper, and he wants to create something better! This movie does not just mention the annoying, annoying laughing, which has definitely dug the jungle! However, I did not make it through this movie, because it closed about three-fourths of the way and it was dropped into the window. It could be a rip to buy as a DVD but as a frisbee it was a mega deal! <br /> <br /> Please do not see this mess for the love of humankind, perhaps the one I've seen is probably the worst thing and I'm thinking of something that I've seen! <br /> <br /> I will be rating in this picture ....
