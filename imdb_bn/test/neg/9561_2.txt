Bad delivery is not as bad but close. Try as soon as possible, Warren Batti is not believed to be just as a bugs. Whenever he becomes violent, instead of being frustrated by violence, I find it very embarrassing because it was so dirty. Other actors do not hire as well. Annette Bening does not just play seductive women, she is well off with safe characters. Many have noticed that if the script was as genuine as George Rafter, then Joe Montenegre was better performing. Only Harvey Keitel had disappeared, but then this man could do these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with just one line, big BT, stole one of the bending scenes. With these movies, I'm not sure if the director feels like a general merchant or it comes in such a way. Anyway, I do not like it. It does not matter how much these boys are the killer and the amount of debt of the Las Vegas Baggy Siegel, I do not think a film should be glorified by people, especially with a big studio backing.
