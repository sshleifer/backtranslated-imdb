CYBRROG 2: A carot trainer named Coulton Hicks (with Ricks!), A shadow of Glass Shadow, Elias Cotas, who helped Penny to escape the cash (Jolie), his creators who exploded him and destroyed the competing company. Billy Dragro and Karen Shepherd look to separate both, while Jack Palance is there to guide both of them running. One of the most frustrating topics about the cyberbank franchisee is how the series was driven by the popular and directed actors. Jean Claude Van Dam and Dale Hadden (what did she not know? She was on the pornography of 70) Jack Palenas, Elias Coats, Billy Dragro and Angelina Jolie. The third is William Catt, Jach Galigan and Malcolm McDowell. (All right, the cast of the Saiberg 3 is not that impressive.) I did not see the Saiberg 3, but I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel and acknowledged that I was not impressed. Indeed that hartal, Cyborg 2 is often a lovely looking movie, it is shot with excellent style and this is easy on the eyes of the visual detail. However, Cyber ​​1 was in the same way, in fact the film was directed with a specific style, slow motion and music which makes it easy to eye. Unfortunately, like the first, this is a new idea or something similar to a plot or texture. Most of the concepts are taken from Blade Runner and Mac Headroom, so there is not much to leave for the film for different reasons. Another side act terrible. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drood are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Cotas and Jack Palenas came running, but seriously playing Pauls Cyberc combatants and Kotes is a carot instructor. I guess toward positive you can not be accused of Michael Schroeder not aspiring with casting. Yet the film is neutral and I am interested in a fifteen minute story. Yet why did they associate it with Sieberg? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which has managed to be worse than this. <br /> * * Out 4- (Bad)
