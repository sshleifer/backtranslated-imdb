I really liked this movie. Number 5, the movie star is playing a robot and something happened in his circuits. He works and feels more like people. After the TV shows the robot, he repeats what he is learning. Then he applies these words to his circumstances. Number 5 is quickly witted and fun. Character imitates the voice of the stars, tries to dancing like John the Trivola of Stevewing's Alley and many other things. In most of his cases, he remembered that he remembered. The robot action is really good. Want to drive number 5, please cook and Stephanie please with all the features of a man. How to move and line up robots, it's violent. I was disappointed that the author could not keep this clear for all the visitors. This movie has ended something you would not expect. I hate films that I swear in them, though I like them, I give them a low rating. This movie was the oath of sound. It is used at least 3 times by insulting me which is used as the word of Jesus Christ. Gdm-m, bul sh_t etc. This can all be an excellent movie with offensive language. There is no sex in this film, some violence, such as cars and machines, robots to blow up.
