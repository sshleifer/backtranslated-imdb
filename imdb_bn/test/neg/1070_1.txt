It fascinates how this title drives the views of new viewers to slip as new and grounded opinion. Murali K Thalali must think in his own mind: "Oh, great ... elephant ... what a great movie! I will work hard to do the same movie and see if anyone gives notice." Sadly, he even failed, his humiliating idea. The movie turns out to be a complete failure. It tries hard to catch the brightness of Gass Van Sant's "Elephant", it sounds even more ridiculous - this is the most embarrassing mistake for a film director. <br /> <br /> The photo starts with suicide school, a student in the bathroom. This scene, in the meantime, shows every weird acting skill involved in this scene. You do not buy a single word they buy. Children are interrupted by short interview-style bits, who "live by marriage" in their separatism on the basis of their individual unity, but rather annoying with every bit. Thalluri means the identity of these characters, their heart to give a heart-quick-as-junk-food insight ... and fails again. Five minutes later, Thaluri finally shouted to the audience, "Yes, man!" I stole this movie and for some strange reason, I'm proud of it! Gass von receives the most absurd characteristic of "Santa" from "elephants": The viewer shoots the scene twice to make each character associated with the scene visible to his role and role in a school situation. Hm, does this seem strange? To me, the specific level of this small forgiving tolerance has been violated at a point where I can not tolerate this horror film anymore. It's up to you, Murali K Thalaluri, I said! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" has reached the official election of Canones by 2006, but everybody must remember "Elephant" (2003) at the same film festival a few years ago! So, how can this insulting rip-off be seen in the Lord's name? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the mainstream film (though it is a wonderful creation without any doubt), some people notice that "2:37" has been told earlier! Why is it possible in such a film festival that as Canon is responsible, I can not say. It is tragic and shameful that such things are passed and no one sees true fraud in it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 Above all commercially, worthless and at a certain level as an independent film) but rather a clear picture of his illustrated idol, "Elephant".
