Some spoilers **** have some wonderful moments to recommend it to a soap. A beautiful, low key, really erotic scene when Charlotte and Veronica get closer to the closure. I like music scores and soft, silent cinematography. If I am not clear if the film's bizarre stop and start structure is basically digested in the serialized form (I describe the description of the action in the section is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is Transbaoman and its stupendous image rather than his life. Of course, he will be shown as a sex worker (something else), enclosed, unreal, unreasonably freelance / guerrillas, dresses, and unable to make any interpersonal attachment worldwide, completely disappointed. Moreover, he has always shown two days of growth of beard (for some strange reason) such as how to shine his life shine. And when she did nothing else to forward her transitioning, she is waiting to get sex reassignment surgery. Indeed, the queen is similar to a character, without anybody in the middle of the transformation. <br /> <br /> These are the common imaginations of people coming from outside, who are not actually connected to Transpoleop. Transforming a GRS surgery film is a way to motivate people who are going through infection. At least the film is not impressed with this aspect. At least, not one of whom has conformed to anyone of someone ... why I thought that male actor Veronica was filmed OK but there was nothing better than that. The Charlotte illustrating woman was very good, it is full of complex, impressive, desirable and conflicting power. If someone is so fascinated with female power, Charlotte can find out in women's bar in two seconds. Yes, he was dragged into Veronica, but not as a unique person, as an abstract idea of ​​male / female characteristics (with a gentle touch but with a good tone). Yes, what a soap is about love, it is often lovely and moving, but this does not mean that the number of stereotyped minorities already stewed to some extent may be stereotyped in the process. <br /> <br /> This picture proves that Danes is a frustrated dancer. For such a committed premier (well executed in a film like "different for girls") the final film is an isolation.
