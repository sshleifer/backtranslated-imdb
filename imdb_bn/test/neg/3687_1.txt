I did not comment on IMDB, but I saw this movie, I can not be quiet. I just set up this account here because this awesome movie. In two words, this movie is pure caps. There is no sense in the movie! Nothing makes sense in this movie. There was pain in all the ways of watching this movie. I do not understand why Val Kilmer agrees to make this movie. He plays a minor role as a gang leader, said a few words, and he has a total of 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD only for the wall box box and to buy it in attractive pictures. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself can be a clear idea about rating itself: Zero
