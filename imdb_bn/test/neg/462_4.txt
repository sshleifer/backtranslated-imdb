The filmmakers had enough money to be able to carry out the proper makeup effect, but not enough for a creature to move around and attack. We do not get the "monster" from one place to another - whenever it happens (assumed), the camera will pay attention to the "horrible" reactions of people around. And when a person is attacked by him, he seems to only have an evil object against himself so that it does not fall on the ground. This is still the worst "alien" rip-off (two "extra" movies are worse, for example); 68 (!!) minutes left if it is fairly amusing. (* 1/2)
