1) If you want to create a movie that deals with social reality, it is very important to identify the characters that mark the audience. 2) The audience can not identify characters that are very trendy or the situation is obvious. 3) If you are getting bad actor you can not create any characters. However, if you are getting a nice actor, their work will be ridiculous if you insist on talking to them with a fabulous Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jasu Pons ignores these 3 points and some cheaper jokes that completely excludes the place. His script is so much as expected: A woman comes out of prison, she meets her old junky boyfriend, hard of life, etc. However, the fact is that the story is original but everything will not be bad if only pons are not complete, unable to write and filming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
