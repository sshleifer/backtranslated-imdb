Many bad critics, it surprised me, what do people think of seeing a simple flick created by a bad director ??? Did you all expect a super hit flawless movie ?? In any case, you can already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi star movie ... all his previous work where many stars, but there was no defective. Take the first Jaani Dushman, for example, many errors, but still good fun. However, for sticking to the film, the film is a Hindi fantasy film, which can take any form (Arman (Munish) Kohli) who takes revenge for the suicide of his boyfriend (Manisha Koirala), which is why it happens. Its quite good, with a great star-throwing. But I think it can be a lot better. For example, accept the script, it can not say its faulty. For example, take ages: <br /> <br /> Is 40-48 years old still studying at the university ?? <br /> <br /> There are many more, I will not give more listings, but there are dozens more there. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> ** 75
