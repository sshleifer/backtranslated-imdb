I love beach boys and their music. So, since I was a filmmaker, I thought, Wow, Beach age movie looks great. Well, wrong! I really stopped HDNET, the channel is going on, because it was very bad. Anyone mentioned about editing ... well, they should have looked at at least an inspection when they were filming. I do not know whether some people have been confronted face-to-face after having kissed my wife and then she smoothed it again with her hand. Ever heard of re-taking a scene! Acting was terrible. Direction was terrible. Make-up was dead !!! Probably the worst thing I ever seen was working up. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheek looked like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> This is indeed the first time I commented on IMDB, and I know it really does not make any difference ... but let's see what the producers think? !?
