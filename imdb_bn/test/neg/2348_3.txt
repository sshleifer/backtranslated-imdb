A few years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar. I heard that it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out that it was a flow and a B-movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the film has no good effect. (Maybe there was not enough money for him in the budget ???) <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie you will see it three times. First, only and last time !!!
