This could probably be the worst movie I ever seen. I knew it was a B-movie before it was seen (it was actually the reason to visit it), but I never thought it could be bad. Promises and returns Dracula on the title space, but the story does not really use any real fact that the descendant of Van Helen of Kaspershire Van deny's character. And watch out for the movie, it comes to you faster. I did not see the cry of the end "And now we are on the budget!" A clear fashion. The film's resolution was rather ridiculous, the story was obviously drawn in a corner. If you see it, remember that it's a friend who shares your love for movies. If I had not done it, then I could not do it at all.
