This cartoon is mostly boring; If "Rane and Stevey" are suffering from Gross-Out Overkill, there was no good shock of "Striprilela", funny gag, cute gag, or gag duration. The idea is bad to start: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, preserves "The City" from the Supervisor's Store. This cartoon looks like a tribute to "Darkwing Doc" and "The Tik", as well as cartoon's wit and good writing - even even better storyboarding, such as the higher vacky superhero spof. "Agent 0069" tries to sprinkle it in being shocking and sexy, but it is not, and this cartoon failed to create one or the other. <br /> <br /> Check out your tipped episodes "Tick," and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is.
