The only thing that David Costerfield has to expect to do is to read cast lists and credits, but oh oh! Such a great acting and directorial talent could have become one of the rich stories of literature among the brave Bor, it was totally out of my mind. Beautiful beautiful photography, especially with the Yarmouth Sequences, it's nice to see, but, just Plan Dulle !!! Do not go! Leave it and see the Selzonic or Wonderful BBC Mini series in the 1980's.
