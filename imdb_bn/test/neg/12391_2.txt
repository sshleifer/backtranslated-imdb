It seems that this movie has given some inspiration for "The Sopranos", its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack), Hitman who has tried so many problems with his past and his profession that he is in therapy, to deal with it all. Finally, her 10-year high school reunion comes in a head. The problem is I stopped taking care when reconstructing Black. Frankly, I got a drag to start from the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was possible. A good idea led by Cusack and Dan Ackroyd, his arch-rival groker in the hit-man business, who was a debutant with a mini driver, Blank's high school sweetheart, who was standing on the night, and the role of limited Alan Arkin, Oatman, as the psychologist of Black. That fairly talented welding really come together, though. The drama lacked the intensity and the comedy did not have true humor. The most feasible to be a curiosity was that I had a proposal for a Hitman proposal for a Hitman, but the idea of ​​refraining from an ongoing trick was not really improved. For romance, one wonders why the goddess thinks of going back to her life. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of chocolate, but nothing really caught me and I spent most of the time. Think of the movie can start clicking on the movie? It never did - at least not for me. 2/10
