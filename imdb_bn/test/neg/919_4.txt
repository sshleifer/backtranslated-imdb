This film is a struggling actor, who is trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love which has not received his taste for 5 years. <br /> <br /> This is basically a movie featuring a poor social skills, and he always says the wrong thing. The plot is open and concreved. The main character, James is alone, but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. This is an empty statement that stem from other subpages. Being depressed is depression and frustration is superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the film. <br /> <br /> This is not as funny as a comedy. Some funny one liners but that's it. It is a happy and uplifting environment to infect happy people. I did not find "want someone to cheese" with fun.
