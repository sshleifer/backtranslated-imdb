The worst Korean movie! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film does not create single shocks. It's enough to build suspense well then you are excited to provide any shock or shocking moments. Whenever there is a cool moment you are not bothered because you are still trying to work who and what is going on! It goes something like this: A modeling company employs 4 people for a modeling carrier. But what the owners do not seem to like, the models of each of them are dolls and a strange girl walks about this place and the owners have no recognition of the girl. It is for everyone that has a reason and that as I understand that turns out. The end is a hassle of killing and you do not know who a doll is true and who has died! I do not recommend it to the fans of Korean / Asian horror films.
