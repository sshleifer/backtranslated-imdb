Curson Daly never made me laugh at this show or laugh at me, or even smiled a little. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. It seems like they do not try to be a little fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not just give enough pressure on how this show is. Do not see it. But if you want to do absolutely, I recommend closing your eyes and stopping your ears with cement.
