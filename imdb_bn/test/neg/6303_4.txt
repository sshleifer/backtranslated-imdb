Shaggy, friendly but frustrating movie has the same old message: If you want to make it in this world, it is not enough to imagine it, you have to live with your position in society and it means governing us (herroxamaxal) rules. Draw a queen comedy-drama from Australia, three male friends travel across the outback on their pink bus, naming Priscilla. Although not every formula film, there is a compulsory "road movie" sequence (confronted by forestfire, rednecks, etc.) etc. Writer-director Stefan Eliot has followed a slight humor and sympathy with potentially possible moments, but has been tuned in his story, with his ex-wife, a terrible mistress and pre-teen son (both) who are comfortable - and child-wise - with their living ), And the third task with no power. It contains some misguided transvestite humor and a fair play, but a script which seems to have been waterfalls along the way. *** to **
