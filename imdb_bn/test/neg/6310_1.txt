I have not seen this film over the years, but the horrific "taste" of acting is still lingers on my tongue. How did the co-leader of Jerry Lee Lewis comment "in a tee", but it seems to him that he is in the most extreme stage Jerry. Does not work in this way, and the performance comes off as frustrating clownish, reducing louis from a buffoonish caricature. <br /> <br /> The author of this book (Nick Taches) is a good writer who wrote several fine musical bios. (I especially like Dean Martin "Dino"); The book Tusch is different from both of us, and "Bij." Quaid's acting implies that Jerry did not act like a human. If people are like this, nobody will be bothered to hang around them. Since cartoons are gently entertaining, but otherwise it was an "honor" among the most respected, movie-proven performances to watch. Terrible ...
