I want to give 4 reasons for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. I'll call "stupid victim syndrome" If you have a killer on the floor and you have his gun - please shoot him. If you are a policeman and your shotgun targets the killer - then shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have a finger trigger your finger - your first instinct is to throw. This is one of the first things you teach in handgun training and because of which you do not put your finger on the trigger until you are ready in the fire - ask a predator or infantrimen. If you are electrocrat then your muscles should also contract - your finger swim. <br /> <br /> 3 It's hard to keep on the ground for 8 hours without 2 hours - one of them is doctor - you do not think you're dead. Even if you think that the tumors of the brain have died and only a few months ago were in the hospital. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the person who injected the poison got the same antidote. If you poison someone, it's killing. <br /> <br /> 5. Did he want to teach Adam's teachings? Yes, there was a need for a doctor, but what was the crime of Adam? Maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> Out of those things, I could have given this film a high grade. The plot was quite good, and the killers were very innovative in the way to kill their victims. I could even forgive the terrible act in the doctor's part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. Cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the finishing felt and did not work just for me. Best of luck, I do not have to pay to see this or I want to return.
