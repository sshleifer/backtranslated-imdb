Note that the director, William Shatner, thought that there are many 'dark movies' of 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier', but considering the huge box-office receipts received by Paramount's suicidal predecessors, the new film insists there are lots of laughs too. So what can we do with the original article, six star track movies are the weakest and most important. There are some bad ideas with some good ideas and if you are in a charity mood, you can also see 'The Final Frontier', in the same way you will see the episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Lawrence Lachenbill is one of the best guest star performances in a star track with a fine actor and William Windmoy's comodo decker on the right or the small screen. When the half-brother spoke of Sibok's screenplay threatened to sinking, the film was released continuously, which is very frequent. Charles Cooper is good as well as the thickening of the Cllingon General; Not too bad his role is as big as he did. If the truth about Shatner's motives is true, then I apologize to him, because I was not ready to blame for irrevocably charity and his director did not clearly see the footsteps of strong steps. Because I always felt that all the trek worked regularly, worked on Starter Star Trek and there was at least 'tune-in' for all of its fans. After reading his track memories, it is very clear to me that he considers Shot as another action-adventure series, which is a science-fiction setting. What gene was liked by Jean Rodney Berry; Cuon was known for his work in the popular West series "The Wild Wild West". Saturn also mentions that his favorite Star Trek episode was 'Action of Peace of Action', which co-written the second seasonal episode of Quan. So, finally the chance to manage a Star Trek feature film, Shatna will not follow her instincts and create an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? Nobody has done good, because 'The Finan Frontier' has ended. Shatna herself has definitely withdrawn as The Great Ham, and Leonard Multin said that the film is suffering from bad cases of 'quits'. In the opening scene of the Usemite National Park, it is difficult to say bad, super-cheesy special effects or false conversations. Running gags on the enterprise's faulty equipment are running from 'Roth of Khan' and by this the fifth track movie has thrown itself on the ground. So there is a 'skeletal crew' concept. A new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scoti and Uhura and it does not mean that the burning emotions do not burn between the two. It is a pointless subplot and nothing is added. The climatic scene where 'God' encounters, does not add much; Whether it was a good idea in the first place is controversial, but the view does not give much knowledge. (At present, the power of creation of 'God' is changed according to what is needed.) A tedious repetition of Claymax's 'from the point of view' in half of it. Leonard Nimo guides to defend the integrity of the speech, even like an on-talk-line "Embrace yourself, doctor." And as usual DeForest Kelley, Shatner and Nimoy outperforms both; She really came as an actor in the final trek films. So this trek is not awesome, it's not very good. Before the next generation, there was another original Cast Trek film, and it was more effective than 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'.
