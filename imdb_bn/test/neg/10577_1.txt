The worst movie I've ever seen in this movie. It was a complete waste of money. If I was not in the film, but two of my cousin brothers (who thought it was frustrating, but thought that it was not terrible), I gave up the movie. The film had two points that I almost smiled, but the rest were annoying, ridiculous, or painful. I thought it would be a mockery of all superhero movies (which I love), but in fact it was originally based on Spiderman, with some vertical references to some superhero movies like Fantastic Four and Batman. I can not remember a good thing to tell about this picture. Do not waste your money with this picture - there are many more good movies!
