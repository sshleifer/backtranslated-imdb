The artist of this film has to be Euro Style, because there is absolutely no substance. A bunch of stuff seems to be going somewhere ... but it will never get it. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to come up with a completely 10 lines of equation, because this film is a completely empty experience. Some cave shrines are some of the many beautiful photography, some really damn zombie effects, for supernatural comedies, and a weak, existential end. These elements fall each other. Just when you might enjoy the scary mood, there is some silliness with the bounce of the head or zombie sex. To avoid annoyance with screaming, you will touch the lowest story line - and it is divided into ridiculous miracles. For example, some people took several half-baked B movies and dropped them in a blender. <br /> <br /> Most movies * almost * nonsense - and * no * good. Obviously, this will affect the section of the Art-House fan, which looks like the separation from the depth. Everyone else should be well clean in this dreary mess.
