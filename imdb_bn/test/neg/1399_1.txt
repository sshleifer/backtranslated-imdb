This is one of the most ridiculous Westerns that Hollywood ever made. Gary Cooper has played 'Rebecca Hilster', the former conductor officer wanted the law. He met a body named Weederb, which is managed by Lif Ericsson, who does not have any knowledge of firearms with United States Marshals. Seeing his fiancée played by Weatherby Raul Roman, Donos is on his way, Tonia Robles. Tyner's parents have a lot of people in Rabal, but they will not be able to keep an eye on their cows, which are regularly caught by the Marlow brothers. Playing by Melo, Raymond Messi, Robes has financed the estate, which made things totally stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He can meet his fiancée, Tonia, (Another example of another plot nonsense, do we think that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy also passed a written test. Could not.) She switched contacts with Reb Hollister, of course, an expert ban Kadhari. Weatherbys of the Weatherby with a high kissing takes the liberty of greeting, while Weatherby looks like a donkey. Gary Cooper, number one studio in Hollywood, here's a fine form as Robi. He did not take the job of weatherby before the movie ended, he stole his fiancé, and Ruth pulled Romania to Tunisia, it was so hard for him and so fast that he gave off the brush to more than half of the film before off of the brush. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot does not have credibility, so despite good cast and lovely photography, the film is a ugly one. And the heels of Cooper's character to complete the boot. The film also stars Brant Marlowe's daughter Barbara Petton, who is a beautiful and talented actress who, unfortunately, made many headlines for her due to the wrong reasons. I firmly recommend you pass this one.
