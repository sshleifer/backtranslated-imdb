First: The latest campaign for this movie is a huge hack. The cover you are trying to judge is that it was a scandal film that played a character about Kyle's sex, drug and whatever. This is just a cheap market-project. She is barely in it and is not doing things. Marketing here is incredible, and I'm not surprised that filmmakers do not object. <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment to me. It seems like a Sunset Beach episode directed by a teenager Quentin Tarantino in a sloppy hand. And that is not meant as a compliment, you think. <br /> <br /> I think the film's first weakness story It seems about nothing. Just about the coolest teenagers 'tripping around on the edge' living nearby. Although the characters themselves have some personality, but the movie does not use its chances. As said, there is no substance here. It looks very broad in cool conversations and looks like a colorful MTV ad. It definitely has that feeling. However, I think some people might enjoy it, but I would say there are many good movies around this.
