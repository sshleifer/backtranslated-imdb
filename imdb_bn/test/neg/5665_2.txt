From annoying and huge curiosity, I decided to try the program today, because my four-year-old nephew loves it. I should know that this was a show that could only be four years old. The show was quite bad. <br /> <br /> First, the event was not funny. The sunny tracks were the most annoying at most inappropriate times, especially since no joke was fun. The laughter track stopped a bit when a cameraman's child said, "I'm going to polish my lens". How is that funny? Its components (such as draminyera drunk) that was supposed to be funny, even knowing that was eleven years old. <br /> <br /> Now, I think four-year-old viewers are not targeted. However, my four-year-old nephew, you see it, then this kind of thing, so when I saw it, I was worried: it does not look very good behavior. আমি যে পর্বটি দেখছিলাম, সেটি স্যামকে চুরি করে ক্যারলি এর স্যান্ডউইচ দেখায় এবং তাকে নিচে মাটিতে ঠেলে দেয়, তাই কার্লি উঠে দাঁড়াতে পারে এবং একই জিনিস আবার তার সাথে করতে পারে। I do not want to see my nephew playing that rude. I do not like the idea of ​​two web girls where they provide personal information ... if it is real, then there will be all the fixes on it. /> <br /> This program is probably 11 years or <br fewer adolescence and be funny, but it's bigger than anyone to stay away from her. I guess these two stars will give me I can see how it could be a kids fun.
