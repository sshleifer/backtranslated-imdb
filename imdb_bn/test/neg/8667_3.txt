For adolescents who have never been to Aston, this adaptation can be good. But only for them. This is an isolated "Cliff Note" version of ManSuffield Park and if you do not see any other version or read parts of the book, then it must be rubbed. <br /> <br /> Why was it hard to do? Good adaptation of this book? In the 1990s, it gained independence that seems to be rarely the same book - psychology was completely modern and vivid. <br /> <br /> Here is our delivery piper, which looks like a beautiful country vinike. She has a fantastic personality that develops nicely - but she has been florantly with black eyebrows, and blonde hair - through many pictures of dark brown roots. A lot for unspoiled cousins. It is incredibly confusing, and the rest of the cast is covered in sticky hair, the type of cyclone dress that truly shows disrespect for the real time. <br /> <br /> Here's a good thing - Holly Atwell is the best version of Mary Crowford. He is the perfect banknote, all modern or stimulating, flippant and completely flirtatious without any moral or ethical compass. Here Henry is actually looking good enough for a little temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jamema Redgrave has played the most interesting role in the story and led her to annoy her until her last scene - a lot of logical. It's just a product that truly misses a true sign for Austin fans. <br /> <br /> The only effective version with strange duck (Sylvester La Tausel's role is perfect) Gay Henri Crowford - he's just ridiculous).
