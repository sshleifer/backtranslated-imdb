I have been able to finish his book in Depardieu and it becomes an excellent success. At least he was wounded with something. <br /> <br /> This movie hit me like some other recent French movies as stupid, angry, and very stylish. It does not nose. Most recent American films are pointless and angry and have no style. We should be grateful, for photography that speaks a European city in the middle of the blown continental winter season and for partial conversations that seemingly challenges us to be able to understand. <br /> <br /> A good thing to be too much. In the midst of the submerged night in the night, it travels around the sea, brings dreams and such bad expressions. (There are several sections of the dream that include things like swim in a river of blood. If you are a Vlad Impaler you would like it.) Many people die. Catherine Dunnow dies by suicide motorcycle. I do not know why. The young girl of Golubu is also dead, and I do not know why she died. He goes silently, falls on his feet, and dies. There is a clear sex scene. I have to take their word for it because it is stylish photographs but it has been almost stylishly photographed in the dark. Kiddies do not worry about being shocked. They will probably go to sleep by this time. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not bad actor. We see that he is deviated from a well-armed handsome young man - without a good, handsome person, that his nose can not come out of his way - linking, murderer, hairy body debris, we are sorry for the man. Golubu is a beautiful face, a huge doll like a huge semi-red eyes and wide cheeks. His next film should be a remake of Leighton's "I Woman With Wimbled". Then there are these mysterious people who leads a band. I guess it's a band. As far as I could have been out, the band has played dozens of drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitar. The outcome of each audience will be appealing, but it can not enjoy the "easy listening" offensive audience. If you do not like the music, there is a waiver because there is a sinister composer and the leader trapped with the walking stick of Depardieu. <br /> <br /> I would say, I've been sitting very rarely. (And it is very lasting.) Occasionally it was waiting for the rail crossing in your car, while long long freight trains stop slowly gradually. I wish it was a few joke.
