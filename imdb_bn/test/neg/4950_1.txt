I do not know why it gotten no decent reviews as it may be the weakest horror comedy that I've ever seen. England simply tries to wipe the most (and scares) it as a camouflage and its performance is unnecessary. The direction is terrible and the acting is bad. It seems that every year the producers are trying to kill another Evil, but these weak, unprofessional attempts are going on in the real horror classic memory. <br /> <br /> His filmmakers have said, "It's not a remake but it's trying to plug it into 80's forwards (which is my opinion - hatch) or with another awesome classic, it's still confusing and fearful, horror, Comedy, not even for the lack of a suitable movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
