This film is a bad movie, but to get a nutritional value from it, I recommend visiting it with Rosemary's baby. <br /> <br /> There are many things to see that many directors may draw similar performances. Actors playing the same character. Observe the fine work she did in Minni Kastievet (Ruth Gordon) and the terrible supplement vs. the first film in the film. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how different characters are played by the same characters. Which is what makes me involved with a seagull if it is aware of the first movie and which of these is not surprising about the child of Rosemary? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is completely straightforward, then you are the best. I have more to say about this picture but I do not want to go there.
