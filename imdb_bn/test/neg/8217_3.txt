The film has successfully given a graphic screenplay for the forced labor of forced labor, but nothing else. The left agenda behind this movie can be seen a mile away and if viewers feel so embarrassed to see that you know the feeling. Therefore, women are abducted and sent to the former Yugoslavian region to work as a slave slave because the United States military agency takes a deep breath of being corrupt and selling their private security contractors abroad. You do not need half your brain to see the Iraq War and the Black Water Company's relevance. It seems to me that my life has been fooled that this problem and many have kept direct direct result of imperialism in this region for 45 years. But no, this was American war in Iraq, which was also responsible for earthquake, tropical storm and constipation last week. <br /> <br /> This image ignores that 95% of sexual activity is women who want to sell their bodies for money and enter Western Block Entry. You see that scene so stupid that you want to pull your hair. We beat her up behind a woman on the street street on the streets of London, then she takes her senseless body to the apartment half a mile away, where she rapes her. No one saw it or called the police, and the current woman did not want to scream at the back. Even better, we see 4-5 women in the center of London later - they will be sold in brinjal - they will be sold in the light of day, one of them faces face, and people are not shopping in the background so nothing is happening. You can not make this fool. <br /> <br /> I thought that such a trash was exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
