After reading the book, I followed the Castle Rock (the essential part of the Rock Trilogy), and the plot relates to the story of the story "Coming to the small Renaissance village of the monster". Characters are all loving details, and it made both a good emotional and minor horror. On the other hand, the film is horrifying. Character is interactive and shiny intriguing, and is tried by a story which is exciting, but missed by a mile. If you do not read the book, you can enjoy it, otherwise it should be avoided with most of the movies in state books.
