The sound film of this link, Harold Lloyd, was aroused in him, and this Lloyd made an amazing surprise similar to creating the same joyful and humorous silence. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's adult choice is Fai and Limp can replace zany antics when we talk to her and silence her in a lazy, modest speed. Lloyd knows a young boy from a missionary who grew up in China and then transferred himself to contemporary New York City without his good news about how his life is lived outside the Chinese village. He found himself in an mayoral election as an unlikely winner and quickly scared all government agencies because he refused to see other ways to face widespread corruption. When he was ready to take him down, he decided to play dirty like everyone else and took every step to make every New York cricketer fraudulent as a scary tactic. This dark satire comes out of place with everything else in the film, but it is the only part of life that comes from far and near life. <br /> <br /> I do not like Harold Lloyd's film to fail, because I like him a lot, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> Grade: D.
