I saw this movie with great prospect. Back Blauber indicates that it's going to be a nasty one. But it was very rude and little dissatisfied. I've never seen this violence thousands of times before, the GO level is only average (remember that in the last 5 years of Hollywood that was probably more than likely - probably more), and I was not at any stage. Let's even go along with the uncomfortable feeling scared. Again a big CAT 3 movie, did not live for her promotion. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly fares, but does not go with any expectations. I am interested to enter the whole Asian awful scene, but constantly disappointed. I love Ichi, and Audition, but then again, Mike is standing alone at the moment. <br /> <br /> Please inspire me .... There is a big cluster of magicians fans who are extremely hungry. !
