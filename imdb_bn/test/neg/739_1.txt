This is a terrible movie, which is rarely accepted by the book, although they have the same type of plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours), it will be much better than doing anything else with grass. Without the badly done fantasy scenes, Catherine feels foolish to be stupid. Catherine's acting actress also saw strange views like all love and it seemed that she was lovingly watching her Tilani's eyes. Really !! The film ends with the fantasy scene of Catherine, where no one can help, but it is astonishing whether it has happened or if she is just confusing, well not what you think, but it is a completely awesome way to enriched the horror movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title, which itself was written by Austen himself. I usually love the BBC's production but this one is awesome.
