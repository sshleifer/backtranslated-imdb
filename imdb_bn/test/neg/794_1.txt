Box (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langley, James Reborn, Homes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Selia Weston. Genuine legend Richard Matheson's fascinating expression "Button, Button", is a truly frustrating adaptation of the film maker Richard Kelly, who truly holds a small, disciplined piece in a grab-bag 'WTF-A-Than! The mysterious (and laughingly humiliated!) Man, Langley, 'struggling' couple Diaz and Mercedes (both fantasticly Vanilla Blend!) Offer millions of dollars: a box with a red button, pushing, killing some people in the world (strangers)! String is attached but really that matters here? Why is Kelly Troll's name so peculiar (i.e. nose-bleeding; water transport system ?? that's right ?? pirates, transport systems) when the tension should be as important as possible (oh possibilities). If it's heard like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're half-right (the TV's 80's boot really did a modest small-screen adaptation; in fact the rental was rented instead!) One of the worst movies of the year.
