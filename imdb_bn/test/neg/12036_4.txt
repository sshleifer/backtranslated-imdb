Mary, Mary, Blaudy Mary is a real time murderer. It has a common catchy cast, the action is rarely dull. There are many killings. And production quality is not bad. But in the end, it spreads some nudity in the 1970s as an ideal TV show. This movie is a complete product of "Authors" which is trying to create a commercial movie entirely. There is a very little depth here, and the film spends too much time with the Chase and Action Scenes. Without the view of the beach with the old man, MMMM is almost nonsense about any fear or mystery or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> This does not leave a lasting impression, though it is watchable.
