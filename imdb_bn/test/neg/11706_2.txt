I can not express how bad this picture was. First of all they are quite old and quite uncomfortable though some legends are all they do in a waste. Fred Astaire, well I think he was in a big favor on behalf of a big reason because this was the role of his last film. The script seems to be a mess and the film is awesome draggy. I've imagined it if I saw it after coming back (1981) I thought it was appropriate. But seeing many really good horror films is the worst. The only real believer in this mess is a very young and lovely outfit / unclear Alice Crease. The main young character was trying to do the best that he could do, but it was totally terrible. I was not sure how much I lacked her skill or lack of defined-supported scripts, but she was just bad in any way. Do not watch if you do not see some of the old guys do not see anything in a bunch.
