This picture follows the very similar storyboard to the Warriors, only the less intensity and the rather bad thing that can not write anything for the house. <br /> <br /> The general story is not bad, it is a small Aussie gang who is making one of their members to rape another gang's daughter, trying to get out of town. Then many of them are being victimized by rival gangs when they have to fight with street roads. Many people can remember that the authors have taken a page from Warrior's book and rewrote it, but as mentioned above - not nearly as intensely. <br /> <br /> The whole acting is not very good in my opinion, and in most cases it is clearly obvious that they are actually acting ... the war scenes are created for this, but the effects of poor words with them are brought back. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie at the Warriors at one time. <br /> <br /> Low budget, accurate story, bad acting, nothing to write.
