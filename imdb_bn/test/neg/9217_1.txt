I went into this movie for an imaginative twist coming second. Boy, I was ever wrong. The BBC is penning a movie, stupid at total stupidity, intensity construction at stupid construction. And how much of this movie is developed by the BBC is no exception. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It took 2 hours for the first 30 minutes. I was surprised to look at my watch when the pointless, monotonous drill was over. The elements are so lazy, and sloppily written, because they spoil a perfectly good actor in the original role. The only thing that will happen is to kill the time. <br /> <br /> In 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (disputed ends). What a shame Plot summary is more interesting than watching a movie. Promotion, "I am Allah" endless blah blah-ing, as evil as bumbling miracles as turmoil ... UGH. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> do not see this crash.
