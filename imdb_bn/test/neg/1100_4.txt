Wicked Little Things (Australia known as "Zombies") find a rare ?? A film that promise one thing but distributes it to another. It is a film of some of Millennium Pictures, known for producing various B-grade action films and thrillers in European film studios, including some action star John-Claude Van Dam. <br /> <br /> Tony and her two daughters, Sarah and Amma, arrived in the city of Adeityon, Pennsylvania, to enter the large house owned by Karen Karne's late husband after searching for the title of her husband's death. Once upon a while, they found that the house was old and needed repair. But home conditions are among the lowest in their problems because they discover that the area is likely to disappear and Karen faces the owner of the area and ordered to move. Once down the night, Tonys found out the reason for the discovery: A group of zombie children break out of a mine in the area more than 85 years ago, came out to kill anything of wood. Karen tries to end her curse with the help of a summer neighbor, and her children become the next victim. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD which hopes for a photo with meat-eating cloths, one thing: the movie is more like a ghost story than your normal junkie flick, the dead children are the nightmare of any curse, which travels at night Takes vengeance (though the internal reasoning is a consequence? Children can only be faded by sacrifices of animals and in the same way Bloodshed is blood shed in the same way that the vampires are distorted by garlic and mirrors?) Do these kids do not have to be dead?) Plots will not be such a problem and will actually be entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script to create a Zumbi film, only through this effort they flattered. In this way, such a film would be just like a ghost story, but due to a poor script, there is nothing more than routine efforts. Cast of the film's greatest power, Cast gives a better performance than the film. Special note Scout Taylor-Compton, its role quite well ?? It's embarrassing that he destroys his genre credit for Halloween performance by a very bad performance (or just Rob Jumboom's script).
