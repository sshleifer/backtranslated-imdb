Let's make it realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. My wife and children showed the real promise in her first season and then went to the mountain. It does not describe words that are so bad. I am surprised to be so horrific on the basis of acting and writing, if Damon Weinen intentionally creates such an oppressive program. Every performance from top to bottom is ridiculous. Damon Wayans phones it completely and second to George Gore is very horrific. I'm crunching every extra acting line. Can anyone really find this show and find it to be funny to be funny? I request you Do not see this show. As soon as we stop sorting this up on TV affiliate syndication we can finally get rid of this ultimate garbage.
