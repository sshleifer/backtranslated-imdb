Unwanted, almost an Andy Milligan movie is a shock, but I also saw this picture by watching most of the movies. <br /> <br /> It is definitely the story of Miguelan swivy Tod, that is, with time the costume (but not the necessary hairstyles for some time) and general headaches-motivational camera-work and the quality of grains. For Gore, well, the version I saw has been cut, because there is not much for a movie with the title "Vampire". Here is the best indication of harmful films: Some meat pies that are involved only with some poor prey tight. So, I still break this video, on my video style, oh, as long as the content is a letdown somewhat like that. Recommended for only stupid and morbidly weird. 10 out of 3
