Let's face it, a real horror movie, no ... I mean a "real" horror movie, it's a rare, weird and beautiful thing to see. I have a special place in my heart for the films of Plan 9 Out of Space, Half Cast, Spasses, and I give this picture 1, though I enjoy any bad movie for this, a real (a bad movie) friend, food, something to drink And it demands special events: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> In addition to eye-rolling performance at the very first side of the lead actor, he tried to straighten the intensity of the film directly without seeing the camera (a part of Ham which is directly out of silent images - find Rudolph Valentino) In the out-of-the-film conclusion, you ... ... do not ... stop ... smile <br /> <br /> It enriches a poor man's warriors in order to enrich the film - and this description should be enough, but "Spaghetti eating scene", "we" got their ticket; They will not leave the city anymore 'Scenes', "It's Isians! Run !!" And more. The only truly objectionable part is the unrealisticly depicted rape. Outside, I dared to see this picture. And I dare to find evidence that the critics say that a film needs to be considered as good, or the line, or direction, or another that is boring and lazy material. <br /> <br /> If uncontrolled laughter does not fit before the movie ends, then what I can do is stand on my side and cry out, "Dog, you dog, you dog!"
