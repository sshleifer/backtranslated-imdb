If a movie does not hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, then I'm so worried about it. The idea is that you will only deal with the third slow pace of the movie and then be rewarded, meaningless. Have started a good movie and have a strong end. It's all interesting and a lot of some decent shots and promises, but eventually seems to be muddled and irrelevant. There are many Asian movies to watch, most of which I'm not sure most of you did not see, I really want to see it somewhere else. Why IMMb requires a minimum of 10 lines for review? I told my piece and I hope it will help some of you go to the next movie.
