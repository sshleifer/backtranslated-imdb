This show is simply another bad comedy which will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just sexist / racist / homophobic, it's fun and not cleaned. The father of the first stage says to his parents, 'I want women to get jobs without going out and having the same rights as men', what really helps attitude? Then he jokingly told his son that he is weird! Does the father say their kids are weird? So overall this show is not annoying, unoriginal, offencive, clich√©d and most fun of all. Yes offencive of American parents But it makes you laugh and probably takes Mickey. Difficulty Thought.
