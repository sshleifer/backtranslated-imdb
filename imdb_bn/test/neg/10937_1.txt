Uwe Boll seriously zoo off the basic concept and dialogue from Se7en?! Why is this douchebag so difficult to be real?! He also mentioned in an interview with Gametricillers that he liked the stuff like picking stuff in the movies because there are characters, plots, backstories and then there and ready to screw with him. <br /> <br /> Guess <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, what do I say? I created something in Ube's 'Respect' ... <br /> <br /> http://zuucka.deviantart.com/art/Uwe-Boll-is-a-Douchebag-70369862
