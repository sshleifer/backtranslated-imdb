In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst roman film I have ever seen. The list is not just wrong, Plot Ideas which is flat is impossible, it will last more than three hours of film, but only give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus have been presented as generous Democrats, "nobles "Against the" people "side. This is patently stupid. Caesarars were developed as you could get. Their interest was to consolidate the power and to stabilize a country which was destroyed in a 150 year civil war. The reformer was, in particular, the Gretchen brothers, who lived almost 100 years ago and supported the rights of a few ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that are funny, if you know something about time. With Richard Burton, "Cleopatra" will give you much better idea than how the facts will be revealed. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue is something else, and here this film is dangerously stopped being a bad junior high school production. I missed the laughter several times, especially when Agustus's daughter Julia was telling a lover. They are emotionally touched, as they breathe: "My father ..." "Oh, your father, your father ... will disappoint your father." Peter O'Toole forced to gn gnour his way through some very pompous and silly lines, at his worst times. Actor who played Agustus as a young man, so silent --- --- and the character is written in this way --- it is impossible to think of him as the driving force of the Roman Empire, the tricky, the Mackievelian politician. Here, he will only know who will have to do most of the time who is a sunny man. <br /> <br /> With the role of Charlotte Rampolong, Agustus's wife was able to get an underrated role as Leviya. If he plays a full role to play, he can rescue this product from irrationality. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent photography and war footage, which is supported by most standard issue CGI. Curious, it was made for British TV (and it seems to be British-Italian co-production) but it is labeled with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> DVD image is nice and the Dolby Digital Soundtrack is very nice, although you can watch it in a few sequential time periods, even though the movie speaks mostly. <br /> <br /> Historicality of almost any Roman film, even "Cleopatra" or "the fall of the Roman Empire" - this wonderful classics Illustrated, without junior adaptation --- not to say anything dramatic --- This is a very unpleasant phrase, "based on a true story." In this case they could say, "Proposed by real events."
