It was a sordid and dreary mess. When it was needed a shower. Something like this happened - some socialism was murdered and a female genocide was filed in the case of detective. He discovered that these victims belong to underground gay societies, and he made friends with the associate who may have relevant information. Since detective is an interesting woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which expresses much about her psychology about Hollywood and women). What's amazing is that this is very sexy or attractive, just depressed and lucky. Elen Barkin gives a respectable performance as lead lead, and Julian Sands provides senseless smiles as cross-dressing psychiatry, it escapes from a one-star rating.
