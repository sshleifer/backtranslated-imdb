****** ******* What spoilers in a dull, predictable, non-frightening snore-fest. There was no development of the character in the film: I did not feel sympathy for any characters (except the little boy), and did not care for anything of them. The film was so stolen from the so-called bit, or other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This movie was so much expected. Many times I would say to myself, "Guess, {Fill the guesswork} next?" Yes, I was right. Even in the opening scenario, I predicted that the family was "attacked" by some people, probably the father (because only wives and children were attacked). Sure, enough happened (of course, wait 79 minutes to be sure). And, of course, other "evil people" scenario. Why did he kill evil and his family? Because he is a man, double! <br /> <br /> Anyone else said that this film can be awful for anyone under the age of 13 or for a movie of the 1970s, but it's a 'horrible' movie by today's standard. And, like many other shit horror movies, there was a lot of fear "fakes". Scary music, scary music, scary music, and a crow flies suddenly through the window! Wow, scary! I thought the old man was the ghost. No, just a crappy movie. <br /> <br /> I've rated 2 of the 10 ratings for this movie, because I kept my attention enough to keep the whole thing in check.
