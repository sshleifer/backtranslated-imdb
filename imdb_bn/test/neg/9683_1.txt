Oh boy Where do I start over this piece? This is one of the few real high-budget movies on my list that I think is appropriate to give 1 rating and it is not for production quality which is quite high. This movie has no respect for the account in the Bible and uses the whole story as a ridiculous imagination. I could not recommend to anyone, except for the society we were less than ... <br /> <br /> First, there was no friend with Noor Lot. Anyone who can actually read Genesis can tell you that Abram is thinking about them. The author is trying to find the story with the whole Sodom / Gomorrah subcontinent, and it seems to have come out of place. Noah is considered to be a lovely Gopbal ("You are kissing! You are kissing!") But at least it has stepped up one step above Viet's delightful practice in Anakonda. <br /> <br /> However, these crimes are faded compared to God's discriminatory behavior in this movie. God is portrayed as a small, obsolete, who changes his mind within a little bit. ("I'm the perfect one, but I could be wrong") What? Where did they get from? Such a God ... no one will ever pay attention to less attention, praise, or love. What is the director's statement, I do not know. I just know that a responsible treatment for Noah's ark should not be taken so easy. These people are involved.
