All the criticism of this movie is quite legitimate! It's quite annoying, and filled with all kinds of vague ridiculous elements. A couple exchanged nods on their "good grub". Before a phone ends, a medium shot of the phone, as long as it comes up, sits and responds at a beautiful speed. When people take the quart or look at things, look at things. Exclusive banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. A joke is said to be a shower, trying to learn about a big mouthed frog, what her children eat, complete with a lot of big mouthed expressions (are needed for the weak punchline). The walnut and cream cheese on the walnut bread share the sandwich, which becomes unpalatable which is squeamish when people burned in the fire. Many of the stock-footage mortgages of wild animals, birds, insects and spiders are visible. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with forest fire, at least some decades later, some people were killed by an ax of the same wood. The killer is obviously not pleased with theft, and the other person's chance of scouring or killing him with his bare hands. <br /> <br /> The off-print video clip is cut, perhaps if many footage is spent, it is suitable for another look in the DVD. Otherwise, it is not only very interesting, and perhaps even the most hardcore foreign-slash fan will try to be patient.
