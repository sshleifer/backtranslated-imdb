I love Japanese movies - at least 100-200 saw. So it is clear that I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes Japanese ideas for the film that do not translate well to the West. They might hit at home, but they just do not think that abroad, well, ... normal. It's like a live fish that my wife has played in a business meeting or a wonderful PS2 game such as dating simulators or Katamari Damasi - which takes things that confuse non-Japanese. It is probably the other way that Americans allow for football, frozen snickers bars and Paris Hilton such as the United States! The King of the amazing Japanese film, which seems not right to the Americans, can only be Itma-Yama. Now the style of animation is not a problem - it's different but it's nice enough. No, it is the idea of ​​the story itself and rather the wicked ends. This creates this truly extraordinary film and it goes like this: There was no stanny people, because of any reason a tree was growing in its head due to any reason. It was very few in the beginning and it was easy to cut, but it grew up again and again - so he decided to do it right. And, after a while, people started to live on their heads under the shade of trees. Curious, they were down the tree, but when they left, they were small but they were full size again. Then, finally it all became sick and shake the tree, the man drowned (!!) In the hole on his head, where the tree was! The end See <br /> <br />! I have told you very, very weird - but not as good as the bliss or happiness of Katakura - just curious. O-D-D .... odd! And if you do not have too much tolerance for this type of thing, I doubt if you can not win the Oscar-nominated movie but you feel bad. Actually, it makes me happy, because I really do not want to spread like this movie. This is a reason to achieve 4 beautiful but not spectacular animations. <br /> <br /> This image hit my brain ... I hope I do not have any trees!
