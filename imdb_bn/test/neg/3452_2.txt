This is a poor film. It certainly does not belong to a feature film category. The story, direction, acting and style are all flat as a pancake. Story consists of five ?? Yes five Football matches spread over the time of the film, more annoying than the end, because an effective amateur football team has the power to gain strength. That's it, it's a plot. It's hard to know about this movie. It's very great for football fans and there's nothing to be thirteen or older. There is nothing in it for women, and not even a single female character. The game gives you neutrality after the game is played after the game is played. The story, such as it, conversations and procedures seems to have been raised from a Eastern Ireland, that the actors brighten the pronunciation of theoretical Dublin. It will not be seen to believe. To avoid all costs. Someone can give me back my 90 minutes. At the end of the high point credit, mention the very few points mentioned. Brendan Gleeson in this picture.
