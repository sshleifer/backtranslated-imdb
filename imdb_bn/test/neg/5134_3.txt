OK, I do not want to bother anyone who enjoys this movie, but it was a bad movie. The scenes were edited and like the acting process, it made me cringe on some points. I really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have the lowest budget. I really like the lines of the story and the letters were preferred, but the whole movie was just awesome. Also, why is one of the lesbian characters in almost every movie being killed or died or straightened?!? It is therefore sent a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything I think was my very kind. If you want to laugh badly, just watch this movie.
