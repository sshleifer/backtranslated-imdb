This is another notorious Mexican horror film: However, the original Spanish-language version is quite spontaneous, though all kinds of cows and nudity were inserted for the English-Doubled Variant (prepared by Gerald Intrater) - the famous Dr. HUMPP [1967/71] - And, the American version of that movie, previously available on DVD, was a bit weird). <br /> <br /> I saw the original and when it did not make a great smile, it was fairly compelling - especially with a conspiracy known as: A doctor went out of the dock to save his life; Even Crying Lomas McTeague (who played by Carlos Lopez Mccitujuma), even played a fierce similar role - although he tried to create more serious veins in the attempt of Crimeing Women [1961]. I know that several Mexican films were horrible with the "Luca Libre" (Wrestling) style, but I never saw myself; This element is here - actually, the heroine is a wrestler - but two styles, probably thanks, kept with each other (which says that wrestling sequences are done efficiently, some steps prove very ridiculous). <br /> <br /> The doctor's son has transformed into a giant (like an incredible hole in a hole with holes on his face!) after being transferred into an eighteen heart - but when it is replaced by a comotose, the female wrestler There are ways and a pair of bouts are going to boot (he will not actually become a transsexcloth ... although I'm allowed I did not know that it was too funny) !! The Climatic Chattel order reminds Frankenstein's Gahst (1942) that the monster kidnaps and meets his death with the police. Although my favorite is a strange moment, when the doctor tries to comfort his son, he tells him that he will cure soon - only after the tear of the tide will he have to go back - and the unexpected look he is going to pursue the giant who escapes from the lab Helpless assistant (later in the car slowly between vehicles). <br /> <br /> The alternative nude scenes work for the film (this was actually a cardinal named Cardo Hormaro Yo Sico, a recipe for the Mexican version), but his fame was originally based on the top violence shown above, for example Being graduated from a jaw socket, scaling and even a person's head being shattered off. There are several graphic operations that are inserted, however, raising a cave: Although it is clear that only two are involved in the operation, we keep oxygen mask in the patient with a third pair! <br /> <br /> This picture is thought to be a remake of Cardona's black and white horror movie Doctor of the Dead (1962), but I did not see it, I can not tell how much bloody APES was pilfered for the night. ...
