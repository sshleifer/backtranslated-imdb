Years ago the "MA2412" feature film tried to be some "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is certain: I hope no one else can see it. Perhaps you are familiar with real sitikom, but it may be interesting to see director Sekheritz making his series. I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> So many directors and writers have failed to create a consistent series idea in the 90 minute movie (Alpha, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult it is to see "MA 2412". My opinion is that these efforts result in a lasting TV episode (and not a good) like taste. It fails to provide a plot, humor tries very hard and the guide looks very candid - like holding the truth for the visual style. <br /> <br /> So briefly I would not recommend this ...
