I think "Section 6: Destruction day" was very unrealistic. Digital effects where a children's cartoons are like. Actors did not work, for example, when the girl was shot to death, she acted as if she had spread the tomato sauce on it. <br /> <br /> The movie was annoying but I saw it because it was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is so annoying, I think my comments will be equally annoying.
