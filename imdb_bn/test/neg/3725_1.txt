I want 99 minutes in my life that the unfortunate excuse for the movie has been broken. The acting was awful! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent d'Anfrio. I will not look at them again the same. Kaneu Reeves and Dan Ikrod were not surprised. Everyone knows they can never work. Thankfully, only Dan tried an expression. There was a disaster as expected of her pronunciation. I think he was confused about the location of the movie or did not really talk to Minnesota. I hope that this review helps anyone who is uncertain about what their valuable time will be. The only reason I could sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without good things to see or read.
