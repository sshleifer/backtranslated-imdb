Danny Glover and Kerry Ellis have obviously forgotten how they will act while creating this film, the act is absolutely cruel. Pay off even worse I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he has paid a lot for this because it makes him feel completely fooled, in the same way Mr. Elias also goes. A slap in front of a horror movie fan, just slap. Hateful This is probably the worst show I've ever seen veteran actors performing. I think if they are annoyed to see the script, or if they "forget about what you know about acting", of course it sounds ridiculous. Frustrating for two season visitors to act in this manner, I hope the salary check was too big, I thought, first of all, it was a fool. If you get satisfaction in this movie then you have more power.
