This second time I have removed enough to write a review. Unfortunately, they have been for both films that can be described with four alphabetic words which can be defined as symptoms or emissions. Other films of this type of film were masks and anonymous. <br /> <br /> Anything wrong with this movie ... in the review .. I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Steven has lost his plot (ie, all his other movies, family / friends die, Steven becomes angry, Steven kills man). <br /> <br /> Steven was out of the money at the beginning, there was a good car's Chase scene, but I think he blotted out his budget and could not afford a suitable script writer or editor.) <br /> <br /> 3) Steven does not seem to be doing his job. Instead, (from memory) 2 was shot from the bottom and back of the battle scene, so you could not actually see her face. Probably a stunt double. I'm guessing Chuck Norris. <br /> <br /> .. The worst Seagal movie ever. In the recent history I saw the second worst movie, and I saw many bad movies.
