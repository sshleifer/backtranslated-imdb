This movie was trying to do something, but sadly failed. All the attempts of suspense were cheap, and there was a lot of tedious disguise and plot holes, which I eventually became laughing and it joking through the whole way. At least I was entertaining. <br /> <br /> The ghost is trying to warn the family, why they attack the girl, whose name I did not remember. And what was black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they were too small. And where did that man (John Carbert's character) go? She is just a huge field where no one waltzes from. And when Raven came, why did he lose again? And if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why would they try to kill him if they attacked him? Does not express any meaning. Many things in this movie are not only sensible and the actress is not very nice in the part of the main girl character. It's not terrible, just a little like his kiddy movie day. <br /> <br /> So there was no brightness in this movie, but I had a good time, and sometimes it needed a horror movie. No quality for entertainment.
