The columnist right. I completely agree with all your feelings and add these. I especially came to my PC to post a comment in this awesome (minus) brigade movie. I wanted to say that at this day and age, I understand how someone could possibly create such a harmful movie - but you hit me. Anyone reading this and Colmyster's comments, trust me ---- do not waste time and money on you. This is an absolute shocker. The acting is unfortunate, the worst way to script, and (so-called) special effect is a joke. Of course, did not invest any money to make this movie? I can not say anything about this so-called horrible science-fi product, but to admit it for submitting 10 comments, it must be padded.
