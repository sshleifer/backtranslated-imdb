After reading about an hour-long reading novel, the film has become sadly frustrating. Like the Prince of Egypt's Prince of Wales, he operated any script that removed all the drama and mystery from its source material and made homogenized futile. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie absolutely no sense made. There was no pleasure in performance or any comedy. There was no thread and there was a hacking straw in the last image of Edy's character throwing his hat in the stupid bookend. After the end of this movie I have violated very much and I still refuse to believe that it's just 90 minutes to go forever. I was thinking how the studio and the director could fix such frustrating scripts but then inserted my friend's picture to me just as it was and I said the arm looks fantastic but what happened in the movie.
