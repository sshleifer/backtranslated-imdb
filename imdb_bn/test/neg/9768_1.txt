This movie is absolutely awesome! I thought because the Gabriel Union, Hill Harper and of course infamous Billy D. There was a good actor like Williams. The film is long, and has gone through a documentary style to talk about the family of Gabriel Union, who died in the film; Which way is confusing family because you never know who, and who is related to. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, and I hope I'll be back here. I fell asleep during the time of frustration. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. It can be more true in life with more dramas, and less annoyance.
