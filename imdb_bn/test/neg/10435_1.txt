You feel like watching a kindergarten game. The story hides the hole and the gap is full and skips so there is no idea as to what happened to you. Half of the scenes are pointless. Character development is not an inkling. There are about three songs in the score / soundtrack, which typically play around 70% of the scenes. I'm glad that I only hired the movie and I still feel cheated. If you do not want to give some decent actors awesome performance, avoid all the costs of this movie. It seems that most of the budget has been used to name some of these bad films as brand actors. This movie is similar to visiting a strip club, it tries to get you excited and interested, but you feel that you have some related relationship and are trying to discover how you've reached it.
