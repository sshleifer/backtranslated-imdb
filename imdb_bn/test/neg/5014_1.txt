This movie was like waste on my money. It was annoying as well as annoying. Honestly, I would not recommend anyone this movie. Which movie thinks a girl beat her dog? Seriously ... It was a waste of my time. I see the movie, hope it will be better and a plot will appear but it never happened. I would like an F-rate movie. This movie should be rated for its annoying nature. I do not have to give children of any age to watch this movie. This movie sucks. This movie is awesome. This movie was a waste of my time. Instead of renting this movie, I could spend some time in my time. The loss of gas for this movie to go to the store, and of course, was the waste of two dollars to see it. Quite a lot, someone would watch this movie. This movie should be banned and burned.
