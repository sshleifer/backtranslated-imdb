I saw this movie quite bemused. I'm not sure whether this is a rubber jumbo type or trying to make a terrible Gore Festival to explore real events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Performance was not compulsory or bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I liked a more psychological perspective and this image could easily pass this route without spoiling the overall effect. .
