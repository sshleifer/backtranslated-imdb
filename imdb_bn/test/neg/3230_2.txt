Okay, my question is; The film written by the fool, who gave the same name as Dean Kongt's wonderful book? Its terrible, nothing like book ... you got the dog, and the voucher, but the equality ended ... If you do not read the book, it may be good though ... but it disappointed me, really. <br /> < They should be made a new one, and let's write quotes ... now it will be a good movie ... I will say again, this movie hated me ... absolutely hateful to me It was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like books. I will not see it again.
