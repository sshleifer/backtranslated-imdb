... when we all know, no one likes BBC. <br /> <br /> This Sunday night being such a cheerful fan, I was looking forward to it. I was so disappointed! In the first thirty seconds I do not think that it was committed and after two minutes I was hard to see it. <br /> <br /> However, my friends and I found only bad acting and utter misunderstandings in half of the letters. This conspiracy is extremist and makeup and constuus gaudy and 'BBC Robin Hood' style moves quickly towards the 21st century. This modern style has been able to place a sharp camera angle and apparently in sculpture but unfortunately we are not. This instruction felt fiercely fugitive for both acting and shot favorites. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we could not visit it and go out and go to 'Prostija' (which is very good btw). I am wrong in judging it because I rarely see it, but seldom I remember something that people warned not to see anything! However, both me and my friends thought that the house and parasol were beautiful - but it gets as good as it does.
