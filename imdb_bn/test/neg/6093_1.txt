If you make a suspense movie, it is "important" that "villain" is not more sympathetic than "hunting". And this sad fails. It really was removed to register and comment so it was very frightening and frustrating to see. OK, so the husband is wealthy and cocky. There is something worse, and the poetry shows lots of boy and wife. Husband is a quarrel because she - Um, that woman is not physically able to attack physically - the witch is one which was absolutely nothing with the BTW Plot. Poetry threatens the boy's husband and tries repeatedly to persuade his wife. Then she puts herself on herself - the woman who gets so hot stops the thought of rape and she wants that she wants. Ohhhh Anti-corruption, inferior complex thinking is the rebellion displayed by the director. A fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to reach an understanding with Villen, but it is a matter when I felt like watching a film about Ted Bandy, but the director failed to make him unlucky, and instead we hated him. The victims He thinks ???
