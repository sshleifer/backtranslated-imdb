When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was very angry. It blew my opinion completely. I did not see it for a decade then decided what hell, let's see. I now see all hellraiser movies where it has been wrong. My guess is that it was with Siegel 5, which was the first to complete the implementation. "I'm in the dream, I saw the strange stuff, oh what's going on, her dream, she's no dream, oh wait I can see something amazing, oh no Mind "- the story. There is no need to keep the box open in that sequo, or follow the rules of the first four movie rules, if you have seen Pinhed, you are much more drunk and dead. The first 3 hierarchists screwed the story, which was so horrific in the first place. Nothing fantasy, something strange, they opened the box open. Kirsty is the only one who can lead astray, firstly because of Kaka Franc. Then he got information about Sinbite At least this movie has been attempted to engage with it, though it is a bad story, but it is still a little hacker. Not sure I was part of the first part of the 5 completely completely and completely destroying hellraiser series. Now they are remaking 1, and I do not think I'll see it. Oh, I'm crying I'll probably and probably be disappointed .... again.
