For the first time I am writing a comment for a movie that I have not seen until the credit. Simple reason for this ... people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I'm usually away from a good deal of comedy in bad taste but I can count to see it. A sad decision based on another Ashton Kutcher comedy (half) was enjoyable such as Lot Like Luv and Guys Hoo. <br /> <br /> Where those two movies had their glasses and smiles, they did not have any (and I mean nothing !!). The acting is horrible, especially 'boss'. They were not surprised at Red, she called herself an actress! The courtyard is thin and the plot is not all dense. If you manage to keep it fun and / or sweet then there is no problem ... but perhaps you have already guessed it is not a Cast! The script was felt completely not finished and I would not be bothered even if the director reviewed some of the shootings. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent script, seriously. And he is not exactly Lassie :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not enjoy this low quality movie ... <br /> <br /> I Not at all ... so 2.
