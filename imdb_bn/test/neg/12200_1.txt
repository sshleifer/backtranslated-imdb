My precious two hours was a complete and humorous game. The whole film can be made in less than 60 seconds, which is only to cool the people, the car accidents, the people growing up, people are being sexually, the people are crying, and the people are shaking even more. The tagline for this movie is to be read "Let's see how f * our characters are cked! They have thrown stones! They are a mess! They are a mess! Who do you really care for? Just give us money, please, because we are definitely another Do not worry about anything! "A terrible movie. It has never gone anywhere, you will never know the characters (they never told what these people have done for such a big house and so much money, car and what they earn), and it was merely boring. If you love the movie as a little more than a stoner, but this is not a huge number of us, this movie is a movie and waste time.
