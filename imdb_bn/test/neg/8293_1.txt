This movie is mostly publicized that this script creates the movie, but apparently it was not a script when they shot this waste! The trailer makes it a comedy, but can not determine whether the film wants to be a comedy, a play, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicate that Saturn and Hamlin made this movie because they liked the script (What are they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I), see "Free Enterprise" instead.
