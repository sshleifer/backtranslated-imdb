I'm throwing down in this review that I'm not crazy - I like Winrosky's many works - Deathstaller 2, Chapman Mall, laws against law fast and extremely enjoyable - just to prove I'm 'I'm not blind, some Shannon tayad' physical chemistry 3 or 4 Or some "with it, I did not find anything against idle sex sequences, but Julie Stren's breasts seem so unattractive, Can not justify but can look at them - which may have the desired effect but I could not enjoy looking at them - and many members of this caste seem depressed or uncomfortable - "erotic thriller" was the worst thing ever to happen in less budget flicks, And thank God that their days have been completed more or less.
