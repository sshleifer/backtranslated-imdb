Why did the Italians made the best films in the '50s and 60s, and then' in the 70's and 80's, did nothing else except the zombies and cannabis movies? Probably because art films do not make any money. The Casual Movie, which was contrasted with The Zombie Movie, created by 'Americans' and 'exploited' by the Italians, is a completely Italian creation, designed as a Mondo exploitation showcase and can earn as much money as possible (no artistic fidelity is available Not the way here).

All of the genuine fans will get a ball because it is a continuous generation for everyone. Rassimov and Curman have a visible eating contest. Agren exists only to be naked, raped, or in danger. There are a lot of 'gore' for many sick people Cancers, who actually think of native cannibals, drink lunch as a lunch. And, on the grand custom of the Kanibal movies, any live animal that showed onscreen, then died soon afterwards.
