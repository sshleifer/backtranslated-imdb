Actually this is not much in the movie. There are a number of important moments, and all the other things to say about an important moment before the movie starts. The initial process used in the story is flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they are not here. When there is zero indication in front or back, and there are several weeks of separation of events, so the context as the view of the scene is only known when something happens. Perhaps the purpose of adding mystery to these places was, but it was quite annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing 100 minutes of on-screen discussion, why are you asked about Long Live Bad, Enjoy For most movies, if you have been appealed to the majority of the worst scenes on the face of judging Gosling's face then you are lucky. Sorry, I can find no reason to suggest this movie. Oh, and another review has been mentioned, Spacy is really here in a Kyoyo role and is probably playing with an isolated isolation that you have already met. <br /> <br /> *** The rest are held back by a few big points *** <br /> <br /> Firstly, before the movie was opened before the so-called disabled child was killed and we did not learn what we learned. This meant that he was killed to stop deep sadness in the boy's eyes. There are no other inappropriate questions because the letters and lead outside the son are very numerical. <br /> <br /> How to deal with lead ... He is crazy about another review. I agree that he is not 'correct', but I will not call it crazy. It seems that the film has worked hard to prove that it was autistic or was otherwise disturbed, because he believed that slow and unable to understand clearly. Either that they or a negligent youth was with some isolation disorder and / or those who were heavily medicines. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at saying to the audience, but it seems that the air is deliberately released. This movie does not give any answers, just questions, but it's a bad movie that I really do not care about.
