Celebrity musicians always spend a hard time disturbing the film (the film is involved in failed attempts) and John Malleng can not think of it as an actor. Instead of taking small portions of hearty projects, Malenkamp was the leader in "Freilling of Grace", which he conducted, and the results were as weird and unexpected as the title. While opening old family wounds, Larry MacMarty took a screenplay while returning to his stomach, while the famous singer, but the scary movie is not gradually moving anywhere. Supporting cast is quite good, including Ken Lenz (who looks good to see it), Maryle Hemingway and Cloud Acne (who will really share the picture in a strong scene). As John's acting, he tried to look at the home, despite the clean effort, he did not look particularly comfortable; She seems to be docking the camera most of the time, and she does not immediately connect with viewers. * **** to 1/2
