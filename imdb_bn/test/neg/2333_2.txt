OK, we have a movie that never calls one of the best movies. But I'm sitting here thinking of hell! These stories are sux {which is not a story}, the dialog is very simple, nothing more artistic! , And the act is not out of the real, so if you want to claim it as aunty you like it, but if you have a real view then you do not like it or explain why!
