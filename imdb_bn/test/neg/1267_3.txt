This movie is a powerful statement as a political statement about the extraordinary talent, the torture and the politics of war against terrorism. Others have already commented on this and other aspects of the film. My review can have spoilers, so if you do not see the movie, you do not want to exceed this point. <br /> <br /> This question raised many questions by this movie. First of all, the hero is an atheist? Why the NSA decides why there is no satisfactory explanation for why it is chosen and transformed in the first place. Why does the NSA think of a terrorist who has received his phone call, and why is he innocent? If so, the movie does not seem to be one and it makes the whole movie unpleasant to me. All right and good to give a statement about whether torture is right or wrong, but first proves that they have mistreated the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the hero was guilty, what did he gain by releasing him? Probably, we were well trained to resist a certain point and then pretended to be broken and could prove to be wrong with some answers, so persecutors persuaded that they had accepted an innocent person, without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the movie that proves that he is also guilty. There are other unexpected endings: 1. Therefore, a barbarous CIA agent has released him and is returning home. Does the NSA prevent him from choosing again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to keep his neck taller in order to intervene on his behalf, then do you have to fear Corin Whitman? 2. If the NSA is tracking a phone number by calling it, why did not they listen to some calls to determine why some underwriters are being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid. A dozen brain cells, including a criminal, will transfer their criminal business to an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, and can not be returned to anyone and to their home. <br /> <br /> Whirling around the whole movie Tigers, in viewers' heart strings showing graphic and unrealistic scenes of torture But when you think about it in depth, then there is nothing in the substance in this movie, just a lot of inappropriate questions and "what, is this?" At the end of the movie.
