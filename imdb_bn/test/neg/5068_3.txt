Many like Tinto Bras ("Caligula"), people who make this film can not distinguish between explicitness and sexuality. No build-up all, just throw nude women on the screen; No, it does not work that way. If the female genitalia close-up is not your thing, be prepared to stay away from the screen at many points (I've often). "All women are crying over the heart", the film's mentality is offensive, and "the story" becomes weird and annoying (the most annoying part of Palau!). But through half it's a random scene that does not go anywhere and is involved in one of the nude wrestling matches (female) captives (male) guards, which he won with some judo steps. Although the war dancing is bad, the whole scene must be memorable. Actually, that scene and excellent cinematography are two reasons * I have two reasons for 0 instead of 0.
