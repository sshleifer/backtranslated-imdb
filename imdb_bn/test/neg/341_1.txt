There is a need to take a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> The terrible special effects of efforts to reach beyond budget constraints. Other science-films (such as pitch black) embellish and unashamed theft. Terrible acting. The continuous slow motion view of the characters walking aimlessly across the sand dunes. The slow dialogue that nothing to go ahead in the story. Characters wearing sweat of the planet's turtle necks in a desert with two suns. A "freight vessel" ship armed with a knock-up crew of gun soldiers (Why do you need to forest-camouflage in the right place?). The worst casting choices in a budget movie making history - a steroid lung "captain" who comes more like a muscle joke than a trusted commander and is a "guilty" who acts and acts dangerously as a rabbit rabbit. If you have any idea about 70 minutes in length, 35 out of 35 "if there is a shortage of time by correcting" it can be printed ... <br /> <br /> I will not go. Some of the material in this horror movie is enough to say it (and should) forgive it due to low budget; Bad ideas, ridiculous plot holes, and graduate-motivation scripts * No * budget powerless. The end result is a tired, dull, time-consuming waste. Sorry friends, I hate to be so strict in an amateur film, but there is no excuse to stop this kind of work.
