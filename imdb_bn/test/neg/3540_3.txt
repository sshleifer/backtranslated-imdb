I was really disappointed by this film which I was hoping high. It seems that it has come out to take advantage of the success of Scrabble Comedy (MGM's own "Libeled Lady", which includes two stars in the same way) and the success of William Powell and Mirna Laay. Three years into their pair, they were interesting to watch and fill in their scene together, but a weak script and the "Libeled Lady" of the previous year's "Libeled Lady" and the beginning of the volcano "they have done this before." Double Wading "a clothing store Telling the story of the manufacturer, Mourina Laay, who is her sister (Florence Rice), the future brother (John Bell), and his own servants (of which C Tolyner and Mary Gordon). The independent soul William Powell came to his life, confused rice and Bell from the regular control of the fury, Loy favors his match, so good, okay? Yes, an interesting trend seems to be minimal Because, because of sadness, the character of Lion is so quantitative, it is very difficult for him to think that Powell fell in love with him, which we know soon Instead of changing her career psychology, instead of changing her life, she is trying to make another attempt instead of changing her life, which was often in Hollywood's golden age, when Loye said that she did not have time to run her business and there was a man in her life, A crying. Thankfully, there is a free spirit Jesse Ralph on the board besides Powell. A soft rich elderly woman who helps Laay start her business, she meets Paywell and can see immediately through Lley's great demand that she hates him. Rice and Bell are a boring couple, and Powell's full seat among them is shameless. Then, Powell's ex-wife showed that it is not really necessary at the end of the story, and the final wedding scene (where the crowd tries to reach Powell's small trailer) is a weak effort, some of Farce's. (While it is interesting, Powell Edgar is being hit by things meant to hit Kennedy; most of these chocolates are welcomed, because only a few are there.) Powell and Fay will work better in two sculble comedies. Love you again "and" crazy love ", which is sophisticated, diverse and fun. The film tries to do three, but a sophisticated bore end.
