The film's trailer promises a new twist in the Zumbi style: it sets in the Old West. It is without real Old West, of course. It is a somewhat future West, in a world where there are some apocalypse, such as apocalypse, killing people and later turning them into zombies. Does it mean that, again, during the zombie virus, folks, and you know? Get a cat and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, a hero comes in this dusty and dead world. She is paid to care for a giant-hunter, zombies. It is not clear whether the fund's supplier, however, seems to have emerged a little bit of zombie cottage industry. However, the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They are running out of zombies. The only way to continue earning is to infect new cities and cities with viruses. <br /> <br /> I think this is not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it's a good idea and a crowd of people pawing Windows to make a good zombie film takes a lot of people. Are we really Clint Eastwood Clone (the actor is calling Quinta), and his "Sunny" sidebar, trying to bag some dead body behind some surviving bad boys to survive. The entire theorem for transmitting other cities is exclusively crossed by halfway through the film. Instead, there are many Western movie reviews, poor zombie make-up and some world-class bad performances. Really bad. Sorted that does not even make it onto Hollyoaks. Both heroes and villains in cigars are thrown quip, quip, man bites. In the conclusion of the church of the film, the only thing worth the surprise is that if the only person of the hero is ending with the living person, he who killed him, killed him, or turned him into a zombie in the final final. Frame. (This is the first, on the way) This image was written and directed by Gerald Knut. He did the only thing and, hopefully, it will end it. At the beginning of the film there is a caption that reads "Not Entertainment". At least they got one thing right.
