This movie has a great feeling, great love story ... its perfect view, all the visible work, original original work, the characters had all the potential and skills to work ... but the story was removed from a chess, the next most likely way ... There is no depth of a character in the film or no depth is explained by the director. What we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she is obsessed with her earth ... nobody allows her and nobody challenges her world ... it is quite clear ... but each of the remaining characters has its own level I did not really express or expose ... the character of Haroon Akert was much more for the story but was not allowed, Abigail Breslein The character is so easy to understand that its performance is somewhat predictable and stupid. In the end, everything goes back to the forced disgraceful world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, which does not fall completely to the audience .... In fact, her dishonored world is a selfish, self-confident It is not much more than portraying an insulted woman, which is often a lot of time or time for the real world Anubhuti not be. The director did not have to make him a hero ... .in the end, it was the character of Ichhurst, which ultimately won because he won. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary movie, just a movie that can be a lot better than a lot of personality, explain and publish. <br /> <br /> Cheers
