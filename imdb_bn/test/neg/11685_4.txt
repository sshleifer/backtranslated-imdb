First there are some plot holes in this movie. We see very soon die from playing a baby game. But who was confiscated in the mail tower? How does the driver keep the package in the mailbox when the driver is running in the steering wheel? It's not like he's Mr. Fantastic. Outside the first 15 minutes ... the actor's second rate, Patrick Kilpatrick ("Who?") Has played "Bad Guy". He made everything in TV on one episode and played some secondary role in poor films. Like this). So acting like most TV dramas, I can live with that, but the graphics or special effects are awesome. The "new" voice sounds as a poor clone of "Space Odyssey 2000". They looked more like a jumping shadow like the monkey from what the Zombies called "Dye Planet". There was a clear body like Eliens' shadow jabbis. In most cases, the film was only predictable because it had no hook or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but the best ideas to discuss the midday meal were not overcome in that good idea level.
