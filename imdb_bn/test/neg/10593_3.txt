I was not really old enough to appreciate the old mode squad, but I knew everyone was pretty cool. I have "books" based on some screen-to-print collection series and they are quite light, so I did not expect much from the movie. This is a good thing, because this movie was a bad lash. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the risk of making such a genuine movie on the 1960s hit. Film viewers have achieved sophistication for 30 years. At least I think so. I must hopefully have one of the original mode squad ideas and more than one and a half year old (now old) car racing (currently considered to be poor) camera work, (Tiny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) scripts and all major screens In the 1960's, we did not care too much because we had low expectations. Along with Suet, an integrated police party was enough for some defeated young people. This was another exciting episode of "IranSides" or "Password". <br /> <br /> Set this "episode" against the publication of the normal theater, the story ... well, I'm not sure I should also because I was not sure that there was one. Not good to drugs? Anyway. The script was stupid. When the characters exchange the dialog and "I've heard it call" and "I think I've got a plan" lines are moving forward, we're really having trouble. Acting was not terrible, no one knew how to say such a stupid line. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Das, then after my agent I would go with the thunder. (Actually, I think that watching the movie and watching observers have the right to demand punishment.) <br /> <br /> And where was that Skode Mod? I understand that these kids have just left the teenage hall, but were not there a velvet suit? "Mod" meant only young and coordinated? What White Boot But Boots? Perhaps the costume section is going for snowfall, but what they found was dirty and dingy. <br /> <br /> Since the original series of movies was completely true, and actors, cameramen, stunt men need special behavior, etc., we should also appreciate more. Unfortunately, I still do not like it. I want to watch the crime drama of 60, I want to buy a DVD. No thanks.
