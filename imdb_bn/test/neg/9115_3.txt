Setup for "the nature of the seeds" is easy, and is associated with an unlimited potential for suspension: The disappointing salesman Jack (very tired Lanes Henriken) has been a victim of Hitler's Adrian (Eric Roberts), who thinks he is responsible for Jack's capture of information. Oh, and more than a million dollars have been stolen from casinos and someone known as 'Hachat Man' scattered people in the desert. Great, right? Sort of "Hitler" like "Psycho." Meet one of these two or both is a secret mysterious, and nothing seems to be! Well, unfortunately, there is not enough idea for the writer-director Viktor Salwa ("Zipar Cripps" and "Powder" fame) to continue the film, the scene does not create any tension or suspicion (which is supposed to be 'Thriller'), and an underlying Homo- Place of love included in the tone. Henriquesen raises an unusual, astronomical omnipotent person (even a broad gesture play), but Roberts is more threatening and frightening among "Death Wish 3"; We are not silent at any point where we are careful about what's actually happening, and the slides slide in the unlikely region (I think it's going to be a "Fight Club" but I was wrong). very bad. "Wild nature" can be something else ... instead of something else.
