To start, I'm not a person to rate movies I've never seen, or not I'm not a person who rated movies 1 when they did not qualify. This movie was really bad. The basic plot was very startling and it was not great, but this plot was worth 5. The part that really bothered me is to mention swimming in the film. I summed up a short list of the wrong things on this photo by swimming. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No ideas at the time. 3. Completely wrong swimming scene, which includes: a. There are a few things about how a group of six swimmers mention both "national" and "regional". B. The same team was going on with the fact that any real meeting of the film was going on without swimming. C. The rival program runs from high school to high school to high school and then to club again. D While Alice is interviewing for the job, banners determine state-run winners and positions in high schools, but depending on what is happening in 3 meetings, the team has anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers. E. 5 people win a party and a girl national / region whatever. F. The girl said that she won 100 men's butterfly event. G In this competition, the girl disappointed the two from a group that was at the top of last year in 3 countries. J. The announcer can change a race from 200 seconds to 100 breasts and reverse 200 to 45 seconds. I am The final relay, 4x100 in the 50-meter long course pool, which is swiming, a swimmer is turning two flips. J. In this same relay team anchor fixes the swimmers and closes the blocks, giving an inspirational pep talk, which can take approximately three and a half minutes or almost three times to meet any national qualification. T It is believed that the film started in July or early August, when Alice appealed before the school began and the pool was closed within 3 months, so both of these things have been held to be true, swimmers could not swim, fewer than two citizens / In the regional wins, such as the pool was cleaned and the kids did not practice for some time. L I'm sure there are a few more, I'm just trying to block them in my memory. 4. There is no single mention of swimming time during the film. 5. If you are going to get a movie for swimming, it is better to take extra extra rent while swimming well. 6. The child who kicked the child in the water is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> Those who say that the swimming scenes were very slow, the swimmers had terrible tactics, and the ability to be eligible for the idea was. Within three months of learning to swim, national matches are available only to swim everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you still do not trust me, then tell me that this movie is one of my worst 5 movies. Ever seen, and this guy is coming from Gogli, Soul Plane, Manaus: Fate's hand, Skullduggery, and any scrap owner on the film. Please do not go!
