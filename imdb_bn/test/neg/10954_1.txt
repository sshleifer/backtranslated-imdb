This movie baffled me I could not get a grip on it. Thought I could be missing something. You are most glad to see that you agree with me. This is not always the case (RE: see my recent review of extinction). <br /> <br /> More time to explain on the flaws of this movie will be a glorious waste ... so I will. <br /> <br /> They are dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, is not it? Any? I do not get it ??? When I picked up the box, I thought: Jambi Western! Cool! That's how it is presented Still not seen I hope they did well. <br /> <br /> They are not! They tried to create a series that would create a series. They do not. <br /> <br /> They tried to create an Aussie Indy Jamby Flick very well on the skill of "UNDEAD" (and perhaps revolving around quote tiles). They do not. <br /> <br /> They might have wanted to create such a confusing, confusing, silent mess in the film, which could eventually be edited to see something. They are not! This is the newest number 2 on my list of the worst job movies. Surely both of them have ever been, "Day of death: CONTAGIUM" is the first (not to be confused with "Dead Day", which is always one of my favorite zombie films). If you're going to create a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie film maker, I'm just a conjurer) make a good one. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of recent recent zombie films. FYI <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are truly forgiving, you might think, well, do not we think that we do not want our money back? Guess they're ... No!
