Jim Brown created a story set in the Philippines after the Japanese attack. The story is taking away some Japanese Navy captives, of which there are several divers, which used to reach GoldAs Gulf of Manila, to recover gold. <br /> <br /> This is a dirty movie which aims to make statements about war and racism (this film does not use Edwin McCain's war in such a fine montage). Performance is just enough. Jim Brown is right, but he does not really show any kind of performance range that just standing there looking for him bothered. The set is noteworthy but rather cheap. This film has been a lot of star footage from the very beginning, including the most famous shot of the Japanese attack in Torra! You You! The use of such large budget sequences effectively makes the left side of the film a positive animate appearance; It reminds one that there are better movies that anyone can see. For me, the film seems to have half the original plot, silver recovery, and half the plot that just meets the time. None of this is even exciting until the end of the explosive. <br /> <br /> I'll pass the given option.
