This award has lost all my honor for Hugos. <br /> <br /> If there is a "prominent" panel, Butlester can not see or understand the specific story-related problems of Galactic, how much does it cost? Their reward? Answer: Not much. <br /> <br /> Award winning event should be an example of creativity and excellence, which is not proven in BG, I have seen this episode or any other. <Br /> <br /> Shooting in a satirical video is not "artistic", it is simply cheap. Reducing the camera is not "creative", it can be vulnerable and lazy. <br /> <br /> All BG showed that the most rewarding "academy" is how corrupt and prizes are, with a lot of PR money.
