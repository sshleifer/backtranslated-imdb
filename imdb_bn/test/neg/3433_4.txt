I think this movie is right. <br /> <br /> On paper, there is a person who wants everything in this movie! Romance, comedy, drama A bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and storytelling! <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the garbage in this movie is over, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) This is my biggest problem: edit. The worst part of this movie is the edit which I've seen briefly on the local car dealership ad. The performance can be improved by tapping the IVV with a defective Perkinson patient's cat. The scenes are talking with each other two characters and you can see their lip moving and audio / video is not synchronized because it is definitely dubbed. Why is it dubbed? I do not know! English dubbing in English! The voice is completed in the studio elsewhere in the specific view! Can not they find a boom-mic?! They are not expensive; Jesus, I even own one! And I do not make movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Kigon's lack of performance It really does not seem that he wanted to be part of this project, and his performance was d. R.E.E. Edited by Skit was equivalent to. For the school. At least John Cricincese showed some encouragement. Yes, John Crisinski is the only reason I rented this flick, and the only real reason to see it. He has done a good, malicious performance and he was the most three-dimensional character. The character of Dean Edwards was very thin, as was his face. <br /> <br /> The final ward? If you are a fan of John Crisinski, your time is valuable. If not, do not even bother. Edit
