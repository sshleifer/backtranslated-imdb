It was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( I said, I was really looking at it <br /> <br /> <br /> All the cell phones were shit, they all are flashbacks !!! <br /> <br> How does a good movie make the credibility of a movie? Yes, it is astonishing that the audience is surprised, but if you go away and go to the bulls #! t ... then what's the point? br /> <br /> Plus the main hijst is hijacking a bag! Pony could not see the team with its complete misunderstanding and bright prospects, which did not even have a great respect, they were all garbage ... French Idiots break through lasers with the lasers ... it can be mixed later when it Easy to do! Plus the type of stuff that was already done in at least one movie .. And then was stupid as well ... <br /> <br /> Also, there is no reason why this movie does not have half of 12 or 11! What is the difference between the half of this film's result? Half of the SCENES will not even be! <br /> <br /> The first was primitive. This was Chap! And it makes the whole team loose credibility. Especially in the Ocean itself for bowing down Bennet.
