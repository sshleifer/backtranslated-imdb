I used to think that it was one of the movies whose director could not read the book, it was really a little the same. It can be very easily "oriented" in a book for a great movie, and it was definitely the next but not the previous. <br /> <br /> There were several errors. One was that it tried to train as much as the children of the railway, perhaps adults had such a hope from adults. Another is that it wanted to be like Harry Potter, the song below and the settings were of great importance. I have nothing against JK Rolling or movies, but the book is nothing like Harry Potter. I think Symmed, though very well edited by Eddie Ezard and character, was almost surprised by the almost inappropriate environment. I missed something here, because the comments made about one of the characters in their own books can be a reflection of the inability of adaptation. There was no need for additional character, and today's special effects can easily be called a story, but they were not. <br /> <br /> I saw this picture with my two children, one of which knows the book and no other. Anyone who knows it was right but because he is not enthusiastic, he was not. I'm not sure what this means.
