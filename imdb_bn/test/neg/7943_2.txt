This movie definitely does not mean to smile to me but that it was just funny. Well, again, mine and my friends got so much fun. <br /> <br /> I doubt about this movie that has not been done at least twice before, the plot is exactly like this. All characters use Movie Clicht to make cardboard-box roles too much that do not require acting skills; Accordingly, such skills are not distributed. Our corrupt police, a ruthless killer who claims to care for his men and their families, when he claims to care for something that is trembling on his shoulders in the forehead so that he is bloody on his face. We have "police penetrating on the edge", so the discussion board of this movie is well-noticed; Retiring from our old one-day police, who should be known only to the closest person to everyone, because he had the most profits and he did not say the faithful word throughout the film. By viewing as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster King, in the history of the film, was a copy of all the big black gangster kings (they could only call him Marcellus Wallace), but a little rigid and more ruthless, because some need to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fisborne, actually a good movie. Then we finally have a highly educated doctor, since the situation is different from normal life and can not think of doing anything to spend the majority of movies sitting in a corner helplessly. The arms are given to him. It does not use. <br /> <br /> The whole blockade story is not interesting, not real (previously used twice), and this movie does not move to add something interesting. If there is initial investigation, then block the blockade, then attack, then the escape attempt. Meanwhile, intense, pressed, forced police and thugs attacked police with the utmost high-tech equipment and VIS important facilities. Then again, on a deep night, with power cuts and snow storm overhead, there are lots of light coming out, so who really is aware of night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best part comes to the end. In the first scenes shown in Princeton 13, we see it located in an outskirt of an industrial town; All sides of the factory and office buildings surround it. From this point, the surrounded is probably a hundred meters in a swivel and where are they? Some lanes are right in the middle of a forest! A forest! Where do that forest come from? Decided to establish a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How did this forest last fall, on a hill on the hillside of the city, when in the forest scenes it saw the deceptive flats? <br /> <br /> I leave the verdict from you here, and in your general sense. Go and see if you are looking for an unexpected good smile, I can really recommend it.
