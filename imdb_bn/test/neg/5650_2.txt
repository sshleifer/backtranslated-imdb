Well, I saw this movie based on high scores here (7.1 now), and some good reviews. Generally, I am a good guide while I'm playing an IMDB, although I was much cheated in this case. <br /> <br /> This movie is currently a detective story, as a Winnie Jones investigating journalist who is investigating the death of a construction worker. Dickens novel (mixed in the 18th or 19th century known as Rodd), which is related to the story of a murder. Both stories are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript in line. <br /> <br /> Interesting? This may be, however, the film has been terribly unsuccessful in several areas: 1) Acting. Mediocre is the best, but it is watchable. You can not expect a little more for a movie worse than your average UK sitikom. Especially on a score 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply terrible, distracts it and it's annoying. Especially pub music, and music which plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) Story. This is a big joke. There is a splendid plot hole everywhere and even the mandatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost fun. Moreover, without any detail, I can safely say that the last is irrational, and one of the worst parts of the year's story and story. 4) Camera-work. Sometimes camera positions and visions are confusing and do not provide any purpose as "stories". <br /> <br /> I am bold of a movie, and can see 1 to 2 movies per day, but this month I have easily seen the worst movies. Do not waste your money or your time in this garbage.
