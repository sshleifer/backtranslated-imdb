La Ragaza del Vagne leto, or terrorist express! The version I saw said that different passengers manage a long distance train. The three fool idiot, Dave, Phil and Ernie (Carlo de Mijo) board, and it is clear that they are in trouble because of disappointments and other passengers and employees who abuse them verbally. Juliet, a prostitute named (Silvia Deoniisi), accelerates the train while denying Dave, and he and his companions agree to keep the entire hostage hostage so that they can do an orgy with Juliet, and actually do not have some heroes and police The detainees who differ from those set about saving the day. Erm, it's really ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production is managed by Ferdinand Baldi and starts from full and complete crap completely. Written by George Eastman, the legacy Montenegro script can be described simply as an annoying porn as a scary / thriller. It happened gradually slowly, some 35 minutes ago, and there was a lack of supply of the Italian sledding and the horror of the film completely in the film gradually, gradually. The film can be compared to other Italian production, which can be compared to the other, which was made in the same year as the House on the Edge of the Park (1980), a very broad comparison, which was made by Park Ege A House, which is notable for the notorious film La Ragazzo del Vagón leto Absent from there, there is no blood, there is no roar, there is almost no violence, only a few are actually raped, no twists or stories in the story And it is impossible not to see Dr boring. In the late 70's and early 80's, Italian sledding and horror were not known for its strong story lines or great scripts, but these movies scrap the barrel below all in all numbers. The character is scary, the film spends more than 30 minutes and gives them some backgrounds why they are on the train, but it quickly forgets and forgets nothing at all. I finally hated the hair and I do not know if I missed something, but there is no reasonable explanation why these three lamps will hijack the train? I do not think there was? I'm sorry but your anger is not enough to cause a prostitute, but if the filmmakers have not been more effective then it can become a bit more significant and interesting. In my opinion this picture has become frustrating, just as straightforward and straightforward as I am scared. <br /> <br /> Director Baldie is okay for the job, he has a darder and there are some train work so I will ruin him a little bit, saying that the film has been repeated very much. There is no style and she is full of bad scenes of bad scenes with sex scenes which are terrible romantic soundtrack piano music. There is not a single drop of blood in the whole film, it is not the only drop. If you do, you will be very disappointed but forget about any pregnancy or violence. There have been some rape but they have become unfriendly stage and have zero impact, nasty exploitation and sled-of-I-spit on you grave (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972). <br /> <br /> The technically La Ragazzo del Vagano leto is okay and it is very good that it has to be in a low budget, but the setting definitely helps to minimize it. The acting is poor as usual, although it has been wub since the original performance is lost. Italian horror fans can recognize many voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazzo del Vagón leto is a terrible movie, it's my opinion but I was tired of waiting for some event to tear and I did not feel trapped till finally, I wanted 80 minutes in my life. This part of the cat is not happy with your 99p VHS Dargahin Bin in your local blockbuster, to avoid it.
