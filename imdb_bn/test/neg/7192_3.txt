This is to reveal real killer to Newton and his true machine. <br /> <br /> Child-voiced hurler and Cigar-Champling Olas hit me as arbitrary pairs, but they made several films together in the 30's and they had some fun. <br /> <br /> This is not George Stevens, who has done a prominent career, has directed this frustrating comedy with a tedious murder plot. But two scenes are good, and both features Wheeler and Bati Grable are written by the excellent "Music My Mother Heart" song, Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHug.
