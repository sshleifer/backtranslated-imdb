Although the broken incognito group is the first movie, I saw it last. I was surprised to enjoy super truppers and I sat by the club drums and bearfest screams, they were surprised to hear an earlier movie. Now I do not sit with high hopes, but there was hope for a fun campus romp. My friend wanted to remember me that they are small (of course) and this is the fight for their first film. I was still disappointed and still. They did not take the BL's acting and comedy skills. The whole picture was tedious, cluttered and a bit annoying. Other actors in the film were really poor at acting. And the game of rugby was not even similar to rugby. Look poor They were greatly improved with Super Troopers and later declined. Hope to get back to form with Super Troopers 2
