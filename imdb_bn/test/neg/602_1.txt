This movie was a terrible light and awesome camera movement. This movie is a shocking horror blow with no money. Slash is looking completely fake. It looks like 17-year-old Idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old boy shot it. With the worst performances you can ever find. People are tired of the knife. At least move to the gun or fire. It's almost the right line from "when an unknown call". With deadly murders, only crazy people will enjoy this movie. It is clear that the authors do not care for kids or even for them. I mean to show some mercy. Just to add it, this movie is a "B" movie and sucked it. Just do not worry about losing your time while watching this crappy movie, for yourself.
