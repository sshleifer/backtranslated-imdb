The last "airport" sequels. This pilot has Alan Dellon and George Kennedy (who had all the movies at the airport); David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; As a newswoman targeted for Susan Blacky's death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert Airlines as President; Charo in a terrific "ridiculous" bit; John Davidson is a newsman (how his hair still stays beyond the planes! The poor head's judgment is insulted! Cicely Tyson plays a mother flying a heart for the son of his mother (turning your eyes rolling!); Jimmie Walker as an astronomer player (I do not smile about what Say?); Mercedes-McCambridge as a Russian gymstick coach (OK you can laugh at one); Bibi Endression is one As well as Silvio Cristal and Sibley's Dancing Girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Just unfortunate.Fool Plots and Conversations That You Need to Grow - See "Getting Married" on the Floor at the end of Davidson! Concorde Moving people to Russia, they escaped with missiles, fled, took land safely in France and closed again the next day. Will the flight be canceled? Or would you mind? Most of the acting is terrible - horrible myakakyamabrija a red wig and a terrible fake accent is a sight to see. Only the best acting Kennedy and delana (gorgeous looking) gives a very compelling performance. Still that you are not enough to sit through this drivel. Very long and lousy special effects too. It was a mega bomb and (grateful) and Universal stopped.
