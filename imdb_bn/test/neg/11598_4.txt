Comodo v. Cobra does not fire the earth! This is not a symbol of movie history. Is this a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to create another movie, creating another check mark and supporting themselves and their families? As I give this effort a lot of slack. I mean, come, it's hard to be Russian special effects technician. Many big budget films are not being made. But - they are more than willing to throw a dedicated bunch and all of them waxing America's giant flick affordable SFX. And I found the same flights repeatedly appearing on these flicks. If for some reason you see it again, then see the parallel order and the company walking through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you'll see curved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Ast" (shown in Saifai a week or two weeks ago), you will see people in trumps through the same ersatz forest. Come to think of it, I think helicopters are landless in the same clearing of both flicks. I can appreciate the thriftiness of this film. Every dollar does not really show up on the screen! Very bad there is not enough dollars ...
