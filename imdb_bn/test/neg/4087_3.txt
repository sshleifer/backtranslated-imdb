If you like me, you enjoy the first film "Bruce Almighty", my advice to me is not to get your hopes too much; In fact, if you are 12 years old and have no film-sense, then reject any hope for this movie. Without going too far, the story goes to Evan (an anchor from Bruce's Nemeses - Anchor from the first film), to move to Virginia's suburbs to "change the world" with a new political path with his family. The follow is a rather conveyed and quite a 'silly' story, which is clearly aiming to target small children as the main target audience. In contrast to its predecessor, Ivan Almighty is a family-based movie that has been tagged on the confusing sequel of 'Comedy', 'Siegel', in which some modern day comedy classics will be considered which are slightly more mature, upsellers. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Ivan Almighty himself is made of terrible cinematic value. Acting; Excluding Steve Carroll and Morgan Freeman was tough, and most letters were encouraged to use unnecessarily big budget to be issued for production. In addition, acting legends John Goodman who makes a look as a heel and the movie is fully seen only a few times; Although I did not buy the character quite well and the story also thought that he was involved in a family comedy or lack of depth. Each character of the film (especially the wife and children!) Is worthy of a significant mention in order to perform them, it can fill a king-size Kiev. Although be warned; This is the most common American-organized shadowfirst associated with mainstream family-oriented movies, so I suggest you to protect yourself with your closest closest buyer. It seems that the film is incapable, it has some promising aspects. The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that many times the animation of the ark and computer-generated animations ended in the end. Used particles, render and textures were aesthetically starred. Though my part could not help, it seems that these films were inefficient with such poor ideals and in my opinion, 'very good' for this piece and the film were taken across the whole. <br /> <br /> Overall, I saw this movie as a disaster in the continuation of a franchisee with huge possibilities, but unfortunately it was short for a bad conclusion of the All-Power series, and moving towards the end of the movie, I wanted my expectations for an epic Did the higher And since I ended up meaningful to make up for mediocre content I was so far witnessed. This was not the case and I deeply came off the frustrated and confused off-off credits. I am sitting in disarray, I could not help, but I think the movie was not like 'a super power' anywhere. In many ways the movie reminds me of "Night at the Museum" as it showed the same styling and features, but unfortunately they also had the following leagues. <br /> <br /> I'm giving 3 of 10 out of 10 movies, as it is watchable, but it's one of the avoids! If you want to watch this movie then be prepared to be depressed, hope to see the expected product of what you said as 'softly entertained'.
