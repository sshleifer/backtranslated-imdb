Sherlock Levis has acted as a pretty girl who has been terrorized by a ghost, who tortured him on the phone. On the road to terrorism, Charlotte is being forced to face this cold mystery to save her affection and her life. Believes that Raggero Doctoo, director of "Altimo Mondo Canibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Park of Edge of the Park", ran this weird part of the trash. Of course, Goblin's Front Claudio Simenita is good, but the story is a painful fool. Franco Ferini's writing is ridiculous and does not give any idea, the act is bad and absolutely no doubt. This scene where the prospective rapist of Charlotte Levis was killed by a coin coming out of the subway telephone. laughing. Do not waste your time on excluding this time. There are so many good Italian movies!
