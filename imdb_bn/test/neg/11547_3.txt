This picture is actually quite interesting, but it turns out to be very slow and predictable melodrama for my taste. None of the performance is particularly interesting and the camera work is only the studio TV movie staff, so if there are no bigger ones than Jeff Bridge fan, then there is no reason why I can not see this movie. <br /> </ br>> Mies Olson, announcing a young picnic that she is going to college to go to the streets, bridges play bridges. Her parents believe that she is talking about "just acting" and "she has no plans". He assures them that they have a plan, and he needs to discover the true self and the world of his place. It is so true that he invited them to go to the street and bought an ancient bus for the trip, which he and his father repaired in the bonding fashion of the true TV movie father-son. To this point in the film I was a little interested in plots and letters and I want to see that her stuck mother (sheep Miles) was going to respond to life on the street. The father and son started to satisfy him to travel with them, where there is a fun scene. They showed him inside the bus and he gradually became more interested, finally, in the windows, he had a few discussions about the opposite screen. The bridge was wonderful to his father (Carl Beatz, decorated with radio announcer voice) that he changed his mind. Dad assured him "the electric stove ... works every time!" <br /> <br /> <br /> It shows that Mike's only "planning" is something his "friends" Who introduced Hippies Rock festivals, found out random people. As soon as I saw the rock festival I was a little disappointed ... It was especially evident that the rest of this movie was not in the field of festival camps and on the street. But at least I thought that a decent band could be, well, if they could not afford Hendrix or Stones, they might have at least a hit or a little fit or something like this. No dies - apparently the only music for this festival is some horrific humorous group with orchestra, which feels like a poor imitation of the fifth level, and a boring announcer, who feels ridiculous. <br /> <br /> We are also introducing a set of hippy enthusiasts and their various medical melodramas. Cathy (Renny Generate) is the existence of her brain and a beautiful blonde girl in nature, who has fallen in love with Maddie, that she needs kidney dialysis to stay alive and went on to die. And 2 other campers are determined to be children of a child in their untimely tent, modern medicines and hippies initiate the struggle between ignorance (or something like this). It always gets more painful, anyone who suddenly or a real genre plays a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is mainly a waste of time, although it probably will enjoy such a person in the late 60's, early in the '70s and movies of that time are actually in time. Although I do not see it again though I want to be happy.
