First of all tell me that I believe in ghosts, and I really know they exist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People forget there are several ways to interpret "Bible", thousands of religion and beliefs, and what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in Stereo-ideal religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not create everything, one thing that should be mentioned in the Bible is that many people do not know that biblical blurting is breaking even the most heavily written rules .... one should wear multiple fabric at a time No, slavery is okay, and you can kill your neighbor in specific situations. None of these, "Oh, was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." The Bible can not be changed to the Word of God, and there should be no change, or version. Wrong interpretation of religion, mixed facts, and those who blindly follow it there, "There is no other way." The use of these blind-blind followers is frustrating, or they can not accurately explain the separation between themselves and instead use their orders from their priest or teacher. <br /> <br /> However, on the review side. I was a good fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show coming soon, I was very excited and I thought it was possible. As much as I like to see "Ghost Hunters", I do not like some members of them, and they do not like to dismiss a place to be disappointed, but I can not explain what is happening. Just because your inquiry does not pick it on the equipment, the camera does not show the camera. I am satisfied, they are skeptical, but they do not realize that you have not received anything from your recorder and the film does not make a violent place. Scratch was easy to capture, it would not be known as a belief, a belief. This is more about "right place at the right time", as well as if there is anything else, then you think it will "run" for you? This show is stupid kind. It is usually annoying, and there are many things, there are many psychology, but rarely happens. The filtered look of the main person is usually not annoying for listening, or is basically not necessary. Also, the reliance on mindset is very much, as I believe some of them are truly gifted. Silvia Brown I certainly believe, but in most cases it is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, but some of the shows I was still very impressed.
