I have seen this movie and what I can say is ... I am not a film student, nor am I trying to find deeper meaning in some artists who are not able to understand. However, if I were doing this with this movie, I would think ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He took the medicine and I can now take pictures of him ... he is traveling one night and laughs with his friends smiling and the staff says, hey ... would not it be funny if the nuns really fly? Like if someone falls off a plane and falls for some time free, gets up and goes up the ground? * cackles * or buckwheat pope gave a bath? O my God, I'm just cracking up thinking about it! Dude! We will make a movie about it! And then he told his friend that he was smiling ... Oh, if people like it and call me a genius for it, would not it be fun? So to me, something happens when some people make multiple narcotics and write a script and make films. Could I have LSD to understand what this man was thinking, so could I laugh too? Because you have to say, I could not laugh. I was awake and checking time. <br /> <br /> I think those who are trying hard to find the deepest meaning are violent. I would never listen to this director until I came to read reviews, which I did because I was crazy that I lost it for the last 2 hours or how long it felt (it felt like 12 hours of my life) and I can not ever return it, Anyway ... I have read that this man is addicted to heroin and he wanted to die for the industry ?? what is this? So my point proven sort of. This guy is not there, he's a drug addict, and his movie is such a proof ... so please try to find out the deeper meaning of this. If someone really wants to understand everything in this movie, leave some LSD and sit back and relax, then it can actually make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me that I saw the last days of Gass Van Sant, other movies I was crazy about watching. I can not help but it will not be a surprise to see what the ratings will be for that movie, if the same person reviews it but it has been reviewed. It seems that if the film director is completely away from his rocker, or if it is a French movie with sex and subtitles, or it is a cartoon, it will take great reviews, hands down, something else annoying and already done. Blah, please bring on boring!
