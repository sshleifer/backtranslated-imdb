Corny and awesome, I was not surprised at this short living show it did. I'm curious to remember when Tales tried to reuse these scary episodes from the cryptos, as they were really scary. Combined with bad acting and lousy music, I was surprised to have never imagined this crummy has been shown. It can not be seen again, and only be grateful for this situation.
