I got this movie for fifty cents going out of business sales. I'd like to return to my fifty cents. Bad acting, writing poor script, shy direction, historically wrong, even the sound of the movie is awful. This is not objectionable. I think suspense movies and genuine crime films are very interesting. The matter can be considered more seriously, with greater attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect for the sufferers and their devious friends and family is enough to fool anyone. Also, ad jeene can not pay attention to anyone who started the malicious act of performing these horrendous crimes, to some of them. <br /> <br /> Save your time and sanity. Do not see this terrible film. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. Although it is not total waste ... you can throw the disc and use plastic case!
