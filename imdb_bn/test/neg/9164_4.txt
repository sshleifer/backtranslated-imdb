As they are beautiful and comfortable, it does not seem to be enough meat to hold the story of three singers Chipmons for just one and a half hours. I thought it was better to show the film for the first half hour or more. It was fun, there was some laugh, it was full of energy. Then it is lost in any way. I did not even tell it to fade away, because it looked quite casual to me. The fun is gone; The smile disappeared. My daughter noticed this. He 4 - He laughed several times in the first part of the movie, stopped his smile Perhaps it took a very serious sound - the work of evil film producer Chipmux death. Something happened, however, it was not even better. <br /> <br /> Of course, trying to tell the story how Chipmuns (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) started. Everyone knows Christmas songs. Here's how we met Dave and got them started. The movie has been updated to date, although their original source was mentioned in Dove Street Address in 1958, which was the year when animated singer rendants were first created. Jason Lee Dave and Chipmun Voices also did a great job. David Cross bothers me for annoying me as Bad Yan, and I did not understand the character of clear acting played by Cameron Richardson. She added a little bit to the movie. This is a movie that you can watch with kids - it's probably a movie that you just want to see with the kids. It gets a 4/10 from me
