Well, I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the newspaper review and went to see the movie with the expectation of good movie allen (as I have done many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. There is nothing to offer this movie. Even with the wonderful performance by talented Sean Penn - this movie has failed. One of the other features of his films is that many characters - different, malicious dialogue This movie originally consisted of only one character - very one dimensional. It was almost no smile. It probably looked good on paper! The only thing I think was Samantha Marton's performance. Now I will be looking at his movie in the future. So, conclusion, this movie was a big disappointment. >
