Do not be fooled by other critics. The talent in this film contains an impressive array, though they leave a big deal to be a favorite of the present elements. Nat King Cole's number 3 is too long and is not close to his next attempt, although he is impressed with playing his piano. 'Moms' Maleley is not a little funny, though I think it's a very entertaining talk show from my young people. In fact, the best performances are from some fatty people who influence with a lively dance dance and four top takeoffs, and the jazz band itself, especially in the lightning-cumulative number. The print itself is quite poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is completely wasteted the wraparound plot.
