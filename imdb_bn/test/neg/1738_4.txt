This movie started as a well-publicized film, but it never kicked, instead it became predetermined and even a bit silly. Some scenes have been well-formed, used to combine with photography and cut words, and this has become more interesting than watching, but the story was quite slow because it was not directed to keep interest alive. And more importantly, it's terrible at all! It was supposed to be a horror movie but it was near a terrific or even exciting that was not a single scene. <br /> <br /> To be frank, the actors were not all great, any colorful characters you remember for the rest of your day .. <br /> <br /> Overall a watchable movie but it does not add anymore and it does not It does not last long when the view is over. <br /> <br /> The reason I saw this was because I have read some reviews with the top scores, but I disagree and instead I will be rating 4 out of 10. If you still want something awful in Japan, I'll see you instead of Junk-on! <br /> <br />
