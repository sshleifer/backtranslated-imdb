I was looking forward to a dance teacher and some good dance routines in this film. How sad it is to suffer such a painful experience! <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Bels and her character. I found Alex very annoying. Bill's face is so small, sweet and innocent, and this incompatible with Alex's very annoying ugly, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She has a children's tantrums in the mood. It is very hard to believe that Nick will return to Moody's teenage daughter after her frequent cyclone and deceit, especially when she opens the door of a moving car and sticks a stilo on her, rather she likes to walk in the house - the middle road - with only one shoe !! ! And after the night in the ballet, what after his stupid behavior? Actually, the whole romance was very annoying - a 30-year-old man was going after a 16-year-old girl. <br /> <br /> For the dance, I thought the style of this 80 is completely dated. Is there a TV dancing sequence on TV in the world? Who will dance? I was not sure that he was a woman or a man pulled! Even the famous final order is quite frustrating, especially giving an ultra-cheap reference to a ballot company. Camp shots actually destroy its effect because you can not see what he's doing. And what was he doing on earth when he went to each side of the panel, pointing to them? And as mentioned in the other comment, he will never join the ballot company with the power of that audition - perhaps because of this, he will not say whether he was successful or stopped. Finally overcame her fears. In 'FlashDancers', I was really concerned about the best Dirty Dancing Penny. You can see that he was a real dancer, and his acrobatics were very impressive. It's certainly if you can get past its horror costume and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good bits in this picture - when Alex came for the first time to apply for audition, ballet dancers - they are very nice and passionate, and at least help to underline this difference in his current dance career and he is one As Another good scene was the dance break in the streets. I liked the ice skaters parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex ask him? What was an 18-year-old converted into a converted warehouse all alone? How is he able to afford that beautiful barrels and all the furniture? Where was his family? Was that nude 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like Disney movies had to check their heads. And anyway, what happened the ice skater? Many people say that the picture was poor but they liked the message - do not give up hope, try it, and your dreams will be true. See "Little Mermaid" instead.
