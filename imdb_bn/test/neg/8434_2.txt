And one of them is bad movie. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of man's diversity, not fish. It is not operated in the '78's Dante 'piranah' (which was fish) and it is also known as "Piranah, Piranaha". The photographer, two men and a woman, hooked up with a local hunter / sniper named Amazon in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with William Smith's resume film, which stars Carrie; Otherwise, they will immediately know that he's arch arch. Smith may refuse to finish or cut before completing filming. (See this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this film contains plenty of fillers - Long shot of local wildlife (birds) - and central set pieces, a motorcycle race, which is very long. It gets the second star from me because of course, William Smith, who can not save this pile, but once again proves why he goes to go 30-35 years ago as a villain; At its best, Smith could be really awesome. He has typed in a type that might be able to enjoy the murder, perhaps in unfortunate fashion, and the difficulty you are able to hit him is usually available from that bad tactic. Physically, he is very imposing, and you know that the other 3 letters are mostly destroyed in the first half hour. Smith played most of his role; This seems hopeless for other characters against man-made giant. Unfortunately, the film continues to melt in the end, as one minute lost in the footage - confusing, incomplete measurements.
