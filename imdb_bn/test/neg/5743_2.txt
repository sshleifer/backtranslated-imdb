This is a relatively watchable movie (+1). After watching the UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, looks better than this one. There is no obvious technical gafsa, although the Vampireic teeth are looking weird. <br /> <br /> The story line does not give any sense. let's see. War of an American GI Vampire The state comes back and is rehabilitated to see ... Vampire. Her commanding officer's aunt's ancestor's aunt Do some research on Biodiversity in South America, where there are vampires. Hah! Do not pill on many coincidences. Who is the head of the vampire? Or his daughter? Or is anyone in this picture? The only fundamentality among these is the Vampires' most of the story (cross and garlic allergies can not come within days, etc.) is wrong. However, they can not be killed without a head injury or a wood wound in the head. Yes right It is clear that they just did not want to make a dark film, because it was made for a TV. <br /> <br /> If they hire some actors, it would be good for the audience. Oh, they've got Linda Carter (Wonder Woman on TV), and a deep, black dude, who has a very deep voice, who got snarls properly to show his vampire's teeth Prothheitics. But, otherwise, you never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> Sufficient war scenes and some vampires-bites of blood, but there is no actual violence.
