I came out and saw this picture. Let me see now - this guy who had previously fuji mounted, managed to collect employees' money and hire employees to register what he's saying on a page like brave and brave action - to cut the world's highest peak. Well - and came to the spinner - what happened, see, a large group of people can help him reach the top and - a contract is lost in the contract - he gets on his skis, he manages it, down a very small way, which is his pond Open ... and that. And this extraordinary anticlimactic to burn footage for an embarrassing damaging end, instead, the guy went ahead and released it. At the end of the spiring I got fantastic courage and the effort must be taken from the film crew to get some of it pretty shot. Another spinner - oh yes, Sherpas was killed by a fall in an enemy. According to Sherpa religion, according to Sherpa religion, the body of this man can not be restored, his soul revolves around life and will not rest. What is the statement of the narrator? He replied - because it worked to give this clay to "sky-down Everest". I have never been able to remember the more annoying part of celluloid.
