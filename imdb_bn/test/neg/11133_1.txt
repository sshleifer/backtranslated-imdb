Hi, I've never seen a great movie! Movie packaging itself is better than film itself My girlfriend and I saw it this past weekend, and we hope it will be better ... it was not ... <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is poor; It seems like it was shot in the video and moved to the movie. The light is not great, which makes it hard to read facial expressions in the face. The acting itself was cheesy, but I guess it is acceptable for the horror of "yet another" teenager. The term was a huge problem: Sometimes you have to review the video because the term is vague and / or muffled. <br /> <br /> does not have its own true worth; Trying to travel to the "sleeping hollow" quotes. Do not bother with this one.
