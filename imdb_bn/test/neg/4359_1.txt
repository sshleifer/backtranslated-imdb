Fill the forest of the golden children. Killjoy this part is good. She is even worse and stronger as well. However, most of the acting is bad as well, like the first one. Sometimes the letters speak to each other, which does not understand and are not believable. I made an error to see this one cool. If you're not, perhaps you'll enjoy it more ;-) If you have not stopped loving trick after the first film, surely after the second ........ <br /> <br /> Children and their supervisors are going to a camp in the forest. . And what a coincidence, their car is right in the middle of a forest and broke ..... night? It's just their luck. They found a house and shot one, one observer is behind (I do not know why) and the rest finally find another house. A Puddu priest lives in that house ... but he is not responsible for the resurrection of Kilgis. Then who? Well, you see good movie and find out for yourself ....
