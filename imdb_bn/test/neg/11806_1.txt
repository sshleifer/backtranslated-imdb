I think that many of the people who worked on this thing have come and rated it because I'm telling you, it's just awful. Acting is worse than Swaparra, the impact is one thing that you see beyond the 1970s episode of Doctor Hu, the story is good, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over again over the same. And the verb? It's like Wing Commander, Muppets used by giant cats, how bad they are? Virtual that is bad. Seriously, the man running this thing is terrible and can never point out anything other than playing his son's school, even then the audience will have to pay to see it. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
