Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Most of my lifetime was stink wasted by this pile. I would rather chew my hand off than watch this film. Painful story lines, painful letters and painful two hours. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is: - I would rather put a PIN in my eyes and wait for another minute for my brain this trip. <br /> <br /> Advice should be well and please let your local dust man get rid of this waste. <br /> <br /> Lin, you told me good !!! <br /> <br /> <br />
