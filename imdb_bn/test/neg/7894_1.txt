It seems to be considered even with these horror movies, it is very easy to see why Hollywood has so much serious problems with bad plots and bad times. <br /> <br /> I think the audience will have to guess the 'black' jokes, 'pump up' look and 'bling' laugh at their last laugh behind them. It's so extraordinary 'up' and so bad that even 'it's so bad it's funny again' has been marked and 'totally embarrassing for someone involved' has become. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry for every minute every minute I waste this one too. I want to return my time <br /> <br /> My only reason to give 1 point to the rating is that 0 was not an option.
