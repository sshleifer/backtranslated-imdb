I also became the wife of an abusive husband, even in my condition is not emotional psychological. He presented a very respected, responsible and generous person to one who saw us together, which, on the contrary, thinks others of others like me as humble and uncomfortable. Initially, I said so incredibly that anyone like Gass (who worked in a bank and was very confident) would even give me time, and instead I was instead head over for IDA. I had my head straight, and at first gotten to know him better, there is no way I would marry him. However, this is my mistake. It was not wrong to use my mistake. I am not worthy of it, or I did not see it until I got confused with mind play, criticism and separatism. He acted like I did not have any opinion that was different from his own - actually he went further. If I did not agree, he assumed that I had misunderstood, and made his words straightening ... I finally lost my self-esteem, was ineligible to admit that I was in danger, and had to push me into reality by the influence of the outside . My father said, Gass worried me. Well ... the anger that started at this moment was half a year before the sudden burst and I packed some things while working and I went away. .. And this is still a few months ago I realized that I was tortured, and it was not my fault that he did what he had done. ..... so please, guess anyone guessing it's guilt, guess !!! When a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner, in an anxious situation it has an accident in the hole, you blame the puppy? When the misuse of the relationship reaches a vicious violent level, the goal of misuse is so fatal and distorted (many like Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the situation correctly, because of this the terrible things spewed by the victim of believing everyone. Have a heart, people The label of abuse as stupid morons already sounds like someone kicked in horribly beaten. -------> And how does this help ???
