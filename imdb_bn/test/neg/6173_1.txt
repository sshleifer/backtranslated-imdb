Really waste space waste. I and my friend tried to see this movie in its conclusion, but it was about 30 minutes to close it. And I can count the closed films before the end of one hand. <br /> <br /> The scripts and directions are leadership and deep-inspiring. I would not be surprised if the script was found in scripts skipping script since 1983. For example, the annoying throat threatens the real estate person from his home phone. I mean seriously. The police will close the door within a few minutes. Scenes and incidents just wash like turds in a river by you. The real hardness of the film is difficult to understand. The descriptions flick into characters in a seemingly random way of breaking the offending effort in creating characters. Oh and what they "characters" The hero acting by Rourke is awesome. She could just cut out a cardboard herself and stay in bed. After 60 or more minutes of the film, I have created a completely free attachment to this character. He is not sympathetic nor despicable. Blundering through a single store window just by designing a dummy every single dummy. Its motivation is impossible to understand from its generally submerged and embarrassed delivery. Is he happy Is she sorry Angry? There is no sense. Only those same dead eyes looked at you from a set piece of meat. And the Native American theme is just awful and dull. <br /> <br /> The best guys are unlike the best. A dust white collar stereotype and a symping neurotic pre-wife stereotype. Coup Arteptal wife with the shootout encounters the bad guy, "You are not going to shoot me", which is both unreasonable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The character of the first rich character is initially interesting, but soon it will burn the psycho characters on one side. Disagreements with some offending motives, such as sympathetic or at least realistically encouraging to some bad people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Rosario Dawson character starts with some promises, but soon the chicken scene from the sick and little parody Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that his character attracted Rouke? Or is he just a glimmer that sleeps like a river? Realistic female letter FTW! <br /> <br /> A summary of a film is a complete mess. Desperate character and performance. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired aspects. And finally, very dull. Her even comedy is not bad. In front of laughing at Robbers, the first 15 minutes of the movie are sitting in the Turkic Minutes.
