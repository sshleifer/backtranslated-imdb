In the last 5 years, I've rented some bad movies ... completely aimed. I am ambitious to be a movie critic, and we all know that there are awesome movies published every year. However, about 3 months ago I rent this one. I saw it all the way ... and cried profusely. This is one of the movies that is very helpless, it wants to mute you. It actually makes my stomach feel a sick feeling. I've seen many bad movies (science science theater 3000 anyone?) But this one takes a cake. Following the plot was difficult, the light was awesome and sound fireproof. If there were negative ratings on the scale here, this movie would be for me at -11. This may seem weird, but I highly recommend it. This is something that you have to look for yourself ... but do not say I warned you. I do not think that this review can be more specific so I've done it now. <br /> <br />
