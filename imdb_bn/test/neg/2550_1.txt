First, the Texas Weirle of Texas headlines is confusing to others. This is actually about El Chupacabra, which is the same animal as a Verubal, but it is not the same in any way. <br /> <br /> Production and editing simply suck plain. When it ends, I will not be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly was Chupacabra, whenever it was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions) the camera became cone and you can only see the monster face clearly The special effect was ridiculously bad, but it would be expected from a low-budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> The terrible production comes as well as bad actors. Now a couple give fairly pretty performance (Erica Fe and Martin Hughes), but then the bad actor (everyone else), who did not feel any emotion in the death of people. Even then, one of the worst performers in the movie, which is seen in a movie, is a horror actor (Sarah Ironson) who is seen in a movie. I mean my God, he was indiscrebly bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a silent kill local residents in a small Texas city and look for a group of thirteen to stop it. However, even if the plot is simple, some plot holes are managed to leak. <br /> <br /> However, terrible movies. However, if you are looking for a fun and laughing movie with your friends one night, then this is a pretty good one. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Perhaps the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Awful, terrifying.
