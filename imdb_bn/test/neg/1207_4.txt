I rarely smile so much in a movie. Notice that I laugh at the Iron Eagle, not with it, because it's probably the most intelligent movie I've ever seen (with the clear exception of Saiftaker's SaifTacare). You should also remember that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> The idea that a 16-year-old American can move to the air force can also steal an F-16. Flying to the Middle East and believing without believing anyone except killing thousands of people), the film is full of ridiculous steps that do not make little or no sense. For example, Doug Master uses a steel girder, a control tower, and a machine gun to shoot a tent on its plane. All these things explode into a massive fireball. Why? An airplane explodes in a strange explosion, in memory of a plane carrying the plane with a fire. <br /> <br /> Plus, I really enjoyed this movie. The creators probably did not want to enjoy it, but likewise I smiled at it and later bought the DVD. It's probably an amazing presence as David Suchet's terrorist leader (perhaps you know him as Belgian detective pirate?) Overall, the film laughs and is a light-hearted alternative to the more serious fighter-plane. Movies like Top Songs Even if it spontaneously checks out people in Homo-erotic (Doug and Chappy). Something's going on in Em!)
