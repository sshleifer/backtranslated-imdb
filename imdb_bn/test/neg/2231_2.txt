I rented this movie, I knew it would be bad (I just saw a good Disney Siegel and it was a toy story 2), but it's much less than my expectations. I'm a die hard hard Disney fan and I just do not believe in the sequels with Disney movies. Anyone who can not grow up with the classic (after they came out, or they were rented after your birth) This is a beautiful story. I just thought the plot was dragging a little more, and was expected. One thing that bothered me most was that the voice of women and women on the forehead They were very tall. Although most reviews say it's not bad, but I think that if you're a real Disney fan, you should not waste your time with you. <br /> <br /> Disney hopes any more classic any more sequels at any time.
