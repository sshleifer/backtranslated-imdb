After all, do not expect much and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that can bring you back in 1983, it definitely does. For the only reason I've claimed this movie more than 2 points, it's 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Kayne <br /> <br /> # 2 The public, the sights, the culture and the music of Brazil <br /> <br /> The movie is almost entirely operated by the kineren because it works impossible to transform an effective and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper are very less. <br /> <br /> As well as being a gifted classical and humorous actor, Kain mixed her spontaneity, misbehavior and sensitivity with her movie ... so far as her role in the alpha The focus of her charm ... and why she won the Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters after two years. This brave, he's flexible, intelligent ... funny and risky ... tragic and emotional .... And the only reason to find a better form of entertainment as well as Rio de Janeiro's gem. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a glimpse of 2 lovely young actors, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore may be a reason. But see, you can do everything you can do (though its appearance seems very bad) .... It can not be a painful film experience rather than trying her "effort" (most of her conversations seem too heavy). Demi's acting and appearance is 100 times better and you can easily convert him to a movie (he can not really be honest). Miss Moore is certainly unused, especially as a big star. Save this fact that it is a stupid first, finally, I'm actually maturity, which all these people manage in this confusing situation ... that it does not stop friendship or marriage, and any relationship Even your best friend's little girl can be forgiven and everyone can move away. The injured teams show anger and frustration about what happened, but do the best for everyone .... Certainly a little unreal, but surprisingly fresh. Always hope.
