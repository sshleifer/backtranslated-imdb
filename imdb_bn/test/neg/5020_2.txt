First of all I want to say that I feel generous on the political scale and I think the film is offensive. I managed to see a film full doggone humiliation. This movie comes from an original original idea. Yes, it is basically two stars rather than me. 1. Are our film writers uncertain that they can only come up with this ?? The acting was terrible, and the characters were unlike for the most part. The main woman in the story was not a good quality. They kept her buff in some bad guys and I did not see it. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most down-to-earth character of the film. I did not shell out any money for this garbage. I hope PETA will come for the rescue of this horror, offensive movie and will create a protest. All what I say is blame now!
