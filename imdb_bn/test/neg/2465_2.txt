Very predictable for the accident, but I do not have the cagey below, so do not read it if you care. <br /> <br /> A few overwhelming writers together in half the afternoon, and even then they run out of ideas. So let's start the criminals in France looking for all the criminals ... no matter what they did, we will think after that (they do not). Some seconds of sensation, but not too much, and something unexpected, because it requires art. The film requires half an hour to finish; I get it: they have a jewelry robs, and take a lot of time to avoid alarms etc.; Everyone calls Jeweler in the movie this way, it is bound to work (not this). There is no laugh, no character (okay, Yevs Montand gives it a scary bit to ham) and everyone speaks quiet silence, which seems to be a silent thought, but only makes actors disappointed. If they are silent, it will feel their weaknesses - but also save our writing line. We will add more to the women of the house we are going to see these things, so they have to make their Habibi sympathetic to do something (we have forgotten any woman in the film). Got it: A boy meshes (gasp) - Oh, and tried to commit suicide for any particular reason (shame? Mafia boss has been set up to scream loudly to his father, but the audience will feel the care of his parents, and if not). Oh, the hypocrite is a classmate of a man who annihilates him; Recharge, uh? Let's all die eventually, or we will not finish this thing. Is it possible? Okay, then with that, thank God. Who will we get for the director?
