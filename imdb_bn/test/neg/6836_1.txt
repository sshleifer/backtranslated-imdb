It's hard to screw this story. Fred Zinnman's great book / good movie version, yet this movie is awesome! The first welding was terrible. Richard Gere himself would have to eat jackal because Edward Fox had the same cipher and it did not need to mess with the original script by adding a very cheap (expensive) fluff. This movie reminds me of many Bruce Willis films, because you see huge expenditure with a movie to show for it. (This is her "conspiracy theories") It is a great original script to do some practical work to create a bad movie. Every person on Michael Canton Jones should be banned for making films for 10 years; This film is the original filmmakers' humiliation. To know what they were doing, Hollywood had to go for trial, this movie would be your exhibition.
