A few years ago I saw the fragrance of green papayas by the same director. My feelings about both movies are actually the same: nicely shot, but horrible slow and annoying. I saw this film in a drift preview, and left half an hour later. It can not stand anymore. How can people make an interesting movie about people who love each other and tell them how perfect their life is .........? My forgotten American gi There was an imagination about it, still wandering around the Vietnamese jungle, who were not aware of the war was over. How will he suddenly pop up in the film, and the movie will start its M16 empty at its character. Their blood red film will create a beautiful contrast with all the green trees ... so I was not so much affected by this picture! Time to leave!
