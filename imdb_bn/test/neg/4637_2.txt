This film has been advertised for three months in Greece as the largest Greek production ever. Well, it might be, but ... when you hear a big production you expect to see something new. No reason why you'll see here is a movie. George Corraface does not seem to really enjoy making this movie. Her acting is so simple, that almost looks amateur. The term, especially when Turkish actors speak some English (dubbed?), Its full Thanks, some, especially in the late 50's and early 70's, special effects shown in Istanbul and Athens were like digital images more than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy since 1959 (at the age of 5), but he miraculously became a teenager after five years. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < , Which is again seen 40 years later, is a love story, oh, there is also a political aspect. Some 'ironic comments' of the Greek "janta" '67 -74', so many children that seem almost compulsive. <br /> <br /> Of course there are some good things in the film: Bay It's a great part of the actor, mainly by Iroklis Michaelsdesis, Yantialia Remkutika, very beautiful scenery and great music, but they are so little to produce such expensive. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Is it a movie so bad? I do not know. I just know that at any stage it does not justify its huge (for Greek values) budget.
