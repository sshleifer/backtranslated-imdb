If I compare two movies with Sachcha Cohen, Borat and Ali Ji, Ali Ji is very good. I'm not a master piece, but it's at least a film. Borat is completely rubbish and I do not understand how Ali G. Better Rate. <br /> <br /> I can not put my finger on top, there is something wrong with Ali G scripts: Jokes half wrote a 15 year old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And some of the humorous ones, including Mr. Cohen's body below, are quite tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the film is actually united as a comedy and some of the legitimate jokes are fun: Like Ali Ji has become a member of the government for making some confusing and fooling in the public (sadly true) in today's western society: Stupid things in public To get people to careers), also advise Ali about immigrant policies and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali Ji is generally using her sympathetic character, though mentally depressed for her age. But it's okay, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But I never see the borat, it is terrible and every cute Muviloore makes the sick.
