I guess the movie was based on a great book. Given the number of characters and sublots in cadence, I thought that the filmmaker, perhaps the author or director, intended to create an epic film But there was not enough time to really spend properly on developing characters or stories. Suddenly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could be edited. <br /> <br /> Concerning the events led to the genocide of these intellectuals and officials, I do not think the film explains why the killings were not necessary for any reason. Was it political? Philosopher Revenge? The interesting part of the historical movies is seeing personal motivation or emotion. Instead, Cattinine assists automatically considered stolen-controlled automatons, which are sometimes made as charcoal sketches. The Russians and the German scriptures seemed to be completely one-dimensional. (Polish people are angry only Russians?) Along with poorly educated and biased or at least unrealistic, music and movie choices match each other and movie. I do not think you can shoot an epic war film or war incident in handheld cameras. (But if the director went with a character-driven story, perhaps by concentrating on a single family, perhaps the Handy-cam system would work better.) And if you really use dramatic music, it should be better balanced.
