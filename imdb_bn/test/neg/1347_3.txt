This image can be a decent rebuild, and the Lord knows it (or miss misses English) to try it. Gather talented actors together with successful and experienced writers / directors should be a source for a decent film. But the experience of Mrs. English - according to her IMDB Bio - is limited to television work, and it is clearly clear throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that I did not mention any reviews I have read. This film is most unlikely, and it keeps it from reaching even a part of its potential: It seems like it was made for television. To give some credit to Mrs. English, most jokes that did not work on the movie screen have become great on TV (and may have helped a sunny track). Most of the camera use and light fined on TV but it looked weird or strange on the big screen. If the whole movie is shot in a small series or a city-cum, I think it could work. But this movie has sadly translated the talent of Mrs. In my embarrassment for the actors and the writers, I am crying so differently that I came out of half the galaxy of drama! Meg Ryan was his usual perky, intelligent self (except for his face-to-face plastic surgery), but where was his chance to use his talent ?! He made a picture where he did not revive his stereo-typed role and he did well ... but not here. Annette Bening just started to go through the pace - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the character of another woman but they were more playful than the substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s was not translated into the 2000s, and no one helped Mrs. Changes in English and updates or sublets correct. For some help he can reach (as a writer, director, and producer), but I think it could be good. But it was not. <br /> <br /> It's frustrating that there is a good star and a good writer or director in a movie and it seems that it's the waste of time and money for everyone! I saw yesterday's cartoon of this New York: There are a meeting of some movies and a caption is read: "Let's make a classic rebuild by all things!"
