You've been sitting on Helk's holidays and you've seen this terrible TV movie. This film is an extra-acting (very bad-acting) exercise that can be more than what they have. I will not leave this plot, but once you understand why people of this movie are moving from the natives in the film, why you spend two hours of your life. More than just looking at Mercury Brady in Bikini!
