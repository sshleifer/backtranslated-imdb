If I want to rate this movie based entirely on acting / script / production etc. I would give it a star. All these elements are awful. I partly apologize for the film's $ 250 budget. The film has mostly entertaining scenes, most of which are curious and funny. Some of them are: A 14-year-old kid has been stealing a car, the teenage huligans (one of which played a T-shirt of Joy Division) is removing the fear of throwing fake firearms in a film hero, and with a plastic calf pillar in the Arizona desert Face a face. <br /> <br /> I could give it 5 stars just for the entertainment value, that is not the presence of the terrible annoying, morally old growth. I was just one star Doc because of him. Who * sleeps * makes a wedding cake with black frosting, anyway?
