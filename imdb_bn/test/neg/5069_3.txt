I have seen this kind of movie that I do not like them very much. Caged Women is still another 'prisoner woman' film, and most of the rest of the day is liked; The plot is favoring showing perfectly nude women. Do not make mistakes now; I love nude women, but like to have some plot threads to go with nudity, and this movie is only going on in the basic 'women's prisons' theme (of course, as well as necessary runners)), I got a little bored before the end. The film is good because it has a moment in which women are wearing clothes, but it is only about positive elements. Director (and the author, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich is happy to show the nakedness of the naked woman, but it is never too romantic. The director was a producer of several trash flickr, among which there is some managed by Jos√© Franco. In my opinion, she should remain in production as her writing genius exists, and she does not know how to film a sex scene. This type of material is dried many times, but I think Franco can make it even more. Overall, in this kind of stuff this stuff can really be enough for humans; But I can not enjoy it.
