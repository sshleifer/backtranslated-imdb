This movie is Flippy Aughul .... I wanted that hour of my life back. For God, away from this terrible order ball movie at all costs. This title is not significant, but the film ratings are quite generous for such a vomit scam. And where do I start? Cell phone ** movie kids ... empty plot or story? ... garden-diversified college / fracture scene of boycock slapping? Or bad acting, teenage girls? $$$ # @% @! My God, it's never finished! I think I've kissed the movie theater floor, then I'll sit again like this. <br /> <br /> But what do you expect? Most people can look for reviews with the power of the brain, they will not be the same as the target audience - so look again Pereut 2, or Jet Li one, if in your own debate. Look, this movie will cost you only your soul, your money, your strength and your brain cells. Fear warned
