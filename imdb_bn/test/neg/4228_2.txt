This French film is thought to be a strange, slow-eyed policeman to investigate the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film really does nothing about it and it takes forever to say nothing. From point A to point ten to ten minutes, the character takes ten minutes, but the film shows this walk ten minutes and these "action" scenes Static shots also last for a few minutes, making visitors wonder that they accidentally hit the remote button on the button. The script has enough content for 20 minute movie. The movie is seven hours or so lasts. You do not math. The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. Note yourself: Do not see a Dumont movie again.
