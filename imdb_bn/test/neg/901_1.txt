I'm not going to say much as the value of this movie effort. Absolutely perfect film! This is the worst movie I ever seen. The story was stupid, you can not follow what's happening, the letters were so annoying especially to the main person. I wanted to kill anybody and threw him and the film out of his grief. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad.
