The idea behind this movie was great. A little girl faces the misuse of the story (both emotionally and physically) and it survives trying to deal with it. The movie makes the fall apart from the movie and the horrific use of pose dialogue makes the fall apart. Actors have to point again and the most obvious thing. Also, very annoying, almost funny, metaphor overuse over voice. The high point is acting small girl. Nice try, but this one stinker.
