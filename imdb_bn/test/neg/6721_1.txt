There are movies not released on the theater but in the video. This is an age-old and old nitrate film stock should be cut off in ways. No stories, oppressed violence, acting, poorly written and tragedy is not only the only bad part of the film. And I've enjoyed and enjoyed something like Seagel's other movies.
