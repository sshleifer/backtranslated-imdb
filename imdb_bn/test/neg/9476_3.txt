Now, when I saw this Sunday I was a hunter and my aunt and uncle were visiting my two cousins ​​one day (one 11, the other 9). We got stuck on TV and started a passport in Paris. My cousins ​​both said that they sometimes look at two types and I told them they could see the movie if they liked it. Since I was not in a suitable condition to wake up, I used to live in the living room with them and I ended up watching the movie! I want to say, a person who has no interest in TV shows or movies, I really enjoyed it ... It must be alcohol abuse, but I admit, it will only apply more for the intermediate girls 6 and 13, but pass the time There was a movie. Always a movie or a show that you do not think you like, but for the laugh, you've enjoyed it.
