Movie ratings are a temptation of injustice - I write it on the IMDB Scale 2.1. Friends, it's very close to 3.0, I'll go out even in one organ and say 4.0 where I put it. Come - how can the creatures of the static electricity net around the Earth and alien amphic cell structures have creativity and do not give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you've got all the great dialogs - "Dave, look at this mud structure." You know, they do not think they've ever returned from that mud. It does not matter, this kind of 'flash' movie that is live for the movie 'Z', and I can now easily rest. In fact, I saw it without proper understanding for several years ago, such as "Giant Leicers of Attack of the Giant Lakes" and "The Wapp Women". I do not know what might be consciousness, but to quote a character from the film - "Whatever it works fast!" <br /> <br /> In the alien amphic cell structure - I liked the idea that the third element in the competition against your ideal red and white blood cells. When the astronaut John Kerran (Michael Ammeth) returned from the dead, I had a scene of scenes that could be the pioneer of "Allian" in 1979, but it would not have been. Instead, budget restrictions restrict the image to hit the Big Bird with a bird, although the idea was almost a decade away. Who knows where to leave and compare to others? <br /> <br /> Look, it's not bad. Not good, but not bad. Any time you can hook up the crash landing with the alien people committed to receiving Earth, you can hook up asteroids, you've got a winning combination. Throw in a cheesy giant factor and you're on your way. Just remember - "An injured animal is not good at all".
