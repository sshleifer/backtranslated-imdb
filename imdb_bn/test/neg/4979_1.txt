There are only three words needed for this review: Kadchana. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see cartoons as children, you will find this movie as a complete waste of your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be sticking to your feet on the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all names and cache phrases. Even the dog is also known as a "showroom" (a dog is referred to as a "show boy" in the dog). They are poly love names, but they do not pure Miss Purebred Miss Polly. <br /> <br /> This drug to see me my wife and son. They wanted to dump me to see it. <br /> <br /> The original underworld Valley Cox, was narrated by the final dance. It is voiced by the person who "knows more about adults than a smart alkalic teenager". <br /> <br /> As alone movie, it's awful. As a tribute to the underdog, it's even worse. It's not a respect. It is not a retelling of stories. It does not update the story. It's an effort to purely make a known title cash and merchandise. The next time I will go to the store, I am afraid that I will see the underdog toys, trousers, towels, sheets, clothes etc. McDonald's and Burger King probably fought on the rights of this child's diet. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. They start wrapping the underdog theme (initially read with a silent "C")! Great, now we're going to destroy something, let's go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew I'd probably get worse before leaving. When I reached my local 12 plaque, my fears were confirmed and they opened it on the first day and the first showed them in their little auditorium (and only four out of the stadium seats). Even theater people knew that it would be trash! Save your money on the ticket and buy the original series in DVD and purchase it and invest it even better. It will be more entertaining and good production quality.
