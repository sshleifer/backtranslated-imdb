I could not see this movie for more than 10 minutes. It's set to value. I would not have to give a movie once more, unless it was as horrible as one. I completely agree with other comments about this film. But, since I'm Dutch, I saw it with a Dutch translation. Apparently, they did not have the meaning for proper translation, so they decided to have it baby. Sometimes ridiculous results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not medicines, do not see daemon summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that actors (Wow, I can not believe I just said.) The script was not at the time of shooting? I think they also did a good job ... well ... Ahm ... no, they did not do any good.
