Now you can really call a movie. I knew some movies that the Japanese did not do anything bad? I mean, I was three times asleep in this movie. Any horror, some small percentage (0.2-0.5) comedy. Let's acknowledge the action that it has some but poorly portrayed in the scene, the actors are unfortunate. None of the actors did a good job in his own role. Did not believe. The script is terrible. I mean that this film can be great, in fact, but for 60 (not 100% sure.) I suggest you not see it, unless you want to get bored like me. I got the rating of this picture can not be hot enough. It, over, over rate !!! This is certainly a personal opinion. I do not want to insult anyone but can like this frog? So I hope this will not help some time to "enjoy" this movie. Yet it's your choice!
