This self-important, confusing b + w "movie" sees a child on a very bad acid trip. You are talking about something that reminds you of a piece of rolling lettuce that accidentally fell behind a garbage truck: no one would think of touching it because it might drop down from the storm. When you got "glue imagery" and "fine" metaphor there is no room for the plot. To me, it seems that the director of intellectuals is trying to create the next great artist while making alms for the honor. I'm not bringing my beret. Seeing this, I feel almost insulted by the effective work to remove myself from the "film".
