Do not watch this movie! It's ... annoying! The beginning is really good, but everything goes in the middle and I'm sorry to spend 80 crowns (about $ 11) on the ticket! Peter Dal should be considered as his last chance to earn public interest. Flat picture! The only bright spot is Robert Gustavson, Lena Neimon and Gasta Ackman's excellent work. <br /> <br /> I hope you will take my advice ... the image is garbage.
