I wanted to like this picture, and of course there is a room for an emotionally driven movie that can not go to cheap thrills. Still, for the sake of the film, one needs to have trusted plots, some pacing and the feeling of editing and getting involved. In clearing, with the kidnappers and unknown motives, what starts as a mysterious mystery, gradually becomes dragonless pointless exercise. Does not really happen, and the so-called character driven angle (as expressed by his commentary director) does not really add much. <br /> <br /> Fine actors are spoiled here Robert Redford is trying his best to engage Willam Duffer and to deviate. Dafo takes a bit of nuance for his character, as someone might feel somewhat sympathetic towards him. It is unfortunate that Duff has been cast as a villain, he is the Christopher Walken Hall of the type cast. <br /> <br /> Wiege Crisons is generally good but his character entry in the film was short and revealed. They were wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character. So far, the greatest waste of gifted was Helen Miron. Director's commentary, I heard how unbelievable he was a genius. I agree, she is a great actress. So why was he not used properly? She can show herself towards the last episode of this movie, but then the visitors take care of her. Very bad, I like some parts of this movie, but another critic wrote that, half of you know that the film will not be even better.
