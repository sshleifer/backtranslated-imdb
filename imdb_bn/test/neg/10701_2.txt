This movie stunk. It does not have much more. The final war seemed like a walker on my grandmother, some supernatural monsters with the power of ten people. I found the commercial more interesting. Plots can be seen coming back a mile from twists and joke. This is the only release of the movie's release. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you enjoy Bad Chuck Norris movie.
