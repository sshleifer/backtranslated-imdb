this is not right. I was really hoping this would be a delightful, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake and Josh's Drake Bell, and Leslie Nilsson has nothing to tear off from his oldest classic, airplane and nude guns. However, after seeing the superhero film, I was happy that it will not be paid for me either. It was not just about 9 taka per ticket. Like a dollar and a few pennies. That would be the sum of hours and minutes for a few reasons. And as frustrating as this movie I am glad that the running time was not small, if not small I do not believe how incredibly indecent, unnecessary, and above all, Stupid, had some scenes! And above that, I saw good acting from a wooden dummy (without ventriloquist). As Craig Majine intended to intentionally create a movie that is worthy of its 3.7 percent, if not less and even trying to get worse than "Meet Spartans". Really frustrating.
