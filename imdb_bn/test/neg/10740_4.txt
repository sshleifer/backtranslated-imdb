Homecoming; What a big disappointment !! After reading the summary of the plot (the dead are coming back for the vote - George W. Bush !!!!!) before I could not wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it gradually fell into an annoying political satire that I did not need to see (I could only see some old comedy for this!). Horrible was just one or two scenes and they were not even that scary. I could not believe that the Joe Holding came from Dante, who could easily draw it with the balance of thrills and ridicule. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
