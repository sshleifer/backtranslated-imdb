I made it through half, but it was not enough to see a masochist all of it. The first half of the film was next to any dialogue! Almost everything was a commentary on the commentary to carry the story. The script writer has forgotten that sometimes he is trying to explain more than a thousand years of history and less in detail in Voices. At the same time he forgot to develop any character. Most of the science fiction fans do not need huge amounts of character development, but it will be good to know why the two main characters surviving in a fast fight together. <br /> <br /> Some good things are going on in the movie. Soundtrack is working well. Some of the graphics made in the computer were very good, but others were just moderate.
