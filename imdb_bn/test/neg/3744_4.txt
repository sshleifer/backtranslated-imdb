There are possible possibilities with "tell potential" there. A weird and stimulating plot, and a French to take a very American story. But for me, the scope was not used here. <br /> <br /> While I liked the direction of this picture, there were three extraordinary failures that drag right from ten to four. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it's a stupid, clich√©d mystery to kill. He wrote a specially conradved murder he or Bergard. This problem is not solved because of being French - it is only silly and French at the same time. It is impossible to complete coincidences. Second, the transition from France to the United States seems to have failed. This French doctor hanging on his new "Homs" and his Blining SUU "street" on the street "street" ... and then the car is moving ... <br /> <br /> But in the third and most cases, it's just Very darn long For me, for more than 90 minutes, there should be a significant cause for the film and some serious argument was taken for more than two hours. This was not it once.
