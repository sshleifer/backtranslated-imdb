It was hurt to see this movie, actually ... I also wanted to like it, even for very little cash. I looked past and praised myself for inspiration. Unfortunately, even though I admire that level film, the acting and editing were terrible and the last 25-30 minutes had serious thumb-twisting areas. A 95-minute film should not be dragged. So the rating is so good, but I fear that there may be such a thing between friends and family. What were those with infections? Dear Mr. Editor, have you just purchased the first copy of Adobe Premiere and made your original goal to use all the fools that come with that innocent program? However ... some good actors, a little more passion, and some more interesting edits and make a decent film.
