Now I know that many black humorous jokes like ordinary black things such as gold teeth But this does not mean that they are always funny. This is an example of not being a danger. Urban cinemas certainly lend itself to ridicule. The problem is that the Waines and the Consortium do not just try to mock the common 'Gato' culture, and disrespect the legitimate statements made in urban films such as the Boys 'N' Hood or Men's 2 Society. Personally I think these filmmakers should move their heads from the gut movement of their white head. Without this, the movie itself is terrible. It's not funny at all. Jokes are racist. Instead of the continuation of urban film, filmmakers show the views of 'unknown' urban (Ghetto) blacks. Now there are some jokes in this movie, but I believe it is the original fare. <br /> <br /> This film is intended to be crap and producers have to use their talents for constructive comedy / satirical films. Their black hats (which were made before this movie) and have their examples on Friday.
