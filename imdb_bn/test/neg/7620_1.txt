Do farmers know spray on the field? All right - the seizure, so the BBC has decided to create a much-publicized conspiracy thriller about GMO and some smelly meat that the BBC has burned on its audience by cultivating what we've got. <br /> !!!! SPILILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That hunger will be saved from third world. "Then the story switches to another bland scene. If you are going to create a thriller then you should not open with a hook to the viewer? At that time the bright physician like The Accelerors was 28 days later with a hook in the laboratory. I think there are some people in the BBC Not that the thriller needed to hook because the audience's trailers tear their throats a couple of weeks ago <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story continues to be a few journalists (Bill Clinton and one with morality than Dubai Bush The drunken people have met, another female journalist who is full of truth) is investigating patients in a county hospital, who have been killed in the "Mercy killings" May be closed by women journalists, confusing the woman journalist about being threatened by MI5 Spox, and the last episode with the main MI5 has been a victim of the killings. <br /> <br /> It is known in the second episode Due to the death of patients in the county hospital who are actually infected with a VRSA superbug. This is when things go completely straw wire. All fields across Gold believe the service of intelligence of the audience and the leadership shown at the forearm has been led to death - but they do not. Bad guy is an organic farmer who has created his bedroom VRSA superbug and the story ended with Matrix camera work, with the involvement of VRSA in a field of fire by dispersing narcotics male journalists, spreading superbogs across the globe <br> <br /> I am Gold Field I think it is impossible to talk about good. During the broadcast I was a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. I have given up my time in environmental movement, but I am still not as dissatisfied as to how environmentalists are portrayed here and to spread the virus to the bogus viruses, because the warnings about the dangers of genetically modified animals are very silly. It's like a Cnd member, which allows a nick stop in London about the dangers of nuclear war. I was also a little distraught about how men's characters were written as barbaric, although all women were highly intelligent and morally superior to men. Especially there are other problems with script related to VRSA. If you look at the time and the problem of RRSA research against the written authors, then you are completely different from what you see here. Oh and if you set fire to daisel, it does not explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it is similar to the structure of the Zeppers Krypton, which is the opposite of what happened last ten minutes ago. Where the zipper crepere lasts for almost 90 minutes, Gold's field lasts twice as long as it is twice as annoying and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> No footnote environment ever creates a good theme for the thriller (anyone who remembers Steven Seagal films ?) And this is the time TV and film producer realized this
