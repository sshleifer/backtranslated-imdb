I've thought of this movie when I saw Pluto's ruin ... why ... Randy quaid playing a rescued robot in both films, this movie was made years ago but is probably a screwplay player who got the same biotoxic coffee or something similar. ..Ahua ... It's hard to avoid paying even great tributes to late great Andy Coffman ... Find another movie or just re-launch the taxi on LatinaTV ... Her Latky Grace character is much more loving ... You pull a lot of things
