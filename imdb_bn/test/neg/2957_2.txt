This movie is very long way. I lost interest in an hour in the story. Saratoga tells the story of Trunk Ingrid Bergman, a famous New Orleans man and his mistress. After his mother died in Paris, Bergman came back to New Orleans to scandalize his father's "legitimate" family and to blackmail him. He met Gary Cooper, who likewise sought revenge against the railway tycoon who tricked his father from his land in Texas. He took him to his schemes, and the film reached the Saratog resort. Long and annoying, but if you're a bargman or Cooper fan then valuable. Midget Cupidon provides the only brilliant spot in these scary stories.
