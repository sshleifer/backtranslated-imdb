When I first heard of this movie, I quickly went out, believed (wrongly) that it was such a bad one-it was one of the fun movies and I was for a behavior. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> To get started, the speed is frustrating, slowly and slowly. Do not start running for 15-20 minutes! The plot was boring, and the end was unconscious and confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. This movie provides glasses of frustration, but rarely is the "Thrills", it lacks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
