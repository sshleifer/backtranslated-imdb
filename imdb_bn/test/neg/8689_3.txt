Uncle Fred Ollen Ray again gave us "lovemaking" a little bit of "love" as our little-core cinemax non-classic. <br /> <br /> When looking at a gravel nut, they look at the stone when it comes to cute dolts as it covers across a "black hole" in a cast vortex. A million crores of years ago, an attractive cave girl soon fell into the time-line and she carried her way in the future. Soon his study made halfway his way in the future and opened a path through future beds. Ray again is an extraordinary performance (but only) memory-festation that plays terrible but some decent skin. Yes it's just title but hey! If bad is bad, it will cure insomnia. <br /> <br /> Reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
