The idea of ​​a really interesting story with good actors but it misses anyway The actors were older but none of them looked particularly well. They like them better, photography or anything else. It is considered to be a love story and yet the picture is more than the rough face of the street movie. I liked the cast but I think performance was rather soft. This is where the manager shows weakness. Perhaps Mrs Spielberg ordered Mr. Spielberg to be a better film.
