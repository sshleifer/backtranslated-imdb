I do not know about you but I was afraid to go to horror movies and it was something scary, the film was really scary and had always been unfortunately unsuccessful! These are some of the suspicious moments that you will see this year by a few bad signals, probably decades! I mean when CGI seems to be watching TV on day by day, I give a bad name to the TV of the day, I saw better things in science file. I'm really sorry for the actors because they've associated their name with this movie) They did a good job, I took care of most of the characters and I felt that their performances were good, but it was not enough to get this movie out of the gutter. . Really reusing some of the set's being fun, if you saw "exorcist: at the beginning" it would be easy to reuse some buildings. However, I think the worst thing about this movie, even the CGs was the main monster, he was not scary in any way, his form, the manner in which he spoke, was extremely submissive. All of these movies were a terrific experience, and I went out of the theater if I wanted to finish the theater.
