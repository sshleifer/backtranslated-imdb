This movie now examines an infamous vans congress, where the top Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the "Final Solution" organization, I want to say that I am surprised to see Kenneth Branagh playing Nazi. With blonde hair slicked back, she certainly looks at the part but she does not really work in good part. There was no danger and cruelty, and eventually he went out to look like a cheerleader coming out, going to the meeting. True Hydraik did not allow the control of how it worked in this movie. <br /> <br /> undoubtedly Colin Firth who is Dr. He played William Starkart, who wrote in 1935. NÃ¼rburg's race has given "legal consent" to the laws and the Nazis. Firth's performance was stunning, what the main vocal opponent Heidrich was offering. The Nazi Bang Bang was the best part when he was verbally arranged. "I'll remember you" and Firth responded, "You should! I'm very familiar !!" The film is historically correct, but let's really blow it out - a group of men around a table discuss, discuss, scream and seriously about 90 minutes. There is no tension, no real conflict (except for the short argument). It's just 90 minutes! Same room, same table, same person <br /> <br /> I'm not sure whether the DVD is worth the money. I felt a little changed for one.
