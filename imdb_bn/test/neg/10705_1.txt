The plot - In the future, when almost all men are killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer is a chem lab that creates a 'creation' - confusing. Despite the somewhat promising premises, the film almost flattened in almost every field. The dialogue is ridiculous. Letter thin paper. The search of a single sex world is shallow. The worst part of the whole film is the Asian detective who has made the lines so sugar that you want to reverse. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how this trash was produced on earth. Movies are mostly male bashing. "All men fell." "All male rape women." "Male only animals." All women - even 'closet heater case' - seems to show anger-fear, fear, and hatred for men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie with the edge of this film then you will do a good job elsewhere.
