I looked at the video store and thought I would try it. Sound like a good story and cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noyle" was the most convincing, though there was no heavy time in the film. I think it's really hard to give a bad rating to a movie, but it gets my book in one minute. I went well with the movie but I wanted to get better but get no benefit. Asthetically, it was good. The sound and the light were good, but the acting of this photo killed it for me. It was like watching a low-grade soap opera. I just said, "I can not believe that they left this step this way". I paused several times to disbelief that the acting was bad. I want to say so much but I would say, for all other things, it was good, it was acting as a final spend, which really made this photo.
