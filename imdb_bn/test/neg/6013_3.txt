This movie should be called a cinematic performance. It took pictures like the painting and director Cliffe's note page 3 and decided that it would be a great car for a film on the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is good here, but there is no similarity with the Hemingway in the dialogue. This is the version created by Hemingway. Hect, Screenwriter, A Hack. See the 1932 edition with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. It was a great film and some of them realized the Battle of Hemingway and North Italy. Gary Cooper is very good compared to his performance, Bell Tolls for whom he feels as tough as the board and he is in the west. <br /> <br /> However, if you're a Hemingway fan then do yourself a favor and do not see this film.
