Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gilleson's trio jumped through the hands of Ginzar Rogers in the Cornish game of Connie Island. With the outbreak of World War I, the trio enters and drives ginger from a distance. The first half of this Arque Pathway production is becoming difficult, screaming with the sight of one man-fishing boat and 'sniper' dialogue with three men, which is tired quickly. In the second half, the US Central Navy follows the German workers' cruiser and a U-boat on the growing steps. These sequences are animated and protected, but overall it is a flat ending and unsatisfied comedy-drama. Only for big fans.
