When I say that this movie was worse than any movie. Worse than "Batman and Robin". Worse than "Manos, Look Arm". Seriously, it's that bad. When people tell me that a movie is terrible, I use the "two girls" scale to identify it. I would not see it when compared to the movie "Two Girls". If it is as good as double, I can see it, but only for those who paid for it, they have to laugh at, because it can be a movie twice as rubbish.
