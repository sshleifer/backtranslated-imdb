My only regret is that a person can not grade a movie in IMDB. "An army ..." will definitely deserve her! At least <br /> <br /> <br /> * Spokela? * The movie starts with a bunch of crypt entry to wake an old vampire. When a person cuts himself and his blood and falls on the damaged body supposed to be bloody, the transformation takes place and the effect of a vampire, an animation-like effect (you believe it!) Is a more human form that only accepts it Tux and wearing a bow-tie reveal that! A wife-in-law, yes. Red, if my memory works right to me! I tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit, but it does not get any better than opening order. I closed the movie, it cursed me to expect a vampire movie. This is not necessarily the case, unless you are 5 and you can take this kind of foolishness seriously. So, if you like the vampire and do not want to feel rebellious or even hateful, learn from my mistakes and even try to see this garbage!
