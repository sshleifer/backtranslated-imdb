Presenting topics are very interesting; Upgradation culture, subdivision expansion, public transport, oil and gas reduction, energy dependence, alternative energy sources etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is part of a pure and shameless promotion. One aspect is presented, then hammered over over the visitors. You often see their case 'experts' on the same topic. The supposed 'narrator' sounds like a news reporter, but eventually he is promoting the film's policy. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film does not reduce the sadness and weak message of oil, but the filmmakers are actually for a post-oil society and what it wants is really sensual. They portray this picture of a Utopian society where we all return to the self-reliant local village model; Walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and usually live a lifestyle of the 19th century. For them, the post-oil society will feel a great vision of a good world. This must be the end of globalization, and better, at the end of Walmart's spell. I would like to give them some credentials for the actual math application to reveal the weaknesses of alternative sources of alternative sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 stars because I appreciated the old footage and the premises.
