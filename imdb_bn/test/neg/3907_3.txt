How to do stories to get this bad. That's not a question. This is a statement. <br /> <br /> This image is my problem. <br /> <br /> 1) The development of most stories was predictable and annoying. My passion has quite a lot of runs in a flat line. There was not much to attract the viewer in the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The letters were neutral abnormally unusual. One was a loon, the other was confusing, and the third was pretty annoying. There was absolutely no reason for dragging these people. Although I did not know it would not happen, I hope that they will be interesting to anyone else. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. A trailer ??? Industrial sector ??? Desert is a place that most people do not like to visit. How do these three end in the desert ???? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really want me to believe that the last three people of the world can find each other in the desert in a few weeks? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for Mrs.? Will there be two scenes that Ryan needs a swimsuit? Hey, she looks pretty, but it was very vague. <br /> <br /> Well, if I thought it was so bad, why did I give it 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Although Allan is annoying, I say that David Ornot has done a very credible job of portraying a neurotropy Nerd (this character reminds me of some annoying role of Albert Brooks). Jerry Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it was not very well written. OK, so she was supposed to be a distraught, unusual woman. but why? What does it add to the story? Swinging her mood felt that I was disappointed (hard!) One way and then another and then another. <br /> <br /> I often do not act in movies, but this makes me think a lot of times. Tough, predictable, annoying Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> I have 2 cents.
