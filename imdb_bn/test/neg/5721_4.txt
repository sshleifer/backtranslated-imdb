Really, this movie is weak. Very weak Only capital can do something of character. It's like a supercharger in a bad engine ... So, if you like red-haired valerie - check it out. But look better and look at Brigitte's picture like Sanger and keep it on the desktop. It will save frustration. Well, Arnold also makes his contract ... but his role is definitely not the best. Other characters - bad is not that word. Sword war? Monsters? Ridiculous Plot really shame Why did he need to rape? In particular, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> However the movie is weak. Although bad movies exist ... without the main character it will be just ******. And if someone talks about it, maybe ...
