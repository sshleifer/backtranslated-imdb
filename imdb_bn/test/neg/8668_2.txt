I read a lot of june Austen during my time and approved several movie / TV adaptations but we just do not need it. <br /> <br /> The rating is 2, because I do not say it's too awful to be so annoying you would think your life wasted 90 minutes. Dry scripts combined by even silly acting. I have heard Billy Piper Dr. who is OK (no fan can not confirm so) but this he just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry in Leeds. It is Austen, it is supposed to be a romance! <br /> <br /> Please do not let this free you from Austen or historical plays. There are plenty of good programs to look at.
