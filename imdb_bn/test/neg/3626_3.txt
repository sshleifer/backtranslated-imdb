OK, I would agree with the review of almost everyone here. The character. Is. Stupid They are all stereotypical, and still have beautiful clothes and are always skinny. <br/> <br /> <br /> Jamie Lin's role as ZOEY did not even get me. Zoey is a beautiful, popular, taut, blonde young teen who just loves everyone! He has a "rebellious", great, personality that everyone agrees with it's stupid or extreme no matter. Most annoying: his voice is so deceitful bubbles and objectionable. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> See for example the first episode. The moment he goes to the huge PCA campus, everyone loves him. The boys want to ask him, girls want to be his friend, etc. Thinking that all this, this phenomenon is always concentrated with Joe; He is kind enough to be the best player of the basketball team, the so-called best player, confident, and face-to-face face. Oh my boyfriend! <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite character is so far away that this whole series is a girl who is later shown in Shaw, Lauren or anything else, which shows only the hating of Joe For <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes Joey does not seem very loyal to her friends. In one episode he calls his frequency without even asking for his forgiveness and does not show at least sad remorse to act like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jolie is always the best. <br /> <br /> Professional t-shirts and backpacks (which are a big hit) <br /> <br /> - The single person came up with a very wide range of schemes for sending lessons. <br /> <br /> -Flace grade <br /> <br /> - A person responsible for stuff that was not related to him, so everyone else may be happy. <br /> <br /> - So good that a commercial coming up with it is made in the TV. The list is running and ... <br /> She has no acting talent. He is always the perfect person. He works brutal and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, regardless of these cardboard characters, plots are creative. It's not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. Humor is usually normal and fun, but the characters are so much of paper that it is hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This show will be really good if it takes a little longer to think of the Dan Chanadera type. Characters he wanted, because they are very common, so annoying that it's long and stupid. Points: Someone has a low bit weight, everyone has stylish clothes, the definition of Zoey Mary-Sue, the story line is well thought out, and humorous ridiculous. But again, I want to emphasize that stressed letter shows show. If you must see the show, look at the show, but do not say if I started bleeding your eyes, then I warned you.
