What is this movie ??? With an old boring idea of ​​mistrust, a horror movie that has already achieved "Bhat Shibir". Film actors Imran Hashimi, Udit Goswami and Dino Morea There is no "base" in the movie. It just goes like this ... Dino is a grown up and living in a rich palace. But Dino does not like Udita in the heart because she wants her wealth. He likes someone else (his Sharma). So Umra has a relationship with Umra, so that he can catch them and eventually split up with the rise. How disturbing !! But Imran falls in love with Udit and in contrast. Finally, when Umta Imran gets the imprisonment, Dino inspires to show her false love for her. Woody could not understand the other side and she really loves him. So he lends all his resources to Dino. Eventually Deino came out of the police station and went with her with all the resources. What a fraud !! The songs are good and only good things in the movie. Individual rating now: (out 5) Imran: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Above all: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Bad performance and poor welding ....... Music: Good ... I rated the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Do not waste your time !!!!)
