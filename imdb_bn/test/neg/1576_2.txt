I saw this movie on surfing night on TV in two nights morning through Sitikom of Infirmalsals and late night 80s. I would say, I did not expect much, and I did not get much. Although Rose McGowan's hot, its performance and other cast performance are not Oscar-worthy, at least say. This movie is up and down, and in the end there are a nice couple of twists, but all honesty was terrible to it. Even a simple slasher movie. No grave, no gender, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I like to give it a 3 out of 10
