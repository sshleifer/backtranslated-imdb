I'm not bothered by the lazy hosts, or I am disturbed by the brutal, self-righteous attitude of these crap makers. <br /> <br /> What I'm worried about is that the huge majority of the episodes are fake. If the episodes are stacked, I would not be surprised. So this is not a reality show, but a little worse than the other: Rubbish television with zero-coma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less intrigues <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > If only these concepts are free from all legal complications / trappings, what actually happens to real people and what happens after the event is disseminated. So the only way to create this "reality show" is "rather" to get some rather frustrated actors and improve them (and most awful and incredible improvisation it's most of the time!). Those who last grade school do not have to be clear at this? Most reviews I read here are not even fraud that any of it is fake, it can all be. Wondering thinking or just endless despair? <br /> <br /> The mercenary sounds of the mercenary are like free unemployed unemployed people who are waiting for the table waiting for a talk show (or this bad) to wait, they will eventually make a few hundred bucks Which is when to get the opportunity. I even recognized an actress (in the role of "deceiver") that I saw in "Jerry Springer Show" many years ago. And I only saw 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters". How many performers are there in the exciting events that I do not know about Springer and "Cheers"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Springer show is not fake; A bulk of the episode is unstaged - so often very entertaining. There is no price at "cheaters", unless you are a struggling actor and want tips on how to not work in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Various (very cheap, transparent) tricks of producers create illusions of reality, confusing documentary feelings that give them footage. But it's all in the vein. In the end, the more intelligent train-debris-finders are left with absolutely squat. There is more credibility than "professional wrestling".
