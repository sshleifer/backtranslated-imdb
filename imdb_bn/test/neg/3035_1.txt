This film really misses the mark on the most front. Pronunciations are the humorously weak, acting amateur and comedy is the least weak. They have a great idea, they can be especially enjoyable, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <The author thinks that by keeping the word f * ck in each word it will make it more fun and try the main character a bit harder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> business, lock stock and snap.
