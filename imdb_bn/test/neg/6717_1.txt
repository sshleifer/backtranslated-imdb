I think the film is made upside down, first of all, they shoot many scenes and actions, and explosions, and then story-writers start working to try to find a story to connect all the scenes together. Without any doubt, I have seen that the worst movie, your average porn movie comes with a better written and more coherent script. The movie makes no sense. Seriously, even if you are a seagull fan, there is no reason that you want to watch this movie, if you are one of those people who want to avoid the accident because it is a horrific accident and it should not be released in this world. <br /> <br /> Bourne.
