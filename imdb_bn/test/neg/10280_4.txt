I always wanted to see the blue electrode for very long time. I've always been curious about the title, the star and the desert, but for some reason (now quite clear), this movie is never shown on TV or I can miss it if it is ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I know now why this movie has been shown very rarely because it is not good. Actually, I'll say it's a mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is mainly a series of vignettes with nothing absolutely holding together. There was a gathering of small films together, suddenly assembled together. Movie can be flown: article (murder); Police and girlfriend together; Article credit; Police are going to work; Crazy people tell stories; Police recovered the body! Cop and main and girlfriend bar; Chase view; Etc. Do not flow together in the scene. They are very independent from each other and this is characterized by weakening, unlimited amateur The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene at the farm with the hippie, the scene with the Big John and the chief was worthy of yelling at each other worthy of the cringe. I almost stop filming those (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The lack of filmmaker's experience is evidence throughout the film. Style, like the 1970's, on all the maps. Articles The credit scene makes a commercial-like appearance for law enforcement. Then it is a friendly picture (Big John and Zipper) and then a murder mystery; Then a melodramatic love story; Etc. A movie does not have to be a specific style to be successful, but I'm not afraid that the electrode in Blue was confused. You can see clearly that he does not know what a director is doing or where he is taking it. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a complete disaster. Although blue-colored electr glaide content is almost amateur, its appearance is extremely (and deceptive) professionals. Cinematography is stunning. Each frame is an exhibition worthy of an art gallery. Or, because the first (and last) director of the album was involved in the cover of the album cover. In the beautiful look of the film, it really gives more confidence to the last product than the quality. And Robert Blake's acting (played by a badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of reality, though nothing else understands. What is remarkable about the appearance and composition of the film is that it has been copied and duplicated over one million times. Institutional credit reminds me of something like the top quality, which was created 13 years later. With her clothes on the bed, Janie's dress scenes remind me of American Gigolo. Surprisingly enough, the electrode in Blue is a very contemporary feeling, due to the incredible visibility, even if the story behind it and the view is frustrating. So, in the electrode in Blue In Hall, on one hand, it is an extraordinary inclusion and neglected film because it appeared apparently and in essence when it probably affected many of the future filmmakers. Only a few films can claim to achieve this and legend cinematographer Conrad Hall will have to take full credit. However, on the other hand, the EGIBO has been forgotten because poor characters, confusing stories, and fake aspects, none of which are memorable.
