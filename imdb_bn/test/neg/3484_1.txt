One of the worst surfing movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that I do not know where to start - OK, let's start - some dailies from the mainland who know how to navigate in Hawaii and enter a big wave competition, which they expect less or less, win. For those who do not go surfing, it would be a good analogy for the pair of running shoes to push the burglar's loud smoke and hopefully win the marathon. No way! And, the competition was held at The North Shore, which arranged 15+ feet of waves, but the wave on the Contest Day could be 6 feet. Acting? What acting? If you want to see it on TV then do not waste your rent. If you want to see a fantastic good surfing movie - it's defective, but it's another story - the wider Wednesday rental.
