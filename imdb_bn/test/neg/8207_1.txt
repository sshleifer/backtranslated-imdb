Why can not a movie be rated a zero? Even a negative number? Some movies like "Cinema Nine Outdoor Space" are so bad that they have fun to watch. This is not the one. "The Dwarzen of Horror" may be the worst movie I ever seen (however. I had a lot of fast forward through it!). Thankfully, for my young man's discretion and the heroism of my progressive age, I can see more bad movies, but grateful, I can not remember them. The set is made with cardboard and finished with spray paint screws. Special effects set in a footwear box with a fifth grader's C + diorama set shoes. When the movie hits Marqui and kills his servant, the film is unusually gaffe. He immediately entered into a quarrel with his fleeing victim, who took the body of his gunman and shot him without reloading the gun! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy was only bad. I guess no company or studio wanted to be. However, when you film your garage and set it from cardboard boxes, a studio is not required. This movie is suddenly known as "The Manipuler" with the worst of all the worst movies ever, which I sometimes saw (one time) the worst of Hollywood's top-of-the-series Mickey Rooney. Only I would recommend watching "Harrow of the Harrow" (or "manipulator") if someone can pay you. (I cheaper) I have $ 7 or $ 8 bucks for "Dungeon" and there are at least ten for "manipulator".
