This filmmaker wanted to tell a story that wanted to make a movie - and so on. Unlikely / unconstrained coincidences and strangers intrigue lines, all really terrible quarrels without letters or explicit motivation. <br /> <br /> we get chich√© snapshots instead of letters. Especially a small and beautiful crime boss, who projected an exaggerated "tough guy" personality and put a horrible cartoon shadow on the real tough son coming to work for him. Nothing much surprising than watching a shot without a shot when the boys hit the road, and none of them explain or explain a bright, sky-blue suitcase (as small as the complete American tourism set). Forgiveness Otherwise it is visible perspective - another mandatory shot in a beautiful bridge in the City is a mandatory shot.
