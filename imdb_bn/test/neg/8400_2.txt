I really wanted to like this movie, especially after all the lightning I heard around it. But, sadly, it did not work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same illusion - Very few conversations made in translation - If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow shutdown and pay attention to the pieces of fabric, then your story will become wider and deeper. <br /> <br /> Most plot lines, if you can find a plot, then add this movie. I was not disappointed 'write it all' confidentially the way of atheist behavior with accidents - so can we believe? He later became happy and wrote a book about his experience, thus, this horrible incident was decided? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do I want to be a movie that shows sympathy for a young man? Futile and faced with an impossible moral quandary, instead of creating a portrait of socialist personality in the future. There is no connection with anyone around him, and there is no real concept of right or wrong at the end of the film. She has no direction in the house and thinks nothing for her friends. What we have is a non-person, a soul that reaches only through life when it sits on its skateboard. I do not feel so much for him, and I want to tell him really. Not all movie centers are critical on the feelings of his crime, but how he is going to avoid punishment and / or accountability for a bad decision. She not only gets away with her, she finds it a way to subtly reasonable. Dreadful, negative message, our young people are so different from the right and doubly that the suggestions make the rules as well as serving themselves well or ill. It's a humiliating behavior for today's young man, and the filmmaker's fearsome arrogance makes every ploding, extra thinking, and frequent drips with eyes removed. <br /> <br /> (He killed guard, but if you embrace your eyes you feel like it was not a duty to say mercy or not - it was probably shameful with his skateboard. When a car is carried out, a wheel skateboard is stained with blood.)
