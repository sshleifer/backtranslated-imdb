The singers of the Czech film may have enjoyed this movie and rated it because it was a check, but I think it is quarterly, tiresome, shocked, annoying, and vague. Again, I doubt the "ramping" of this film to increase the sales of this dog. Amazon is saying about this film some of the folks who refuse to be big, but I'm going to be one more - I think it's almost two have entered a dementia state and are doing any work that does not give any idea to anyone. I said, a film actor has committed suicide after film and I will believe. When he saw his performance, he probably realized what he did and he realized that the only way to avoid the terminal embarrassment was to create a "big exit", which I was certain that it was even more dramatic and much better performance "Autumn Spring " Do not waste your time or money on this kind of performance. It's nothing more than a dog in a hole.
