I just saw Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove, Lauder Road and Dead Man's Walk. All are excellent This junky work has been done very cheaply and has been played poorly. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gass came to McRae as a solid believing cowboy. Caption call is played by a different actor, but everyone quickly won me. Believing as a small version of the boys' experienced Texas Ranger in Dead Man's Walk. At the Kamchech Moon they just got a couple of drunk rednecks. I had to stop. <br /> <br /> I have written a lot of reviews for this show which made this stinging pile. It's otherwise a great franchise to end a sorry.
