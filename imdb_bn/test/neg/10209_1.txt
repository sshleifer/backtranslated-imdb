No Holes Barred is a film that should not be taken seriously in any way. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. See also that your plan should be 9 out of the outer space. They are the same one in each other that they are funny No Holds Barred Funny moments are usually not supposed to be one. Hul Hogan, run by Hip Hogan only after playing the first interview with Brip (Cart Fuller), can only play them) Leona driver comes out in front of him and it is a part of the movie shown to each person. It can never be the most fun scene, I swear. <br /> <br /> However, I never knew how anyone would make money in this film and that person would probably have to submit. I hope I've fired at least. This movie earns 1 out of 5 on my scale and it's the only funny part.
