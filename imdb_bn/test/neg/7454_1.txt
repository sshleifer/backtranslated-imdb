This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen in film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Acting in this movie is very bad. Change the scene at the hat drop. For example, for at least 30 seconds we saw some people singing to themselves, which did not add anything to the movie. I have the worst conversation in this life, I do not think this film can be even worse, but it is already. I would describe it as the Chuck Norris Action Film would go wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
