I've spent quite a few minutes through all the reviews for this photo. I'm in a rough study saying that Noah's ark is crippled, shit, shit, shit, shit! NBC does not have any classes of executives? Actually my stomach feel ill to see both parts of this small series. The script is so stupid, so pointless, and yes, completely invalid! I can make some changes to the dramatic purpose, but this movie only changed everything in the story. God is going through difficulties to stop the entire population of the world, but he misses a person who is trying to sell stuff in Noa. Give me a break And did Noah's son act like Indiana Jones, save the girls in trouble? If not bad enough, God takes part where Noah apologies to Noah and says "I'm sorry Noah, I was wrong". Newsflash NBC, God can not be wrong! This image is sometimes made in the most ruthless and insulting biblical film.
