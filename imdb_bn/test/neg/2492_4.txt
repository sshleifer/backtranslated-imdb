There are other comments here how poor this movie is. How do I want to say how the film has taken the biggest science project in history and it looks small. The Manhattan Project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Nearly all silver electromagnetic divisions in the country went to make cables. There were two choices in each of the ways to work if they were both just so. The first durable nuclear reactor was fired under the study of the University of Chicago Stadium with graduate students as revising the scam as graduate students. This is an interesting story that holds hundreds of locations and thousands of people, this picture seems to be getting reduced to a small group of satirists in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked was the big moral debate. After surrendering to Germany, the project has to be continued. Okay, our thousands of men (mostly men) who work for several years can actually make big brooms. Does anyone think that they do not want to see it? There was some debate about whether our device should be used, but it was not serious, obviously the film did not make this huge debate.
