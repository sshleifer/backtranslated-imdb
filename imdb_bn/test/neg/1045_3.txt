Twilight Zone has achieved a specific legend about it - like Star Trek. Since there are many dedicated lovers on this event, it does not seem to be the winner of any episode. Each of them displays 10 and does not evaluate the exhibition. For this reason, a while ago I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were very positive. Now, while doing this for the timeline zone. <br /> <br /> Now I am very surprised when I have seen reviews for this Blend Episode which described it as "in the best" and gave 10 scores, if this is the case, why is it that I hate this episode? I hate it as much as I hate? It is possible that my family and friends have all the cranks but it is also possible that in this case, the average rate of average or lower average in this case has been reduced to another violent fan. <br /> <br /> This episode was written by William Windmom and others in various folklore - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They all stuck in the cylindrical chamber and finally you can understand the "frustration of frustration" - which is not frustrating and it is mainly primarily crippled. No, it's a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes, there are many episodes in the series that have achieved 10 qualifications, but some are as worthless due to some shallow scripts and an out-of-date resolution.
