Friz Freleng's 'Snafuperman' is one of the less personal Snafu shorts. An alert on the importance of your field manual study, 'Snafuperman' rather makes curtains rather. The story, in which the technical fairy, makes the first class an epidemic to help Snaff to see its way wrong, it is expected and unclear. The previous snifoo of Freelong's brief 'Romers' burst out with ideas and smiles, but the director here grew taller rather annoying and he struggled to make a recreational short from it. For even more than three minutes, 'Snfupperman' seemed to be and unlike the best cartoon of the series, it was like a directional film and the second in entertainment. Although they were more scattered than the normal Warner cartoons, Sanfu Shorts suddenly maintained an amazingly high standard. 'Snaffman' reflects more reasonable-quality standards than the genius of the creative mind.
