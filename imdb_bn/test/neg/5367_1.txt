There really is no redeeming reason about this show. Simply put it, it's just terrible. Absolutely horrible It's just a terrific "reality" show. Imagine this: A group of very fantastic teenagers get together on one night and "Hey!" "Ghost Hunters" and do not! "So they occupy a camera, local residents and random landscapes of the movie" Beat-to-the-dramatic-yet-fail-is-wrong "behind the myths. This show originally started with a home movie camera trying to create a bad movie posture There is a bunch of teens.Only the difference is that this show is actually a budget and a writer.A bad budget and a terrible writer <br /> < Well, first stop, let's talk about this from a personal level, it's unusual when I'm not total skeptic.I am unusual and willing to believe what, and I'm sure Many people who feel the same. So, you're going to do a show about unusual, but you have to work harder to see what they're looking for is unusual or not. Because, because the audience can easily believe otherwise I hate to compare, but I do not see why at this time, for example, "Ghost Hunter." In "Ghost Hunters" you can say that the cast is in line with the audience, they are not entirely suspicious, Yet they are still willing to remember the possibility of any unusual obstacles. They are willing to see something and say "it is possible that its nothing simple". And, with that feeling, they tried and proved themselves wrong. They use technology and other gadgets with constant restraint to determine how they can handle something that they can not observe, which is unusual. They are not only trying to convince you, they are trying to convince themselves of what is true and what not. Doubt that the material "unusual state" does not appear. <br /> <br /> "Unusual state", Cast is simply saying "This is a scary place and it is Hunted, so we can find some spirit!" And immediately you know and say to yourself "OK, otherwise I'm satisfied". Cast is not a professional in their interview. In fact, sometimes they seem to harass local residents of this so-called "panic" area. Without their hypotheses and theories, there is no authentic evidence to support their claims and they can "claim" that they can communicate with the dead, this person supports any person and how valid they really are. They said they could easily pick some random person off the street and said "you can contact spirits for our show" and said it went. In the "Methanan" episode, it is just right. Without proof of evidence at the end of the ceremony, they bring such a person out of here where "somewhat" a little bit of "scary" works in a supposedly scrapped script of the supposed area to satisfy his audience. Very, very poor effort. I think one of the main problems of the show is that it is scripted. In one of the episodes, at the time of being dramatic, it was attacked by "one of the unusual contrasts" at Cast. Such dramatic sequences will create a suspicious smile and even those who are traveling will understand that what they are watching is just a bunch of tabloid-esquier trash If the aim of the event is to try their audiences and firmly believe that this "unusual" phenomenon is real, they are doing so badly in such a way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Only one last scene to see if the event is really valuable. The program is not trying to convince you that these unusual incidents are real and you are just trying to entertain with good fiction? It even fails at that level. The creators of the show were trying to write fiction to entertain the audience, but the text was too poor and even imagined that the audience failed firmly to believe that their cast members really felt his full, horrible glory unknown. The text is not only compulsory and even brave, I say boring. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The remnants of this event are only thirteen teenagers who are very uncomfortable or exaggerated, incredibly trusting because only camera is more amazing than reality, a bad script and bad actors Generally made a really bad horror documentary. All shows are at this time. There is no reason to see it, even for the entertainment factor and there is no reason to care for it. To be stupid, its lame. There are absolutely no redeeming reasons about this show.
