First, this film was made in 1978. So tell you that the movie is going to be bad. But I'm not saying that all the old movies are bad. Second, the special effect we have even terrible for that time. Finally, the performance was so bad, Bozo the Clown could do it better. It surprises you how people earn money to create these movies. This movie sucks!
