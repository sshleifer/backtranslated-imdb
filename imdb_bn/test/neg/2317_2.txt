This is a little cheapy only significant because it's the worst movie Abbott and Costello ever made. It is always awesome: continuous music, horror danceography (check out the strange lead male dancer), Chess special effects and sets, wooden actors (Leads only at high school level in their profession and not later) and a script without a single smile. There was a good time ahead for comedy pairing. Meeting with Abbott and Costello Captain Kid is very popular, such as the television series, which was inspired occasionally. But skip this one.
