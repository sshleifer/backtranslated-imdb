I do not understand why any of the biggest metro areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio etc) show a show, they portray the average person as wranglers / cowboys hats. With a drill, there is zero fashion sense, and his "Salon" or his next hunting trip, Rodo, Skit Shooting or country's music concert drive him a truck on the way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe the average person is very stupid to know the differences. Bad scripts and equally bad acting away. This show shows the dirty look of the past, high entertainment like nitrider. At least there was reason to talk about nitrite.
