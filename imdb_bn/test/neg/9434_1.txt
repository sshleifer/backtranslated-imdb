Can a bad film be? Even its terrible bad Ed Wood could not come up with anything bad. Silent, stupid, tall wind, annoying ... and those good points. In the early 80's I saw this trash when I was incredibly anxious, and actually did not finish my brain and sat on the whole thing, although it was probably more pleasurable. I actually think because it was actually so bad. It makes me sad because they started by creating some TV movies (ie Spielberg) for the best managers and they had a great way to get their primary ingredients to the public, but the crap completely killed the process completely.
