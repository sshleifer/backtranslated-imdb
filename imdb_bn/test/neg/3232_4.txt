Cori Heim plays a kid who shares a giant troll with a dog and teamed with a dog with OSA Hit-Man (Michael Iranside) 30/30 and home-made bombs (some plays considered in the snow) and protects his mother and girlfriend. This watchable still frustrating adaption in a decent story. Cori Heim is terrible, of course, with the continuous motion of the film, along with the strong presence of Iranaside, it has produced at least one of the most modest films. Still the plot is ridiculous and can be inferior if we have seen a giant or at least more gore. At least it's something different. It is also most likely that this movie will be the last teen movie for a while to create a young pipe bomb. <br /> <br /> Matt Branson 2/5
