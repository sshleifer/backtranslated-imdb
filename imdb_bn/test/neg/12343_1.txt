After 11 years of releasing this movie, 5 people reviewed it in IMDB. There is reason to lack this interest across the moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic qualities. See this film for all kinds of terrible production examples. For example the opening credit mechanically increasingly white letters from the red background. The last feature Michael MacQueon showed in the prison window said, "There are many mysteries there." Sadly, all the uploading moments in bad movie follow a clip montage / music video. Julinana Hatfield Everything is horrible in between. I struggled to find a price in this film and I just came out. Although hard to believe, a Camio role of Berghus Meridith (always a crowd receiver) just disappointed me. This film is very special about movie which is a fun. Down the average of the movie on paper. Women live together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost unwatchable. The movie tried to branch off from many aspects but no one followed it through. The unexpected conflict of their lovers in prison has never been resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. Women became hookers, but that does not happen. Instead they get to work as a bartender and a shelf stock. Exciting sounds? It was not. It was stupid. And mostly in the movie, two women are talking about alleged contradiction and are inventing. Woman enabled actress, but the script was beyond the poor. Useless It was a terrible movie, but it is worse that they took Berger Meridith out of his retirement house. Bad end to start Like a lion without teeth, this film has no bite.
