Seriously! You got this movie to understand something wrong with her. It came in a time when everybody was trying to make family films, so everyone could enjoy (small missile; Mr. Nani, etc.) but still there is no charisma or encouragement. Every single character in the movie is driven by anger, in addition to the exception of Tricks' mother, shows only fatigue and fatigue, probably enjoying this movie with this click. <br /> <br /> To say it simply, do not play the biggest flaw in the film, not the filming, but most notably the text. The line we receive is classic Disney memorable, although this film managed to pull off the whole heartburn non-IL 'Walt. Junior's father, John Ritter, makes you crazy about doing something, because he gives junior permission to rotate around unpublished, and only when he taps 200 pounds of green on the chalk board, he gives a strict warning. <br /> <br /> Also, junior's grandfather is particularly annoying. This seems to be annoying for those of you who first saw it, and thus, the second movie was not shown as "Big Ben Healy", as it has been mentioned in this movie, yet a total of two eyes He was originally separated from John Rotor's house, set himself up in the junior room, although he said that he hates junior and does not do anything to promote film speeds or to support the film in some way. Rather, he stopped the list with a lazy free loader. Finally, we introduced different types of new characters, such as smog, riddles, tricks, who carry dynamite to her backpack, which she is the Prothom-alo, then hands, junior, who easily open eyed stares. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returned to this film, while playing in the junior new elementary school, the unreasonable principal. If Gilbert Gotfride is not enough across the point, I'll simply give it: <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the firmity of the actor creates a stir through the film, though the script sucks.
