Bled is a very suitable title for it as you see it you will feel bled from you in your life. Horrible horses are just like those people who do not want to do (going into the basement or going into the attack), then the problem arises, be careful, then do not watch this movie. Enter the pictures of the brain that are never seen in horror films. And if you need inspiration of this movie? The worst bad shot is just as bad as the movie, the dead house is bad. I have often thought of writing a movie review on IMDB. And, after seeing something based on the comments here, I discovered that everyone was attracted to his opinion. Believe me mine
