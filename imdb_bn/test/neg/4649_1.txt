Legendary Cameron Mitchell is burned by a Turkish actress / makeup man starry when the light of cigarette flows in his face. In the Mwiland Max Museum, Mitchell dressed in a scared mess and an eye patch. He slaughtered people using a solution that killed people, so that they could turn them into exhibitions. Desi describes that genuinely malicious bad movie. Do not try to remove the number of wax numbers, take note of the tobacco that is excluded from most southern states, because things are radioactive and radioactive only. It's a terrible tragedy in a movie and you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. It's a classic bad movie that will surprise you even as it leaves permanent scars on your mind.
