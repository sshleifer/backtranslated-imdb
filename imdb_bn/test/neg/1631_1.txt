Almost everyone else, I became aware of Turkey in mystery Science Theater 3,000. It is always easily available as one of my favorite MSST 3K episodes. I really can not try to see this picture in my own film ......... it really, really, really, really really is really really bad. <br /> <br /> A star like Miles O'Keeffe's attire, muscular-based Fabio Wangby who lives during the cave men. We told the viewer to suspend our stagnation that he knows pesticides and chemistry and can create a complete hang-glider in about 5 minutes. Yes right A fairly attractive actress (her name can not be remembered) who wears a hub-hat as a chest shield. Oh, and I do not forget that poses Asian side-kick thong. He played the simplest role in the film because he did not even publish a word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to think about how his character was not talking ... and he tragically failed. <br /> <br /> The film can not be seen in any way, and it should only be seen in the correct MST3K format. If you look at that version, you laugh with your fool! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'm too much !!!!" <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1
