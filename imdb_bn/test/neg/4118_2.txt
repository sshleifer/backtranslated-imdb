What a waste of great acting talent It's a shame because Catherine Dunnew, Matthew Amalik, Emmanuel Devos, Chiarea Mastrowni and Melville Paupud (not to mention the less known in America) can maintain a lot of acting talent. This film is a terrible disappointment. After enjoying her "Kingson and Queens" and this film completely bored and frustrated me where I actually went before the film ended. The film is separated by its peripheral story and supporter character appearing on the screen by traveling around its central story (associated with Catherine Dynne's illness). The film develops very few characters in us so that why different characters hate each other (it was a story of family inconvenience) that the lack of coherent story becomes even more serious. Finally, the soundtrack (which ranged from Hip Hop to Bach until Mendelshan's Midsummer Night Dream) was strange with the film's mental temperature and at that time the audience's feelings expressed any emotion about the feelings that should be felt. Photography (The director often starts the scenes with a mainly dark screen, where our only scene is through a small opening, it seems as if we look through a perfol, which is expanding) also scary and deadly.
