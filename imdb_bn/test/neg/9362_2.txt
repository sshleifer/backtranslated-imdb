This movie is a movie from the toilet. If the name of the production company is a signal, it will be a movie. I think I'm not really a horror film, I'm not a chicken, but this year alone, the proposal I have so far has not been explicitly explained, whether it is from west to west or from Asia. 9:56 A different, great courtyard, but poor execution, depending on the cluttered tricks (I think the only equipment available in these trades?) Try some heartbreaking moments to try. <br /> <br /> She-Zen (Co-Young) is a solo working woman, who once issued a notice that unlike her, apartments in flat blocks, blackouts are available at 9: 5 every day. No, he is not a believer, but a series of vague deaths around, in which he encounters himself in a container, he begins to draw deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding this death. <br /> <br /> There is always a pseudo-logical explanation about how the movie comes to Spu. This is the most interesting subject in the film which "true" is uncovered, although it can not guess the plots through half of preferred film lovers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, a mentally challenged boy and a paved train passenger. But following the general formula, these people usually live there as charity for death, or in this case, the sole aim of filmmakers to confuse the audience, if they are not convinced, then adding a little to forward the plot. <br/> <br /> and do not start me with the techniques employed here. Quick cut, sudden appearance, long hair golf (Ahhhhh, so passes!) That can not be removed properly, the amount of blood is released free of charge, such as releasing the mountain and the list continues. But the sound engineers used to create spellings for the holes for the earrings used while removing the spooks each time, although it seems like a trick Tony. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time at this time, even if you 're a horror fan again. It is a complete waste of a committed premises, and in the end, think you have just taken a ride. Brought is a very long and painful one. In this style, it is better for some innovation, otherwise one movie can easily look like another, the ugly long-haired monsters will be fun, but suddenly they can suddenly create sudden presence as soon as they hear the sounds. Oh, and anyone they can oil those doors as well.
