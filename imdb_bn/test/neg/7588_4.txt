It is true that both ivan the tribili, part i and II, were Harry Medvedev's entry into the 50 worst movie books. Now, I think that they declare among the worst movies that they are sometimes exaggerated, even though they are still both beautiful poor movies - especially the first, even though it looks more than ever seen and "shows Google ID" before !! Director Eijenstein and others fondly thought that it had created "artists and deep" movies - and if I'm legally barbarous, I must say that I hate this first movie !! The second, though still incomplete, is a huge improvement, though as the eye rotation is short, though overacting this film like partact and has long annoying scenes! Part 2 looks quite incomplete and requires at least another hour (especially since it does not get for Ivan's insane behavior later in life - such as killing his son and heir in an appropriate condition). Because both Stalin's two parts 1 and 2 excite his own murderer and glorify him, both sections are, no wonder that the life story of Yanan is very incomplete. In addition to Yan's real horror, Apparently the greatest evil Stalin did not like the film and did not allow the release of his lifetime. Probably he did not approve this because he was more concerned about how much money and the company saw the huge disadvantages of Stalin wanted to see him as a mad man! Meanwhile, there was a segment of this tedious movie that the film was 4 (without it, 2) was so cool - and that scene was with Prince Vladimir! It works well in a dark way and is quite funny. And, scene 2 round technicolar was completed in Russian version. It is very strange, because in the mid-1930s technicolor developed a better color process, which did not show everything in orange and red-green-blue. So, during the color sequence, this movie shows a lot like a silent or initial sound color film. Really very strange for the 1940s.
