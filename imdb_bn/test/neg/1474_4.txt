Sorry, guys, but you all are such a great documentary ... and that award won it at Sundance ... well, you're all guilty. I've heard for a few years about how I had to see this documentary and I finally saw it. Maybe in 1999, when it came, and there was not such a dominant presence in the reality TV industry, this movie seemed entertaining. But Mike and Mark are obviously their own game, Mike and Mark. At times they are funny and some lines appear off the cuff, but mostly they do not ringing the truth. They are J. and Silent Bob's Reality Edition. Yes people are real, they are not actors, but it is, it is overwhelming over themselves, and it is so clear that it is difficult to believe that many people think it is the real deal. I was not fooled so it was actually a tad boring. Gently gripping, but not missing much if you miss it.
