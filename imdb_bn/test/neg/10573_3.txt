I will be funny about this. I did I do not know what happened. But I think the problem lies with many unfortunately welding. I do not know this kid, he may be a very nice person, but he was not right for this movie. And supporting the throw was more obvious. For example, there will be a scene with the interest of her and her love, and your mind will start to break, but then Keith Davids began to speak, or Leslie Nilssen, or Marian Ross, and someone would be enlightened and suddenly you could pay attention again And you think it might not be bad. But when they get back to the main character the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material found in the Superhero style is mostly true that most of the jokes were a fart, you were surprised to know who wrote this thing. I mean that it was a bit funny, because I remember the smile a few times, but now I do not think why and it was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> I honestly take it or give it a rating but I think most people just give it up.
