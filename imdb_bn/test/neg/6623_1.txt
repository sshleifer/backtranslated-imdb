These movies disappointed my wish why this hate is not 100 lists, which I do not know. <br /> <br /> <br /> My life was preserved by Danny Trazzo's healing power. <br /> <br /> The worst movie, I dare you watch. It's like calling a 90 minute gathering commercial, just too bad. I rather see the blue screen it's really bad
