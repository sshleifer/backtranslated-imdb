There is some good performance for this movie - and it's all about going for it. Especially Pauli Peretti is particularly attractive. (Although some bit players seem to be acting from telepipers.) Elements - this is the problem. I think the screen writer / manager saw the whole roles of the falcity together, then sitting for writing the script after sleeping. It really reminds me of Felicity - a thoughtful young girl finds herself, finds love, watches with a flurry and see-character and what their relationships have happened. As I usually enjoyed watching Felicity, this movie leaves me cold. The text is just awful It is extraordinary that Cast can shut them as well, the dialogue is neutral At its worst, it trite, stilted and amateur. There is nothing real here, recycled from the hostage with plat elements which was not so bright. (Angels and Fate Taylor? Come on.) For the first half of the film, I am encouraged for actors and hope to be rewarded for my patience. By the second half, I just wished only to finish it. Cast my sympathy, who deserve a good car for their talents.
