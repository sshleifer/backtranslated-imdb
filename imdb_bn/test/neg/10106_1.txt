From the terrible special effects, I played the worst of any film. Let's do this, I do not have any directional experience, and for the first time when I saw a movie, I thought, 'I can do better than this! This pope was watching the observer. The acting of this film was terrible, I think the best actor was Manmor Man's man, but the French of Alliance 3 was so wooden that I wondered how he got the first job. The story was moderate and I think, like most films, if the rest is done well then it can stand. I usually do not write reviews here, but some people have given this film a good rating (must be a cast / crew) I felt that I had to tell my piece to save me from accidentally hiring money to buy it. cack
