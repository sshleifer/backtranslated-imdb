This movie was not that good at all. Here's the first formula and it will not be a strong film, the name of Harrison Ford will not be the first, but it is larger than the title. Music was nominated for an Oscar, what was the hack? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. Acting was the best sub par, without the son of Amish he did a decent job for so young. Then your story was weak and the place was a bit more, and won it to adapt! The music was awesome, I know I already said something but it was really bad. The court was real good and it should be rebuilt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
