Can i say This was the worst movie of my life hand-down (and I believe, some of my favorite movies are horrific horror). The acting was amateur, the set was boring, and the camerawork was shoddy and sophomoric. This whole movie looked like a college final project. I had to keep myself believing in myself a bit better for it to be done by a teenager. The film's most annoying factor is not even a movie - it's shot in the video. That was extremely confusing. Above all that, dialogue is simply upset and the plot line is so basic it makes water in my eyes. Note that they do not steal at least four horror movies in the first 20 minutes. If there are some things like zero stars then this movie will get it. <br /> <br /> The scary thing of this movie is so bad.
