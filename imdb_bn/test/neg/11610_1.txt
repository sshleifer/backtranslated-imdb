In my local video rental shop, there are two special places for girls and one gar. It's really a long running joke. Clarke hired it for free. They give too much value to their shoppers to waste their hard working money. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see people who gave this movie a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (Or maybe there was a positive comment on Jokes? Can people write about them in the movie? Perhaps the director / author's mother?) <br /> <br /> Maybe I've seen a lot of good movies that fail to compare it.
