It's just 2 stars because they work a lot to make this game better. I played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game is the worst story for me. What they could do is the best conversation that lets you avoid conversations (however, you'll hear them talking for 10 minutes) and only keep the same things back upwards. Embark on the building, save civilians, kill some fathers. It's all the same! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a huge fan of the Prince Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you want to know what happens next time. I do not hate the prince of Persia 4. But I think that anyone who was in charge of developing the story of Assassin's religion should be banned for writing the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Over annoying stories and the same mission over again! One of these two things will be just good enough to play in the game.
