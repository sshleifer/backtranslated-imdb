This movie did it for me, a rude SNL fan for the last 14 years. Jamie Gertz's screenplay was fine, but the film itself was so close. The events presented in the movie are completely skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, would explain so much. He was never in the SNL, had nothing to do with him. While living in SNL, his life is trailing behind. When we first saw him at the SNL, walking through the studio with Loren Michaels, the wall logo was not about 1988-1989, about 1975, and Cast Cast - who are these people? I did not hear one of them. Really dissatisfied Why this movie shows TV movies only TV shows
