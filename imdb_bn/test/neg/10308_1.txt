Wow, there is no word to describe how bad this movie is. I'm generally not proud to be able to enjoy a movie, but it was too much. I would only suggest watching this film as a torture device. If you see it silently, you can overcome horrible plots and conversations, even more awesome camera work and cone special effects make this movie a real panic. If you have less than ten-minute screen time to think about watching it because of your Sandra Bullet fan, do not bother even and its acting is absolutely oppressive. The rest of the cast is not mentioned, which can be replaced with Babun, who will work well, at least then we will not hear terrible dialogue.
