First of all, let me know that I have no idea Nora Roberts K So the book may be great, but the movie is not. <br /> <br /> I have lived in the podmont area of ​​NC whole life. I have not heard a pronoun as ridiculous as in this movie. I lived in two small towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On the occasion, you will show the people with strong southern accent, but I did not come to a city where everyone would talk like a bad imitation of the air with the wind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the reaction of atheist community Gorer_ Your comments reveal more about what your warped psyche about the movie. If we extend our imagination and say nothing in this movie - which is not there - it is true that bad people like Tory's father will always get some justification for their actions. The author chose Tory's supernatural powers as a counter-religion. Your guess is that the "true nature of the gospel" leads one to kill his daughter, that I have ever heard about the most distorted and misinterpretation. Before you start spouting about the Gospel, you should read them first. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Dialogue is flat, unnatural, and incredible most of the time. In particular, what Tire has said is quite inappropriate and does not match the mood, context, or what they said. <br /> <br /> "Exciting twist" lam of the end of the movie, expected, and lack of any credibility. Some have claimed that Jacqueline Bisset has done a wonderful job in this movie, but the fact that the bitter mother character is also an old, anticipated, one-dimensional character. What is the fault of that Biset? I do not know <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a look at this movie of the show and I like your 20-year old iteration, I would recommend the Mupp pet show.
