All right, if you are sick in bed or do not do anything else then it is worth seeing. In order to get this movie the suspension suspension is important. First of all, in today's modern society, do you think the college kods are committed to anyone in those times, even if you are a "honest" resident volunteer who likes autistic kids? And the romance of 2 weeks was provoked in exchange for a letter, which would make John's "contradiction" to be properly reconnected after 9/11/01? ... actually? What did he ask him? We know that every person did not sit down after falling down the towers (my husband was one of them and I loved him and proud of him for going) the character of John was so flat. He is almost full-blown movie. She is looking good but Spec Ops ... She does not feel uncertain, rather than a hellfire, no tattoo, a pushing match that gets into a "fight" with an prepping boys is really something more ... walking around her head almost full movie Without a cover on around ... and there are military technical errors everywhere (flip the epaulets?). The battle scenes are stupid ... John and other people are rushing towards them ... huh ?, then the other guy gets the shot and John gives him 10 feet and before the security of the area or back up, Behind them ... It's a gunfight for God, you do not stop fighting till his end ... Hack I wanted to kill John. After returning home, when the truth is revealed and he drinks ... we hate him to remove his shirt in his presence ... WTH? Break his heart and then tease him into adultery? He trollop a head suit. The best part of the movie when he moved away from him ... at least he had some respect and respect. Overall incredible stories and we usually do not care about these characters or their love. Dark!
