If you want to waste a whole time, because you are thinking of pulling a lint from your stomach button or clearing wax from your ear or gourging your tile, you can not miss it at your carnival. <<br /> <br /> One thing, forget VHS cover. No body of this film seems attractive (ie, Indian girl). Someone has commented that anyone who picks for cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes in the film, no, for 40 seconds I knew I was stopped. <br /> <br /> I ended up seeing it because 1) I paid 99 cents and 2) Perhaps probably, there were probably some durable scenes worth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know you had a difficult role to do this, but it is your bottom.
