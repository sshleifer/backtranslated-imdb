Oh god Why did Niceloxon have made such a difficult time, with half the movie being made? I mean, this movie was good, but it was: <br /> <br /> Very small b. Rather simple, stereotypical, and some C abusive. <br /> <br /> <br /> The first thing, "soft appearance soft appearance" things were very consumeristic, very sponsored, very vain, and very insulting. Her stereotyptic nerd-stupid face, glasses, no kiss, her mother's holiday, etc. Perhaps the guy did not kiss a girl because he is gay! Does that mean that all gay nerds are? And what's wrong with your mother? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chess loves him, and Bla Bla Baha, and then, when Chess finally Decide to tell him, <br /> <br /> He did not speak to him personally because he was going about general deviation, he came along. He tried to send the message, but his PDA fell into a fountain and died before getting the message. <br /> <br /> end. <br /> <br /> How hello ??? Formula I mean, why the cartoonist can not change anything in the series? Many of us would like to see these two together. Why can not we see it? I mean, the producers are not really aware of the new problem with the change in Syria? So they have to stick with the same plot and outline, and they just have to do as many episodes as using? After a while, it becomes dull and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see some real romance here, Darna! <br /> <br /> OK. I was done with my rant.
