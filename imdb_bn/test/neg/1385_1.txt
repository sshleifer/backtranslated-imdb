OK, I can not see Comedy Central again because I can not see the repetitive advertisements of this event. I'll tell you the truth, this is not a terrible show because I'm bored by it, but because Carlos Menezia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I do not impress a George Bush on top of the carrot rather than watch this skill hack. And to believe he says himself the greatest. Even if he did not steal the joke, he is still bad at telling them, he is off-timing and original. He remembered one interesting, "Why do white people go to camping, where do they blame the poor for a week?" What do you mean now? Are all white people rich? Another I did not understand when he did the price wight, and he told some fat people, "How much is the price of the refrigerator, you're fat" and his face was the worst appearance of a fatty person. . But what does that mean? Is that "fat man" always looking for the fridge? I saw her commercial ad, both of whom know how her show is .. <br /> <br /> This event is preferred by Epic Movie and Movie.
