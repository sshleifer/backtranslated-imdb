Keep sound simple or rather a word, best suited by !!!!!! The film begins to attract some interest by plot, but the spectators can rest for a few minutes of rest and drink intoxication, the darkness can breathe out fresh air outside. <br /> <br /> It looks like watching a movie in the 1960's, where the colors were soft, operated by a guardian, and managed by high school students! The movie plays an extraordinary Indian film and tries to return to the film and travels with an American high profile actress. Her performance is praised by delivering truly bad conversations. <br /> <br /> Overall: I would not recommend anyone to visit this movie yet still want to watch the watch: then try to watch it at home, when some TV channel airs it, this movie is not a single advertisement and no sponsor Is. <br /> <br /> And aperin carries well, if you do not get remote control to change the channel then you may need it! Note that I have no source, did other critics see the movie? I lost my 10 dollars on the ticket!
