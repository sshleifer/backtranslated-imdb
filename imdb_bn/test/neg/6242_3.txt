Now I know why this movie can be bought in the video stores to buy so cheap. I was astonished because his three big stars were in the movie 'B', which apparently could not give the video! The answer is, this is a film that will attract a very limited audience: more than 50 crowds with very generous sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Anybody who sees Robert Redford, Willam Dofo and Helen Mirren, basically, is a basic message that "your spouse is just cheating as long as you still love him." Here are the excellent "sentimental messages" here, especially at the end of this strange abduction story. Who wrote this article ... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is one of the best abductors (DFO) without the end. He frequently makes his hostage (Redford) frequently, which will not be a risk of kidnappers, casual conversations on family matters, etc. It's all ridiculous! Well, LA Times said it was "an intelligent thriller." Haha Well, it ensures that most people know about LA Times. For those of you who believe and do not see it, I will not loot this story, especially with a huge hole in the end. Indeed, it insulted someone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> However, you can not always fool people, because critics still understand it. Here's another movie that they bomb in the box office and video stores.
