Amanda Bains is a very talented actress, and I've really enjoyed her role in the past, especially nicely "She Man." Because of that alone, "Sydney White" was a big disappointment for me. The real reason for this film dislike is the poor use of characters. A good fun teen comedy, it's fairly accurate to have a cast of fairly fact-oriented teen characters. The idea "Sydney White," has gone out of the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Binness has made Sydney like this, but she really lacks something that creates her shock as an actress. I blame it in the script, which makes her character very shaky and restrained and in the hair / makeup section, which gives her a detrimental plastic look and a boring hairstyle. The seven "dorks" that Sydney is finally friendly are so bad. They are so tailor-made that their choice is made or respectable as their character. They are basically repulsive cold seedlings. Such is the story "Prince Skimming", which is completely unbelievable as a character and it can be about Chess. <br /> <br /> Probably being the biggest star of the film (Possible Exposance of Aman Bans), Paxton, who truly congratulations, is very good as Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame that the scripts of the authors are more gray than the black <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Imagine a re-imagination. Links to "Snow White" have spread so much to us that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. Prince Tumming Unknowingly charming, "Witch" is very shamefully wicked, the seven "Dark" is very dorky, and Sydney is very pure in the heart. Now, these movies do not say bad. Although Bains is forced by the script, he still has his moments. Such as Sarah Paxton, brings her the greatest physical comedy in the scene. Sydney's room-mate, too funny as a character called "Dinkey". It is a part of the funny movie which is very chic and ultimately clipped to recommend.
