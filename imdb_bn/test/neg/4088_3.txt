Although I'm not too much of a religious person, I was expecting a relatively high quality compared to this movie, because it was amazingly amazing Steve Carroll and its prediction, Bruce Total, was really a creative and clever, Christian-themed comedy. However, Ivan Almighty does not come close to the core of this fundamentality and immediacy and can not determine whether it is a sensitive film about a comedy or belief and family values. If it chooses a clear path to focus on a theme, it may depend on its feasibility, but instead the result of two mixes is a film that features coolers, cool and dry ideas of delicious dialogue. The tricks of trying to give the moviefront, rather the viewers' intelligence is abusive, and the film is very confusing and cloudy presentation of the unpublished message. Ivan Almighty was very badly written, it was very clear, there are numerous plot holes and elements of the film that do not make absolutely any sense. For example, although the vast amount of extraterrestrial animals from all over the world had thrown Ivan, he built ships for their salvation from the flood, but their inclusion was really necessary when only "floods" in the movie were found in the city's downtown Washington DC. And there is no risk of a suburban neighborhood, which means they wipe out? Movie makers believe that the story of the Bible is lacking in the originality of modernization, and instead it has happened in the present time without any change in the platform, which has kept many elements that it does not add to and it makes clear that stupid motifs and writing in the movie. After all, it is unfortunate that Steve Carroll and Wanda Cheques's performance genius is not shown due to their described blood characters, and it was so bad that it screwed and cluttered many of the movie's tried themes and created it a ridiculous first movie. Finally, the Ivan Almighty is insulted by the brilliant actor and half the intelligent moviegoer, both of them have sadly failed.
