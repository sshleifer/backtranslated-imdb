I want to know the real name of the lodge where the scenes of the film were illustrated. It is really nice and the attention of the architecture of 20 and 30 like the Hotel del Coronado. I know it was in Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it still exists. For the film, it's really amazing that Zen Wyman was nominated for the Academy Award. It should be a time when he loved academy colleagues. It was really interesting to get the true impression of Wyman and other actors in the script related film. The script of this movie, recently with a message like a Kevin Costar movie, is so incredible that it limits the credibility of the actors that can bring their portions. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, mostly on seeing his appearance and subsequent role in his career (Precious Madness Exception). But Wyeman must be forced to take the film through the requirements of the contract or the studio system.
