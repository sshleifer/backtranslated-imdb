The radio is probably one of the best movies, while at the same time I see the worst. It told me to cry where you wanted to cry me, and you cringe me at the supposed moment of laughing. It lacks the characteristic of any kind that is very important for a sensitive image. Some questions, why the character of Ed Harris took the radio under his wing, it was not properly interpreted and I am sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of film), if ever it is seen, is most vain. <br /> <br /> Somebody is going to continue the work of Gooding Junior, he is a great actor and should be taunted too much until he is working on a more line. <br /> <br /> To go as a true story, it's not interesting. P. The reason I said this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, because it's a full pap I've enjoyed it. Smiling on the script, and most of the monoglows are really stupid or someone else is very clever, trying to show how the straightforward film can be expressed as a freedom fighter, which is why everyone becomes a favorite joke. The matter is, the character of Cuban is comedy sheets to watch football matches.
