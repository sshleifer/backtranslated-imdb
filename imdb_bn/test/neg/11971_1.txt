I can not believe that I cut the rubbish into myself! Acting was so poor, my grandmother could do a good job. The pots thrown in the film were not near the character of docking in the Cherekro floor. The movie became a joke to watch! <br /> <br /> This group of baseball jokes decides to laugh, even after being not considered a coach under the results as a coach. So, naturally, they go anyway. They decided to have a damaged tie in a post with so-called "Scarecrow". When the best friend of the victim found out about this, he and his girlfriend went to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The child has found diabetes and is admitted to the hospital, while Jokes goes to the beach. Day. They found them inside and killed them pretty well. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure, you really do not care. However, Scarecrow ended up connecting with "Diabetes Boy" and after the death of Skakro, the boy started to do terrible things. Yes, it really is really Chess. <br /> <br /> It seems that these movies were full * Sooner or later, living (naturally) lover and girlfriend are the main characters :) Then the evil boyfriend is transferred and he breaks his curse so that nobody else gets hurt. Okay okay No, do not waste your hard working money, I give it a score of one to one, otherwise it is not worth it.
