As much as I like the train, I could not beat this movie. Unless a trainer and "drive" movement from Arkansas to Chicago do not hit the train, the impossible plot line should be properly in the hit board. Imagine two dissatisfied NASA staffers stolen the "crawler" and imagining and imagined it to run and imagine New York. <br /> <br /> It's all good to say. Wilford Bermelli is the best of his ear, and Levan Helm has a good performance as his embarrassed but well known sidekick. Bob Balaban got appropriately surprised as a corporate singer, and the "little guy takes on Goliath" gets another wind of the story.
