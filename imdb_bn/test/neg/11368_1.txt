This was the worst tv movie I ever seen. Visuals were so dangerous it made me enlighten. I continually zoom in and zoom out, and frequent black and white color switches. I thought that the story did not make much sense, and it was another closed action movie, a hero was a bad guy, and a few hostages. Why could I take good pictures with my camera? I can keep it fixed, the director can not do anything. Did I really see all the worst, did you dislike Disney? I was not even bothered to see the whole thing because I was sure that I could guess the results, and the visuals I saw were the worst.
