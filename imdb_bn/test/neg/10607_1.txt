Pure shit, decent cinematography ... I like some colors. Since another, one of the worst movies I've ever seen is the one. Annoying, lifeless, once I am interested in any of the characters myself. I wait for a real plot form and take to take movie motion. Nothing happened! I think they spent a lot of time on hair and clothing that they forgot that a movie was being created at that time.
