Oh, there are many bad Wayne movies. This movie has been badly edited but it's a campie material that makes it enjoyable. Villain is an Anglo-Marathi actor who plays laughable Mexican clothes and influences the Mexican accent that has become sunny. The girl is dressed like Jean-Harley Wangbei, after all these 1934. At least location shots are beautiful and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> See it and smile. Not expecting a serious western, rather poor performance, but I do not hope to have light and patronized stories about Shibir humor occasionally. Wayne is almost humorous young and handsome and can see the years of blossomed his acting ability after this congratulatory venture.
