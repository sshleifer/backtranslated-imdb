Yes, it's me again! Sir, 'I'm sitting by shit, so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> What do you think about this? Perhaps it could be a woman who calls a sexual line and arranges to meet graduates in an isolated area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend slits their throat with the razor and, before closing together with her cash? Wow, guess what! And if I tell you that the police over this case is forced to join a sexy assistant DA for the help of this sexy, then what will you conclude? Do you think the sexy DAT will try to meet the queen of the drug to wear a red-red underwear, but eventually she will be kidnapped and the magistrates will be rescued? (Already his gun and badge has been transferred) Jing! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Actually, this picture bothered me tears. Why emphasis on making such garbage? It is our time, a waste of their time and yet they bear regardless. Filing a movie does not give anyone an iota. If this is a rental feature, it's a really pretty woman who I've seen in a motion picture for a while. I hope they earn a lot on Botox and colonial irrigation. They like to look great on the cover of the cover or perched at the top of a car of Bikini Bikini. They just have to leave the acting of professionals (like Shannon Tieid). <br /> <br /> While talking about the future career, I ran the director another day. She sure does not whack up a delicious chicken burger food. I would say very, that the uniform really suited him. I asked him about the 'party line', and before going to his eyes he wasted some extra fries before breaking it. Oh well, guess it does not work quite well. Do not mind, they are taking him by the day tomorrow! From Hurray !! 1/10
