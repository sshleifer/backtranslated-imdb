For a good take on the Roman Empire, see the fantastic BBC-produced miniseries "I, Claudius". This just sucked. The act was unfortunate and you can often watch actors watching the camera. Hans Matson was annoying. The cheese factor was so high that it promoted constipation with a repeat display. Even the kaligula was like that. I think the film is silently supported by the "religious" group, who will remain anonymous;). If there was any indication of additional Christian prejudice and oppression, it was unclear. Stay away from what you do - running time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than I saw this trip. <br /> <br /> Italy has done well - not let the hans cute face fool you. He's not a great actor ... He's a great bore.
