European films may be driven slowly and lesser than American films, but it takes it far away. It shows a whole bunch of incomplete letters written incomplete. It's not fantasy, it's not even weird, it's just painful and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? Do the people of France not give up? Do they show sex to other people? Do they unknowingly strangely touch their neck? Do not wear a watch while watching this picture, because you have explained a little or have learned a large part of time. <br /> <br /> This is a story of "Police Superintendent" which is deeply disturbed. Although by the cruel assassination of a small girl, she actually seems annoyed before. He is not only disturbed by his personal tragedies, but apparently mentally, slowly, a six-year-old child is behaving like a learning disability. He sees a lot of things, walks with rigid arms like little kids, speaks humble, sympiring, tones, behaves very unknowingly at all his interaction (although no one thinks he or she does not care, even the police seem to be doing business )). She is a troubled police, not an exotic ones. Latky character on the taxi Andy Kaufman taxi, but without humor. She is not credible as an adult, not only as trustworthy as a policeman. For this interpretation of his character, he has won a prize, it's really amazing - as long as he plays the part in writing and the error lies with the weirdists who write this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see things remotely by police if a little girl is killed. This is not important, even though the uncertainty of their behavior is insulting. The problem is that the rest of the picture does not give any idea. Which give long-lasting close-up of the field, vegetable gardens, and human face etc. Eventually I was hit as a particularly humorous - completely unsupported by the events organized by it - unless you think, "What's the worst way to end this movie? <br /> <br /> there are many sex and nudity, Do you think vaginas? Do not worry, it's art. It has a deep meaning, I'm not sure. And despite its innocent curiosity, the heroic It seems like some kind of homeopathic neck or joke fetish. <br /> <br /> Finally, subtitles are white and often appear in white background - many are difficult to read. On the other hand, there are not many dialogs, so this is a big problem No. There is very little sound - even if you do not expect to hear the surrounding words - the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience, the old Woody Allen's work <br /> <br /> It's a rewarding film that is sad, I hate to see the lost movie. Enjoy <br /> <br />.
