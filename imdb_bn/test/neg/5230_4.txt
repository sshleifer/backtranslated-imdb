Star rating: ***** works **** just misses the mark *** little bit of it ** behind the head * Piss <br /> <br /> Based on one of Stephen King's long novels, New York In the town Castle Rock (also called the production company of the film!), This is a new antique shop, the famous essentials are opened. Owner and owner, Leland Gant (Max von Sedo) is hiding, you can say, a devil secret. Everyone in the small town has an item in his store that wants a higher price than the first at the beginning of the cash price. As a suspect, hatred and insanity distinguishes the city, it comes back to the police chief, Allan Panggour (Ed Harris) and protects the city from the horrific end. <br /> <br /> I read the necessary novel at the beginning of this year, and was interested in watching the movie adaptation to compare them (like any competition is going to happen!) but it has been deleted in the video and DVD and I am from it Could not rent a place. So I was surprised when I finally found it on a chip market in a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> This is a brutal iron story that is best for reading King's novels, but when they are adapted to the screen The nine screens are complete junk nine times, as it is here. By any means the book that makes its books great, does not translate into the movie script. And I think there is always a question: Why am I bored to read this book again? <br /> <br /> I am satisfied that some very long (ie, stand) will be done on the entire screen so that all the circumstances and characters are included, so there can be no reason for all the elements from the book. As a result, many main characters of the book (i.e. S. Merrill) are not included and we have some terrible character development, which means we are not concerned about characters that are involved in deepening and motivation - for example, there is a character in our book, Danforth Keaton, Who finally killed his wife, but hinted at us for any reason Did not hate him or hate him. When it happens, there is no effect, unlike the book where many depths have been invested and it involves you to discover what happened to the characters involved. If all the elements of the script want to fill the fixes, they are really stupid and arbitrary, and generally pagan elements that are included in King adaptations. <br /> <br /> Most movie problems are that it is far from devital to books but from a cast some terrible performances which obviously they can not feel for the sturdy elements being performed to make. In the 90's, many actors left the movie and made only for TV-video / video. The garbage like this must surely indicate why. **
