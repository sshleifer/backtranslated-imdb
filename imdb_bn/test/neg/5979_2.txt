About 5 minutes in the movie, you have entered these ruthlessly hit cats and mouse romances between these two great characters and worse than that. The biggest problem is the characters and how they are completely incredible. The 50-year-old producer and out-of-the-face Hollywood script writers believe that Stoner's life is good, as they have made some pots on friends' cast. Bland, dull, annoying and totally unrealistic I despise this movie.
