Now I'm suffering from parts, The Clones Horror. <br /> <br /> The horror in this movie's title is the insult of true fear. <br /> <br /> The story was about cloning-centric clones owned by "The Man", they are clones that increase the clones from clones to replacing them with real people. A clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but how the story is leaked out. <br /> <br /> How could potentially destroy such a movie by amateur people like Phivon? The concept of human rights and philosophical perspectives, which can make human beings human and it is OK to increase clones for biological crops? Sadly, the middle actor has been elected and this plot has left the city, until it can create a compassionate effort. <br /> <br /> But !! My most worried concern was the introduction of new characters to the lack of actual relevance for the plot. Nevertheless, Fivison thinks the need to kill them in a bad explosion that only Sir Colman Francis will be proud of himself. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. How Fisson felt that drinking water on plastic sheets and drinking water on them could be a river for me, but I think if you compare the setting for gray pastry otmeal in Colman Francis than setting, this film will win. </ br> <br /> Perhaps penman changed the bad movie for me. 3/10
