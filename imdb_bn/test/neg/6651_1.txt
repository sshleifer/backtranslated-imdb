This movie is stupid. Absolutely terrible Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia must work in this movie. The plot is not completely credible! Michael Keaton agreed to donate a detective's death to the son's bone marrow, but then escapes. He led police to neutralize the entire hospital - not believable that he would get so much knowledge of the hospital. He chose the extreme way to blow up the electricity generator and a pedicrial bridge (why?) To get out of the hospital. And Andy Garcia (dead boy's father) topped up and a doctor helped the criminal get a bone marrow. The plot is not so much! Probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
