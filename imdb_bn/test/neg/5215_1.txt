My friends and I always look for Chocolate Norris films are always bash and fun. Our favorite one is still Lonolief. I went to a Wal-Mart Christmas shopping and I came across this movie at 5.99 Bin. I had to get it. I had high hopes for this movie and, though sometimes quite smile, we agreed that we have ever seen the bell of innocence, created, produced, worried, etc. ... who thinks this is a good idea. It's not just confusing at times, but it's very hard to see the acting. The person playing the orchestra has played, I can compare myself to a vmeter, and Chuck took such a dive, he was not the greatest actor, but it was terrible. And what kind of name Ore, Conrad and Jackson ... .Jox. Come on people. If you honestly believed that this movie was always visible, it was difficult for you because it was difficult for me and after seeing it I got severe headache and stomach ache. I'm saying now if you do not see this movie, no !! Do not engage yourself in this awesome 90 minutes of life for God's love.
