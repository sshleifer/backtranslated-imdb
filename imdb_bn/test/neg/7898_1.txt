Hmph. Soul Plane A "Black Comedy" is a well-known movie, supposed to be the spoof of the airplane. This movie, the black comedy done at the worst of it. Stereotypes can be fun, and they can be many times. But in this film, it's annoying. All right, you have clubs, sex, medicines, which today are all cruis related to "urban" culture. <br /> <br /> Tom Arnold's presence in this movie, if it is ever there, is the saving grace of this movie. DL Hoogle does not have to accept the script. Kevin Hart makes a poor leading figure here ... his appearance in this movie would probably be very annoying. Method man and snoop look was far, their worst. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I could not see this movie ...
