Sometimes there are patients when you are watching Indie Horn. If you can top-tap your path only through slower primary scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself ... it was (unfortunately) not with "the whip of Satan". <br /> <br /> and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan Whip" tries to drag us with a boring graduate-film of a movie, which ultimately has no real wages. I suppose that black and white (and blue) cinematography can be a cause, but it can not be interpreted as to why the majority of blood is not blue, and as the film progresses, it seems increasingly annoying. The story itself was not bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting was only merciful. It slowly and slowly, with a lack of real (red) beef, creates a "whip of the devil", which quickly forgot. I'll give it a "4" rating for some malicious conversations that circulate to me, but my time can not save this annoying waste.
