"Sessions on the Bring" is one of my favorite books all the time - the unexpected look of Bob Knight and her Indiana Hussiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporter actors all the time. So I made a point of watching this adaptation. <br /> <br /> It's frustrating at each level. Denhei's performance was less than inspiration, and she was not ready to play in the drama - just as she took the role just before filming. The rest of the cast is not good. <br /> <br /> And it is clear that it was ESPN's first movie. It was badly directed, misrepresented, and a lack of budgets at any time the games were simulated (small gyms, empty seats, etc.), skip this adaptation and read the book - it's good even today!
