If someone came back to the dawn of talk, then bright future for Harold Lloyd would be predicted. Unlike his opponents, he was a legitimate actor, trained at a legal level until he was raised in Music Hall or Bowdville Circuit parajouri. She is a good voice which matched her image. Furthermore, since 1924, his "silent" film included sequences based on the lost goggles of viewers (e.g., Framman's fall rolling bell sequence and Kid Brother's monkey sequence). Lloyd's sound features have failed in the box office even after the advent of Volkomi Danger's novelty. Lloyd blames his fall from many external sources, but never realized that the enemy word for the glass character was not great depression. Pre-depressed viewers, giddy with optimistic, they may have rooted for this aspiring go-getter who saw their surrogate; Sadness obscures him as the prospect of foreclose him on his mortgage and throwing them in guitars. Consolidating the character's preference problem is Lloyd's perception as a wonderful happy hander. Undoubtedly sincerity is a thematic assessment, but Lloyd can not play a treacherous and neutral game despite his own tragedy. Perhaps that is why he was afraid to return to that country permanently. The CATS-PAW failed because of this, but due to the release of Lloyd's supporter-fascist agenda it is suffering alone. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was encouraged to make this film because he saw the FDR's president looking as wealthy and soft as a dictatorial criminal. We should remember that these feelings were not alone. This day and age of Dimil, a pre-police state drama, was directed in the previous year. We should remember that the United States was founded by the Hitahd tax protesters and is going to be inspired by those who want something without funding for it. TCP sufferers because it treated Fascist "comedy" lightly, and its release was especially dangerous, as Germany's events were given that year. The production code of 1934 will reduce the glory of the final trial and revisit the rule of constitutional law; The ideal of a well-established uninterrupted ideology, the leader of the omnipotent leader who releases this omnipotent check and balance once brings an ostrich, it is the date of antiquity of ancient times. For this reason, unanimous regimes act as a safety valve, although the fear of laughter Wickedly, TCP's existence is simply a film that proves its origins in the democratic experience of the country, that the FDR's America was safe enough to criticize. Hitler does not face any parallel criticism of Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But the smile of fascism hanging laughing laughing? Lloyd's extraordinary movie ran out on the right and of course he himself felt humorous, if Dr. GaÃ«bel himself wrote. It is an alternate history that restores the honor by restoring the order of a selected person and by no means necessary, and does so well with nature and fun. The left-handed fascism improves, of course, Chaplin's Great Dictator. This next film is based on the advantage of setting in another country and on a thinly covered real personality and events. The Great Dictator makes some smiles today, because it estimates the prediction of human evil, but it succeeds despite its uneducated and inappropriate lectures, because it has the distinct advantage of being proven by history. However, Lloyd should be credited for two things: First of all, he did not make any other fascist film or later after the war, he did not produce a hypochlorical pro-allied film: Second, he did not sell TCP on television. The country after 1945 saw the face of fascism and it was not funny.
