It is without doubt that I have seen the greatest signal, and I have seen a lot of it to make that conclusion. The plot is easy ridiculous. I can catch a ball and run around a field. Why can not I play Superbowl? Yes I know this movie was made for children, but there are some plots that children can understand completely foolish and unreal. The first air-boot movie was quite good, but it was a complete crash. Disney is loosing it. If I win the Razzie prize, then I'll give it a couple. Happy your day =)
