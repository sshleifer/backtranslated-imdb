Surely you are not usually polizia, but Raden did not work for me. The film considers the story of a jewelery abusive, and kidnaps a young man unknowingly of the process. While trying to flee, the robbers left a bloody death in their ransom because they planned to release the boy. This plan is never stopped because the robbers are more interested than going to France and the boy has wanted to stay with them. Although I could quote a number of problems with the movie, but I'll focus the most obvious ?? The character played by Tele Savalas Memphis. His most memorable role as a Croak boss, in other Italian films from the works of Derby Dosene and Kelly's heroes, was a victory for Savalas. I've always considered him as a Ãœuber-cool customer. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unwanted redness. Director directed the camera and directed him to work as a psychologist as possible? His work was not very bad about the plan I had planned, but it seems strange because he is acting weird. It seems like random lunacy. And what's that with the pronunciation? Savalas could have done a lot, but none of them were Southern. She even sounds completely ridiculous to try to pronounce even Outside, I have not seen interest in the rest of the movie. As I instructed, this plot never attracted me. I was not worried about what was going on. And the crime that the boy is attracted to so much from criminal life is not true. As with other actors, Mark Lester Savalas is not as much good as almost as bad and usually reliable Franko Nero. Three "names" actors and do not have a good performance among them. To make matters even worse, I believe the director has shown many pictures of the night scene and there is nothing more than shaking the shots from his watch. I can not tell what might happen. Character I hate, is a plot that I'm not worried, and a production value which fails ?? Little wonder I've given Redneck a 3/10.
