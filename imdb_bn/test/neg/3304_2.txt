I have no idea who these others but this movie is so awful easy. When he is a minor character they must propp up Joe Pesci. Adams Sandler and Jim Carey, etc. Like studio bits and switch movies like statuses etc. The DVD I found is that "this vague gem is around the MOB character of Joyce, a hothead that starts a fight" etc. Joe Joe Joe's, he does not even carry a gun, gets a whimpy character drama and spinner - (paved). So much for the rolling movie around Pesci. Only a half-memorable scene was a bad attempt at Comedian when passing the gas during the waiting time of the score. If you watch this movie after reading, I've warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
