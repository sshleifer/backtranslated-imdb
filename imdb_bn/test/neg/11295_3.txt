I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I read all his novels at least 5 times and I really love Hanibal's books. So the movie was my biggest disappointment and I did not really see why some people here gave it nine or even ten. Their needs are very low, or they did not read the book or both. Even if I did not read the book, I would still consider the movie as an absolute average and I'm a five The strange, mysterious environment of the novel does not appear in singles time, when I first saw it in the movie, I was still asleep. Why was a very important aspect of Margot Vajjar removed completely? Why is Barney earning money as the only ambition to be shown as a stupid sensation? And most, why did the process of brain sterling end, applied to drugs due to lecture? It can not be said that the termination has been omitted and completely changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster referrals to playing again were well known and I acknowledged it, though I have been frustrated as many because I have identified Starling with him. It is very important to identify with the Red Dragon, the Lamb's silence or the mental depth of such a mental depth, while being adapted for the screen, but the Germans say it is "snow of yesterday". Ridley Scott has done some incredibly good movies but with this one he will not live for his name. Jonathan Dame had a right feeling for his relationship with the plot, character and neighbors, the lamb should have been silent, he should have been hurt. My only comfort I have seen the movie two times, it is a long time ago and thanks to God, when I read a novel, I could not see the movie scene. I'm sorry but I can not really recommend it to anyone.
