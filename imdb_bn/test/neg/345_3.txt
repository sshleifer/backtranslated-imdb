I think it's safe if you see only standard box office or a premium product, but you will not be disturbed because you hate it. Do not bother if you are not an overly critical film buff. If you like science fiction films and you do not have any observation about any future, then you will be gently entertained. It is very clear that for this budget was super super, but the stomach behind what they had done with the money. The incidents of burning fire were bad and deportation scenes were terrible, but it is quite clear that they got some good support from computer perspective because planetary scenes and alien images were quite innovative. The dialogue is not exactly festive but completely poorly played. Good for the story, I'm not sure what actually happened to tell me genuinely.
