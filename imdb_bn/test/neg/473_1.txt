Let's find one thing. I have big Bruce Campbell Fan, have my Evil Dead series, have a number of jobs, and Buba Ho-Tape. I appreciate a fan of cheesy, ridiculous horror flicks and know how complete "it's bad it's good" deal <br /> <br /> I want to say the same thing as this movie. I have seen this movie with high expectations, I want to be good, we know and love something from Campi, BC. It was quite committed, but after the first 20 minutes I lived to see the rest of the movie a sad excuse so that I was shot with tranquilizer darts. <br /> <br /> This idea is not bad; Two men, together with the same brain, are not killed by a woman, half of a person's brain is replaced in another's head, they disagree, disagree and comedy ensues. <br /> <br /> How did you kill me, how uncompromising and annoying it was! It was probably even better than even the campfix. The plot was boring, even Bruce's zany physical slap stick could not work it. <br /> <br /> Bose's wife could not correctly express the ridiculous robot in the brain's brain. I've never seen the worst looking robot anywhere (even for a B movie). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What was going through the mind of Bruce when I made this vapor wave was outside of me. Why did Ted Raimi not try to run to his elder brother, so that he could impose some ideas on Bruce and did not mention anything about making a concerted film in the budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> !!!
