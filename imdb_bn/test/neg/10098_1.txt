2001 was probably not the best year Eric Roberts. Both Raptor and this came out. Just watched the rapper a while ago and really thought that it was sucked and being the worst Erics. But it has shared fun and d-quality moments. This is not the one thing to do. <br /> <br /> The name of Tommy Lee Thomas probably the worst actor this day. The story is no less of a punch and the whole thing is more frequent than a snooze break. <br /> <br /> Martyn Cove and Eric Roberts are standing two. You can argue for better or better than their efforts, but they are all over criticism than all others. <br /> <br /> I tell you Roberts thank you next time (and hopefully a good one) Thanks.
