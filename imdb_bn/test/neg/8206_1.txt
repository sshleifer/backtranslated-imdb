If I can give a negative star, I want this stingerbar. <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes. I see a good movie. I'm big fan like Octomán, Wizard of Mars, Queen King and others. The actual classics of B-movie <br /> <br /> But this film actually sees Jack Nicholson and Boris Karl as the Academy Award winner! Dialogues are so inefficiently long-winded, and mostly used in most cases. (That is, "I will do your will condensed (Yes, Condense !!). Actually, it is much better to have a lot of logical lines. <br /> <br /> What is the story? Is his wife counted for leprosy? Is not that sure of the counting? A ship on a (wealthy?) Island is causing an accident? People are acting abnormally? Okay, I have a lot of things in the camp, there are lots of charm, but it was shu It was a fool, but was a fool who is a Blue Sea Captain who is speaking as a professor of the college? There was no idea of ​​how a person who did not come from a boatman could play it, a scene he played in Spanish, next English / European)? Not sure if the person who is a resurrection or indeed a dad. 4 Beer is my wife, my friend and I still could not find it. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible factor ... I can show this Turkish to my younger grandchildren and only think about sleeping through them. I love 60's horror movies, and some are still good shocks, but this thing ... was never a shock, There was even an indication of a fear. Returning to the data, <br /> <br /> "This movie has scenes that are so vivid and abusive that they will overcome your worst nightmare." This film is only reducing. It's 90 minutes (The case says it's 74 minutes.) You will not get back in your life. <br /> <br /> I have paid just one profit for this and no other film, yes one rupee. I still feel like I do. Even for sitting in 50 cents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
