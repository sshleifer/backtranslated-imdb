I did not review the IMDB before but this documentary has disappeared so much that I feel compelled to feel I did not even see if I was not a guest in someone's house. The film was poor at many levels: First - Tredwell's video footage was added. As much as I saw, he started acting as a personality, rather than trying to be famous instead of acting. <br /> <br /> - Others in the movie, without the parents of Trentwell, the airline pilot, as he was, rich and authentic as he was. God, they seemed artificially <br /> <br /> - Beard's protection mission, even by being accustomed to the presence of heroes, has done more harm than good, even with the aim of protecting the heroes. I believe that Tredwell really loves beer, but there are many studies that mislead his efforts. Sometimes we have to enjoy wildlife to help us. <br /> <br /> The entertainment price of the movie is not half of other wildlife films like "March of the Penguins" In my opinion, filmmakers have done a bad job of growing scenes and gave little enthusiasm to watch. <br /> <br /> As a person who loves Alaska, beer and other wildlife, I want to see more people dedicated to preserving our wildlands. I hope their efforts will be the center of low people.
