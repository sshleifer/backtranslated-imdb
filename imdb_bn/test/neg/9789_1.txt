This is probably the worst movie I ever seen. I would think you could get from the title. Also, there is a special love scene that can be weird in the history of the film. I can not remember why I saw this image or never. That's just an absolutely awesome movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you want to waste your strange strange movie for two hours of your time, rent it all the way. Good luck though finding it at your local store. I suspect this movie is a very wide-delivery. And do not show it to children in any way because it can awaken their feelings forever.
