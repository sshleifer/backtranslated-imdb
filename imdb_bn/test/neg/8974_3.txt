After spending some lazy time before working, I saw my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" DVD collection and opted for the most obscure title of the pack: Jeis Bom Wah has played a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is obviously operative, since I have never heard the titles and I doubt they are in the public domain. However, this film is his son Peter Lynd and his wife Mary Hilie (who I have found out that I live in Louisiana, a resident of New Orleans) also owns a malchery shop and took a break as Hunts Hall, as Peter's friend from East Side Kids. The plot is trying to turn his rich unwilling boy into a responsible person about a plot of land, and he does not know much about it, for the birds, and most of the scenes, although I love Peter's celebrity and his dance with the hall at a slow pace. And the songs and dance are entertaining among themselves. But Rubin is always involved with her confusion about the American language of all times and almost everything about him gives no idea (though I like her fun dance). Since this is just 61 minutes, I am sure that I played in half of the double feature bill, I could be charity and I would give a 3 for some of the entertainment bits that I enjoyed.
