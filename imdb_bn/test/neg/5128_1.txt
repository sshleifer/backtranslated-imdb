When I came out of this movie, I was a sophomore in college and I have never seen it till yesterday. I finally decided to watch it because I liked the good dance and the film was such a cultural influence. After watching the film, I have become completely busy with how it can affect other people about sleeping. <br /> <br /> The story is quite annoying when you think about it. Has anyone really bought the idea that beer beer junior steel workers and teamists can jointly share their clients with high conception that girls are doing? All of them came quickly to Zanjeer than to say "performance art". Can you imagine the real life version of viewers that the seamless TV saw the things of any theater dance? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I did not buy for a second that the girl worked in the steel yard. And I did not buy for a second that I was looking for a real steel yard. Steel work is dangerous. You do not see your work area as a junk yard and do not end up losing one limb. I love having something like lying on the welding of two cast welding tubes while sitting. What are they doing there? Or when he cut six inch inches of a hole in the hole with a cutting torch. He was clearly a board and only started to cut random things. <br /> <br /> If the film is not fun, then the story of the least enthusiastic story can be ignored. FlashDance does not offer anything to balance it, <br /> <br /> <br /> Dance is awesome. It's a touchstick twitch-and-pose style that destroyed American music ... well, is it still on top of it? The film tries to get lost by the complete lack of personality of Jennifer Bell. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old man and when he wants to eat a lottery, my only reaction was to get him a lobster bb. <br /> <br /> You can not really go to Alex and his dreams because his character is so stupid and shallow. The dog is going more than that. <br /> <br /> Love matter is flat. It comes as nothing more than a boss with its staff a hottie. Zero Emotions <br /> <br /> Even the final scene where he dances for Oriilla Randenbach and is stuck with some other stiffs because the response to the panel is so incredible. What serious dancer does Alex's lame cheerleader routine roll their eyes? In short the film was nothing but leg-warm and big sweatshirts. Oh, yeah, there is a good part of nudity when Alex is finding his friend "her" being a innocent erotic dancer (a ridiculous bit of hypocrisy). Another movie is a waste of time during that movie. I wish the MST 3 crew was still in business. This will be good sheets for them.
