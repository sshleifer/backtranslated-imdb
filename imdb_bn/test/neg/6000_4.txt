"Thunderbolt", probably the worst movie of Jackie Chan's "The Renter" in 1985. Yes, I know that no one sees her film for her story, but its plot is infringed unequivocally, even by its standards and war dance drama, its scenes (their whole two) are destroyed, as others have mentioned, mad, misleading camerawork By Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans should not bother about this seemingly harmful, stunts and plug-in junk. Anita Yunen's clever and perky performance attributes some of her release. For a good "serious Jackie" movie, I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
