The recession did not look so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I mean, based on the title, I knew it was a sunny, but I do not know how ridiculous it would be. <br /> <br /> I missed some dialog for the first time (if you can call it) because we were very busy with the plot of the film. It seems that it was written in less than a week, and they did not have the budget to go back and fix some minor bugs. Wait, what did I say "small"? I meant the exact opposite. For example, the main character is credited as 'K', but several times throughout the film he is called 'John'. <br /> <br /> If the plot holes are not enough fun for you, check out the acting. Some feel anxious about the zombie attacks in their state, including the mother of the main character, who is sitting in the eruption while reading a book. <br /> <br /> The budget hurdles put the cinema on the same level as the sunny. Perhaps they were not allowed to film wherever they were, because in the big motorcycle chass senses, the characters are following all traffic rules. The dead bodies of 25 or more people stopped at the stop sign coming out of the parking lot. I do not even do that, but then again, I do not have a biker zombie. The end of the movie seems like they just went out of the money. It ends so suddenly that it leaves you more ... Second thought, it ends soon. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a great time with your friends, then search for this movie. This is a great weird comedy.
