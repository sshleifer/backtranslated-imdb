What a stupid movie? It looks beautiful, though it does not make much sense. On one hand, the film knows that Junah's "madness" was that she was a woman than her. On the other hand, her neighbor's daughter has a feeling among the worst Victorian novels, and it seems like a mental headache like Miss Hesham of a fort. If Elizabeth could not overcome the sexual attraction of Aesx, the film was similar to Elizabeth.
