National Lampon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cachato Eddie Island Identificant (2003) Randy Coyd, Maryam Flin, Dana Baron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hei Lee, Eric Idel, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D. Nick Mark. The shameful direct-to-video video of Fluff's overwhelming cousin Eddie and family is near his boss in the South Pacific on his expensive holiday holidays, hoping that a smart lab monkey will not sued his company after being chocked! Idiots can not measure up to spin off of weather films (even European vacation!), Filmmakers think there is a question about whether the script was really fun. Even Quaid, Willard, or Asner can make it watchable remotely 83 minutes, do not rate. *
