Stanley Kubrick, who was the director of the highest speculation for my greatest artist (Clockwork Array, 2001, The Killing, The Shining, Dr. Strenzovov, etc), he took the film out of circulation, it was only found by hardcore. Fans and completists. Seeing the picture for myself, I saw why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already honored his mastery of photography for Luc Magazine and also made some short documentaries. For the first time for decades, she seemed like filmmakers, her ambition for fear and anxiety, short-term, only to make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if she could see it. He was successful at that stage. However, the film itself is not. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that this movie has failed because there was something that I loved all day long. Even the story of the film went on the pathway and the actor (who had no idea that Kubrick was not a man of the theater), got his seeds in this film for his filming and capturing some of his great films. Occasionally, there are some shots of close-up and quick shots in the watch / scene scene. Unfortunately, all I can say is really good film. Although there are some 'names' actors in the film (Frank Sullivara, who was present at Killers Kiss, and Paul Mozaruski, a director on his right), performance is neutral and very routine overall. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is the main death of the movie for me. Whenever I see any kubrick film, even the first film hero Keilers Kiss and The Killing, I can say who made it, then his style became distinct, which he developed as an artist. It was not an 'art' which I could portray (which is usually for the first time such as Scorsese and Spielberg), but seeing this movie just because it was not a kubrick, it felt so much, when I was a director by some B (Or even C) watching the grade movie that I forgot - some 'ed wood' was not bad, but close. Music can be as good as standard, fades pedestrians, and the plot can not really keep an eye on it. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said and I can agree, it is a future groundbreaker's "doodle pad", who sees some shots and some edits that attract some attention (after the soldiers take the hostile girl hostage The best view), but it is not enough to properly recommend except those. Seeing everything from the Quebec itself (or, perhaps, everyone will see low budget war movies), if only curiosity is there.
