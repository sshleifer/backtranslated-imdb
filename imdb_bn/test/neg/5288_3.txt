Shortly after the start of teenage chippers, teen Nicholas (Robert Edmons) Mom died, he is still spending it, but each cloud has a silver lining, and in this case it seems that his mother has a spontaneous declaration of the cabin owned by Tataneka. 'Friendly place for the happy people' that he did not tell her. So Nicholas went to the fun weekend together with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsea Chris) and three friends, Jimmy (Boych Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoet) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy). Unfortunately, the plans are not running accordingly, the cabin runs slightly more than the running shade and their neighbors do. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Chopper was edited and directed by Louis Seanburnen and this picture seems to have a hard time here at IMDB. Strict review, though, I think that Dr. Chappar is quite vain as a horror movie, I do not think that some of the criticisms I am totally justified. According to the IPW cast list, this image has been submitted to Ian Hollt (though she does not like it or not ...) who plays a detective role, although I can not remember a letter of that name, maybe she might start with a police? However, the basic story is okay, though I think it is a tad lazy and lasts for a very long time, it's close to our annoying American teen cast and usually with some sort of bad character running slogans, you know the drill now. Using body parts Dr. In addition to some brief and unorthodox remuneration in relation to the reconstruction of some of its own weak body in the chopper, there are not many stories here, and scripts seem to exist only for the discovery of the situation of girls taking them to the top, there is inevitable sexual scenes, there is a continuation where some girls have a streamlined house initiation topless Must be done and at Here are a few lesabiyanaderao naki, one of whom can be seen in his full dress without praise. Oh, and when I said that they do not wear any top position, they all keep their bra so that you can remember that Dr. Chopper has no real full nudity. So you have it really, this is an average story which eventually ends up with a nice wonderful wrap, which is destroyed, is poor with poorly stupid characters that show only some cheap cattle scenes and girls in bra. To be honest I hope a little more than my films, but again I'm just picking up. <br /> <br /> The director, Shenburn, is really good, this is the worst movie I've seen though it looks still cheap. There is no style here, I do not think it was scary and there is no environment. The body of the cow is tied on some bodies and shoulders and is limited to it, there is nothing new or specially believed to have special effects here. Dr. Choppero is one of the films where the character's decision and motivation are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically it is a bit rough around the edge but perhaps in a very low budget, forests which are probably well-formed, the locations are separated individually, but the police offices show front front rooms and two nurse designs as the stripper's clothes at the beginning. Actually, it may be good but I've certainly seen the bad. <br /> <br /> The chopper actually looks like a helicopter roaming around the motorbike but unfortunately it is not enough to be satisfied with me, despite it being sinking without the lack of a suitable beef, nudity or any suitable plot.
