Time wastage, talent and shelf space, this is a real unreal movie. Big ligua like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Ackroyd is wasting their time in such waste? The little criminal Revis married his brother (Vincent d'Anfrio) and left the bride. A comedy ?, thriller ?, romance? I do not know well! Reeves led by Wood and Dan Aykroyd as a policeman are casting so awesome it will be seen to be believed! Diaz is the only bright spot from the dark dark tunnel and he is not good. Rent something else. Everyone involved with this mess will put his head in shame and will be victimized by the confusion in the next few years.
