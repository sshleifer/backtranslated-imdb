If this film is in English then all critics trashed it. The language is extremely poor, the scenes are widely directed and it is not all fun. After the film I thought that the film was written by 8th grade, at least if you consider the lack of credible characters and stability in certain male body parts. (Oh, as well as dogs ...) The story is almost blurry compared to the more mature Viger EVE glasses that are almost premiere at the same time. Of course the people have chosen the nets! Jalla! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, perhaps it was the first time Joseph Joseph I used the cheap camera equipment and after that I just decided to play with him. As a result, this is a movie that can easily be divided into 12 small films, each of them with a new directory style. This was very frustrating. Maybe Joseph Fares lived with his little movie, because he could be the only artist he could master. <br /> <br /> Another annoyance is not the story together. In the middle of the film most of the time the story will move very fast and the characters can walk together with each other, which is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I did not mention the 2-dimensional character, especially those on the helpful land. <br /> <br /> Although I'm one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s and it's one of the most rude movies, it's understandable as a public choice. I mean, bad taste has always been a trademark of the public ... <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed the critics that I am more surprised. They should know better ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
