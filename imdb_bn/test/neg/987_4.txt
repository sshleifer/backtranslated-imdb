*** ********************************************************************************************** *********** Who was this character? Why do not I care about them? If I'm going to watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to take care of somebody or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore has dreamed of the riches found in the new world. Even then, we learned something unknown about his family's most hopes, fears, as they started an adventure unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy in this movie? He said a little; What did we know about him or what he was doing (he forced him to work instead of allowing him to go to the ship?) Or what his plan was to reach New York. Those who might suggest that he needed to reduce the point that single women, but Sanskrit, could not enter this country alone, I would say that there is enough logic for the time to give his screen time. <br /> More questions: Why did not you have two brothers in the boat to meet the family? We listened to the brother, and some ties at that point could be helpful in enriching the movie. Also, how long did it take to travel to New York from Italy? If given the conditions of the ship, it will make a difference in the viewer if the journey takes between five or 10 or 50 days. (Some say something about seeing "weeks" in a moment, but I think they were already on the route.) Such details were needed so that they could appreciate what they were going to do. <br /> <br /> I really like the scene when the passengers' filled boat left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this movie remotely; You can use the Fast forward button easily. <br /> <br /> Finally, can I suggest that providing accurate information about the situation with the right timing and the condition of the immigrants - especially in rural slopes, people walking, etc. - This movie may be made of an interesting public TV documentary.
