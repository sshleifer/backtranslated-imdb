After a good start, I've never seen holier turned into the worst piece of propaganda. This movie is an open humiliation designed to make you feel bad about reading "Holy Bible". <br /> <br /> To start again ... okay let's call it a plot ... basically the kid does not kidnap people (that we already know ..). No, in fact his giant forces abduct the new age stuff or magic, or pornographic magazine (such as a dramatic). <br /> <br /> While comprehending its original character, it is full of little emotional piano music. He must follow in order to be a follower of Christ in darkness. A quote calculates all of it, imagine a fine piano music in the background: "You can not give others to anyone you love, to prevent you from following." Lord. "<br /> <br /> And we are supposed to live in an enlightened age ... still have to work. Boycott this piece of shit
