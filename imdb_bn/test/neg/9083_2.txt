Once again, Brunson's genius has lost much of this shock, the 1984 thriller, which is a lot more annoying than what happened today. "People who do bad things" are not very annoying (their verbal and visual representation of torture) problems. It is shameful gratuity which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to be a symbol of the next part of the career of Bronson, where he tortured many of his fans with the same violent predictable and uncertain plots. One hope that this fine actor will rise again.
