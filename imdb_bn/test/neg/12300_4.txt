'The Fourth Floor' is a perfect medieval film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a problematic neighbor's hack. Jane (Louis) has recently inherited an awesome 5th storey apartment from her grandmother and inherits a ridiculously low rental rate by agreement on the landlord. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a wonderful weatherman) wants to go with her, but she wants her place. So he goes away, and strange things happen, and because it's a B-grade horror flash, why is not a fool, found-available-reality? Since no miracle junk does not try to tell others - her boyfriend, the police, the co-workers, everyone is thinking that she lost it. So, of course, he has to face problems - alone alone crazy life. Not to be alarmed is not interesting, saving the movie's singles is Mercy Lewis. She is not a very fine actress but she is weakly used here, which is not the best thing about this flashing - because she His body is Churchilla and it has a better screen than Silicon Bimboj, which regularly produces such a film. Although this type of movie is not worthy of it - which is satirical, perhaps because of it anyone can see it.
