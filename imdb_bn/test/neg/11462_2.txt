Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe that the girl is a witch? Is there only dark hair and she can be a witch to wear dark clothes? And I think that the film tries to present him as someone "different", nobody understands ... he is just a teenager and some fools in his high school, he is a witch and everybody believes in him. Besides, Brandy is portrayed very badly or the character itself has been created ... fake. He did not believe me that he was not a witch, at first I would believe. Everyone accuses him of being a witch and he does something that he is not sure whether he is a witch or not. And the way they sorted him for court - I see old ladies every day who would not wear it, even if it was the last dress in the world! Brandy's brother was not very convincing ... But, you see, the important thing is, "He returns that bad, bad girl to the ground at the end of the film". "He won the war, he proved to different people." <br /> <br /> This could be one of the worst movies of life, which is very shallow. I just saw it because there was nothing else on TV at the moment, so I was condemned in this trash. Please do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the 7th rating, I became almost obscure ... it is not worth compared to some other movies compared with other 7 stars.
