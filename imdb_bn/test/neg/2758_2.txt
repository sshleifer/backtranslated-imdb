The stories of drab morality about a high school child are those who are now stereotypical nerd. She is smart, but her friend, social skills, and a father are lazy people who borrows money from her. A beautiful girl hits her (she knew she wanted something - she could be smart, did not she?). Sheikh Hasina has made the poor cruel fool to write Shakespeare's term paper, which the teacher immediately knew that he did not write. She lost her daughter (not that she really got him), her teacher's confidence, and her college scholarship, everyone was a blurred. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the ware he works, Then perhaps trashy will influence the little whore and want to marry him. Sorry, really sad Marav is a kind-hearted (and quite a brain, for a supposed smart person, that is, trying to loot a narcotics vendor? This child has opened the screw?) So that you feel sorry for him and get the terrible desire to kill him <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> They try to do it, and in this process Ye killed several. The police show up at the same time, and the stupid Marav pulls away, forever disrespectful. I know that these things have been directed towards directing the behavior of the adolescents by showing the consequences of bad behavior, but it was actually illustrated as the result of stupid behavior. Which of course is the premature timing of your film career. Bye, Marv, we really did not really know. And thank you for that.
