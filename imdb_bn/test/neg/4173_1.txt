What can be said about this? One of the most mind-numbing experiences of my life is really one. Your brain will try to shut down as part of a self-preservation primary emotion. I was disconnected from this 'film' experience and I took two hours to complete recovery. This film now joins revenge for Bugman and Jumbo as part of the brutal triangle of horror films. I certainly do not mean this difference in a good way. I mean this in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> There is no freedom fighter in this picture. Everything is uncomfortable. Uninterrupted camera-work continually represents our imaginable setting, such as large amounts of maize, plenty of mud. The story is beyond stupid. Is the script ?? Was there a script? Villeneum Wear heavily helpless and yellow welding boots. The kids are annoying. The main people are charisma free And it has an oddity to go for 100 minutes. At no stage, without merit, it is like torture. Generally this statement would be very much meant for a ridiculous effect. Not in this case. I would say it again ?? This torture. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was in paralysis. This was briefly thanks. But once I decided to recover I was looking at the 'Making Off' featurette. I had to understand. Perhaps this would be a reasonable explanation for this repression. Was it a wide joke at all? I saw the first 2 minutes of 'Making of Off' featurette and discovered that the writer / director made it lightly, a little confusing. I discovered that I took time to see the first two minutes of Dark Harvest 2's 'Making of Off' feature because I was stupid. Self-discovery is not a delightful journey. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Very uncomfortable
