This movie was unfortunately, terrible. <br /> <br /> Closed, hackneyed, stilled conversation and acting makes it almost unexpected. <br /> <br /> The feeling is a good feeling ridiculous hair. <br /> <br /> Judge Reynold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you are not in New York and not Jewish, most of the jokes will be unknowable. <br /> <br /> I also found the need to put an abusive end to an unidentified lesbian girl. <br /> <br /> I was just not so popular in film film. > <br /> It's been one of the worst movies I've seen for some time, without any doubt.
