I can not say that I saw it a few months or weeks ago (I can not remember) during this torture. I saw it as part two of Zoey 101, because they showed it in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed in a neutral thing, it is not just an example that is stereotypical people in how acceptable, irrelevant, sponsor, negative, favorable, and entertainment businesses and obviously I'm highly peeved. It was not all fun. A nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very angry. <br /> <br /> Second, Zoey 101 people do not have real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Jo is very rich. Today's tweens and teenagers do not have to deal with peer pressure, and things that will deal with stereotype issues. Also, the actor is awesome. Jamie Lynn Spayers is not eligible for a television show Jo Jo 101 (which is the world's wrong?), She has no actor. Actually, she's worse than in Britain! Chase and Joe's things were incredibly predictable, I want to say how can I go with show shoes and dating Chase? Perhaps they could have other problems? Everything is perfect without the chase that the girl wants! My television watcher's life is truly 48 minutes bad. Ever. 0/10 (and who is generous)
