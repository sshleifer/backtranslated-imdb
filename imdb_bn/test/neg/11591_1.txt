Comodo v. Cobra launched 'One Planet' distributor Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTiwish) and his girlfriend, Kerry (Renée Talbert), to captain Michael Stodder (Executive Producer Michael Perar) to take them to the South Pacific Islands on the first studded street. Reluctant to base a top secret military research base from the island but changed his mind soon when the cash was given a load. Together with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jerry Murte), they started off for the island and once discovered the military that the military is financing illegal DNA genetic tests, which are located near the Strodder and Co-Menu in the vast amount of Comodo dragon and King Cobra that has eaten all living things. ... <br /> <br /> Under the J. Andrews, the worst horror of Jim Wintersky The pseudonym driven and managed by is just terrible horror, it's hard to sit easily. Even if the normal garbage is worse than 'animal characteristics' and even if the sci-fi channel is possible it has wind wind. The scripts are scary, anticipated and completely annoying, some of the kind of giant monsters created by scientists surrounding the DNA, a group of people are stuck with the dancers and try to stop them from eating. That is, it's the whole plot of Comodo v. Cobra, perhaps it tried to AWP-Rip-Off: Alien vs. Pritator (2004) but all 'vs.' Bit quantity is a radioactive thirty-second stand-off, at the very end, between two titulary animals, boring like hell and certainly a big disappointment that is expected to be full of monstrosity. The character is poor, the conversation is horrific, the speed of motion, the story is predictable and the cliché raided and the whole movie only sucks with a lazy script which wrongly states that comodo dragon and cobra are not indifferent. Heck, Comodo Vs. Cobra is not too valuable to look for any unknown smile because it is very slow and rarely happens, though the sight of a woman hidden behind a small rock from the cobra is very interesting for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How is Wennersky working on the job? Now he is continuously acting as the worst director, how can he keep the fun words set in beautiful places with beautiful cast and still ruin such a terrible movie? I think it was spent showing a PG or its TV, because every time someone swears by the mask of a paraapo Sikak! There is zero pride or violence and the giant scenes are tall, the people are just standing there, the monsters grow up very loudly and this is about it. The effects of CGI computer are terrible, it's a really bad thing that just looks terrible. <br /> <br /> It was as cheap with an estimated budget of $ 450,000, it looks nice to see Hawaiian locations, but it's about it. Acting is an avid looking poor to cast. <br /> <br /> The comedy vs. Cobra Jim Wenraski is a terrible caiaphai channel 'properties of animals', movies are not much worse than that.
