When I first saw the commercial for this show, my sister Kim was watching the potential movie. Commercial shows Sadi and her friend discuss the meaning of the word. It's a stupid advertisement I've ever seen. Basically, they go back to the line as "nothing is a thing, so technically nothing," When I saw it, I think it would be a fake copy of Disney's Lumie Maguere. But I had no idea that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> For some reason, his friend Margaret decided that he must be tested to see if Oweck needs to be "good." What is the test involved? Well, one thing they make a note in his notebook That is why he should be Squumish and ask to bring his Montoen Knight out of the shiny armor, which is what the test is, because if he pokes it, then he does not believe it, and he does not believe that Sadi puts it, "innocent creatures" They are repressed and anxious, they are ready to please! But of course, the OWL pulls the General out, and Saadi still falls in love, but this is not the end! Margre Someone needs to challenge once more, that he can "no man can pass". This one involves shoving scarves down their pants (yes, you read that correct) and walking them to see if they notice his big butts. Probably, he does not notice, and we see Sadi in the world of his malicious and strange notebooks. Sadi has decided that she wants to stay with Owen forever, wants to raise a family with her, and as she says, "live like a wooden duck with their kids" It's just a simple mistake <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is the weird, most insane show I've seen. For those who want to do fun things, you like it. For anyone else, avoid this show.
