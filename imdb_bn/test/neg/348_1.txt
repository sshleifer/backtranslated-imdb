All right, I could stop crying while reading this. This movie was so awesome to be very scary. The animals are very beautiful, but the only real thing about the film was the increasing connection between the prisoners and their guards after being separated from this bad island. Even Barbara's child is seen with her hair to tear everything. He goes around with a whispery-never-wash-only-use-my-voice breathlessness that is screaming the bloody murder only when not just washed. (Hey's leading man was very nice but I'm still not assuaged.) It's Dr. Mourou's good ole island is a tears-in-your-beer ripoff. Poor Richard Johnson, who certainly was born for good things, is incredibly bad as bad guy. I mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Trying hard not to feel embarrassed as Joseph Cotten staggers through his shaven look. In the name of that sacred, do not rent this darned bomb.
