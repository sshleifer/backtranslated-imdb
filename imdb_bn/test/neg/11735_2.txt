All right, so Gus Van wanted to recreate Santo's psyche in order to bring it to modern audiences, if they were forced to watch a movie in black and white, probably cardiac arrest could be arrested, when they easily forgot that both "clarks" and "Skinlar's List" is a painting and portrayed in black and white films. Unfortunately, the same narrow people who do not want to see black movies do not want to see a great movie & white is the same people who do not like "saiko" because it's a murder or sexual scene every two minutes. Not there. And these killings are not bloody blood / holes / cows / bone-snapping, which are not used by people like "Halloween", "Friday 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". For this reason, the restoration of "psycho" was often not exactly determined to work as it is mainly due to the interest of the fans. All the other people are watching it only to see the next "Scrum" seewell, and because of that, they will be disappointed. "Psycho" depends on the mystery and mystery, not blood and throat. (And so nobody thinks that if I like the old movie then I have to be a senior citizen, I will allow 21-year-old to set a record straight. "<br /> <br /> <br /> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> About copying Instead, he can spin his own director - at least a new writer has been hired to adapt a new script from "Psycho" book, but it seems that van Sant can not decide whether he wants to rebuild "Psycho" * or not * Whether it can not be a complete or a project - either completely recreate the movie or do it differently - but it does It is about 95% of the film, but it does not seem to have any intention of touching it, such as Norman masturbating while spying on a Marine dress, it does not fully provide the plot and kept the reason because it could * * . He wanted to say, "Hit can not show man masturbating in the 1960s so I'm going to do it." Hello, big deal, as I am very surprised to see someone masturbating. And what was the point of showing the single-frame shot of clouds and farm animals divided into the killings scene in the world? And then he * out * left an important scene, where Lilah and Sam meet Sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Plus, using the same script, the whole film feels an immunity. The opening credit says that the year 1998. Then what does Marine do with 60-inch-looking dress or parasol? Why Marine and Sam have to sit in the hotel, when they are not disappointed by what someone is doing on this day? Why Marine's office does not have air conditioning? Why is there no TV in the total room of Betas, and apparently there is no automatic lock in the doors? Why should Sheriff ask the operator to attach him to the bettors? For this reason it was a mistake to use the same script - only a few words were changed here and it was not enough for modernization. It requires a complete recycling. <br /> <br /> While Vince Van turned out to be a good performer like Norman, it does not seem right for that part. The part of the creation of the original "psycho" was so scary that Norman was the innocent, male-post-bargain quality, so nobody can believe that he is capable of such horrible crimes. Vince Von plays the part, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? She said, I understand that Gass Van Sant was probably an admirer of the film "Siko" and wanted to be respected. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that the only exposure to some people's "psycho" can be. I've really seen you original if you would watch this movie. Since I'm a fan to do something with "psycho", so I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can see occasionally. The original movie was a mines, where the remix is ​​a hamburger. But if you had it everyday, the filter mains would also be annoying, so for a change it is better to have a hamburger once.
