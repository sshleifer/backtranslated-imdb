I decided to watch this fall movie. It keeps me awake, so it was interesting; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think actors do any bad work. Mikey Roar is believable that people of any mountain can be hit-man. In the dialogue of this movie, these actors are not given many opportunities to show their full potential, but they are still shy. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the color combined with the mood that the painters wanted to draw for. Even in the weather movie moods improved. Everything is fine <br /> <br /> The failure of this movie is to develop its story. The story of Mafia versus Blackbird does not get enough attention. The story of Carmen and Owen's divorce can not be explained. The FBI seems to work fast here too fast. Are there any papers for all this process? Is it really easy for you to scrub your brother's body from your grave, burn the dead body? There are many loops in my story to give this movie more than 4 ratings out of 10. I will not recommend this movie to the public unless they are really upset and wash some really good weed. Even though WOW is down for maintenance, find better to do something than watch this movie.
