This show is probably one of the most annoying, most unfunny shows I've ever seen. Humor was fine, and I'm all for fine humor; Jokes were not funny. <br /> <br /> This show is trying to start their music career, in the mid-30s, two queues residing in New York. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where Brett's other Kiwi leaf behind a mugging time. OK, the concept of plot is possible; But I felt that only half the episode was filled, and the other half was really important for the story. <br /> <br /> What I am saying is that how they have gone behind it has been explained how betraying and there was a lot of disbelief for other people. I have received a piece of advice for writers: mention it to a group of rebels who can not understand it through its behavior and move forward. <br /> <br /> And I saw that the letters were annoying. The character has left behind the other, Brett is very innocent and has been added to the humorous, talking about the monotonous and robotics voice behind what kept behind. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was a band manager, was definitely incapable, but he liked that there was one character. He is also an actor who earned a one-star rating. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have no interest in watching a show again.
