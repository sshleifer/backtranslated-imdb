John Candy was a very hit-or-miss comic actor. His death was a tragic event and we all miss him a lot, but Wagons East, where he plays leftist Wagonmaster, who agrees to accept a group of pioneers from the wild west, even tragic. I did not even understand why it was released. The story is not in vain and weak, and joke. It makes me even worse that the last film of the candy will be its worst movie ever. So forget about all this and remember him in his films like Samor Rentals, Plan, Trains and Automobiles, and Uncle Bak. <br /> <br /> 5
