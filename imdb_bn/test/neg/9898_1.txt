Before I saw this movie I'd like to read IMDb comment comments. The first one hour was right, even though it surprised me why everything was concentrated in Chicago and why did not anyone report any weather disparities from outside the United States. Nature isolated work (this level) is unimaginable. But outside of the first 60 minutes, the movie goes on like a story never ending. The plaque is awesome For actors, very poor choice. Only people hire to play in their role panic stick. But I want to agree with the consent that this movie has some good "special effects". If you rent it on DVD and watch the movie despite the reviews, run it at the highest speed of your player!
