I really like the horror movies and try to see as much credit as possible (or sometimes more) as much as possible, but it's really pushing the ticket ... Most casts were very capable but at least none of them could work at all - but again Think about this mess / dialogue ... some good make-up but absolutely ridiculous special FX. I can give 3 out of 10 to everyone - and the second thought about it !!
