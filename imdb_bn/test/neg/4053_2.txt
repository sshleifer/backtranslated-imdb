They never denied funding for this film, the NSW Film and Television Office. Producers kicked up a big stink and preached a firefighting Victoria to take their production. As well as lost work for technicians, NSW was not lucky ... <br /> <br /> The film failed at almost every stage. Post-modernization fails, casting fails (What is the role of everyday outsourcing?) Which 1 dimensional bachelor's hugo weaving channel has? What is the character of Pia Mirand?) And the story is a conflict of contradiction. Actually, the story is running like a dragged out house instead of a full plot line. <br /> <br /> "It's a chance if the pop culture meets depression" and it was a good idea to execute the sentence and execute it. If the casting was quirkier, the style was less serious ... if everything was different about me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the usual excellence of clothing, design and cinematography (like most Australian movies), the film is only a total mistake. <br /> <br /> In the budget of more than $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of Malaysian artifacts of the Australian film industry - wrong people and wrong projects are being paid. Compare this mess with "Noise" (less than $ 2m) or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1m) and you get the idea. Strong, attractive movies are struggling for funds and omnibus projects with shock, nail art are owing. <br /> <br /> This investor money companies deserve to go the same way as the character of Hugo Knitting. The end of the film
