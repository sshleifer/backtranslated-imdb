I spent the past 5 years in the entertainment business and recently I am working for this company, which actually made this movie, because I like these people, I can not believe that someone might do something as bad as possible. As this? !!!! This was shit from every possible angle. From the work of the camera to the dress and production design, the dialogue was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The actors of this movie saw that they were removed directly from a pornographic film shot in San Fernando Valley and set up a set with even less talented crews. <br /> <br /> I'm just sitting on some of the best things I have ever read and communicate in the industry that can help me to implement my dream and potentially hit each roadblock. Still, the people behind this philosophy do not have any problem in getting together, and in fact, it can sleep better after release. <br /> <br /> Life, key tour!
