This movie has neglected me with all the promotion around the film. I was hoping for a better film to include Murphy, De Niro and Rousseau's talent but it found that the movie is flat on its face. Comedy sequences were overdone and star's performance, especially De Niro and Rorsos, could not save it! <br /> <br /> ** *****
