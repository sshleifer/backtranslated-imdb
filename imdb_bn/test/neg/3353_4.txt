An innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, always relatantly) of the horrors of Threadbear, is trying to get involved in the popular cycle at school (though they seem to hate him completely) and allowed himself to be indoctrinated under the kindergarten initiative: the cost is a wonderful tomb . Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller comes with some modest special effects and has some of its best performances (especially Robin Evans, as a leader of the girls' campi desecration). The script is not sharp sharp, but there is enough joke to make it workable. ** **** to
