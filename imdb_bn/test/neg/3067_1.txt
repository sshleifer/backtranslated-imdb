To say something else, something else is a real need. This movie was actually thinking of suicide to me. As a huge fan of Zumbi films, I have found this in most cases, which I have sometimes tried to hide. Sometimes the movie can not go! It all had an indication, I was feeling depressed and lost. Hell was so bad that I could not prevent it. I'm just going to hanging myself in the closet. Okay I have tried to submit my comments now but the server will only accept ten lines or more comments. So here it goes ... bad, horrible, where there is enough close around. Any tips !!!!!! How can you make a zombie game without tits The fact is that there was a rack of women's leadership, and the only reason I saw the end of the movie was probably to get a vision. No! Of course, a line that was worth mentioning, I'm waiting for myself to use one line one day (when I think my face needs to be crushed) "This Hog is not going to fade itself" This movie is bad, very bad.
