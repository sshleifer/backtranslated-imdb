What were they thinking about creating this true movie? <br /> <br /> Arbas, the most important photographer and women of the twentieth century had an interesting and dramatic life. Has this picture been created by someone who explains its unique artistic perspective, which is an extraordinary, yet, as a result of a (imaginary) relationship with the charismatic hairdrip (played by Doni)? <br /> <br /> <br /> Arbas broke a role of women in heritage marriage and expressed herself. In this film, Arbis is a supernatural Nicole Kinnman whose inspiration is called everyone as an interesting person "devotion to beauty and shit". <br /> <br /> For this review, the film is really embarrassing. That's independent, it's just dopey and dull.
