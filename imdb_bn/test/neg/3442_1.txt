Team Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addiction. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities as a coward and a child and an actor or a person. The only movie with which it is enjoyable is "Galaxy Quest" and its character - washing the actress from a former hit TV show - real life was so close to her. The rest of the cast is equally bad. I hate his mother and actress playing Patricia Richardson, she sucks! Sometimes there is a cliché, stupid woman who likes fat and opera and is only careful about caring her children, in real life when she declares family values ​​and is divorced after twins. And child actors were interesting about as a root canal.
