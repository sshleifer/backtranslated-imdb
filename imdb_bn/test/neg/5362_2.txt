I give this a messy 2 instead of 2 a haunted home called because of a bad show. But this child and his friends manage their investigation like total innocent. They speculate that there is a ghost in it, and if they ever find reasonable explanations behind the experience, they should be scared to accept the drug and accept it. But outside of it, the whole set of shows is incredibly annoying. Although most of its text seems to be scripted, college-educated children who make cast, can rarely speak in English, but still try to understand the "big" words they do not understand clearly. And the chief investigator Ryan's ridiculously self-important voiceover wanted me to throw TV through window. (And he always shows the stone). In short, this group looks like Ghost Hunters from TISS to MIT scientists!
