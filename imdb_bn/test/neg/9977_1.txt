I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. It is almost remarkable to mention the problem of production. The script is sub-standard (it is easy to see why Willal tried to deny it). The direction is bad In most of the films, long shots are stuck closely with the close closure closest to most non-boy pornographic cross cut (most commonly in the "uncut" version). Cinematography is particularly sub-par, which gives a whole-grain production of a cheap dust-out look that reduces the set set designs. The movie should look a whole lot better. The first hour after the departure of Peter O'Toole and John Gilgood, the actors thin the overall concept of keeping an X-rated film (also called Gaakono as "Pagan"). Bob Gucci√≥n clearly gained huge amounts of it, but it all seems to be a big waste. For better understanding of the Roman Empire of the first century, if you look at the interstitial BBC's production of Claudius instead of me ... and if you want to see porn, see Jizz-Louise anywhere else.
