At the age of 13, I was lucky enough to find this picture. It was part of an endless Danish series of really cheesy stuff. This however was the most cheesiest I ever owned - but I sold it, sold very bad. Well what to write ... "Minds: Look Lucky" and worse than "Criters 4". But this is more than one and a half times that it was made to make it. Acting is not terrible in comparison to some other eighty trash - actually I look like an old man, but he looked at me 'Indian. But I guess you can not get everything ... help yourself and see it ...
