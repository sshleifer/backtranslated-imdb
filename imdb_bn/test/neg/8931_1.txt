Right now on my TV ... but in my comments this is long enough to completely finish it. The previous comment can tell me that this movie will not be any better, as much as I would expect and pray. I will discuss this movie with an extraordinary waste of my time, and it will be your time ... it will not be any better! I can not believe this screen writer is doing the Atlas Shuruged! I hope he has improved one million times! I have a good review that I saw some good credits in his resume, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with her work, post something here, because I really want to see Etas Schriegade, and if this guy turns this movie into a rubbish, it will hate it.
