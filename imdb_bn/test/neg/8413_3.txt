For a movie that has gained great recognition and "Roseme's Baby" evaluates this spinoff, it is a big mistake. Whatever the name of Andrew / Adrian, he is so confused that he does not know that he and his mother are fleeing from any religion and he is soon kidnapped by a strange lady who ends up taking care of him. She was her mother. As the terrible terrible actress grew in her twentieth century and looks terrible with her Sunken, Hazard's clothes have been more than the devil's son like drunk on the last grin and Dukes ever looks. In fact, all that he does is drunk and he falls on himself, because he tries to scream and shout in the last memorial of his past and move on a bus. He found a friend who seems to be an angel, but he quickly died there in a carnage scene and saw a Christmas tree. Andrew was worried and checked with members of the first part to see if he was really the son of Satan. His stupid self-examination failed and my makeup made me jump on the stage of the makeup and night club and made a shoe dance change on the crack! This watch is a memorable and well worth the watch. The end is terrible and somewhat predictive because he is stupid considering the whole film. Do not see this piece of trash or you will not respect for the first part.
