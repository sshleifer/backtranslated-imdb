Their whole career was a pale disguise of The Beatles, it is surprising that some days after the great ambiguity of Beatles's "The Mystery of the Museum", the monks are "Head." With their own inspiration and the creative cruelty of a movie. Both films are not so much true with a plot ( Although MMT tried to define a plot) because they were skits and snippets Due to Hajj-Pazad, music and songs associated with and out-takes. <br /> <br /> There is no plot of "Head", in addition to pre-fav-four, who try to get rid of "Box" (ie "Monkeze" and type-casting like surrounding business) Finds out the box. Most skits involve the break in the "fourth wall" and other, seemingly distant scenes. Along with efforts by the team to protest Vietnam's war message and their other talents, the film revolves suddenly - blames multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The picture is like a magic mystery tour. Now surprised by some fans "Wonderful Symbol and Wrong Artist Statement." Angered-sounding sounds Like MMT, many drugs have access to many medicines that are trying to make everything and crying. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, "Head" has some clever moments and some unexpected unknown song songs are pretty decent. It develops even more curiosity than MMT and it is a bit easier to sit on, but it is not so weird that it was not the first bit of Beatles to do anything in Monkeys ... even when it comes to an egg bed.
