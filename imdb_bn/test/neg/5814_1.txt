Local rental rental shop tapes were found in a rack of exchange between different rental shops. 'That person skied down the Everest'. Hmm ... I never heard of it. The box was read by some Japanese colleagues who always wanted to Sky Everest and really did it. Interesting words I rent it As expected it was in documentary style. The first part can be summarized briefly: "I always wanted to mount Mount Everest". Some of the preparations for this event are followed by footage. Lots of preparation footage All right, I think it's a lot of preparation. Then we are treated in a long part of our skyair, the philosophy of the life of Zuichi Mura, etc. Following more fillers and I started thinking that skiing is fit on this show. More preparations are shown and they start to travel to the mountains. More views are shown. Eventually they reached the mountain and probably would probably go to skiing the refrigerator. After a lot of football, there is a description of the parachute device that makes the pulse of the murias slow at the slope of the steep slope. Eventually he was stripped on the skies and ready to go. <br /> <br /> She's stopped ... She is about 20 feet high and her ski shoots from below, she places patchy and timble in a radioactive bundle. Some distance down the mountain and that. At the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Well, I wanted to Sky Everest, made huge preparations and actually tried it with a camera crew. It did not work, and he wasted himself and killed himself, so what would be harmful for him to inspire a movie and Sky Eve Eve? Perhaps the title, "Man's feet shot from under his feet and he was too long for the tapes on the slide down on his ass".
