After watching the movie, I must say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This takes away my worst movie award from Komodo, which is no easy achievement. This is neither porn nor legal film, and it gives both a bad name. Acting, camera-work, plot, script, and words are all horror. My personal favorite part of the movie is asking for a wine if it is a wine. Why was such a joke kept in this picture? The manager was thinking; "I need a ridiculous view to adjust to my great acting, so I will use some fanatic ass jokes to read the Laffee Taffee booth." Another destructive part is that when Norman stretched the invisible material on herself, because she tried to keep it from spilling. Why did they bother to give this movie an NC-17 rating, did they expect viewers to do as much as possible? At least if it is rated, it will be more sexually and therefore the audience will be focused away from the overall low quality. I pray for somebody who works this panty waste in a flick of reaction.
