I have heard that this Japanese flick is a "cool new thong" scene in the intense, creative, attractive Asian film scene ... Perhaps something new as Hydee Knox's "Rinku" or "Oldbay" of Chan-Uk Park. You can imagine my disappointment, instead, I have confused both of the films both classically and cinematically (although in no way a movie is appreciated), rather than unfortunate, even miserable. Unfortunately, the funny thing is - it's a very fake copy of "Pope Fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped seeing after 30 minutes, when I gave up, it got more than that.
