I could not really get into this movie. This plot has been tortured by some older women so that they are distorted. She died and she left the hungry basement. Months must pass and a family can go away. Due to the accident due to father, she is blind. Well this person in the basement, that all rights should still be close to long death. She eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now has people eat and have sex. And when a hooker dies, the father gets blame. I always dislike movies where someone else blames you for killing because you are not always here "I did it" generally on the lines, "I could not do anything", Allah Allah And family tales can be a lifetime movie story.
