The DVD release of this movie expects you to face the name of this movie and Sandra Bullock. His picture (a few years later in this film) is mostly cover art ... and rear cover art ... and inner cover art ... same pictures. His name is front cover, mainly 4 edges and the disc itself is shown. He is the first name in the big list list. His biography is printed inside the field. This image will rotate around its character, is not it? Wrong! This is his first movie and he plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role seems like a minor role. Character dogs actually show some personality. In less than an hour after watching this, I do not remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> If I had seen it several more times, then I could actually find the plot, but I do not. <br /> <br /> Wait, I just have a fun bit to remember! Shooting-up video game fans come out of "Dumm-Cam" Looks like a first-person shooter game. Hands and guns in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a person to criticize movies, but it can be the worst movie I ever seen. I hope to walk across some silhouette screens, sit down and start to have fun. <br /> <br /> I donated for the money I spent in this fun.
