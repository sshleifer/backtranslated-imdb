Director Martin Campbell blamed this terrible flutter. After seeing some of his credit in the next few years, it must be his first dwarf gigge. He was more than just a proper cast to work with him, but unfortunately he did not know what he was doing. There was a scene that made absolutely no sense. Where was his head? I was waiting for this movie due to Oldman and Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting schedule and Campbell was just "bang it out". I can not imagine that stories conducted by Campbell came even closer to the author's writing story. Oldman and Bacon, if they have slides under the rest of their chairs, along with the rest of the cast as well as going to screening. Looking at one poster, Karen Young saw a good fight scene with Bacon. He really 'let go'. It is unfortunate that I need to fill in more space for IMDB's necessary guidelines because I have nothing to say about this vague film. One does not have to be forced to 'Windabag' by criticizing the horrific quarrels and IMDB hopes to change the amount of words to fill a criticism.
