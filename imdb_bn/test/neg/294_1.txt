I will not be bothered to mention a plot - it's a strictly ambiguous B-Movie But my shock has become some of the actors of this film. Erika Eleniak, whatever you do not want to call any Thecian, it looks like Anna Nicole Smith (during her big time) has faced. Daniel Bernardt - I often tear a tear. Seeing the Bloodport series (such as B movies but if you prefer martial arts, see it as important), because of his martial arts skills he always loved me. Here, he is not looking forward to doing his ex-self-dependent shell, he is aged, but doing the mercantile thing and even ... I do not get it. Does this people invest? William Forsyth is another "heavy" I've always liked, but his last few roles are what you call "this mailing". I even Mr. Reynolds is not going to mention - its gigabyte is a casting amount here, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Devoff, naturally a vague, evil, worn villain, which is a sandpaper's voice that can suppress milk - the best kind! It's a movie you watch for a smile. It's nothing else.
