Like most musical instruments of the era, one must verify the reality of the door. The Broadway Melody of 1938 is not remotely trustworthy and not possible, but it is strange funny. This movie is simply an excuse for star performances. Some scenes are just as they happen, so they were in a review, not a plot-driven movie. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland became lukewarm, and she was sad when she was not left until the cutting floor was in the floor. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> Walks through a few scenes and there is no work, no rehearsals ... There is nothing. He needs money to win the horse in the auction. He has no money. He is not getting rehearsed money? Taylor had to borrow money to help. She is supposed to be a big time producer. He has no money ??? However, only two elements of this weird story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are quite surprising, which save it from total loss. The 1940s Broadway Melody is better than the Broadway Melody of 1936.
