Patriotic (nothing to do with the Mail Melson movie of the same name) Steven Seagull is doing 'Save the Environment' in his movies. Which is fine. But it does not make it to work well. <br /> <br /> When I finally kicked the plot (?), I saw (?) one mile away. Seagal's anti-war, mother-nature attitude for care is not very delicate. For a film that will be debut in the film, it is shot by Dos Wilsh's photographer Dean Semellar as a TV movie despite some wonderful shots of the country. <br /> <br /> Steven Sigal is like a war scene in the whole film and it's completely annoying. As an action film it fails, stinks it as a play, as it is clear in an environmental message. Avoid like crossing with Ebola plug.
