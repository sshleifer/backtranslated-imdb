It actually hurts me to say it, but this movie was terrible at every stage. The blame does not completely lie with the van dame, because you can see that he tried his best, but let's face it, he is almost fifty, how much more can you ask for it? I think it is so difficult to believe that the same people who are confused together; Controversially made the year's best (Western) martial arts film. Everything from the plot, the dialogue, the editing, the overall performance was gathered, and in most cases it was absolutely annoying and uncomfortable. Scott Adkins, who fought in the scene, thinks much more like a demo rail, even rarely used unused, and even the main villain was not even ashamed because 1) he was not able to play that role, and 2) the real main villain only All the fears but quite annoying. Again, Van Damme does not blame. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.
