After an aircraft's insulting experience, Nation Wade (Kevin Heart) sued the airline and used the money to start its own full-service airline. Its difference is that it has no cockpit on sexy stewards, a board dance club and a captain snake dog. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of the aircraft. The problem is that Soul Plane has not even got near the air smile. Joke at Soul Pan is very aggressive and they are mostly irrational, and they are mostly irrational. I said that if I did not laugh after some ridiculous moments, I would have lied. However, I was more expected and I was disappointed with the theater. <br /> <br /> I'll put the Soul Plane on airplane 2. The second was only a repetition of the first movie, when the old one was a rehearsal of the old level. Weird joke There is no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. However, I do not think Soul Planet "100 below" is bad. At this time, the number of movies has been ranked at 82 and it is a little harsh. I'm not saying this is a good movie but it's not terrible. Running time is only 86 minutes long so the pain is not too high to see it. For stupid jokes, you can do something worse. <br /> <br /> Cast is very good in somebody but they all seem to be fun and it helps. Kevin was very boring as Heart Nation. He had some funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was funny in Starky and Hutch, was completely flunks here. Tom Arnold was really tolerant and it was the biggest surprise of the film. The most annoying person in the film was Ryan Pinkstone. She was not all fun and she would not have to be fun. Ms. Pyle and Mooney were the funest members of the cast. They gave the best line and they smiled at me the most. Ultimately, if you are looking for a stupid comedy then Soul Plane can fit the bill but it will be better if you skip the movie only. Ratings 4/10
