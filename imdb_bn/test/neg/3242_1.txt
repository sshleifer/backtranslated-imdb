Oh, if you want to see a joke in a day, see this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was so frustrating that it had so many actors, but what did they do and how they were fit? <br /> <br /> The handling of college scenes is like playing a school where every person comes to talk and then comes the next person <br /> <br /> <br /> The reason for the smile is okay: 1) Akshay , Sunil, Aditya Panchcholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as a college student 2) Akshay college carries guns 3) Some kind stunts and SFX <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Being raped and so late? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> It was painful to see this film directed by Rajkumar Kohli, who made such a movie in the past and successfully recorded in the movie Jansish Dushman (1979) and Nagin Rajkumar Kohli. 1992), all the flops of Aulad K. Dashman (1993) and Kahahar (1996), he worked hard to promote his son and he was the biggest of the big stars Big and big big girls > There are several comedic scenes like death scenes in this movie, after the dreams, actors are so good to fight him again <br /> <br /> The direction of the Princess Kohli is bad! /> <br /> It brings us to Akshay Kumar - the common thing is that he does not have to do anything but instead Sunil Sethi-Vaaran Sona Nigam - the worst debate goes to him for the prodigious award, he plays cartoon with new meaning. Aftab-Horrible Arshad Warsi - Sharad Kapoor - Bad Aditya Panchcholi - There is nothing like this - Sunny Deol is disturbed - when he is the son of Lola Manisha Koirala - Kiran Kumar, a pair of ordinary Rampant Akshay, Rajkari Rajbari-Sunny Princess, like Raja Murad Rajkanya, because the girls are horrified Due to the reasons we brought Munish Kohli. This man has huge body, he is more powerful and tall, then Akshay Kumar is sad with the sadness of his voice in the letters of poor people, his expression is painful, what he will do in the movie, wear only glasses and make an evil face is awful
