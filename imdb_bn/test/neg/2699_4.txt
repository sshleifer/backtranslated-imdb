I went to see "discount" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" influenced me so much. In spite of a few laps in malice, family relationships and high rates of "shower" on my list of favorite favorites movies for it's usually intense acting and direction of its intense insights And I saw it at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But according to my guess the "running" was flat. It seemed to be an uninterrupted exercise and I was so tired of the impossibility of the main character that I wanted to finish the film. I admitted to sleep for six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's OK to write this comment yet. <br /> <br /> I appreciate my parents. The machine used to use all the real characters in the movie is a beautiful one that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Along with frustration, I will still try to see a movie related to the name of Yang Zhang, on the basis of the beautiful "Shower".
