This film originally tried to show the heroism of fire extinguishers by roaming the whole film with an American heart, which kept itself in front of others. Now I know that they try to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a common American father, which is a firefighter, but there is nothing interesting about him in anything like him, so when the movie reaches Climax, there are very few emotions there. This film originally tried to make a fire-breathing sensational life but it became boring as a work other than a fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but someone could play his role and he is a neutral character like the rest of the film. What could be a good movie is that firefighters have been made as heli as hello because they make firefighter and the whole scenario a strange melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
