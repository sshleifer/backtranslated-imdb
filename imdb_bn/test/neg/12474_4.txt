The first thing I noticed was that it was allowed to stand in the rest of this culture when Solale's place to wake up. Women are used in an air shot to show exclusive flowered with a sea kiss. I believe that women had agreed to each other for this closeness? Those who were stuck together with separation and misunderstanding among generations, and still depend on each other, bonds and dependent. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by neutrality is that they did not suffer the consequences of their actions and they were treated as an error. After Palla accidentally killed her father, it's an example. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for this work, although she did not face any remorse for what she had done to Paula. Again, another example of this is when every girl (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to get together with their supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). To know the pressure of the most causes of his family, arrest the mother without taking care of what each of them still did? That is to kill her husband and boyfriend. In this light, women are portrayed who do not independently liberate each other from the work of character, but those who do not seem to be annoyed at their activities by their friends / family. <br /> <br /> Another idea that I felt was the incentive of this culture to supernatural about their ideas. With the death of Raymunda and Soul's mother and her inexpectible prospect, the director made the audience's emotions to believe that the audience is supernatural. The people portrayed in this culture seem very supernatural, which is very encouraging to believe that life is outside the grave. Their aunt, longtime friend Augustina, a prostitute living in Launchcha town, and other people all believe that the rumors of the dead are coming back to family members so that they can end "incomplete business". I believe it was a mixed mix of the religious beliefs of the culture (mainly Catholic) and the need to correct them with no opportunity to forgive at the time of death. Those who believe in the "living" of the dead are also optimistic about the hopes of sufferings of death. When this reality is released by the audience when the audience is not suprised, it is interesting that the role played by the mother is to play the role. He is still regarded as a Scratch (such as small small crevices (inside the bed or inside a car trunk)). I believe that the director represented the mother that the city would increase the supernatural beliefs already existed. The mother's character is a metaphor of the lasting belief of life after death.
