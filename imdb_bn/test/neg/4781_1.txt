This movie was really awful. It was not least bit awesome, or even surprising. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and at the end of the night we were saying "ruins destroyed my night." <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters, seeing rent or watching movies on television. It is a half-hour complete waste. <br /> <br /> The plot almost existed, the letters were horrified, and they did not make any previous story for what was happening, and then finally it was completely open so that it was ready for a signal.
