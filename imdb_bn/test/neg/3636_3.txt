While watching this show, I really joke at once to laugh. Jamie Lin Spears got her big sister only for acting, and I do not think anyone could argue with her. There is no expression in her face (even when she laughs) - Just look at the show and you can see what you understand. Let's talk about its show now. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen! Many people have already said that Joe Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves him, he is a straight student, and all the boys think he's "hot". The PCA is a rich boarding board full of children who provide flat-screen TVs and laptop computers to all their students, to provide children's fitness from the sushi bar. In one of the latest episodes, Joey is completely stupid and thinks that Chase does not fall in love with her and Chess also does not want to love her. Then, when he entered Chase's dorm room to prove his friends wrongly, he would have kissed this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, freaks out, because he probably likes attention from Chase. However, if you do not have anything else then just check out this show and the only thing on television is Zoey 101. You can have fun laughing at at least how unreal!
