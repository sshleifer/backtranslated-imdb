The acting is usually quite weak. The dialog was visually doped even after filming, so it does not come well. What do you want for a TV movie? <br /> <br /> Annette O'Tol was OK; There were some strong lines from Queen's parents. <br /> <br /> No, these kids were not so far. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a trusted fashion plot and got through the development of character . Settings and cinematography are okay. <br /> <br /> Some other visitors may like it for emotional reasons.
