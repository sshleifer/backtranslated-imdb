OK. I will accept it I'm a huge fan of B movie. Michelle Barar, Linna Quigley and Brink Stevens came back when they turned around. And then back, bad movies were even better. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad. Even Bringe does not help one of Stevens's small cameo (reiterating his role as Linda from "Slumpy Party Genocide" 21 years ago). A group of cheerleaders take refuge in a festive cabin after their van breaks. A psycho stalks one of them one by one, caught them in different states of the dress. Bad scripts, bad sides and horrible performances make this one plain plain! Leave this turkey and rented "Slumber Party Genocide." 1/2 *
