Killjoy has a fantastic song in between 2 that how the clowns are really nice and fun but Killjoy is a killer. I did not recall the song in the first movie, but the singer Olympia Fernandez's song has been added for this alarming continuity like listening to the song "Kilzo, yes kilos 2". The film was much worse than the first movie and it was really bad. At this time, Cast, along with Debbie Rocon, surpassed most outstanding Debbie Rocon and director Tammy Sutton did not create any tension and presented only a neutral and stagnant movie. Full moon images are produced in their 'urban' stage, none of which was very good, but no one was so bad here.
