"The Next Karate Kid" is a completely predictable film, just like before. His prediction often resulted in a feeling of impatience on the part of the audience, who are often willing to move the story a little faster. However, despite his lull and his extreme contact, this fourth entry in the series is painless, due to the presence of almost the only Murita. He does not feel tired from his role and he cast some life and humor in the film, becoming your best reason to see it. Do not be horrific, but nothing, is.
