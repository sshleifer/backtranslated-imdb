Hungary does not have any good movies. Fact. This is a great example. <br /> <br /> The first word "plot" does not exist in this movie. It's very weak. Even many people that will argue with me. Of course, it's about a banned, but that's about it. There are endless possibilities, which can be used if can be really great, but they almost omitted everything I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show the picture, which is the only decent thing on this whole level of horror. <br /> <br /> Acting is just simple itty. There are not many lines, so you think that the faces of the faces of the actors have the facial expression or the skill is imitated, but not. In fact, 86% of the time they suck. And when they do not say anything. If they even say a word, you will start to shout your head: "It is very unrealistic". But again, this is partly the fault of writing. There is no emotion in most conversations too. <br /> <br /> <br /> Edit editing is sometimes OK, but most of the time is unreasonable and the whole picture is bad. It can be a psychological push, but it seems that the editing here is about to spend after each other. Calling this an "industry" does not make it even better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Living with it. Even you probably will not have the scarifying opinion of your "child" in the opinion of me or any other son.
