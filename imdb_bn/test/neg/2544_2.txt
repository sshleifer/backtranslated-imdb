This disaster flick is a remake of the 1973 film of the same title, based on the novel Saok Komatsu. Japan is the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcano) as well as the right side of the plate tectonics, whose transfer will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (Japanese words for tides itself). Naturally, it creates natural trends for a catastrophe image, which has a field day with the Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently The Day Effect Culture, which explains how to become a global warming catalyst for natural disasters. But <br/> <br /> <br /> I would say this: All the Japanese drowning films are already mentioned, look like a classic. This disaster film is a disaster, and it's a bigger one. The movie is not busy every 10-15 minutes to look at my watch and it seems longer than runtime. <br /> <br /> Special effects are beautiful to look at. From the satellite-style outer space picture, the lively entertainment of every imaginable natural disaster that can hit the rising sun's land, the impact of the star of the show. However, superb computer generator graphics themselves can not be platable to a movie, only a very good thing that is just like a player. <br /> <br /> If you have seen a trailer where you are stimulated by the effects and chaos and greatness of the particular scene, then yes, actually that's just the scenes. There is no description, and everything is seen in the mode like God, from far away. Things will happen just like the screen, try nary to try and deeply try to look at deeper problems. It's like jumping on buildings like Godzilla, and it's not like losing any harm or life to human lives through a single law. Maybe the word of the word of Meribi has been shown to us! A populated country like Japan does not suffer disasters after the catastrophism with very few deadly genocide, when filmmakers do not express greatness on this epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to make romance in movies, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the film, but each of them has real features, or a lack of humanity, and frail geomagy, without expression, without emotion, and of course very harsh and unbelievable. The Heroes Generic Control Room stops giving statements, instructions, and form policies, and it responds to events like a computer game, all standing with a button push. These are letters that you do not mind. <br /> <br /> If I can use Tomorrow as a comparison, there is a terrific effect, but at least one microscope can see the entire disaster from the perspective of different people. And the order of growing action, bigger than big calamities and smaller with the wins of the human soul, which makes it relatively compulsory. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Japan sinking, this film should be shrunk and one of the tanks and hopefully small and quick deaths are made to create better things in the local staff office.
