Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen It is very interestingly illustrated, this is not a supposed "real half-letter" or even a focus, it is more about the creation of a Hollywood movie. There is no cinematic significance, and if I can take about 1 1/2 hours back then I used to spend watching this movie, I felt better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a topical film, just like a genuine Hollywood production. However, they go into the description of the story, and it is very f *** ing terribly pictured. It sounds like it should be taken in "Blair Witch Project", since they do not make you fools, because they think you're called 'real camera footage'. <br /> <br /> The worst movie. Have ever seen . . Positively it has a semi-horrible scene and half-colored scenes are not very bad. Do not hire
