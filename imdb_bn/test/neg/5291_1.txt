Director Lewis Shobarbruin will not be allowed to step in the film set when the cinema is in the universe trial. It seemed as if it was a feeling that anyone who spent the two decades in the editing room to launch a career in LDS, could be completely isolated without any idea of ​​panning or dramatic staging, but the film proves to be a proof. <br /> <br /> As it's bad, it's so fascinating. From the opening scene, where a nurse is wearing a dress that is suitable for a Polish film only, and Mexicans have skits on different shows, it is forced to see how far it can be to the viewer. The answer is not too far, like the next scene we are going to a funeral porter, where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a sexy off-the-shoulder black dress defeated by the bereavement. <br /> <br /> The aggression is not the only fault of the costuming film. Dialog is a treatment for bad writing connoisseurs. "You turned into my tears of wine," a sample gem. The actress deserves the Oscars to give it directly with one face. <br /> <br /> The director also strengthens any Pigeon scene, which is probably the score of the Schmidtzest soundtrack, which is sometimes embarrassed in the dialogue scenes. rocknroll in groovebox wannabe transitional scene <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and the story bit is doled out as with a broken ladle. <br /> <br /> Do not forget this, though a "horror" film. Our characters have found themselves in a jungle where Dr. Chopper and his two "frightening" Henchovan have been hidden, who see something similar to Frankencryre, but they look similar to fake blood Valley girls under their superconscious chag. I'm really sticking to the 8-year-olds of Halloween. <br /> <br /> We found the designer's harmonious handmade work that was worn by Valley Prakash. Often, in a pseudo-Victorian polyubstand smoke, his friend wore a knapsack shoe that was often fashionable at the lower hip corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Chopper has made a big fashion statement, although its big black hare looks like a lost crossover cowboy in the jungle, GPPID looks like a black S & M skin looking at the toes from the head <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Check it out all the way. There are many side-splitting and belberbed dialogs (like valuable "elephant cemetery" scenes or Ginsberg's "intellectual" conversation). To be fair, cinematography before the camera, and to do something from a scrap hip of actor clichés and inertia (with wild extreme results) struggle. If you are really caught by one of their intelligent visual villains, then 99 stores can not stop the set with the weapons in the store, that's really stupid or vaguely frustrating.
