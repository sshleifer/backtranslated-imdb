First of all tell me, since the bloodshed, you did not enjoy the movie Van Dam, then you probably would not like this movie. Most of these films can not have the best plot or the best actors, but they enjoy the kind of films they have. The movie is much better than any other film (Segal and Dolf), and is planning to skip the last few years. Van Damme is good for movies, the movie is only valuable for fans of Van Dam. It's not as good as death awakening (which I recommend to Van Dam, to someone) or to hell, but in my opinion it's worth watching. It has to remember the same kind as it runs somewhere. Good fun stuff!
