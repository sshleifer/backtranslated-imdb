It's hard to imagine how the Dan Brown novelist "Angels and Demons" involved in this film version may be mad. Why the failure of the film is ten reasons? Due to incognito, if you do not see the movie already, do not read it. <br /> <br /> (1) There was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vito Vera in this film. Even worse, there was no chemistry between two leading actors. <br /> <br /> (2) The exciting locations of Rome described in the novel were not realized in the film. I am aware that the difficulties in the filming of the positions of director Ron Howard. But Rome's The History Channel has high imagery paintings in Rome rather than this film, which is presented in the film of the eternal stock film footage than this film. The great art works described in the novel are briefly illustrated in the film. The "Baroque" sculpture of the "Execution of St. Teresa" was only briefly illuminated and relief was not visible to the West Pennant in Vatican Square. <br /> <br /> (3) The most stupid choice film maker showed the Dead Pope screenplay, which is actually similar to the second favorite John Paul II. In the novel, the Pope is clearly fictional and does not match any real Pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, CERN director, Maximilian Kohlaar, was <br/> <br /> (5) A lot of events occurred when the lines of dialogue due to external background noise Was inefficient. <br /> <br /> (6) The moment was when the face of the letters was not visible in the shadows and cheeroscuro films. This technique worked in the film "The Godfather", but Ron Howard is not a Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The college's cardinals were an election candidate for the Southern Drill. The city was home to more than a farm in Texas, compared to the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) Camerlengo and the important relationship of the dead Pope have not been defined in the film. This relationship was the center of science versus the theme of religion and the relevance of Elumanati for the plot against the Church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, Hassasin's character was the unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of the assassin character was a cardboard cutout villain. <br /> <br /> (10) Completely, filmmakers do not believe in the work of successful novels. In the novel <br /> <br />, Langdon creates an impossible collapse from the sky. Tiber River. In the movie of Ron Howard, it was the film that landed on Tuber.
