It starts interesting, someone has oil ropes beside someone's oil beside the carnival, and a neon "Jesus stores" sign in front of the street in front of the street, just in a small area ... now impossible, if it's pretty fantastic ... and then We go to the movies that seem impossible in a new movie correctly. Of course, it has acted as the 1979 thriller Carroll Kelly actress The Babysitter Jill Johnson .... Now Jill has some chick who has gone up to her cellphone, so her evil father is punishing her by stopping her work, the audience can probably identify with this movie goal That's something For the Milkakis family, Babita was taken to his grandfather's house in a central lake somewhere in the middle. Before the jill came, the kids have already torn their bed, and the owner is still there, huh, can not he have a child? Of course, despite the distant position, Jill's friends pop a pop, with whom she apparently had problems like "boyfriend's theft" or something else. However, of course, the alarm of the house is closed for any reason, and after that someone calls from the beginning, anyone who wants to kill him. Of course, Jail calls the police and there is no threat to her life, they blow her away, but if she can do something for her then ask her to call her. Look at the scene with Jill, that looks like something like "Burning Man" festival in his friends' high school Bonfire / Pepi rally or whatever it seems to be ?? !! ?? There are all kinds of folly with cool cat chests, which are popping up here and there, one of the most exhausting "horror movie" clich√©s. I admit that I dozed off at some time during this time, and I miss something? Hard to say, or care, really. This is a movie that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of "MTVille Horror", "House of Max" or "The Fog" were bad. However, from reading online reviews, it seems like someone who was most scared by 12 year old girls and I can only guess that "it made me my pants". Well, one might expect that it will end the Hollywood remix of Humor which is not right at the beginning, but do not bet on it. 10 out of 2 and I'm being too generous.
