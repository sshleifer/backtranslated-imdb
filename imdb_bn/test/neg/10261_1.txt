Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And all the blood and gore that was "Demons" was a good movie and it was not always afraid at all. My brother said that this movie was bad but because the first film was very good I had to give it a chance. When the movie was over, I realized why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus of this movie was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is not a movie and music soundtrack is the most important thing. And I found that it was released four successive sequences after this movie, I have not seen any of them, but they can be such a horror, I do not have any plans to see them, but I might see them a little bit.
