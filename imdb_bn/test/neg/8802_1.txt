This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who could be the "mysterious" location of Disney's Snow White, was smiling through the whole movie. My first warning was at $ 5.50 in Wal-Mart. But I really got some good movies in that bine, so I can not blame for this danger. The second warning was that when the cashier uploaded the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again I have ignored the cheap things. This film is not something that is looking good to look at, and it's certainly not something that enjoys bad movies sometimes. You need background noise when you're doing something like playing cards with some friends, then get this, but if you actually want to see something not even bothered to see it. There was a lot of good actors because it was really frustrating. I felt like I was seeing the villain's chocolate version.
