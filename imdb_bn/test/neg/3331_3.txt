To see if the price is re-opened, this extremely low budget giant flick centers near a group of mine surveyors are looking for a abandoned gold mine. They seem trapped after being trapped in a cave and knocking them off one at a time that they are a curious, thin animal mercy. I saw most of the words 'frustrating'. The scripts and the terrible, stop-motion giant effects were strange and since most of the film was played in underground light, the sets looked firmly like a logical nightmare. However, for any reason it is said that the film has failed due to lack of effort, but due to the lack of budget, experience and / or creative inspiration. The whole thing came that it was like the first film made by college college or amateur, I have a certain amount of fondness for films that completely miss the mark. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm trying to get it a B. and for a D-real result, I see some low budget monster is not as bad as a movie, but it's not valuable until you're free to spend a lot of time. In my hand, I voted for it 4.
