This signal is quite terrible to be honest. I am a fan of Kung-Fu movies and this is the worst I have ever seen. Bride with White Hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment. BWHH1 was brilliant in some ways with a unique weird bad guy. <br /> <br /> Couple plays a small role in this movie from the first movie. Instead of trying to take revenge on their fallen tribe, the film revolves around a bunch of discouraged characters. But there is no opposition in this movie so revenge muted. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is Kung Fu or there is a lack. They were literally fighting a street style knife. Eventually the character refused to fight because there was lack of danceography.
