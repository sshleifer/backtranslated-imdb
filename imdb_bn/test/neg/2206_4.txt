This was a simple effort of a movie, although it grew like a TV pilot. Someone may think it's inappropriate, but it seems like someone saw "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance". And thought, "Hey, I could do that too." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, on television. The leading lady (her name, can not remember sorry) was very reasonable, but you think Julia Styles (she was "right in the last dance", right?) Because she really "white girl" mode.
