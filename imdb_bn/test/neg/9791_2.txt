July's role was her last movie. Apparently I did not see all his movies, but Julius Harris was in a very good movie and I think he was the best of "Live and Le Mite" where he played in T. Hee and which was full of reference to Voodoo, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought Live and LeD were a great movie because it was some atmosphere and mystery, in contrast to most movies of 2007. Julius Harris is her Voodoo person with Sharoncan Heads! He has a great style for mysteries and secrets, and his part in this movie is excellent. Sadly, the rest of the movie is comedy. Spinner: Three kids, who leave the little Russes cast, are killed by the hoodlums around them, it looks like they have come out of the Fame cast! Or as a dancer in Dick Clark's American bandstand. In other words, these kids give another level of loading bidgate. Julius Harris goes to the chicken-finale home, cuts the heads of three children (and does not notice) and then they take them to their condominium unit where there is a monster of hot liquids. Three heads get tossed along with some herbs, spices, and voodoo items. At some time Mr. Harriss's table has ugly little heads and he has spread their blood, and they bring life to talk! They can fly, joke, turn their eyes and take correct revenge from the Evil Door. They look pretty funny flying around pretty much, but the effect is not bad. For some reason, one of the kids always has a switch blade in her mouth, and she uses it to cut the holes between the human sliver and tire. This movie is weird and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this film and he watched Fat more than Rossi O'Donnell and Meg plays the leader of a gang gang member. Weird movie
