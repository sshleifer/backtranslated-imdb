I once saw the bits and pieces on the TV, and when a friend was recommended, I started looking for it though it was not near any place. I finally kept it in an old shop, and could not wait to see it ... Oh, I saw it a few years ago and could really enjoy it. I was surprised that this movie was only 80 or more minutes long, and I think this plot and story is so poor. The trawler really thinks both trailers and movie views are good: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his new pedestrian lab, Yellow with his father on a boat during a storm in a boat. Davison). Together, they managed to survive in the desert and wait to be found and recovered. Yet, what is not mentioned is that everything is reduced and the plot of the plot spreads very quickly. Angus and Sarah have an interest in possible love, but they are not seen together for more than an hour. Yellow is a naughty dog ​​parents who are reluctant to keep, but in a few days, he was greatly appreciated for joining the boat trips. Mother's view (Mummy Rogers) refers to something unusual as death like a little boy (Joel Palmer) is nowhere to go. At any time, we have learned that 9 days have passed on the island, then suddenly it is 14 years, then 19th. A forest among all creatures can be exposed in the wild, only 1 kind - a wolf - their attack. Instead of having the same type of creature, there can be no other problem - perhaps the same - twice the strike? Angus discovers fruits and roots on how to prepare some food, and when they throw a sticky mouse. If he knew so much about the survival skills, then why was not it much more visible? One thing that makes me empty is that the dog did not have too many parts. When he was rescued, and the dog went behind the island, no scene was seen that he survived without any human help. I wished I was more open for this while watching it, but I enjoyed some of this. The performance was good, and the score was enjoyable. Although, I wondered to myself why the father was so old to his family, and why he and he would share the name of the main search and rescue guardian. This is a good movie for kids, but the character is 14 years old, but more than 10 people will not be interested in it.
