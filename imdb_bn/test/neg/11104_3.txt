It's all my fault. They all told me that I would have to avoid this movie because I had a huge fan of the old TV series. They were right. The production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "do not see it now") are not that bad as Julie Chris, the whole film shows shiny and self-credibility, clearly without any reason. I feel like comparing between CarloP "Mummy" and "Mummy Returns 2000". In fact, more than the new Mummy movies in the Balfour 2000 series. But then, scripting is not terrible, and sometimes the movie is full of unknown jokes (the first scene of the tomb is simple), cats are clearly cast when they are going to jump (landing with their backpack first). Belforgers do not go on like the statues on the wheels, impressive or scary, and psychological dramas that were published in the old TV series, when the heroine knew that she had completely ignored a villain. This movie is so harmful (money wasted, lost actors, damaged blueprints) It hurts. This is the Mummy-Rip in the lower part, which is good for some laughs, but it does not have any relation with the Greek classics (this film also has a small role in the graveyard).
