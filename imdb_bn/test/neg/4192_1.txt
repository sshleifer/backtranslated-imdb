This is the worst movie I've ever seen, as well, the worst that I would probably see. There is no need to republish what I have said before, just predict ... <br /> <br /> This is not one of the bad movies you want to see because you want to see it's fun, it's just plain bid badge Buddy Bud. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is equivalent to keeping "pet rock" as your friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it's not. At least you know what you got with a pet rock. The lion's gate completely deceives this bombardment ... no ... it's a disaster. After seeing this picture, you caught her hand for the brutality of George W. Bush's film ... yes it's her stupid <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless you absolutely want to see the worst movie all the time. Perhaps this is how the lion's gate explains how to cut pieces into pieces and give some money.
