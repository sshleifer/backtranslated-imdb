I can just illustrate how this picture is: <br /> <br /> "How can we cut our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a picture that was wildly successful and made a signal from it! <br />" Perfect! We will get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and they only want 10% of the main salary of the car. We will save millions of people and stand in huge profits, no one wants to see the second season sigel that it is a popular actor that has become popular in the first place! As an executive we still believe that a movie was popular based on name and story, not the actors who made it in the first place! "<br /> <br />" Bright! Let's keep a huge budget and we can get the cheapest actors to find! "<br /> <br /> And really, the son of the mask can also be described in this way, just a normal B-grade movie that wants to suck life <br /> <br /> <br /> If The movie does not have anything to do with masks, or masks, but it will be a beautiful children's cinema, it's a huge error and terrible acting for everything, this will really appeal to kids. This is a good sign that really screams "like me" But only those 8 and young people will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Notable mention of this film is only one, he is definitely trying to make the material, playing the great father, but the script is so poor, only after seeing this thing I used to have drinks and claims the character of this person, which is the most enjoyable character and actually seen this movie. The only reason for the adult adult is that it was very bad, and I really liked it because of the true mask. Instead, we got reduced to fart jokes and toilets humor. <br /> <br /> The book of this book is so much, I would not be bothered to mention here. It is so clear that Disney will definitely be green with jealousy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, going to the DVD within three months of its appearance. Sham on the studio for smearing a decent film again with a terrific sequel. Fools and dumbera nothing to learn?
