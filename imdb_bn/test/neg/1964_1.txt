Jack Frost 2 is a horrible, terrible, sadly unfortunate excuse for a sequel of a great movie. Originally, there was a low-budget comedy horror movie about the killings, which became a snowball after the accident with some toxic wastes. And the snowman went around killing humans, and avoided blow dryers like plague. This, though, was a lot of crying from the original quality. It seems that this was a low budget, because even after an hour I did not see the snowman in this picture. If she shakes a bit, she always gets a Chess voice-over and cold little whisper in the form of Isis cubes, allowing her to give an animation. Even for a fan of bad movies, no confidence is frustrating.
