This movie reminds me of old B movies, but not well. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the scene, I think these are going to be a sprinkle among the first SF movies. Terrible acting, plastic props and visions gave me that impression of visual effects. <br /> <br /> But not, that the movie is really bad. The story is a complete nonsense, effect is below the level of a TV production; Even editing is a mess. <br /> <br /> The only theater that kept me was that I wanted to finish the story, even though I was sure it was going to be silly (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend your time and money.
