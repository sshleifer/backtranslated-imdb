After the violence of the English people, in the violence of violence. Showing Moses as a murderer Those who believe in the Old Testament, they will sit there and shake their heads. I'm not always a religious person. But I felt that the writers of this movie were trying to bring us back all against Allah and the Jews. When Moses lifted up the stone and threw it out to slaughter it for the first time. I wanted the writer's stone. At this day and age I can not believe that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) will try to display such garbage. We do not have enough problems in this world?
