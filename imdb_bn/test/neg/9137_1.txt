Director Godfrey Regio must be the very discussed and motivated people for this project. Regio's message is so frustrating and transformed in the previous two Kasti films, that has become frustrating. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, ridiculous heads, etc., mix without purpose. The inactive image parade is the most generic stock from Gatty Image et al, and the heavily transferred digital manipulation is the fantasticest amateur in worst way Of course anyone involved (Steven Soderberg, executive producer?) Had a very bad idea that almost all frames applied to a solar filter? Crude looping, layering, and image distortion reminds a new Photoshop class. And to make matters even worse, computer animation sequences are more uninterrupted than the 1980's Wall Street pie-chart. It simply will not say that the advanced shoemaker art has accumulated this film, but fewer attempts at this direction may be considered as visible favors for accompanying music. I think the score of Philip Glass would certainly satisfy his fans. Rather than a fundamentalist exit, rather than the good holes contributed by the YO Mommy, the glass does well to correct it. If you decide to watch this movie, then the brief opening sequence will draw your attention. After 89 minutes you can get acquainted with Detroit's once great but long-abandoned central central railway strain, but you remember this image of the 20th Century damage when you press the EXIT sign / stop button, etc. You have been warned.
