When traveling on a train, a woman (Stefan Exchiefar) went out of the train in the middle of the night and accidentally left the station. Soon he found that a strange solo pinyman (Jim Van der Woud) who did not speak his language was the only person in that region and it was the last train of that track. The man sits in his house and they develop an abnormal silent relationship among them. <br /> <br /> "D isolvecture" is an extra drug story, which does not go anywhere else. I like the off-Hollywood movie, but this story is very irrational and there is no message at all. The sexual activity between two lead characters is funny but very repetitive in a moment. I saw this old VHS movie and the picture is too dark; I do not know if the image will be good quality in the DVD. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem de Linhaha" ("Man of the Line")
