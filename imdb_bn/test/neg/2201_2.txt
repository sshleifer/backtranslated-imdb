SPILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not go to high tech movies which can be 100% correct for everything related to computers. But anyway, even I have a computer that is supposed to trust the user: <br /> <br /> 1) A professional with a computer, a professional with special data <br /> 2) 1.44 in the floppy <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was very nice, but we can not believe that any of his friends, neighbors, extended family or co-workers could not recognize him. Even the unmarried family had a family that could turn them around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The storyline fueled that. Characterization was awful, the plot is completely ineligible, and if you do not meet it, do not bother.
