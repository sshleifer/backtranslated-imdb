Well I had the opportunity to see this photo another day. I never saw the trailer, so do not expect ... but the first 10 minutes I discovered that this movie is my worst, which I never saw bad. <Br /> <br /> I hope I can rate this rating 0. The first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as the party got the scene I just wanted to write a coma. It was really done badly. Actors did not have any direction, there was no real story, I have read some reviews that are good for entertaining 90 minutes of your child etc. ... but why do we publish children in such films? ? It got poor humor, weird and strange comedy, and focused on poor special effects to meet 80% of the time. After the bombing of this photo some people in Hollywood will come out on the streets. <br /> <br /> How can 39 people give this movie 10? I mean, this movie gives 10 people. There are some mental problems and the film works for the company. This film should be average of 1.5 / 10 instead of 2.3 / 10, because it has got 10 places. Really sad
