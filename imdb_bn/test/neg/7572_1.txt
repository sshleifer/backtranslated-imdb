And unrealistic, top performers, you can enjoy this garbage flick. Apparently the atom bombs change lives in one or two days (or wake them up, according to other viewers). Or so it seems. And visually large nuclear explosions on the coast of Spain can not question any questions. It seems to be thinking that the plot can not be understood in any way (why the evil shock doll will attack the lighthouse?), So the nuke does not stop due to any reason. <br /> All right, I'm getting it, and the "monster" kindergarten is a great thing to build socks, you really can stand for it. But once the complete lack of Gore does not help to reduce the giant attacks in the "magnificence" of all the naked rock-bottom budgets. <br /> <br /> I doubt you'll be able to see it though, stay away from the well well.
