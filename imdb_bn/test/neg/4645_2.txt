I can only believe that the film's writers, directors and producers have not even heard of Mr Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's impressive characteristic features are transformed into wooden sticks, all historians are ignored or discarded, the reality of the book has been changed to include more appropriate feelings for a cartoon. And why is an Egyptian speaking Hanchen Spanish? Geis, no TV can be made to miniviriya movie! Is there any input from Wilbur Smith making this film? I can not believe that he is. Awesome, horror movie If you read both books or both, your money or money will not see this meaning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
