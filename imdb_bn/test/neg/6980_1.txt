I give this movie only a chance because it was very good reviews. After watching the trailer I thought - what a weird movie is full of clich√©s. But I decided to give it a shot because the trailer does not often depict the movie very well. What is the waste ... The movie is worse than the trailer and after 2 hours of watching it, I could not remember the single line which lets me laugh. The most interesting parts of the movie were the CSI parody, but it is also quite good. I can not relate to any characters and hope they will not be together, because I found them totally stupid. The plot is highly anticipated and unintentional. The unconscious comedy for those who are still high school or mentally think that way.
