After the 1930s jazz guitarist, after hearing his star for a while, while managing this little documentary about the life of Emmit Roy (Shan Pen), Woody Allen (who was initially unable to accept), faded. Pen illustrates a complex and somewhat neurotic person (not like Allen, which probably explains why Woody will be attracted to this project), who can not maintain the relationship and watching Twin Touch (in addition to playing guitar) dumped rats and watching the train. <br /> <br /> The adjustment of the story is not a great deal. It is described in a sense by modern day jazz "experts" (in which Allen himself) by a series, who discusses various theories and explanations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a great inconsistent story of a fictional person's life, which seems to have given a fairly interesting lifestyle by his creators, perhaps it should have done a good job with it. <br /> <br /> Fans of jazz fans and Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. For me? I can give it the best 3/10.
