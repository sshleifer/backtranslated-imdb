This film spends a lot of time during the campaign against marijuana. However, plots and visuals are so crazy that it is more like a poster-child for LSD. <br /> <br /> Plot: As Michael's heroic struggle, he fought against his drug addiction, when he was humiliated. Like Winnie the Pooh and Dad Smarf Yes, yes, there is a good message, but the authors have rather adopted the idea of ​​PSA and tried to extend it to 30. Minutes There is a song sequence in it, where you have been told that there is a million, "no!" Reasonable way to say For example, "I can not smoke the pot, I have homework! <br /> <br /> <br /> The author does not have the mind to do with the character they have taken in the royalty-release. We see all of them need to be hidden from the human character, but we were not able to see them in five minutes. Soon they started conversing with human cast and this thing was a bit disturbing. It is not the only narcotics, but it is her younger sister who talks with her teddy bear (Poo, by way of way). There are some more dread ghosts floating around because you know, Pushers do not take children's drugs. She is very hesitant - she's Michael's addiction It can be symbolic and is not supposed to be seen by other people, he goes to Latters and haunts a little coriander to get her into drugs. So I think she ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole plot finally ended in some crazy sequence, which would be seen on Saturday morning as a carnival, a theme park from Lukka Hell, where several cartoon characters hit him and Ignore stuff For example, Miss Piggy ate him in sandwiches and threw him out. If the writer is not high during this writing, they should recommend that they try higher because they can not be crazy over this. Of course, the film ignores that Michael has been elevated for two years, so why is he more afraid than the tripping order? <br /> <br /> I understand that I am totally crushing this film, but I actually saw it again because I had trouble tracking it in Ibbe because it was a bad reputation for being a BD cartoon. Strange humor level is bright. Take this view for example - Michael's parents are rooting through the fridge for a beer. He is missing many of them and his wife mentioned it. Ever since her mother says, "Do not worry, you probably see football in the last night." Although we are probably drinking Michael Beat beer (with pot and crack), then we can read more and realize - Hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependency as long as you're old - up! The scenes of this scene are worth the price tag of this movie. Oh yeah, and you hear Simon Chipmu that "Marizana".
