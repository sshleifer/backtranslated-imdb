I saw this movie in a show that shows bad b-movies and tries to buy them. It was originally a long trailer, but you really got a good idea about what the movie was like. After watching the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in the opposite way. It is not entertained in any sense of the word. The film is going for two (or I say four) and it is not the number of deaths, it is women. They are very hot and nude and Mrs. Lovell can be a legitimate actress, but in a movie where T and A and corny dialogues are not emphasized. It's not even a horror movie or scary, unless you're talking about the actors trying to do the job. Production is unfortunate, bad acting and writing is the worst. What was the point of making this movie? People scared? "Texas Censo genocide" to be robbed? Try and be funny? Women show breast? Fake hand and foot with some people's head in the upside-down props? Does a character just say "Snow" over the word? Despite not having true violence, there is not enough nudity to cover the truth, there is no real plot? Which movie will never be able to create a signal, have you seen or seen? I made a mistake in choosing this movie, do not make this mistake. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
