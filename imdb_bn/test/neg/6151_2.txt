I saw this picture while coming out for the first time in the movie. We were waiting for Mark Hamill to restart his career, but we expressed the hope that we would not be disturbed. About half an hour later, many people went away - I would like to have mine too. The fundamental foundations seem to be okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and oppressive, and through half-way runs out. It is totally unreasonable, and a movie that you do not want to pay to see. If you are really annoyed and have it on TV, it will help you to kill within a few hours (or help you stop!). 2/10
