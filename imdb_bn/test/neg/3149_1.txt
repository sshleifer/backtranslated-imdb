Barney is a fool dinosaur who (unfortunately) has not been extinct with other dinosaurs a long time ago. Instead he is singing silly songs and stupid morality about 100% of useless and / or extremely dangerous lives of life: "Strangers are your friends, whom you still do not drink!" Why I said that he is evil? Well, on YouTube, there is a video of Barney songs about a toy ball. When it is played behind, it comes as "we" can envy you all! Do not believe me See it for yourself! I read one more reading that they are now reading the folklore and fairy tale of the PC. Now that stupid with the capital! I really mean that! However, I do not recommend your kids to show this dirty because the strangers are your friend (as told earlier), there is no reason to be sad and if you are sad then eating junk food, being a person is forbidden, Magic can solve all your problems and other ridiculous crap heaps.
