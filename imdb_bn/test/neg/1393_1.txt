I absolutely love the comedy stand up. I love listening to the stage up stand up to the raw, they are appealing to the audience of various life experiences of their colleagues, or they were worried or saw that they were just thinking so **** they are stupid to share with anyone. <br/> <br /> <br /> There was a study of a person who was involved with a personality that everyone could be related to everyone (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or they were so brave that you could not help But they can laugh with them, smile (Richard Prior). Then, there were thought-provoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite being pretending to be Loon, was the smartest person sitting in the house, who appealed to people to revisit the sights of traveling, and realized how drunk things were, and how easy it was to change May Now, it looks like "Menacea of ​​Mindia", which I agree with most commentators here, is the central panic solution to the loss of the comedy "Chapel show", but it does. Carlos Mencia is making stand-up bits for his audience, often in popular topics, half of the time shows mostly on racism and ethnicity. She tries to be three of the top three studs up. He is a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos, who, despite the stereotypes, makes your run-of-the-mill normal guy only. Then he tries to laugh at others, he speaks of racist or opinion-makers only with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to studio audiences and viewers, telling them that this will help them see their outlook. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mensia always says that he sees that people can not see, yet what he is actually doing is not only the racist stereotypes being proclaimed and have already got fun about death, but he stubbornly encourages people to listen to them. And he does a job that helps keep them around: smile <br /> <br /> The promotion of stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet the easiest way to laugh in stand-up. Carlos Mensia thinks that the best comedians are with me in a good company, they will not have to take shelter. They are talking publicly, and encourages like Maseier, rather than laughing at you proudly. Since he creates more skits or "real-life" situations, which is annoying with racism or his use, he tells us instead of asking us to laugh and actually present these foolish people as true. It's extreme <br /> <br /> Insult to those who see it in their show. Mensia does not give us comedy and we want to digest it and accept it from what we want (something that I hate as much as I hate, the best quality of "chapel show") and how it should react to us. --- That, in his opinion, put a stupid face and "de de dee!" It is to say that this show is properly named. This is actually a show about "Mensychic Mind". It's nothing more than Mensia's mind, through and through, and, for example, fools entertainment. The show is designed to send life lessons to the stereototypes, for the 14-24-year-old live-in life of its original audience, but the racist dispute is good in Carlos Mensia and it should be right for you!
