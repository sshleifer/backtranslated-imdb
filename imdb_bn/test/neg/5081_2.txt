The people who told me, "This film is good" - the litter on them! This movie is for viewers who do not have any problem seeing everything {especially when it is hard boys, guns, chasing and all about the hist ...} I compare the movie "Inside Man" {decrease at the same time}. I'm copying and pasting movies. And I'm unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of such movies much more ... if you want to see such a movie then I would recommend that you "Lucky Number Slevin" I do not mean, I just dislike this movie {weak actors, weak script, weak move}. Perhaps someone else would love it. Many people-many tastes How is "rice" for me durable!
