Alas, another constraint movie, which was one hour long. Trustworthy performance, but the script was where to go and there was no hurry to get there. The first is the story of which we are given a related string in the story. Will Randall and his wife do the script center? Randall and Fischer? How about Fisher and Thomas? In the end, a true story never develops, and characters are artificially raised together on behalf of a third party. Randall explains, Randall explains Fischer. Finally, after a long time you will learn something about script meetings. There was no doubt at the end of three and no one could decide. The end result? All three are used, one, after, after another. You can hang 100th yawn in the past, you can take them out. Despite a clear attempt to earn points with the dedication to the Coast Guard, it must be washed out on the first day.
