I saw five or six episodes about this stupid show, and most of them were forced to see me. And I did not like the episode. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving a great exhibition like Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create such stupid shows? My problem is not with Dan, but for Amy, this show is with the nominees, were they drunk or the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for Emmay, but it is better than Zoey 101 The creator of this show will be ashamed of the existence of this show, hopefully who will affect your pregnancy, or hopefully it will still be canceled.
