First of all, I do not understand how some people enjoyed this movie. It's the worst thing I ever seen. Even the actor seems disturbed ... and I think it's all! However, I would like to congratulate my first credit creator - that team really feels a better future. That's why I recommend opening big studio's opening credits and one or two special effects sequences (if they look outside of this movie, it looks like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Good luck (or judgment) next time for this producer, this ... this "thing!"
