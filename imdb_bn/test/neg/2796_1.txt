Now, I'm going to do this without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies on other holidays, and we grew up in this, 'very terrible inside'. It looked cool, so we hired it along the Kung Fu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Oh ... just ... wow. <br /> <br /> To start, the movie was awesome. Now, box art, opening scene, and music were well-received, but the film itself is terrific. The actress does not see anything like sub-par (Shan, Lead, no emotion and / or effort of her character), looks like a terrific cover (false advertising, perhaps?), And camera shots and angles were a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a wrestling fan. I know the bad camera angle. And honestly, it's okay with Jigli and Putty Tong. It's so bad that it amuses me It makes me smile So, however, this movie took place as a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> To be fair, what to do and what to do in movies, especially slashher genre. I recommend that you simply look for a better idea of ​​how to avoid these.
