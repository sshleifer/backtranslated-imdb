When the movie started, I felt that it was going to be something special. Acting and camera work was undoubtedly good. I like the characters and may empathize with them. The film had a good environment and there was a hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, because the film is going on, the plot can never be seen and it becomes visible in the scene. I did not understand the connection between the story I used to see that sometimes each other played in the role of reference in the ship. Without that connection, I was left with just a few unmarkmarkable short stories. <br /> <br /> I'm so surprised at the ears so well
