I can think of one reason for the release of this movie. Guy Pearce's closest fame is off the capital market. There is no qualification in this movie and trashes Iral Flin's memory inappropriately. The face of homosexuality was pure speculation. The ban shown for this movie Flin is clear. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Terrible and embarrassing Very frustrating. Do not waste your time in this trash trash. If you want to know about these subtle actors or read his autobiography then see my evil miserable ways. This is not the way of movie
