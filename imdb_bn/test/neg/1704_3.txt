In this picture, it has been done correctly, so there are so many potential. Parody movies are always fun, and people like them because they are light-hearted, stupid and silly but funny. This picture was fun in some parts, but it was much more fun. Acting was right from all actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seems an empty empty, and my short title says it all about the effect. The correct movie screens have not been used for this movie ... the backgrounds were added which looked just terrible afterwards. No wonder this picture went straight to the DVD lol. It's not a total loss, it's fun and will give you a good smile (it's not most of the time with it).
