KnightsCrump is a TV movie so it's pretty awesome to be especially tied to it as a supposed horror film. The young girl was frustrated by a young girl dreaming to arrive in a small town a year ago. When he was surprised that everyone in the city looks exactly like a murderer. When the people of the city are in awe of dreams, they reveal the exact description of the killer and the killer, because the police feel completely wrong. They seem feared to find out, before the murderers (both of them) have reached the truth, they have begun to lose a plan to get rid of him. At this moment, perhaps you are asleep and why the creators of the film's dream sequences have full throttle 'made mistakes' machines.
