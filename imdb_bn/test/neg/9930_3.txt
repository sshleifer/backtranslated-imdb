This picture tries, but eventually it was a waste of talent. It tries to be difficult "sexy." I'll find Allen Barkin and Pata Wilson (who will find something without his talent TV "Le Fame Nikita"). I'm not taking down the work of such actresses. I could not find Mrs Wilson's so-called information. There is no real passion for the uninterrupted scene with Mrs. Barquin, though I know that Thespians have tried very hard to work on this scene. Wilson's sexually transmitted sexual acts do not touch our heart (which is ultimately not worth it without ending it), and the plot of plot also did not do it. Perhaps it was either script or perhaps direction, but I did not feel for anyone in this film, and without this feeling, a movie does not work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbians then there are at least two movies on both sides of the spectrum: 1.) The gland pleasure of the "bound" which works well in Noor's settings; And 2.) The more honest, and sensitive story of homosexuals growing in Hell's kitchen is "Above all". In the mid-90's, it is a definite defined indie that, with feeling, handles problems of upcoming age, not compulsory sex. Without a few things "Mercy" would be a better hire than ever.
