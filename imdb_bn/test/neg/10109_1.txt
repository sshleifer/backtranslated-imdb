Well, I'll start like this: I like horror-movie, even the worst plot or destruction of the terrible acting experience, until a particular hole and mystery are present. Secondly; This is the worst movie of all time. It even beats average guns, and attacks the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay tribute to it. However, the strange humor was only funny until the movie has passed half, after which all of the points were so sad. My great surprise, where the reviews are somewhat divided; And those who rate this piece of c movie poisoning up to 7 and up; I know you are working! Good one !! Hahaha! As there is no reason in the world, and we have only a bit of the same concept of quality; You can not be for real. <br /> <br /> Everything mentioned above has already been pretty good, so I will release it. <br /> <br /> Small spirited alert <br /> <br /> The scene where the Calcutta Rubber Masks drop the woman behind the dog-kennel for ten minutes, so the fearsome music score and mind blowing between the two, It really is for me
