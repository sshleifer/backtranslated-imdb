This is probably one of my worst movies which was unpleasant to see throughout my life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I saw this photo of 3 friends and we agree to stop it 30 minutes before the end. The character of Ben Kingsley is not only simple but stupid. It's her wonder why her talent will involve an actor. Tea Leoni impresses Hilary Clinton across a whole across a basket that depicts a very cold and unwilling female lead who has all the favorite qualities of a basket handle. Throw in a vague and undefined sub-plot and a terrific cringe worthy montage, and you end up with 93 minutes waste (60 case cases). Avoid this film at all costs!
