Last night I saw this movie, and after reading all the reviews I hope to have a good, emotional sports film. I got something clich√©d and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. The game got hurt long before I saw the All-Star. I think maybe they might wait for him, until he is "big one" before the game ends, but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> The parental relationship was very relaxed, with a lively dad's father (I would say McGrath impressed me), and the boy who wants to stay and help her (sick?) mother. <br /> <br /> I especially like random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the film for 5 minutes, and there were only football players to do some work outside the field. I thought "OK, how does this plot work again?" Maybe I miss the point, "Well they play football in a city that loves, so girls throw them on their feet". <br /> <br /> There were some good aspects of sports work, but most of it ran so! I think the first game is longer than the full playoffs montage! And I was not so sure about the continuation of the rolling down watch in the final game. <br /> <br /> I think I saw this movie win ESPY for the best sports movies, if it is only released. Actually, I found it a boring movie that covered the pigskin with illness. For a good football film, remember Titans.
