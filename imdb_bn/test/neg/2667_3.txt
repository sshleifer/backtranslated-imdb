All right, exactly what all this means ??? Halloween 6 (All right, right?), Without any doubt, the most convincing movie of the series (and what I heard from it, "Producer cut" does not seem to make things look like this) Less than the "official" release Bimling). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - It just does not have any senses! Do not tell me that Michael started "engineer" from the beginning to being evil and to kill and destroy, and Bla Bla Bla. They turned Michael to Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just like he was an excuse to keep him in another movie). It was too much. <br /> <br /> This is another case that the makers of the movie are trying to "be very smart" by coming up with a new edge that will threaten us and affect everyone. Bad steps, guys We are not looking for an explanation of why Michael was killed, so please try and do not feed us in this shit. Show me Michael and kill a bunch of people. Let me show Lumys tried to stop him and always, just getting smaller. Do not waste (what happened) to Donald Plansense's last performance (which is most confusing as possible) by creating something "made from Michael" by fake and not destroying its "seed". Another ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> There are moments of Halloween 6, do not make me wrong, and we all know FAR bad signals compared to this (Hellraiser, any?) so what you can do from it (Michael charged down a deep red corridor With the end of the film is particularly useful in the scene) and try to ignore the scrawl plot. I hope we all see one day "Producer's cut" and probably get the chance to do even more. Until then, this must be done ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
