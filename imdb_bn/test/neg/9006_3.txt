I'm sure I'm a minor (I know I'm in my friends), but I found this movie a long, annoying and sad. The role played by Dennis Leighy is the most preferred character (I liked him as "Agag Buzz Life" once!) As the volume. The character of Rene Russo was boring outside of belief and Thomas Crown was flat and impressive on himself. Saying he could be two-dimensional a little generous. (No, his psychological scenes did not help him to be real.) <br /> <br /> In addition to two wonderful scenery (both museums are associated with Copper and not associated with Ryan Russo), this film is my wish. At home television was a golf observer.
