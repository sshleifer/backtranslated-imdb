This comment was originally meant as an alert to people who might be attracted to the title (temporarily) high user ratings which I am definitely astounded. Why I did not like this title: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have some doubts for the creation of a Jackie-Chan-type Flick or a bold Odiapian tragedy. As a result, according to the article, the film falls into two malls, because the tragedy and comedy elements combine together with each other. <br /> <br /> 2. The purpose and behavior of the characters is incompatible and unconvincing. Mental truth and reasoning is sad missing. <br /> <br /> 3 Helpless welding. I do not blame the actress, because it is difficult to create a credible character by acting alone if there is a harmful argument in the script. However, why is there a visible age difference between the top two actors, who can not be more than 3-4 years old? <br /> <br /> 4. The main entertainment for me was mainly due to 2 points. If you can not find a letter, you can sympathize with it but it's hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn what happened to the main playwright, it can not make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies also being entertaining are also thought-provoking. Seeing this picture, I started thinking, could not think of the excitement that the director tried to be that cruel ties could be quite healthy and delightful. I can not finish any other end. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is completely rife with unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it works for an important and worthy purpose. Purpose may be different and I do not want to enter this broad subject. Just tell me I do not protest violence in such films as "Passion of Movie" or "The False Fiction". Torture and hardships are prolonged in the "Oldborn" and graphic (or Aral). For what? I do not know. Personally, I do not get any satisfaction from hitting a tooth or a person can not hear that the scissor is cut off with his shoulders and then his own blood etc. <br /> <br /> 7. This film reminds me of Japanese porn mangadas to remind me of harmful and young Asian girls' children's pants, urine and opinions. It shows a minority who actually enjoy such things. If you are one of them, you can make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it does not fool, it's hateful. Do not waste your time.
