"Blame It On Rio" is a romantic comedy 80's style, more than sex full sex throughout the 101-minute running time. <br /> <br /> This plot is related to two middle class men through crisis, one of which is sorted through his divorce, dealing with the possibility of another similar possibility. Both are good friends, they decide to take a holiday on their holidays in exotic Rio de Janeiro. Possible rioting in this story is almost ridiculous and has some good lines, but it can not really be sunny. Any effort to manage the moral problem does not work seriously, and perhaps the director Donn could keep the humor of the situation alive. <br /> <br /> No bad movie, but it has actually been destroyed as Mitchell Johnson's terrible nasty little temptation Jennifer. Although he uses his body in full good, it is his only thing. Michelle's acting ability leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we did not see anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
