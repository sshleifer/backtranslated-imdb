"The Cellar" is a helpless and extremely child friendly 80's cheese parade, directed by Kevin Tenny (the producer of most of the best films "Witchboard" and "Night of the Nannes") and has played incredibly unstoppable Patrick Kilpatrick, which is a guy with the supposedly expressed feelings. Pacing is really slow, the plot seems very familiar, the giant-effects are all harmful and with the opening of the film, it ends with a tiring story which is not related to the film's actual content. Riding on the wind-over winds keeps on nagging about air and animals, but what the hell does the plot have, there is no air? Like the horror movie of 80, "The Cellar" manages the exploited Indian landscape and all the ultra-real mythological monsters hidden in basements and quaggiers. Mens Casan and his family traveled in one room, which was once home to local Americans, but then the white man came and turned the land into an oil field. Half of the script has been lost to explain the origin of the monster, but I can easily write your summary for it: An ancient Indian Weeddector can be used to blow up the white people (which is a size-sized paper-like a mouse on a mice) but he buried it again. , And I quote, SOB also killed Indians. Mance's very annoying son eventually awakens this creature and naturally can not satisfy her parents about the large hungry mice in the cellar. The spoken psychological family situation (the father always wants to love his son) is very sad and unfortunate and the movie requires more bloodshed; Children's movie or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is very annoying, but we must have played more than 80 bad kids. "The Cellar" is not highly recommended, unless you are a fan of Chess and the 80's Genie Design. The big dodgy rats are a real hoot to see things.
