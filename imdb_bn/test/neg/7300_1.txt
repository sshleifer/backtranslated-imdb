A post-apocalyptic fighter wants to save some kind of nun and to fill some cyber-punkers on the street that kicks his ass. These movies are the most difficult, silent scenes ever seen, which, in the end, seem like the last hour before someone goes out with a badly written, badly played line. There are verb verbs which continue to repeat - and we're not talking about repeating 1-2-3 verbs on a good kick especially made by Eastern Guides, we're repeating a lot of many, long, bad battle sequences. This is the first incredibly confusing, but instantly annoying as you look at the sequence of 30 seconds for the second, third and fourth times. A plot or sight disappeared in a confusing continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (besides a bet who can not see without a begging, I can not see without begging) and securely settle it so that it can harm others) Indeed, though painful, This movie is weirdly funny, I think it's "so funny that it's funny" I'm a partner of film but I am not a partner. There was tears. Other aspects of the note are the sound and quality of the picture but it is forgiving because it is obviously a big problem in the making of this movie. The final verdict - "So bad they're funny" type of king, any type of video of the kind of night to get yourself a copy. Also do not forget the worst movies that I've ever seen.
