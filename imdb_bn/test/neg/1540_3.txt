From director Barbet Schroeder (opposite of Fortune), I think I saw this in my Media Studies class and I recognized the leading actress, so I tried it despite critics rating. Basically the cool kid Richard Hawwood (Ryan Gosling of Huff Nelson) and Justin Penlettton (Bully's Michael Pitt) tried to challenge themselves to kill a random girl and if they could not find the police, could they escape with him? The murder is investigated by the killings detective agency Casey 'The Hena' Maider (Sandra Bullock), new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite annoying by the evidence found in the scene. Unrelated hair The plan does not seem to be fully functioning because Casey and Sam very quickly see Richard or Justin as a suspect, it is only their question that they can turn them away. Apart from Lisa Mills, Chris Pen's Ray Feathers, Captain Rod Cody and Tom Veraica as S. D. Acted as Call. D.A. Al Swanson I can now see the challenge of Sir Alfred Hitakoop's challenge, but this film works very shamelessly, and even a reasonably good thing can not protect it from shameless and predictive. Enough!
