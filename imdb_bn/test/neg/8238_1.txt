I picked up this movie and was scared to know that this movie was based on the rape of a little girl, which parents take their daughter wisely. My first thought was that I am never ashamed to be Indian and Hindu. I found this movie crazy right below. Please do not waste your time. For the song, there are two awesome songs and the movie used is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not known for India. I hope that I am a bit enlightened about how bad this movie is. Yes, it can highlight that bad people in power, especially when they come to religion, can sit and almost everyone can roam around this movie for nearly two hours. See a good Indian movie by your up-director Mira Nair.
