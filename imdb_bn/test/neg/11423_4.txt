First of all I must say that I enjoyed the first underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to know about vampires and lycans and so forth. This last part of the series (hopefully) I'm sorry for the kind of vampires. At least in the first part were your tight skin clothes ... now the vampires look like victims of bad pest control issues. They look and act like proud white pasty people. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were healthy ... The whole thing was interesting with human civilians. Sadly acting was unrealistic. The slave thing was also possible. <br /> <br /> Anything else just suppresses me. Spoilers now Castle walls can be jumped over a few steps? Enemies who do not attack the days? Big bad old vampire who takes the age to join the war, and then runs away from a new Lekan leader for a minute or so later? They roam around their enemies? Lycans carry weapons ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader is so dissatisfied that he is just against everyone? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie if you do not get online or want to buy a very cheap movie ticket. Something ok okay in the action. Of course the Vampire armor and arms are interesting. Otherwise a very weak script that is badly merged and uses all kinds of simple plot twists.
