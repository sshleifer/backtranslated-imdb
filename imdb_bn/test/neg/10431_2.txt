Plodding, probably that would be the title. Bad dialogue delivers at a snap speed. All the characters are single levels with one exception. Unfortunately, that character has some bad lines and this clich√© does not seem to fit in the two-hour dragged ridden. After growing up to seventeen years old, the film seriously lacks details, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by the Grace Grammar, anyone who knew the immediate dialogue and the continuous description of a script. Cameron Richardson is the only element to illuminate this picture. Robin Trower's music is also added to a welcome.
