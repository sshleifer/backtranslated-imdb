Some good set designs. Good songs, like other people, though they are not performed with much power. Bia Arthur tries to defeat her to do something with the element, while Ma'am's friend was sometimes a good one-fishing vessel as sheep, and helped to move along the song "Bombs Bones". Besides, you have nothing worth here. Slowly pissing, incredibly bad syntotropography, not very good (without Robert Preston), a scary script, bad acting (without farewell), and a terrific lead actress. Who thought Luceille was good, like the love of Mom? Warner Bros. There was no doubt on the crack over the head when they decided to use Angela Lansbury, who did it so well at Broadway, and instead of using the ball, who was almost not as funny as 20 years ago, could perform the "right track" section No, and used a painful rage to sing. Even if (probably because) it was difficult for him to make a film and even if he made money, he is not just a mam. The soundtrack of the Broadway musical soundtrack looks great, with so many good films and lanseabirie for anti-mam. In most cases there is nothing that is cool, attractive, or interesting. Forget it, unless you are a huge Lucy fan who does not make any mistake. Hopefully you'll realize that he was just a man.
