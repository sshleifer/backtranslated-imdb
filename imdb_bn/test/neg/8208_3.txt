This movie tries to be more than that. First of all, acting is horrible. You will deliver incredibly bad lines and get past the terrible emoting. The plot is quite interesting. A ship is broken (apparently because it is made from string and balala wood), and a few guys find the shore on themselves. If this is not bad enough, some people living in the County of Count de Saude also live there. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone completely insane. However, he has a big slave, a young girl, and some dogs. There is a woman who does not speak and her wife, who is a leper. However, these men will have to deal with cases of this nut as bad men. He likes to give arrogant and pine and line. The rest of the film tries to escape. This is a satirical end that I will not publish and it's kind of a movie. I did not bother you if you did not
