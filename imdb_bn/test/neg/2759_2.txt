Times I look back at the high school and it's wonderful that I was not less than the Marvin in the BVA film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the best characteristic of Marav is that the bad fortune gets worse and worse. Despite his intelligence, he managed to get raped, exploited, supports his lousy deadbeat parents, and did not go completely planned to plan a lot of spies including a brave hijst. Of course, the viewer does not feel any sympathy with anyone in this movie, so these crisp sadness stops like dehydrated jitter rays. Recommended for the days that you feel, pop this movie and you will laugh and say, "I am so happy that I'm not a hero!"
