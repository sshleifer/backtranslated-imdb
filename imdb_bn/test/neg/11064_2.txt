When I was sitting to watch this movie, I thought it might be a little better. But not This was not a good movie, it was not good, but in most cases it was not bad, but you will end and it will lose all fidelity. They just have to stay left then dead. They did not leave the last bit without doing any bit. If they started something about the plane crash, yes we did not work. The first bit is okay and I give credit for them but the rest is just bad and unnecessary, if you think about watching and watching this movie "It becomes terrible and it's something that's really valuable. I give it 2/10
