This movie was so bad that I do not know where to start, apparently or filmmakers too. It starts with a guy in the mid-decade of TV watching. The news tells a corn mood that is open for Halloween. How do you know if there is a "vision" to him and how to protect his children who are walking in an underground area and in some way are associated with this "vision"? I do not know, and I did not say before that the filmmakers too. They are just human footprints. How did he get this "outlook"? It is not explained, we are just supposed to go along with it. Inside, he went into a deviation to find the missing two girls inside, and the girls started walking behind him twice, and once they ran into him. What does she do? Is he behind them? No When he stood up, he stood as robbery for them. Girls stop? No Then they asked, "Was that the father?" Then whoever was wearing a couple's clothes on "The Star", he just hit a fierce battle to find terrible stray workers. The police are called and after finding "stars" (which are really bad words to use) they cuff him. They trembled in front of him, so that he could take some lock, which he did. First of all, anyone who has been arrested knows that the police should lift your hands behind your back, and secondly why do these "average people" seem to pick up the lock of handcuffs? Eventually, he gave up the police and the "star" wife went away from the police who left the police car leaving Serena as a deviation. However, it appears that all workers seemed to be in the night time and going down the sunshine. One man was attacked by a worker and two missing children in hijacking. It was a slow night that is why this is their only customer, why not. Apart from the police there are apparently good jobs. However, the name of the "star" who goes to "Walker", we call it his last name, a name in which his wife even tells him. As he knows that there are some graves in the middle of this mine field and the excavation begins. I say 'somewhat' because I did not first understand why he first started digging. He found a locket, what does that mean? Anyone seeing this for nothing, but for him it's something of a crime. Some have killed his children by seeing his "vision" and I guess what he is doing, the real intelligence work. And till now he knows that there is loose in the waves of a murderer, he knew in any way that it was from the beginning of the film, so he is looking for his girls. Every time we see the killer or the murderer's feet, we hear a strange robotics, such as a scientist-disobedient toy that expresses voices in mechanical terms. Why do we hear these words? Whatever it is ... related to something? Who knows again? Of course the filmmakers are not. When the peak of all bad acting and bad conversations, "Walker" shouted, "Hey you, Mr. Bed Man ... I'm going to get you." Again, his wife attacked the inner entrance of the "Forest Man" attack, which I mentioned earlier that the strange staff of any employee or police officer. "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone that he plans to kill his wife and children, as well as him. "Walker" can only answer "Hey! Hey!" Before dropping his phone and running close. Along with talking to someone else, the killer does not drop his phone, leaving the wife a few feet and leaves him alone for the next picture, losing his first chance to keep his conduct true. I would be surprised if this script is not written by a child. Opps it was not. It was written, directed and produced by the same person. And not even that, he also did the painful camera work, where we waste 90m of football's football and could not walk through the squawk shots. Finally, "Walker" uses caffeine to cure "bad people", which also seems to mean that the "Walker" can pick up the locks with the same metal object. Apparently there are plenty of small metal objects laying around this cornfield. But in response to the murderer, he is still going to kill the children "Walker" kills "bad man" and everything is fine with the world again. Now in reality it makes a murderer "Walker", he killed a man who killed his own daughter "by his own intentionally". He knows it not because of the evidence, but because of his views. He could not find any body, nor did anyone know that this man was also in the shrine. And pocket? He returns to the ghosts of two dead girls and gives it. There is no evidence. So he killed a man without a real reason. I can not imagine what the filmmakers think about this. This may be the way to cover the misuse of funds for production companies. I would watch the Blair Witch project five times to see this film again. The actor will be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact the whole production company should be ashamed. If there is anyone associated with this movie, please answer. What did you think
