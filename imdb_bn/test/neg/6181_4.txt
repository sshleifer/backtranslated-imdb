All right, so I saw this movie in this movie, and I was very boring. Before any edit or line dialogue, no more than fifteen minutes of footage took place that turned into a sense and the Ham-Faced script took more than 30 minutes before placing a plot, which is a close-up of Ryan Gosling's smile or distorted morality. After the first 45 minutes, this script was blown into the clock's thornbush, although it was not completely entertaining or worrisome. Highlights include a very well-established character actor, including Gosling and Mors' performance, Gosling an up-coming star and a great feeling for a wonderful emotion. As a sidinet, after screening, I was pushing a little about my movie to some of my friends when David Morsus walked behind me - he looks like the world's perfect man, but he crosses me by 6'2 "50 pounds. Remove my legs and immediately change the subject.
