I do not hate this movie if I speak Polish. I chose the English version in the first menu, but it gave me Polish conversations with English subtitles just like the Polish version. Maybe the conversation was so confusing because the subtitles did not translate well into English. In order to further increase this problem, there were no subtitles in some dialogues. The performance was quite bad, especially the female lead, everything was melodramatic about! A scene that bothered me when a German woman was stolen and the crowd hanging around her, her shirt opened, and the director closed her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. I could not see how his breasts could be added to the scene or in the film's play. Perhaps the audience was trying to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. Most of the films are run by Americans to end the war of liberation. First, the "American" uniforms did not see anything like the US military uniform. Secondly, none of Poland's exile camps were freed by the Americans. In 1945, the 19-year-old Polish film director, better known than the American born in 1966, knows that all six exile camps in Russia were released. After all, if you do not say Polish, then this is not a very good movie.
