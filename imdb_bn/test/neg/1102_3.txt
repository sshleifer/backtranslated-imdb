I can not believe I myself support myself to reach this mission. My friends asked me at the beginning of April 14, 2007. This movie is certainly a pain in your theater and the pain of sickness, I did not even feel the acute effect. Her "great view" is what I think is the complete failure to attract the audience. Even the worst even shreds me, because my friend's theater does not come in time because he was busy helping his lover to find a suitable lodge for the night. I was not really frustrated about this thing, but this film is actually a matter for me, poor plot, vain storyline, and I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> The headline does not recommend the horrors and frightening of failing to overthrow our viewers, if they show it in real situational theaters, can reduce the deadly trauma of animals. Good luck to those who try to see it whatever.
