** Possible Spoiler ** Three young men of the law and order body were given the chance to become secret police in their 'mode squad' and become a suitable member of society, the rebirth of the hit television series, directed by Scott Silver, directed by Scott Silver. The wires are less than the background, and they are not known to whom and whom they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Dance), Pete Cochran (Geovani Ribisi) and Lincoln Hays (Omar Appes), so they can go, so they can be Captain Adam Guer (Dennis Farina) surrounded a troubled night's place suspected to be standing in front of a prostitute ring. At the beginning, as a Julie waitress gets a job there, they get to know what stomach and linch they 'hang out' only. Julie is the oldest boyfriend, Billy Wyatts (Josh Brolin), who has been re-acquainted with the medication, which is tied in a barrage contract. Before it ends, the 'party' is up to their throats, even doing fake clusters that are involved in drugs, and this results in their involvement with the investigation. From the beginning of the film, there is a sense that you are late; As it is believed that the source and activity of the team is as current as you know. Here you are going to have three short-mug-shot bios which gives you nothing at a glance of their past; There is nothing about how all this actually came in. Thinking that this way will lead to a quick story, things will go along. Although it is true to a certain extent, some pairs of background pictures make the texture more attractive; The way it was done here only reduces the credibility of the whole proceeding. The plot was limited to the beginning, and it was better to spend any time in the development of character. What is distributed, and that is roughly less than a compelling story to fill a dimensional character. Performance is satisfactory, but from actors script, and apparently get any help from silver; Danis, Ribbis and Apees have come near to hate Julie, Pete, and Link, but their time has been allocated, coupled with lack of support, they are still getting very little access to this man's life. Farina, a good actor who is better than what he got here, is no less than a joke of 'good police'. There is a feeling that everything in this movie has been given once; Some details and nuance will be steered up to this one-stage stock. Supporting actress Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershade), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckhampton), Lionel Marc Smith (Lenian) and Sam McMurray (Tricky) are included. Here is an embarrassing acting talent that has been lost in this way; A lot of thinking and planning should go to create this film. As it is, weak pregnancies and poorly executed are executed. Dennis, Rabies, and Apps are like Major Laguar who are trapped in the game for all the marble of the local sandals; Instead of getting a shot in the title, they all dried up. Terry says in the Waterfront, "You're my brother, Charlie, you're looking for me." Well, it is clear that Charlie was not there to find them here, and after 'The Mode Squad', they all could expect something better with the next few times. I rate this 1/10.
