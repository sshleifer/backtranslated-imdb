All right, number one - this "movie" version of the "90s" of an obscure show of the 70's that no one remembers! Number two, as soon as the movie started, I was confused, I was walking around halfway through the movie! There was no plot! It was very annoying! Awesome clothes! Call me crazy, but it's not trustworthy to me that a little skinny Omar Aps can take a big man back without guns and afraid to talk to him! This is a ridiculous "plot" I'm sorry, but to me, kids can not keep their pants on one leg this day, let alone catch up on some "evil, underground, killer". I went out of the theater and demanded and got my money back! I do not reconsider this movie to anyone 12 years old!
