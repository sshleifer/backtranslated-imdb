I can not believe the original rating found when I saw this film, 9.5? Unfortunately I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> One of the slow and annoying, tragic things in the film is that if the film is given a real rating of 5 or 6 then expectation <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so the film Seeing and doing poor story and acting I give 3/10 score. <br /> <br /> Linne Vinnie Jones is fantastic, and snatch, and she plays a great hard-man, however, she should have played this role. When Stella and Schwarzenegger's comedy films work, they're a bit like that, they just do not work. <br /> <br /> She can not play lead actors, she supports or otherwise plays better. When he led, his acting talent is very 'visible' and is not really shown as very good. This is another good example of the average machine.
