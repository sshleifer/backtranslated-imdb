The best soul sisters of Palm Greyer's 1970s have appeared in many blackploiting movies, which have been recently discovered and praised for the new generation. I can safely say that black mama, white maternal uncle, may be the worst Pam Greyer movie ever seen. <br /> <br /> Gray and League Margaret are Markov Karen; Karen's revolutionary friends escaped from prison after being attacked by rice gutters and two female prisoners. Disciplined to each other, the film is convicted of women, but there are three separate plots: a fattened criminal (Filippino Sledgeer Vic Diaz) Lee dead, a cowboy Bunty Hunter (Excellent Sid Hugh) seeks search for two girls; And Karen's revolutionary friend searched for her. This image eventually becomes so slowly and untitled two women that the headline should face the man. Greyer, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in many (overlapping) action scenes. Markov is excellent as Carver and Gare Lee, but both of them have finally forgotten in many subsets. In an attractive scene, a police officer and his head are compelled to shoot their pants to be huntsman so that he can paint with the smallest gender (judged by his whore), but it can easily be forgotten in all the greatness. <br /> <br /> Black Mammar, White Mama starts off as a female-in-prison film full of Lady Warden and Shower Scenes, then then completely switches to a Chase film. Director Eddie Romero (famous for Filipino horror films) was only stuck with the WIP theme, he was good. Instead, the BMWM gets real real fast and surprising finishes surprise the viewers why they end up like a 90-minute film! Another problem: where will the film be determined? Although some of the pronunciations have Spanish names and Spanish names (Los Rambles, etc.), all native are clearly Asian! Hmmm ... only recommended for die-hard grape fans, who will be even frustrated.
