This is a tragic Hollywood remake of a classic British film. All of the original "Italian work" entertainers have been dubbed "Donated" by Donna and Wayne Powers's "scripted" movie, and encouraged by F Gary Gray. I am surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the original film screenwriter) allows his pigs to use his name in the credit. Martin worked on the Best 40-Year-Wicked Movie and TV Projects. Even getting involved vaguely with this stinker is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Humor is forced, plays are performed, all letters are cookie cutter, preferable crims (Charlie Theron's impossible, safe cracker / ray driver without) and this plot only matches the original with the following points: br /> <br /> (1) Three Minutes (modern BMW versions, but minis) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 (2) use two crickers named Crocker and Brasher. 3) Through it A city to provide safe road traffic control system to disrupt. <br /> <br /> (4) Er, that's it. No matter what you get, it's a great and impossible American number-a countless heavyweight movie, in which a gang of perfect pirate kisses will eventually make their evil partner better. Believe me, they feel like a terrible long time before doing it. Cast does their best job with what they've given, but after reading the script it seems to have taken it as a comedy-smooth operation. Feeding on a Hollywood hamburger machine is the curly nature of the original film and none of the distinct British flavor survived. <br /> <br /> Check your own bias and see the original 1969 film of this chest infection. It is a wonderful fact that Nobel Coward has jumped from his grave without making any Annie Nelly, and all those involved in this stereotype have remixed their teeth down their throats. <br /> <br /> Italian job? More like Italian Jabbi.
