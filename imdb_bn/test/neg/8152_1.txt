Myself (an independent) is an independent filmmaker, I really understand what these people are trying to do and it sounds like a good idea. On paper. In 16 mm film, though, it's awful. I did not understand that this film was created in the mid 90's because the film was so disastrous and bad, I swore that this was one of the 30-year-old Flickr where a porn producer tried to go to the main stream. And the words! Well, I do not know what kind of mic they used to record, but it looks like someone killed the whole thing. I think I should not judge very strictly, lastly, how many films have my company spread? Nobody, but I want to think that with our poor acting, writing, and management we must have at least good pictures and sound quality. For A + concept, F-- for executing.
