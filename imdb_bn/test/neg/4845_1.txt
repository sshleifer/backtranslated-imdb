I'd like to read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before I rent it. A waste of money. Time wasted Very little dialog. The conversation was difficult to understand in every way. The story and plot were both weak. It was so beautiful that there was only cinematography. <br /> <br /> The letters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time trying to find things due to the lack of conversation, that you will restart this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this picture. It was a mess and you would have to leave feeling like a mess. <br /> <br /> You say, what was the hack, when the movie ends?
