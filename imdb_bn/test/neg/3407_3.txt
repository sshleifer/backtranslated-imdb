I love watching a good poor giallo. Unfortunately, Solange is certainly not one of them. It's long Very long The story is strong and makes very little sense even if it is very obvious. Scripting on these killings and girls spends so much time, but it does not spend almost any time with the killers. It leaves a big hole in the story: we may be able to see a young woman shaking together but why we have zero characters in the assassination of the killers who decide to kill girls. Yeah, what happened to Salang was terrible but we were left too much in the darkness, why the [annoying] murderer decided that it was valuable in his efforts to stop naughty girls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nothing memorable about it. Actors? Annoying This manuscript? Ridiculous boring Teacher, blonde and the whole "warm" love relationship between the student was really embarrassing. Are they living planets? Music? Annoying leave it.
