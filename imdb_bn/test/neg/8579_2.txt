I was present at the screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Although the other reviews I've read generally (and mystifyingly) seems to be positive, I must tell you that without any axis that this movie is unimaginable, vaguely bad William H. Messi and Maria Bello's very brave and weird performance is probably the least polished, most clearted scripts that have been found to be green in years, and have been very mizpainted. I do not know how bad Brown Bani was, but I'm sure it could not get a dentist-style that did it. They were brave like their performance, perhaps this otherwise brilliant actors made themselves such a horrible director and unrealistic plapla as the worst actress. <br /> <br /> She must be well-dressed in the boardroom, because she never allowed a camera to be in a hundred yard. The conversation is so shameful and amazed that I actually ruined myself during screening. I have squandered in the hand that the brain's talent is completely incapable of writing its handwriting. <br /> <br /> Seeing talented actors like Alec Baldwin's labor through Kramer's unexpected script and ham-fisted instructions was watching to get involved with the death of a child - I felt angry at all, at times, and all of the sick, sick. Although I'm always happy that investors and industrialists are willing to risk playful scripts with interesting places, this image was a total, pronounced Fiasco. If he had taken a steel pipe on his knees, then Krrame could not have been more creative for these actors. I hope they for all sakes can avoid similar humiliation in the future. Messi wisely ducked the door next door and even did not stick around for screening. Sadly, the misfortune of the main character seems to have stopped the picture in the worst way. Anyone accustomed to quality freedom will find it completely intolerable.
