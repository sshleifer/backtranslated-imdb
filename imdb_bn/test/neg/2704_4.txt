Although this movie is fairly wrong, there are some items that can be true. Of course, he was a wild character of his young man, played a joke on his fellow cadets at West Point, was often expelled, finished his graduation at the age of 34 and was often shameless under his leadership during the civil war. <<br /> But history may have made him a goat goat of Indian war. Undoubtedly, he was a partner with cruel things, but how much was he under the command? Also, there is evidence that he convinced Congress (in a big risk of his commission and command) that he had argued about the right to break the treaty with Indians and if he was an Indian, he would fight instead of living in a reservation! <br /> <br /> A character was told in 1776 that what will be said about the British about defeating revolutionary warriors, this character says, "History will always do what it does ... it will be false." Who knows how bad a man is a cast. Certainly he was not a sympathetic character painted by Iran Flan and later Ronald Reagan. But I suspect he was completely evil as he was impressed later.
