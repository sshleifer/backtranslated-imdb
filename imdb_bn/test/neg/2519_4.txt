All right, this is a weird film! Supporters of Ed Wood Juniors use "director" strategy director George Barry as stock footage and sugar voice over. He can make a crack in the wall in a plot device! There is more humor than the horror here, but I found it an uneven blend. You will smile and cry, and probably wonder why you got your hands on this.

If you like your cheese next to the camp, but with the alcohol '70s "Gore, you get it a great and weird meal.
