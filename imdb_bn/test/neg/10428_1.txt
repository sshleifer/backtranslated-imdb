Journalist Bob Woodward has become a cruel "fantasy" directed by Larry Pepper, blasting scratches, and sometimes a suspect in the rise and fall of actress John Belusi, as if he did some important and important work. Michael Chalice (years before his success at "Shield"), Belousi kept the illogical position of filming, took postmortem trips through his life, reviewing "Saturday Night Live" skits that are now part of TV history. It's like someone trying to find out - Lucy Lucille Ball - it can not be done. Why was Baluchi's sadness at the time of his death because he was one of them? Chiklis makes an appreciable effort to see parts, and he is trying to flee to a Morgue, an interesting scene interesting. Yet, it is an uphill initiative and no actor - how talented it can be - it can save. * ****
