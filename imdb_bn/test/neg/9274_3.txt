The movie has a good story line, in some parts it's good, but not all. In some parts, I felt that bad guys did not stop yet, from the experience of taking martial arts. Some work is long, for most of the boss, but for at least important people, they were killed or stopped with a few hits, but some were too unreal or they could do better. <br /> <br /> The least important actor or stunt man was the right choice for the movie, my girlfriend began to press on to see that she started watching movies more than spending time with me. <br /> <br /> Movie is good, what I can say is that.
