It's wonderful, but then what else do you expect? Heroine Cinderella's younger sister, full of evil mother, sister and everyone! The hero (if you can call him) is a void Putz; And the interests of the competing love are fulfilled with Millidramatic villany. <br /> <br /> All of the cast, settings, and dresses were very interesting, and I think the actors did a fantastic job considering how vulnerable the elements were. The film was beautifully portrayed and proud of a soundtrack, which was created to create a queue about what the viewers should feel throughout life. Megan McDonough sang sweet songs, and the film provided the movie with its best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Daniel Steele you like this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you will love this film. I did not I was able to sit through it, but it was close.
