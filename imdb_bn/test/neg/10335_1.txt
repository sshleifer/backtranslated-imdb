If you ever shop at Wal-Mart, you probably know about $ 5 DVD bin which is sitting in the electronics division. Well, where I found this movie However, I was cheated! You see, this special DVD cover had a big picture of Sandy Bullock and even listed her name as "title". I thought, "Wow, I do not know Sandra Bullock made this movie?!" So I was going to go home and see a cool Sandra bullock movie. I'm not surprised, Miss Bullock's small role played a very small role .... He plays CIA agent's son's girlfriend. Talk about the actress support. He can not have more than 2 lines in the film. Besides being deceived as a bulk flick, I've seen the past and I'm watching an "action-packed" movie. Negative! At one moment, for a special effect, a gun was taped on camera. You really will see it to be laughing at the horrible.
