So unfortunately my and my partner saw this !!! It is known as "Zone Channel" in "Square Channel", which basically shows crappy B-movie horror movies 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so there is a smile and decided to give this one look. In addition to acting abductors, the horrifying plot, the terrible effects, the chic camera work and all the ridiculousness of the brain, it was ok, lol !!! It was quite hilarious in all seriousness and it was stupid actor laughing to laugh. There is a bit semi-nudity which has given the film a little more, unfortunately it was "uggo", who called my partner to his call: od If you are annoyed one evening and play it, take a chance, you might just like it: )
