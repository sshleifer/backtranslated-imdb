There is a lack of emotion and stress for native Mongolian speakers. Many non-resident speakers are used especially without using gamukas. Many changes from actual history. Terrible terrible subtitles !!! I wonder where and where those subtitles are. It was both in English and Thai. If I was subtitled in English subtitles in Thai language how bad it was in Thai! The greatest leader is a very reluctant description of the life. Mongolian directors made better films with less budget in the 1980s. In fact, if the critics of the academy's award are not leonants then what do I think? Only some good signals in Singapore were only moderate ... not the top CGI
