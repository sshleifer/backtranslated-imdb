Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I saw that most American films cobbled in the Cowboy movie That is why Hollywood is so really love with the original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy mythology. I'm not sure that I bought that argument altogether but there is evidence in support of the slipstream theory. It is the airport with a whip movie. <br /> <br /> It's actually better than that. This is a spaghetti western airplane! Arrange planks with horses, make Android a pastor, and this movie can be a difference for seventy years from a dozen Italian Spanish semi-armed "suit-up-ups". <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is not like BAD because I could believe it by some reviews here but it was certainly not good.
