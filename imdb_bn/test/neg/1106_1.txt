I usually love this type of movie. However, this time I'm missing the screen sticker myself. Because I can not do this, I'll complain about it. This was absolutely stupid. What is happening with dead children is very quiet, but the living man is completely stupid. I'm an old man, quite big, and I can protect myself. However, I will not half the little girl's stuff in this movie. Also, in this movie, the mother looked at neglect with her children. I was not so angry about her and her actions because I used to enjoy the flick otherwise. She had a number of suggestions, and proceeded through quickly see everything until you finish her job. Also, anyone else is sick of seeing movies that are described in the dark. For example, no one can see what is being painted. As the audience, we are involved in action on the screen impossible. So why do not we dream of night?
