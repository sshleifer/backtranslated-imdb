According to me, the version of Leicile Ball's "Mam" is sometimes one of the worst performances in the film. Seeing Lucie more than the number of astronomical numbers, I can tell you that I really love Lucie, but this film is incredibly bad casting, music and a fiasco of dance. Robert Preston is the only smallest part that you missed quite a bit for a short while. I do not know what he thinks and I can not imagine how the studio or director was advised, but I'm actually seeing this embarrassing performance. I can really be cruel and suggest to see it for laughter, but it is very sad to get it qualified. Do not waste your money or your time.
