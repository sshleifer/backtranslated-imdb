This movie is about a young girl who is going to live with her rich cousins, falls in love with a cousin, and refuses the advance of a moral relative who brings problems to her family. After seeing the 1999 edition and reading the book, I decided to look at the old version. I had to stay true to the book Fanny's character, but it was annoying character. The character of Fannier, played by Sylstra Le Tauzell, was impossible; He often appeared to be about frustration. I do not like Robert Bourgeois who played Henry Crowford. I do not know him being interested in Fanny or his cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crowford, was right, but she was very ugly wig she wore. I lost interest in his acting and I kept staring at his wig. I kept expecting to drop off his head. I could see a slip of her real hair under the wig.
