I sometimes have to understand this garbage of my kids so they will understand how kind of "competitors" show. They are lean because they are not lean because they wish for their reputation for a few months' fame and fate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What does the nation say about us? Is it not your responsibility to say your lifestyle choices, and its consequences? <br /> <br /> "The Biggest Hussar" is an appropriate title, but there is nothing to do with its weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute trash.
