I'm really a big lover of bad b movies And I love especially alien / Scifi movies. I say cheaper, cheesier, and the camper is better. Low budget and a hockey concept are fun enough for the worst B movies, but this movie is so bad that I'm really embarrassed for filmmaking and for making films and for the shameful ad-actors. First off, there is no real plot, it's all the kind of situation "comedy" (if it can be called). "Comedy" in this movie is saying more about the description, "Look at me, I'm in this madness, is not it funny?", But it is unfortunate that none of the work is funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actors repeatedly say stupid things (perhaps trying to hide for the catching words, perhaps only everyone has B / C is so bad), really the overwhelming women are being played as hot girls and people are going back and forth to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> There was a middle-class actor at the end of the movie, whom I used to say was some acting and I believed in his land. He was out of the weekend as a solid BM bathroom in the Weekend Detox unit. Corey Feldman was portrayed for about 3 minutes (thanks, we did nothing else with him), and was portrayed from the site - probably outside of his apartment somewhere. She said there are some unreasonable things about the alien and Alien has had sexual intercourse and the appearance of her face. <br /> <br /> If you are worth your life and 90 minutes (and years of pain remembering), you will lose by watching this junk observer. If you have done many drugs like Adam Sandler's comedy styling (and there is no value in it) and are considered mentally slow, then you can choose this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think those who are disturbed about this, they have to work for tromo or something, b / c I can not believe that people can actually be so hairy to enjoy this movie. (Does the drug really waste your judgment?)
