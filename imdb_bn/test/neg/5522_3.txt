"Happy Day" was produced and broadcasted from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, and seems more ridiculous than the age. During its broadcasting, most of the older viewers in the 1950s were medieval with families, and Melakes Dinner's view was probably brought to artificial nostalgia. Fonz was definitely cool (although on this day, actor Henry Rankleler did not learn to drive a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was an American-American boy who would probably be elected president of Chhatra Dal. Potsie Richie was the best friend - the show star has a good friend, I guess. And if not the whole team, then Ralph Malffe Fonz was a busted sidekick. I liked it to beat the Fannage poor Ralph Malefe. And there was the mail, the middle-aged lug ran Mel's dinner. And of course, who can forget the appearance of Mork? Is it actually the 1950's? Surprisingly, the films made in the 1950s, such as "Rebelless Cause" and "Wild One" have been well-acquainted with the age and have shown more honesty than this show, which was created 20 years after the release of the film. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Day" is not in the same league, because "a reason without rebellion" or "American graph" about it. The "happy day" might have some aspects of his burger diner, juke box, cooler car and strong pad shirt in 1950, but it has created a more nostalgic idealism than for a decent painting rather than a decent painting. In the 1950s, there was something called "American graffiti" about young Americans, where "Happy Days" was more like the way the medieval generations of the 1970s were like in the 1950s. As a result, there was a kind of waterfall that nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Day", Best, comedy-fantasy with the artistic culture of the 1950s. As indicated by another critic, American American Reich Kingfisher has probably been penalized for friendship like Drummer like Drop Out. And the mail will probably ban Phoenie from her dinner entry. A quick history: "Happy day" was originally a pilot known as "Love in Happy Days" which was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots had themes related to sex and romance, which was sometimes unable to venture into the pilot, which sometimes shows the broadcast program "American Style of Love", which is often circulated or replaced by other unexpected programming cancellations and / or barcelain games. Change In short, "American Style of Love" was a thrilling show that these all-time comedy pilots did not make it for a slanted debut. "Profit in the Happy Days" was shown in the "American Style of Love" program in the early 1970's, but at that time the TV officials did not know how popular the popularity of the youth of 1950 was, especially in those days, comedy was like middle-aged people, Mary Tillar Moore Show "(and the next spin-offs such as" Roda ")," The Bob NewHat Show ", and" All In The Family " Center around (How much of the TV satcumers have changed now, rather than younger young people, and the industry avoids the most shows about middle-aged people, such as the plague!) <br /> <br /> Later, "Love" rap Howard named "The Andy Griffith Show" A child actor, known as Happy Days ", in 1959 about a young man named" American Graffiti " Actor, which was relatively unknown by George Lucas, before which the "THX 1138" box office tragedy bombed, even when the movie executives premiered, a movie about young people can become popular in the 1950s, because it is popular with the past, Not appropriate ", although they did not realize that during the film, most of the audience were in the 1950's In the decade, young people knew that the film was a huge hit and studio officials admitted that they completely wrong their audiences. In the course of the drama "American Graphics", TV executives realized that their voice was a comedy pilot, "American Graffiti" Was like. They brought it back to the original cast and gave Henry Rankler the title "Title Day" again as "The Phanaz" and the rest became TV History, becoming one of the most popular of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> "Happy day" seems ridiculous now Characters are plane and cardboard, they are not superficially higher or less. They despise the issues they face. And their reaction is mindless and even silly. Nowadays, the phone's character seems to be good, well, the punk. Can the parody of Marlon Brando character be an idea of ​​"Wild One"? I'm groaning with fresh eyes, I think the producers really missed a great opportunity to present with depth and reality in the 1950's, which can still be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided to cheaper cheap for bucks quickly. This is definitely a show that did not prevent time exams. There are many physical presentations of "American Graffiti" "Happy Day" but it was an edge. It was a fairness about letters and their subject. "Happy Day" took the appearance of "American Graphic" but failed to take his heart.
