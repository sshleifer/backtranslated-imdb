I can not believe I saw this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" I was waiting to improve it, which never happened. The sound is terrible, blaring the sound in seconds is going to be very low too much to listen to the conversation. The plot is absolutely impossible, acting intermediaries, although Keaton does her usual good work in the psychological field, although the typist may be considered negatively in that role. The director does not know absolutely anything about the hospital, medicine, science or a technical nature. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder what they came up with that diagnosis? There are many errors, mistakes and some mistakes with this movie that if someone lists them, it will probably set a record of some sort. Demerol as a general anestetic? A motorcycle in a non-DOT / freighter motorway wearing helmet of helmet. San francisco When the walls of the paper are taped, the helmets come out of the thin air, the guns point to one direction, but on the other, things hit, light is seen and disappeared and the move is in a scene which is not defective. My wife, who is an RNA of an oncology unit, finally left the room before the end of the movie and got all the medical errors in mind. I gave it only 2 stars, otherwise it must have got 1.
