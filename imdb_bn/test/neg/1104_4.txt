J.S. Cardenas conducted a small 'video nasty', called "The Slayer" in 1982, and then thereafter hand in several feature films; Garbage 2001 with the VPC movie The Fourscan. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, has highlighted a plot that is quite good and is a vague looking poster, a few years ago, I felt that Tommy Hooper was related to a direct directive. Well, I felt that he thought that this was very similar to his stupid zombie fret film 'Mortuary' and so it closed the one. I do not blame him for him. This plot focuses on the mother and her two daughters, who goes to an old house in the hill, which once belonged to her late husband. However, they do not realize that almost a hundred years ago; A group of children used as mines were trapped below a minineshft. Naturally, these are not their last and they have survived their aggressive and are now running the area in search of revenge ?? <br /> <br /> The film was originally a collection of Clich√©s; From the little child "fantastic friends", mother and all its usual junkie cut off the garbage. J.S. Get back to horror fans with cardone shock and gory scenery (mostly kids involved) but it's not enough. The story can not play very well at all and actually reminds me of the previous mortuary, and it is not a good thing (though death is actually a better film than this). Nothing is nothing to write about at home; Laurie herring suitable appearance, such as the big girl Scout Taylor-Compton; But not managed to provide an attractive performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than normal child actor. The plot is not given any credibility and in reality the Scrapplee can not even bother to explain the causes of children's attack on the locals. It all flies to a common and rather gradual end, and overall I would say that if you know your horror movies you can feel free to leave it!
