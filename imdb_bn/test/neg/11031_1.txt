This movie is an example of a small budget, an invalid star cast, a weak story and a poor entertainment. These films are not for a commercial break and not for entertaining Bollywood movies. I went to this movie because I thought that before a gangster was tolerant, that too. Actress acted as actress Nandita Das, actress acted as the new actress. She is good, sexy and well-played. She definitely goes in her career. Our Mitunda was good all the time during her work. At least it was something good for the movie. I do not like Imran for his role because he should be advised to improve himself for acting because he has done many films as a new actor and he has been seen as an established actor. This film has nothing except a bold scene directed by a new actress. Never try this movie
