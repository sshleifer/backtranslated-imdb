I'm not the big fan of Spielberg / Cruz version of this movie. And so I must throw it with more humble lathe / haoyel version. C Thomas Howell had more heart and sympathy, which was cruise in the original role (at least in my opinion). It's not hard to imagine until you lose everything in the Spielberg version, which costs more than thousands of dollars. Nothing remains, no special effects, no set, no cruise. Because David Michael is much more than a cool grandmother in the Latin version that I suspect So, compare the shells to Apple I guess I will go with sailing. At least it gives a shot of an independent shot in the epic science fiction disaster market.
