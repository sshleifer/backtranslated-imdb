For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now, I know why. I was even worse than I wanted. Ashton Kutcher has made the worst film in his career wrong, since 'Dude, where's my car?' As Ashton's dream girl, her red co-star, who requested her father (and her boss) to have a baby onion during the weekend. Rules: 1. No shoes at home. 2. There is no one in the house. 3. The boy's son is out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, how much you can guess at the end of the first 20th century, how the rest will be run. <br /> <br> You know, there are movies like "Meet the Parents", where something bad is happening, but it is entertaining to watch, and it is distributed in such a way that you can wait to see what will happen next No This is one of those films. You know right from the beginning that bad things are going to happen, and they are mostly stupid things that will not really happen. It was a very frustrating movie to watch, and almost three times I almost stopped because it was too bad. However, I paid the rent fee, and it looks like I'll see it now. <br /> <br /> They were like Red, and I want to see him in more pictures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that is short. <br /> <br /> do not see it. You sincerely regret it!
