This is the first action movie to be banned in the USSR Hollywood Action Style. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movie of that time. The plot is so childhood, so the instruction is so. This movie was successful because it was Russia's first type. Although I have seen this many times, I admit it was naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of a Russian action movie. This is just the first experience.
