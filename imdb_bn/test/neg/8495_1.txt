It's the worst movie I've ever seen without any doubt. I say this without hyperbolase, and believe me, I've seen many bad movies. It's shameful and annoying that millions of dollars went to this movie and hundreds of thousands of tech writers and producers certainly spent so much time telling them to be a tremendous failure. <br /> <br /> A 90-minute film is a long, stretched, annoying, And you think that you have something wrong. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I've enjoyed elsewhere) is just terrible in this role. Obviously he did not screen a screen, because his right mind would not consider any producer entertaining in any way, especially in the buzzing mask. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, /> <br /> This film producer should be ashamed, and more importantly, it will not be allowed to create dramatic films again.
