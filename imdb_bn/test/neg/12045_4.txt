When I saw this film it came first and hated it. I saw it again 27 years later. I really liked something ... even though Robin Williams was completely wrong for this role ... I think most of the time I hate to hate this film, after reading that book I realized that it was almost completely opposite. Since I did not read it again, I can only give my impression from the past - but I'm sure one thing - this movie is a piano for family life, in which the book shows almost all traditional traditions - and probably, especially - the straight-jacket, which we Get rid of it well. The only positive aspect of the book is the extraordinary nature of the children ... that really captures the very beginning and end of the film (which is incredibly fantastic baby floating in the air), the very poor Williams is the tenth joke!) My mark is because the book is wrongly presented in the book. It fits as a movie of itself - but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is astonishing - I think someone will be in love with her to see it. And as a former football player, John Lathgo, who has conducted a sexually transmitted operation, is fantastic .... He did not camp or sometimes praised the character but he was very commendable - and his performance was incredibly honest. I saw him closely in all his scenes, and he was never something other than women. Nothing of her performance came around the performance of a drug queen ... and that made all the difference. Actually, among all the people in the film, he is the only one who is unnecessary. It's only worth to see this film for its performance.
