I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas cage entered its first lines, I thought he was having fun. Cage as an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but bad actors who are acting BAD also do not mention their Italian language. The story is very loose, it has been well, but with other actors and perhaps other screens. The camera is great, photography, but why did you throw Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please do not make me wrong, I do not have anything against Kejri, there are some great films, but he certainly does not play every role. There is a possible possibility of the story because it is a sad fact that Cast was not well set.
