Burned suck! I saw this movie last week and it's awesome. What bulls are udders? All my two year olds were asking me if all the cows are silent and try to explain to him that this is not true and the movie is making him more confused! <br /> <br /> Also, the violent theme got my 2 year old fear. They made looking coyotes harmful and this has instilled a fear of coyotes in my daughter. I do not know the coyotes for a reality are violent and natural predators. Mother and son sitting in front of us were shouting, "Kill him, kill him, yes" is a special scene in the film where good versus bad. <br /> <br /> This is the King of the Lions and they Big names for poking movies should be used to stop the actors. Steve Oderik who also made thumb films, such as thumb Wars, thumblinina and many others are so bad! <br /> <br /> If my Steve Ordere movie comes in my life, I will be nude and my diarrhea is wet and posted on Youtube.com ... enough!
