There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read the revolution for Hell of It or any of his other works. Abby is often dismissed as a prankster for the '60', but he was a thinker for his senses, his humor and the sense of pop culture, and his image to attract attention to the ideas of personality. Media often focuses on people, not ideas, and it is also a problem with this movie. Later in his life he suffered depression. But this flick is like the National Enquirer version of Abee. She deserved well. If you do not know Abby or his bar then this film will not help. <br /> <br /> This image is false. I give it a zero. <br /> <br />
