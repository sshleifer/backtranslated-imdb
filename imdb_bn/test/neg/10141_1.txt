This is really a "OK" series .. It's pretty good to everyone. But I can not take Reba. She is trying to be funny but she just did not and then she got a stupid accent !! If they get him out of the show then I want to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I am now seeing the show in 10 minutes and as mentioned earlier, the Revo is destroyed by the show. But the 20-year-old man (does not know his name) but he is very funny, and he is really saving it. <br /> <br /> Recipe for getting a great show here. The rebate takes place and the 20-year-old man plays a major role. <br /> <br /> I really hope that someone will agree with me and think (like me) that they will cut robe and other role someone else
