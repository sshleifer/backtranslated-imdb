Fawn Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dryer, Marcel Carney, and others, is a remarkable semi-laughable tribute to black and white films. Alan has played a character who was caught in a nightmare of Kafsaec, first thought that he was trying to catch a killer and gradually realized that he could be a suspect. Writing a little forcing (after all this, Woody Allen is trying to be a part of Kafka), but the point was made, and there was no harm. Cinematography is interesting, about 100 gray gray, but make sure that you see in a very dark room with a good screen, or discoloration will be swallowed in fog. This is a ridiculous little movie which smiles something that actually snorts of "Uh-hoo" Acting is considered good because of a weird car, and if you grow up Woody Allen fan then it's valuable. Interested people who are also knowledgeable about expressionist films. I want to give this 10 a 6.5.
