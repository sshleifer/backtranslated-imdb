I am sure that those people who make this film think that they are acting very well politically right because they consider the US war in Afghanistan and especially Iraq's war in the United States, but it does not clear later, thus sowing seeds for future troubles. In addition, they do this without making the Islamist an enemy and making Republicans an enemy, because it is the Republicans who are in the office and they are doing this great thing by bringing the USSR by providing the secret of war in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> But seriously now. . . Do we want a movie that says repeatedly, "Let's kill some Russians!" Bloody America is the greatest thing in America's blood? And did we want to find this congressman to find the adorable because he used to wear women's clothing with big hair and printed clothes? Even his supposed smart assistant, who was always wearing a professional dress, looked at Charlie as she was just the most wonderful, beautiful, greatest man As if he rented his son Nancy Nancy. Julia Roberts works a bang-up in her role, but basically the women are really demeaned in this movie, and it's really annoying.
