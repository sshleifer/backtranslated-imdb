My suspicions about this show as both the daughters (14 and 11) parents and all the events tweens are targeted. First of all, I am always surprised that the conditions of the life of Drake / Josh, Jack / Kodi, Hana, Karli, Derek, Sunny etc. are always frequent and raging. Most people work hard to live for less than half a day of life, but some of these shows are not working, coming from work, paying utilities, rent, mortgages or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, toilet fixing etc. Curling jokes (most of which involve falsely and ridiculous results) and shirking work just walk and walk outside (and the broadest stairs that only exist on TV sets). I think there will be unrealistic expectations about how hard they will work for these children and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, sometimes a parent or father, but never both, who is not going on a sexless date, is a continuing family, but never divorce divorce (misconception, support, reasoning) seems to have no feel. Again, the children may get the impression that if the mother / father is divorced, the fun will be fun (actually the mother or the father almost does not help in the plot). There is no mention of spirituality (forget certain religion). Finally there is a theme that hurts me. There are good "nerds" in the school, "jocks" are good in sports, "good two shoes" as well. Plays are not good for school, sport, or charity, but make a stranger about those who are there. The message is not good at all, just the "notting" one who mixes the cricking jokes. Not saying that all of this shows an empty and always closes them and banned them in my house is just short.
