It's hard to understand what the audience's powerful film thinks. I would guess that the main purpose of this movie is to study a character and the effect of racism in a British community. Therefore it is frustrating that all the characters are in two dimensional and acting at the college's performing arts level. I am always skeptical about "reform", another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performance and sat in an audience who smiled when they were supposed to move by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I believe that a fine method of film works far better than setting it up with Troglell.
