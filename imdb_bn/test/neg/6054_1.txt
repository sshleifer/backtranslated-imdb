The only word to describe this ridiculous terrible production is "ridiculous" From the unexpected production value, the entire mini series is a remnant of a train, the origin of the source material (which annihilates somebody familiar with the archaeological identity of archaeologists) [<br /> <br /> The cast (which includes something good), which I regret) provides the same common generic "European" accent with unreasonable conversations which are common in bad epics. Lack of basicity of almost all other aspects of work (which combines styles of time and space) from work and set design (which includes many recognizable classical tunes as well as "Ling of the Ring") Most objectionable all visual effects, which alone prove that if you can not afford to do well, write them down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> "Adaptation." Maybe one day, someone will fix it.
