Sherman Hemsell Jefferson was particularly good at all the families. He was also very good at Amen, why would he do this movie on earth? This movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny people. Luis Avalos He is good but this is awful. This movie was at the beginning of bankruptcy for Sherman Hemesley. I think he's very funny but this is a terrible terrible vain story of Scratch. Stick with Ghostbusters.
