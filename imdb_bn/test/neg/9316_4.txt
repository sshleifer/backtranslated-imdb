As long as you understand that you are going with any historical truth in this film, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> It's equivalent to Sam Raimi's "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys". As a plot, acting, humor, and production values ​​are concerned. You will see similarities in different points. Most of the scenes are not good, but the film is suffering. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jacques Palance puts a screen on the screen as well, and never feels that he is giving less than that level the best of the level. The same for the Oliver Reid. The problem makes Done Diamont's low-starter performance skills even more painful to stave their strong performance class. Burnaby bit player Cass Anwer was very good, in the previous Hercules played a character like Salmanias. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy low-budget sword-and-magic movies in the 80's, you're probably going to enjoy this show. It's actually embarrassing that they combined the name of Marco Polo. There is no relation with Marco's life, unlike the expectations of most people who want to see this movie.
