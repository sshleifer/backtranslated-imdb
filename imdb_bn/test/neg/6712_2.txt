Why do the five US states repeat this repetition? The title really says it: The plot is clear as a book that you do not read in a language and do not feel anything with it. <br /> <br /> You will see 90 minutes of variable positions, most of them will fly after the movie. At the very beginning, you see a beautiful little farm suitable for Beri, which has been moved to Paris, but it does not survive "transportation" in Isle de France: it explodes after 1 minute. There are two gangsters who do not have any language, such as SMS and in the world of the world to be sensible, give pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It does not understand anything exactly as it goes. The story My only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is nice.
