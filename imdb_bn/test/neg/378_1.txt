I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this one was hated. For the same reason, it was almost terrible as 'The Never And Story Story 3'. Using a pyramid they adopted a fascinating world of Barbarian tribes, agricultural villages, magicians, supernatural creatures, and a worship of fanatical fanatics; And Rock and Roll is a mix of our pop-pop culture world, Sushi (I think it was what it was) and flash sports could be fun cars. These two worlds do together. I do not want to see a bunch of ancient miraculous people to dance some rock songs on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but this is just stupid. This is what Hollywood movies make better imagination when they run out of ideas. Do not give up though, Brax's eyes are much better. Which I gave 10. This one, while the portal, I give one. 1. Trust me, I do not always give a very high or low rating. I just tend to tend to comment on such movies.
