First off, if you want to make a good movie, do not chrome all your exposition in the last 10 minutes. It is expected to fool the viewer for nearly two hours, only Margot's parents have interpreted everything in Alex making this film very late. To make things even worse, the script writer decided that it was not enough to solve the fundamental mystery, but was added to an entirely unnecessary murder that we did not know (Alex's father involved!). <br /> <br /> Motivation topic with some serious characters. Margo's father's preferences are not understood after the movie is over Why did not he just kill the father of Philip and finish with him? Instead, one that is concocted with a complicated plot to obscure the truth, but one that confirms, including one which can be physical danger over the years (including the completely innocent photographer, which is killed by Philip's father's thugs). Although Alex is a doctor (someone who feels relatively brighter), he likes to flee from the police, in which he does not endanger his own life, but he is involved in a nasty play-up on the freeway. Why is Margo's friend Marago so interested in fulfilling his promise, once all the fans hit the fan for Alex? And do we think that Morgo's father will kill himself instead of going to prison? What about his wife? Did he consider his will? These are some of the major problems. <br /> <br /> There are some nasty details, such as: Why was the execution of death on his father's night? In this short notice, how did he hold the junky body and get it back faster to bury him with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno became interested in being part of Mahmud, where he and his friends had to kill Alex, although in the absence of a loan, he was owed to Alex to save his son's life. What will be the best of Margo? They will not catch Philip like this. And on that night, what does the mortgage safety deposit box useful for kidnappers? Am I missing something else? Probably. My tiny losses are actually this fact that Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. Which makes her marathon away from the police even more impressive. Also, when he roams with his lawyer, no one is wearing a seat belt. How can they be bright?
