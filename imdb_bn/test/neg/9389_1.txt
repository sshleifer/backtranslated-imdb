This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. At first I thought it was going to be good because I was interested in Bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. It all provided a bunch of hair explanations that could not understand (if the woman is not age and her boy is quickly puberty), and a terrible tragedy ends. Later, those who went to Bermuda would have to take all copies of this movie with them. Everyone voted for this movie so that it could get the worst movie list.
