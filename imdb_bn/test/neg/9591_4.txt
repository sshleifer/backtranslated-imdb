A possible good idea is to completely degrade by a weak script which eliminates all credibility from the window to do very little work with the actors. The chariot can make it all good by the mouth as it covers; There is no danger as a blurred heart and stamps can not determine whether a former London crew or some Taff is playing directly at the playground in Bronx. He does what he can as poor Laura Dell Sole, but his character is not more than the views of Latino women of every northern and European model, who are all pounds and hot moods. If you are a fan of the main actors do not let yourself be frustrated or fool yourself (since I have had many other critics here too). See it all the way but stay critical; You know these guys can do well.
