I always hate this annoying show. I like the "Doctor Laboratory" or "Magass XLR" show like cartoon networks. But I do not like this Turkish piece. Basically because it has stupid characters (well or villains feel mentally rescued) their stupid voices (especially Bubbud, are considered to be the "intelligent" character of the show, but she is incredibly annoying) the lines of the story are very stupid. Some episodes may be attractive but often show childhood and corny active. There was no favorite character, the music was awesome, and the animation was the worst that I saw. Even a five-year-old boy could draw good! I can not see why the whole world seems to love this piece of garbage. "Powerpuff girls" seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made. Fortunately, "Foster Home for Fictional Friends" was far away from the same creator.
