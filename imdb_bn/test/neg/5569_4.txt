I really wanted to like this movie, because it is different from everyday horror films clones, and I am grateful that filmmakers try to do something original. Unfortunately, the plots do not hold together and a letter does not like enough about them to really care about them or their fate. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the towbox was quite interesting. The directors took some risky steps, such as adding animations to parts (looking for flash) and special effects (such as a certain harmful light). Sometimes it works and sometimes it did, but he was eligible for COODS, and cinematography was generally high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, see the same method of throwing a lot of things in the wall when the plot is applied to the stick, the results were not very good. The film finds a voice that does not like, from a black comedy to the family soap opera, the 80's witchcraft voluptuous voluptuous family goes back to childhood until nostalgia. Their own, bits and pieces of each element of this material work fairly well, but nothing coheres into a fully satisfied. As well, big bits of the plot are not really explained. I'm not the one that likes to eat all the spoons for me, and I like movies that leave the decision to the audience, but the parts left from Toybox just think they have already gone out of the money. They can explain them or they really do not mind starting anything. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at the director's next project, because I think there are plenty of reflections here that are hidden here under the surface, but I can not really recommend Toybox on its own qualities.
