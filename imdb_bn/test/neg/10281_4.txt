First off, I'm Robert Blake's big fan, always been. <br /> <br /> This movie came to the movie last night at 10/13, and the title is interested in me as a star. But after seeing this, I was more confused than before starting ... I have some good views and I think they will lead somewhere, but they did not, it is an "anti-police" "anti-friend" "anti-Hippie ", Most" complete-everything movies ", which were not even very confusing. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is a leadership leader, great as well as someone who can live with this bad movie, I still love the great fan of Mr. Black and love his acting ... but this drug has inspired the 70's, well ... stay away from this ... and, that's the end, what a pisser.
