I enjoyed the beautiful scenery of this movie, when I saw it at the age of 9. Dunderklumpen is kind of tricky for a corny way kiddies. It reminds me of HRPUFFINSTUFF in the morning, its Swedish backdrop makes it easy to eye. Do not expect adult children to be as active as ever before in live action / animation and most older kids will get annoyed. It must be a film of less than 10 years old and a little memory of our little children in 1974.
