This is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Three main cast members just do not seem to be good clicks. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was quite annoying. For some reason, he said that he likes to repeat. If he is a "Rain Man", then it is all right, but he is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
