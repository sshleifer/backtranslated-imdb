It was a highly publicized movie before its release, but turned into a ugly turned. I never spoke to one person who loved this movie. I agree: I do not like it. Perhaps the box office success was not a big reason that it was nothing but unexpected characters in the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Law Linna or Dylan Walsh played any movie but played annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This, and a stupid story, makes this movie a big disappointment, especially considering that big buildup. Are film makers really going to be this hit with this conversation?
