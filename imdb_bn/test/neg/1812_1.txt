Humor of Darkness movie insults the book Joseph Conrad! The movie wants me to sleep very well. On the other hand, the book was definitely remarkable. I think the movie has gone out of a number of original elements and missed some of the main issues of the book. In addition, the actors were annoying and lacking in fundamentalism and encouragement. <br /> <br /> The book, though not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of plot and interesting twists. Although the book is very confusing and complex, surprising. When you finally understand it, you actually feel something learned. There were various original ideas like novels, or short stories, futility and craziness, which left the movie. In addition, different key views have been changed, which affect the whole plot of the return. Most of the scenes appeared to be "sticky", thus they did not fit together. In short, the film seems to be a bad explanation of the book. <br /> <br /> If you do not understand the book or the image, I would recommend only watching this movie, but otherwise I would avoid it. It was horrible, and in complete chaos. If you do not read the book, you will not see the movie because you need basic information in your book to understand the film. The movie was an awesome and detailed book close to an awesome spin.
