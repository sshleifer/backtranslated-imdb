I saw it in my city's independent movie - it does not surprise, because no mainstream theater will want to fingerprints the train's wreck. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very confusing. Constant Transfers, Returns, and Zoom A sedentary person may entice motion sickness. It looks more like a film project project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> While acting well, unlike characters. Josh is terrible, always trying to interfere in circumstances and human circumstances under his advantage. In any context of Emily and Josh's relationship, she marries as a troubled, insecure girl who is reluctant to marry. Rite is a mental child, unable to understand the complexity of the human interaction. Without any released qualities, I'm not worried about any of those events. <br /> <br /> Some people obviously liked this movie, because the couples sitting behind me fiercely smile. Of course, they can just make fun of it. I could blame them for it.
