There are major spoilers, for the off-the-spot you will be able to keep an eye on the story line. <br /> <br /> Well, we have a storm that destroys a city and computer hacker, which blocks the electricity grid. <br /> <br /> Estimated scales from the beginning, and if it is not enough then there is no doubt that there is a 5 second action barrier between film and advertising. For example: will they bring time to the airport? Things look slower as we go to a commercial ?? And before the ads shows their bouncing around in the zero before the action shots! Well, I think they have to make it after all? But then again, they were because they were good people. <br /> <br /> Acting was not very impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quay as Tornado Tommy), the effect was harmful, bad guys got it, and the good guys came through. The real disaster in this movie was the script, especially the end. They do not provide 24 hours notice for the soap opera as soon as possible, rather they also called hackers deliberately. So he is the cause of a Bazlian death ?? She meant good. And, of course, coming together to upload an ultimate TV report about me. To vomit. It was everything I expected from the commercial, and I'm glad I waste my time watching it. It will be a good conversation at noon lunch tomorrow afternoon. <br /> <br /> CBS is insulting us? Sure ?? But we saw it, right? During this pig, did you count many ads for home backup generators? <br /> <br /> The next plan 9 is expected from operating space (which gets better with each visit). It's not <br /> <br /> 1 star.
