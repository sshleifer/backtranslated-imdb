Before running by a car an Asian blowgun assassin takes the victim out of Niagara Falls and New York City. Rock Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, who gave a sunny "Southern Bell" dubbing to show from Alabama) came out to investigate through the disappearance of the murder and his sister Diana (Paola Senator). This brings him to New Guinea where he promises a $ 80,000 deal to identify his sister, a bottle guide (Robert Curman such as American porn star R. Bola) to identify his sister. After making it through a full-fledged cannabal forest, they found Diana, who is under the control of Jim Jones-type ritualist Jonas Melvin (Ivan Rasimov). Jonas is the common crazy guru-style thing, such as LSD pass, the group commits suicide, anyone who disobeys him and kills him, and squeezed Cobra's blood and rape Agren with a huge stain. Each time a character can be seen right or left in a short time, and a jury view will be taken directly from Junkel Holocaust or man from Man Rim (both managed by Lenzie). I'm sure they used at least two scenes from Cannibal Holocaust. Here we expect to see the victims of animal killings (trapping a gutter, eating live snake natives), as well as some extra nudity and an oxidation. I look forward to breastfeeding my hair, another lady, who has a three-member law enforcer on her joint crematorial husband's Ashes. The mail came back as a professor for a short time and he was not given much. <br /> <br /> So, with the transition VIVI! You get the full commitment to most of your nudity, cow, dead animals and one of these titles with the bad taste you expected, so if you are a sledge hole, you can see it all the way. Personally, I got bored with it through the middle and just wanted to finish. In 1985, the real (widely cut) title of the United States was titled The Emerald Junoon, so that people think they are actually hiring Emirated Forest of John Boorman. It is also known as the Dymeed Dyamed and was alive by the Kanibals!
