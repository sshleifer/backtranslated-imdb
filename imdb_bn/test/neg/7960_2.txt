Water shows the sadness of Indian widows in the late 1930s, eventually giving statistics, the issue most often refers to Gandhi, finally reveals the scene in which he is visible to the movie and generally does not invent anything more. Or new movie. Yes, cinematography is quite impressive but it can not be a movie spirit for me. <br /> <br /> India has had many problems like many other nations but they have resolved most of the problems. A movie was created in a special year on racism in America, which is "the number of X-American Americans still enjoy racism". <br /> <br /> How it would be relevant, and, b) There are some extraordinary things to be portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a Deepa Mehta interview that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for limitations. From the review I read in every place, the general thing I'm hearing is how the director has done a great job and was brave about the world's problems. The film is more about a specific problem that can face society (and these are redeemed by reform). <br /> <br /> I do not spread anything about the movie about the movie. Besides, there is a lack of soul in the film and it has been shifted between Chuiya and Kalyan plots. The young Sri Lankan actress, Sarla, acted in Chuay and was the only thing that made me worried about the movie.
