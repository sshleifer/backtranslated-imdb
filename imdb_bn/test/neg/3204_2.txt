(Small spinners) I bought this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and could not believe what I was able to do. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 films, at least humor (especially the third movie), but only critters rarely make a look, they were not funny! They did not let me laugh. I must admit that I start off the story nicely. After an hour, I remembered the movies of Crivery were always very small. So I thought to myself, "where $ ^% are # $ critters?!?" They were barely in this movie! After Charlie "sings the ship", the son Ethan was sitting on her bed and she knew that the crew was still on board! In the first film, Brown's family was afraid of their minds. But here, Ethan does not even care! <br /> <br /> Now what I'm going to say will be destroyed, but I'll say it the same way. In the first movie, finally, they had to face the demon Crater for the final battle. In the second match, the cricketer had a great ball. In the third movie, her crafty crater gave a spinach (Sony from Hedgehog) and was going to attack the little baby. But the fourth at the end (which makes me feel bad) charges cold chirater to Ethan, and Ethan kills it without doing anything. <br /> <br /> Now what I really did not understand was what happened. She was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then 50 years later, he was evil. That was very frustrating. Not only that, but he was not a helpless wild hunter? Why is he still "Johnny Still?" Plus he seems to have a different personality. He feels very smart and is not like the first two jewels. <br /> <br /> Anyone who actually enjoyed the first two movies and loved the third, I would like
