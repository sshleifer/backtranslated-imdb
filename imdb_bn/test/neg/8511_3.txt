I was a photographer working in the summer summer that Jim Suller's movie shot three. <br /> <br /> I made some dry pictures for him, which I was told as a movie poster. I do not see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A teen, because the material that went on it was mandatory. Robi Porter's girlfriend was beautiful like Rampoling. I asked the prayer, if I were around and there was an extra cameraman, they would not have to shoot everything twice. I'm sure, but I was back in the back, promise was back to NY. Hey, I do not get back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
