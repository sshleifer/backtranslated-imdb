And the worst part can be good at it. But something terrible is wrong First of all, Amitabh Bachchan should not have played in this film earlier. He let alone the very role of an icon to deal with a subtle and controversial issue. <br /> <br /> To get rid of the classic story of Lolita and shame, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of himself. Known as his Lolita Zia (acting by Zia Khan coming) and when we meet him, he stole any kind of ornament of oppression or the absurdity of that subtle impersonation, which is essentially associated with the complex story of Lolita, gradually nymphet Even before meeting with the camera, Verma's Zia has already won the award. And he practiced no fidelity in the way of his leading nymphet in his movie. Continuous panning shots of its crash-line have been fixed in its lazy gesture and method, Mr Verma has confirmed that in the audience he has kept a person uncomfortable with his Voicciosist Pionefill camera angle. <br /> <br /> I do not talk about chemistry of existing existence between Oh and Zia and her so-called friend Ritu (daughter of a child's character). These girls are supposed to be even the best friends even before they go wrong, look like bad enemies yet. They do not come together to believe nothing until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr Verma should not have been focused on destroying any credibility rather than on the basis of his script. Amitabh Bachchan may have gone as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this picture is probably the beneficial image of the child's character. Its role was so written and ridiculously wood that it is impossible for him to feel no grief or anxiety. I actually felt like normal woman did not react like to reach her slapping screen. Instead, he stood there and looked helpless, I imagine that most of the filmmakers can feel at ease after seeing this movie's tragedy. Look at your own risk.
