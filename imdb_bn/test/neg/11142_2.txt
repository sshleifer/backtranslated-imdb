I like underground films when they have something to say, or to show. I tried hard like "trash". I tried to see some artistic achievements or to see some interesting presentations of New York City life in the early 70's. Or at least give it entertainment? But the film is not frustrating and art and entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse for Joe Dalesendro's naked body to be exposed for 2 hours, when he meets other unintended, annoying statistics. Agree that, it's a fantastic body, but it's no excuse for a complete movie about it, right?). Holly Woodlawn finally gives some good smiles as Joe's girlfriend, but after that it is too late for several hours to get lost. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is one of those people and a good screenplay of that time, even if it is actually more interesting than it is. 1.5 / 10
