Why is most of the action films a similar example. Generic and annoying, there is really nothing worth watching here. Whole waste of ice and ice cube's only tapped shoots, everyone who has proved to many that they are able to act and perform well. Do not be bothered by this, see New York City, Ricochet, or see New York underworld for Ice, or look for Boy's En Hood, Higher Education or Friday's Ice Cube and see the original deal. Till the Ice T's terrific separation, this picture grows toothache, and I am still wondering what is Bill Paxton doing in this film? And why does he always play the same character? From the Alliance, the movies I saw with Bill Packethon played him the same annoying character, and at least his character has died in Alien, which makes it a bit beneficial ... <br /> <br /> Overall, the second rate action is trash. There are great movies to watch, and if you really want to see it, see the Judgment Night which is practically a carbon copy, but there is good performance and a good script. The only thing to look at the camera was a handsome hand on the camera - cinematography was often refreshing, which came to create a terrible movie for itself - but not many. 4/10.
