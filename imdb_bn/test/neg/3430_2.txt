Other than John Crisinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The story of Lacey Chabbert and Andrew Kigon's love was as much as possible, how incredible bad lines of his parents never allow them to stay together and did not appear very hammy link. There was no "emotional" no depth or reality. Two letter-lettering (Dean Edwards as Rupert and anyone playing it with gun experts) .... Once they saw how bad the sound was, did they not decide to rewrite a few lines to release them? Audience headache? Apparently not I do not even know how to start editing, especially with sound editing. If you hate me as much explicit over-dubbing as you like, do not see it. That said, Krasinski was great. Off the bat I'll admit that I have a huge office fan and so I rent this. But he is quite entertaining as "off-wall friend with insane ideas". He got a clichéd role, but he still managed to make it as entertaining as possible. The last was horrible. Just terrible out flat. The idea of ​​robbery is thought to have been horrific, but Kigen roams after firing, Chaver's painter (which does not show anything like him) is the most crien-worthy scene in his studio.
