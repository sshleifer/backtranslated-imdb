After reading a lot of good things about it, I finally saw "clearing". With a cast of great actors like Redford and Duffer, at least a decent movie will be expected. Even after the last credits were rolling, I wondered how this movie was actually bad and was inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" movie ?? I do not think that's because it's pretty much backed up. The bad thing is that the drama seems to be very compulsory and irrational. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the script does not give any knowledge at all. First, it does not explain the purpose behind a character action, it is simply their so-called "personal matter" It is so bad about the life of Redford's character that he has to "delete it"? In fact he cheated his wife ?? The man is a millionaire who has got a good life, he has a great son, a great girl, a wife that loves him (and a girlfriend that seems to be way above the generally owned woman) and a new born grandson. The only problem seems that he ... worked hard to be a successful person for his life. So what ?? It seems that his hard work really stopped and there was no real problem with his life. <br /> <br /> Then we came to Duffer's character: There is someone here who was a manager of a company in Redford and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed ... eight years ??? It seems that a person seems like a good job to get a job like his first job and a strong idea about his work (like seeing his conversation with Redford's flashback, he sees it working for him) Can not get and gain a decent life? Because he was fired, once? Completely unrealistic <br /> <br /> This picture is really trying to portray this man as "oppressed souls" or something else that really comes close as cheesy. Actually I would say that this filmmaker is trying to tell me something about American Dream. Chickens, they sadly failed. <br /> <br /> They did not even have an idea that happened during the movie. In fact, the film's last 20 minutes came as an insult to the audience. Intelligence, because there is something that really does not give any idea. Redford seems to have changed nearly 1000 possibilities, but he does not. He is ready to run in a moment and still thinks he missed his chance, sorry for his abductor and did not want to hurt him !!! Then Dapho lifted his gun from water and mud, which should be in vain (if you gun the gun after firing with a gun and mud it will probably blow in your face) and the gun is in perfect condition !!! Unemployed, unnecessary (portraying this film) and the path of mentally unstable character, thus easily brings the story of the FBI film to "Evening Zone" level. Chess finish (with the illusion of Redford's wife) to finish the viewer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> This image seems to be something that is not (ie, a quality, sophisticated psychological thriller). Unfortunately, it has become so difficult that it has become a catastrophe and the image is best described by: A Disaster.
