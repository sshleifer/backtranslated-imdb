Among all the adaptations of Alistair McLinn's books, I think it qualifies as the worst, but does not blame McClean! It will appear that all of the movies shared with the novel are the same title. We have no secret, there is no way to predict the mystery, there is no scope to really feel with the main characters. We spent the entire period (or at least I) waiting to wear Charlotte Rampolier's clothing (for Charlotte, it seems to take a great long time!). Still, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampoling's tits can not really save this crushing film. MacLean again appears to blame for all the ills that are trying to film his bookmakers who have been kicked in the guitar to endure sniping nasty hackers and nit-pickers. The poor old alistair must tremble in a corner and when it comes out it will be scared intensely. At least "beer island" - which uses McLinn's name but apparently any of his novels - a little exciting. The excitement here is waiting for the final credit here.
