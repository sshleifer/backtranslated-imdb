I'm living this first hour and I've been back for the last ten minutes, just saying I saw the end. If you want * real * myths, shamelessly execute, then look for the "ODC" of Arms Assent. The Great Story does not have to be tweaked to tell - stories are fantastic on their own. I hope the sun sleeve needs money. And Sophocal and Ovid must be rolling in their graves - wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least in the version of Sorbo, the tongue was cheated silently in the cheek - we knew it was mostly blades, but there was probably a lot of interest in creating a backstarter to send to the library. I was surprised that Halley could launch something so funny (TV series), and it could follow with something like that.
