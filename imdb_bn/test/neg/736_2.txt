I saw some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day, but this is the top of them! Wickedly unreasonable story distorts itself from the story, which itself is untrue in the book. Mr. Tilani is nothing like handsome; Like Catherine Moorland, a mouse-like appearance makes this heroine difficult to sell to sympathetic audiences. There is nothing like Ezbella Afrodite that can be read in the original text and James Merland was present in this film, with very little understanding of his important role in the philosophy, leaving the audience less. Also, as mentioned earlier by others, this novel was intended to ridicule Gothic like madman during Austen, but it seems that this "soft horror" film has been designed and taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen wanders around her grave every time, frustrated by this terrible interpretation that one of her fans is a curiosity.
