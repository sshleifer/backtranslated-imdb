A movie is not very good. Sure, this is action, but it's not all good for a '08 movie. Gunshot effect is cruel terrible. Actor "Meh" <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not like a verse, but the basics of the story except the name (genetically modified advanced soldiers going to Amoe). Super soldiers are very different, apart from the tenants, the setting is quite different (in the game Pacific Islands, on the island of North America in the Americas). <br /> <br /> Cry. I like the story and setting. I hate movies.
