What is wrong with American movies this day? Hollyweird produces movies that act like men, acting like men and men. The stupid male director and writer of this film must check their heads. The main problem of this film is the extreme feminine screenplay of sex. In its scenes, Eva Mendes and her friend are swimming from beer bottles, as you can find sailors on oil. Tankers doing so at a bar in Iceland. Mendez constantly kisses every girl after that she shows up. He sees each scene provocatively, yet curse like a guy. When he fought for a while with Will Smith, he became very emotional, when he was trying to "defend" all the women from bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> Men are not good at this movie. What we see is a bunch of weddings that are trying to do something that they can achieve a date. The men of this movie are unable to speak explicitly when facing sexual harassment or women. Men do not behave in this way in real life. <br /> <br /> What we see in this movie is that a culture of culture is very dangerous. Everything is flip-flop. The boys work like girls, girls work like guys. These facts put the extreme view of sex in a part of the story. Men are shown as soft and stupid, but in most cases only sex shows sex, even though women are shown as masculine and excessive reverence but they are shown as a veneer for their psychological insecurity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The objection has not been presented to the audience. The content is not criminal. The method in which it is presented content.
