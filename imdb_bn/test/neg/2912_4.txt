Let's be hard that movie that people are probably sorry for years after they are sorry. The horrific racist Japanese conversation and comedy is full, this East and Kid's story tells how children want to join the military to defeat Japs. Since they are very young, so they decided to clean the city outside these great zaps. They found one, gave fruit spots (which did nothing to stop them) and he pulled a small sword for their damages! Police tell him to bother! He's just Chinese! He is on us! China's people die if they ask for apologies! All this part of this huge jap and German Spy Ring! The kids are close at the cost of seeing that! I'm sure it was all right when (1942) was created but now that it's been seen, of course you realize that it is obviously a product of it. Stereotypes, full of German and Japanese. Interesting how the East and Kidodes group has a black kid, and he or she is not. Gee whiz
