I do not like anything more than a Kung Fu movie that laughs. I can not stand Jackie Chan (or his face). She was not always a shoe, I must add. "My Young Anty" is the most serious martial arts. This is a perfect example of how subgenars were pushed into the mat by foolish fools and childhood behaviors. Unless you are 5 years old, I do not realize that some of this kind of funny movie can be found. But humor is really a very interesting thing. Personally, I think this kind of system has permanent damage to the subgenier. I think the leading lady who was very good here. But I had a hard time that I could not enjoy his good performance. If you do not feel all silliness, you can enjoy it. I do not know if I do not.
