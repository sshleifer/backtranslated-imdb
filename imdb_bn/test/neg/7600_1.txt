A very bad movie above Beethovan Lives. In my world history class, our teachers saw this movie and Amadeus being able to compare two composers or something. We first saw Amadas and it was a very good movie, but when he saw this movie directly later, I could not believe what I saw. The acting was horrific, the costume was ugly (little boy was particularly ugly and girl), and cinematography was z grade. My friend compared it to a home movie with the date shown in the bottom right corner. I understand it was a TV movie from Canada and probably cost $ 10 to spend, but please, they could do better. I saw some good TV movies in my time, but it was not one of them. I do not understand that the biggest thing is that the class of my world history is not just immortal favorites or anything. How is it possible to compare music when giving an Amadeus movie for bees, and living for Bethovan Bethovan? It is not possible to do it when it likes the movie for Beethovan. I'm curious to know if someone amadeus an- (9 out of 9), but Beethovan gets an F (10 out of 10) above Lives.
