This movie shows that you can create a movie that can make a movie if you have a camera, some extra paint and a cardboard, a toy ship, some friends acting in the community theater and wrong ideas. The end result is an unwanted time-dissipation which you will avoid, unless you take it out of the DVD player and toss the window first. <br /> <br /> Credits are a good indicator of what you would like to do before "crashing" in the early action (especially by 'Hurricane Lee Morgan as Captain') and the toy ship "crashes" before. (With all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" has been shot in a kitchen sink. I guess Boyette figured she would save some cash by washing at the same time). According to the bad movie, the interesting thing is "Harrow of the Harrow" inspired (probably coincidentally) "Manas: The hand of fate" Yes, it's the same lame "I was a victim, and now I take the place of crazy villain". It's ironical end. Large satirism is two incompetent, talented filmmakers can create two equally damaged, Texas-based horror films and can go away with it. <br /> <br /> Monoton Nerd R. Harvey has never been a great man in a great family line, he's never been big broached), his ship even crashed the death of his family line and crest before crash (even though we are treating it with a droning description across the film) When we are annoying Sadly, we are not very lucky. His family's toy ship crashed into some staphofams in a synch, and he easily deposited with his leak captain and some women on the Crazy County island. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit, Blackstone's Magic Kit dressed in a suit, attacked him with various dolls (spiders, snakes, bats ... all icky stuff). Counting (William McNullet) became worse than Satan's and apparently spent a hard time keeping straight face with common madness. <br /> <br /> If I lived in this disaster I would be crazy too. The woman was immediately killed by genocide dogs, and two quarrels were captured by her husband. Counting accuses them of pirates (perhaps his most fearful fear), he crushes many people around him (probably his greatest pleasure), Fatabah is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and a nurse, a rolling leper. Non-wedding dress in Unogocalli County (he excavated Nerdy Nobel and the only effective and obscure film in the movie), many unknown dialogues in the dining room table, blubbery captain was killed during a fierce departure. (A sloth war lion watching a pack). . . It's all my ugly fog. I spent most of my time in the fast-forward button. <br /> <br /> However, blurry magnates and nurses make a holiday and think they will rescue three people in a row boat in the lake. Yes, we believe that a lake is sea). They are not, because Nerd's hair has become gray and he is afraid of the asylum seekers. Indeed, I think they took the opportunity to take away the opportunity to move away from this terrible film. They return to the sickle, the nurse starts counting the counties (and your stomach, by this time), and we're ready to end with these two. . . Harrog DANZAN !!!! Blatch! <br /> <br /> I love old, shy horror films, but they must have some of the recreational value. I ripped off for this biscuit even off at a low price of $ 5.99. Mystery science theater will be a difficult time making this one fun. I was caught by some fist critics, who claimed that this film is about the atmosphere and some rare moments. Wrong! Avoid this trip at all costs, and if you do not find a single dollar bin anywhere, do not waste a seed. This movie creates Karman's "The Terrorism" which is awful and a wonderful composition in the atmosphere.
