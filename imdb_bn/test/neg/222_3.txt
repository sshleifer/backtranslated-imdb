I went to see this movie today, hopefully it will hold at least half-hearted story. I was very disappointed, as it was not. The plot, and the decision by the main character, was so far fetched. I was expecting a "dog day afternoon" type movie, but instead got something completely unacceptable. I really expected myself to open a "hero", and this incident should not have happened, but I often went out of the theater. Good morning movies do not look good, and it only tried to do it. Within a few minutes of the second half of the movie, I said to myself, "There is no way". Without giving the whole story, it was roaming around an armored car guard, who was financially down and out and whose house was in foreclosures. He was invited on a heist, and took, once the action started only back to back. Weaker
