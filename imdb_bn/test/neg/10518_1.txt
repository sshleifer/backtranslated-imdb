There are some great Canadian movies. There is some crappy. Last night, I saw a crappy one. It was not usually Canadian movies where it tried to be different by arty. This movie tried to be some kind of Hollywood gangster film. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> I had a feeling from the beginning that it would be a bad movie. It was something of cheesiest dialage that could be a movie. This was a voice for the scene and then it did not return. That always bugs me, when filmmakers can not think of another creative way to tell a story when they use voice. <br /> <br /> I know being in the Canadian film industry, I should support my fellow brothers, but this movie is junk. The proof is just something that is not realistic. Some banker's mafia boss orders his son to bed and the boy to legalize the business. So the original is not And workers complain about it, but they only accept the fact that they will soon work without doing anything. They use extortion to make it legit. Scandal But not the best kind. Then there was some scary show girl who had a horrific Elvis wig and the sign of birth was halved by half of her face and the rond raped her. Anyway, whatever this girl likes to wear as girls. Then this banker hooks up with a hooker, when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he read it for the hooker because Hooker dressed like a man and kept a makeup on it. She blackmails her with some pictures of her wearing bra and panties. Yet, he still loves her. There is no reason to leave her maternity leave, but she works to stay with Hooker. <br /> <br /> For a movie to organize crime and sexual fetish, there was no action or sex. It was like a cinemax porn movie on a late night without things like that. The sex scene scene was not hot or sexy. It was all very amateur. There was nothing for the film, only the crippled plot. <br /> <br /> I was not the actor's fault. I had a terrific script to work with them. The most ridiculous characters are the most stuck The bad guy's name was Uncle Bani or something. But the name was not important. It was all clich√©. Dialogues were ridiculous throughout the film, and fellow movie-gear laughs at some moments of "critical" moments. Then, it's all the worst. It will be the cheapest end. You can never remember playing out as a kid with a fantastic gun or toy gun. That was basically the end of the movie. But I was far more than happy, and I had to warn my fellow Canadians to watch the movie or to waste money.
