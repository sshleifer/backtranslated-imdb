If you are going to create a movie from a book, make sure that the characters are compatible with that book. This film is not only written in the Bible, but it has been reported to children for thousands of years for thousands of years, but it has clearly embraced independence that will never try any adaptation. At least the colorful Lord is near enough for the book that people wanted to read this book, if they wanted to read this book, "Noah's Ark" tried it.
