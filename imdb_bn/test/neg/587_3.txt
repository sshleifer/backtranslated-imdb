Wow, well, you know what shock things people use in hospital to get your heart pumping again? After watching this movie I was in need for my brain. It literally saw me for about 4 hours because I had to take a break and my brain had to be repeatedly restarted for semi-normal functioning. I mean that this movie seems to be funny in Swollo, this script was liberal about 10 pages of dialogue. They just do not talk !! And talking is not everything at all, and I acknowledge that there were some scenes where only music was needed and the music was great, perhaps it was the best part, but then listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. Many people gave this amazing review, and for its time, I used to say that special effects and cinematography are good, but for acting or lacking it only needs more, no trumpet or sex etc. ., Neckness even needed, but a little more passion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long face. After all, if you need something to calm yourself, then just play the movie, if you see it before, do not start at the beginning, just start, start somewhere and relax, it will give you sleepy right.
