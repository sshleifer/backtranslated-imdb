It's a violent horror film with good acting and camar-work, but I would say it's just that Hicker Flickr is frustrating and lined with poor camera-work - see 'Ju-On: The Garage will waste your time with this garbage. The main idea behind the film is the overthrow of killer-doll-based terrorism which has been decided upon us over the years; Unfortunately, the story is managed with the benefits of the latest Michael Bay Activayvar, which plays a clear cut of characters that is completely unlikely, and is played with clear-spirited horror by actors removed from one-day Korean Soap opera. It's not awesome and succeeding to succeed only in reducing the hopes of next Korean horror movie. Well good
