It showed me a DVD of a DVD bought for me. They were completely different movies in which it was listed as "Savage Gun". Obviously, the DVD package does not bother to see the people burning on the disk. <br /> <br /> However, this film is as bad as it's been. Soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Army James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Lots of galloping around this music. It seems that the man has to interrupt in the scene for some time to burn and do some of the visible people. <br /> <br /> English is dubbed in Italy and it really shows up. I think it was a little bit worse and then it was something of the feeling of cam footage of Ed Wood. As it turns out, it's just normal horror.
