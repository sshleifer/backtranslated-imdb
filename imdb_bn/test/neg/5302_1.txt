Although I think the hated critics of this film have just decided (everything!), I had to add two cents to me. If you want a long version of this movie terrible, please read the review by printed discussion. Here's a short version: Their talent (none of them brought "this game"), unclear business (I suppose that Pepsi could stop advertising in an advertisement against the shameful use of NAMES's shameful use of actors - or 40 - now in a movie), and a plot (???) which was so slow that "Rock Star" clich√©s that it was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I'll put you this way. . . I was thinking about 'Waynes World', I was watching this movie all the time, but I could not laugh! Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) you got serious problems to help your movie plot any time. <br /> <br /> Please warn your friends and family - this movie is damaged.
