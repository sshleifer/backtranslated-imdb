The movie itself is not bad ... until you see the original movie hit (2005), Will Smith will act as well. Most of the film is a direct copy of this dialogue translated from English to Hindi! The original plot was strictly executed. Hindi version failed to make viewers interested. David Dhawan's extremist comedy seems to have been the greatest shouting ever with Govinda ... Sometimes it is more time spent to understand its causes than plots. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I guess you're reading this, see the original Hollywood. You see at least "hit" the partner has been able to compare. Like David Dhawan, "induced" people are evicted abusively, we can do this to support the creative forces of whose work.
