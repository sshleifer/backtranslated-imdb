The bone collector was set up in New York City and the world's first major criminal expert and crime scene expert Lincoln Raim (Denzel Washington) began to engage in an accident and left him a tragic quadrilateral. Four years went ahead and Alan (Gary Swansein) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) were abducted, soon the New York police super Amelia Donaghie (Angelina Jolie) was called in criminal justice and Alan's burial and explosive body was found. Amelia proves some unusual crime scene and creates a note in it which is influenced by Rime when asked to act in that case, she quickly realizes that these proofs are actually a mysterious source of Lindsay's position. Police broke the instructions that were too late for rescue, but it only killed an adventurous serial killer from the beginning and released forensic sources for rhythm and police ... <br /> <br /> I had yesterday told the bone collector I saw and said it is one of the biggest budget postings of The Silence of the Lomes (1991) and she 7en (1995) serial killer thriller I saw it, actually it's Friday 13th (1980)) Sophisticated and realistic look! The script written by Jeremy Eckon was based on Jeffrey Diver's book and so many of the levels were so poor that I do not know where to start. At first it seems deadly, and it seems to be twice as bad as all other errors. The character is really awful and I do not believe that any of them were genuine humans. First of all, we've got Lincoln Raim, who is paralyzed from the throat and the script can not do much with it, in fact, he can not do much, but he is lying on the bed for the whole film. He appears with Amelia because he stopped a train and thought that a new footprint near a murderer could be relevant, I'm not here funny, but could it be some relevance to a police that does not understand a footprint near an assassin? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is no Captain Cheney who is not just impossible and does not shout to everyone for any reason, but is unable to connect with some murders in a short time, where the body and skin of each victim is removed from their body in surgery This guy can be a police captain? So the killer's motives are less than curiosity, are you trying to tell me that they have made a complex plan to kill at least seven people, because they spent six years in prison for what they did? If they want revenge in rhythm, why they killed all other people who had no relationship, I might want to buy only one person to take revenge, who threw them away but could not kill many other people, with whom There was no relation, goal target rhyme anything else. They also create a complex plan to kill this man, and after taking away it suddenly becomes the most stupid person in history, although they hold a large knife and are able to walk and use their weapons, they are actually defeated and almost Died in a quarter. There is no movement in her body under her neck! How did that happen? I want to mention Amelia also a terrific character, she actually buys her own camera, because of a scene, taking a photo view and shoot goat. <br /> <br /> The story of the story of some bad writing and the plot is very good, we will never find why the literary book of the killer bone is being used as an inspiration, because we could never find the murderer being able to grab meat from his victims. Before the right forensic parties, it was never explained why a rocky police like Amalia was not allowed to enter the crime scenes. There is no reason why the killer likes his victims. The murderers' sources are a little unclear, is not it? I mean a bloody animals bone and shaved rats hair? How can someone logically move the precision pinpoint position of the bone and rat hair and choose from New York entirely? Some rhymes sitting on the window trail are meaningless about something which is just completely random and almost bore-bones almost two hours are going really slow. There is a lot of misunderstanding with the bone collector and it comes in one of the worst scripts of all time, it has crushing and zero credibility at all levels. Apparently Angelina Jolie said that she shot naked scenes for this movie but she was cut because they became very confused. <br /> <br /> The bone collector produces well with the estimated budget of $ 48,000,000 and the quality that Hollywood shines about. I must add now that I think Angelina Jolie has one of the worst performances in her, I think she is absolutely terrible. Denzel Washington is lying right there, Queen Latifa's horror and even Michael Rumar can not do much because he is stuck with a clean and one dimensional character. <br /> <br /> I have seen several times that the bone collector has to be one of the biggest movies of Hollywood, I saw it free on the telephone last night and I still feel cheated and bursting. There are so many things to tear so cruel, embarrassingly horrible, or should he be embarrassed? No way to be honest ...
