This is a really insulting show. For example, in reality, fewer TVs have fallen than 'reality' styles. Tania is fantastic but she has a very rude and terrible taste. Is the place for a home sexual appeal show? Apparently some men show up because they find tania interesting. The other boss is not spanking but he is completely rude and has terrible taste. Unfortunately, many homes should be shown when someone still lives in them. Most people who want to see these rooms before the change should be moved to new places or completely empty places so they will not insult others. Most of them .. like 'crew' .. to learn humility. I can imagine how terrible it was when British curiosity was shown, since British realities have become worse in procession and taste. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and after some years) it was filled with treatment. Now it's a big trash machine.
