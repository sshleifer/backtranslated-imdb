One day around the life of a small cab driver: The cab driver chooses the rental ... They have a 'really insightful' interlude ... he closes the rent ... He takes another hire. Another interlude ... and so it goes like this for 90 friggin 'minutes ... it's one minute even sure (or interesting) ... it's Sky!
