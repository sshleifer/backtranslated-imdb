It was funny because the whole thing was so unreal, I mean, like a pop star, a public high school will show up and love will fall for that girl, which can be covered with her? Come on, man! <br /> <br /> Everybody congratulates the actress. The dialogue was Chess, the premiere was stupid, and the camera work was done badly. I felt like I saw a badly created home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I have lost almost two hours in my life that I will never return. <br /> <br /> I do not have to say anything else, except that I want to see this movie again but rather lean more than once.
