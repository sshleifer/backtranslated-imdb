This is the worst waste I've ever experienced. Even the first one is close. The story lines were difficult to follow - the plot was weak - the best. The whole thing looked like three stories that they tried to bind together and make a movie. There were some good lines here and there - and the effort of the message was commendable, but they moved from Houston to New York in Dialas. It was difficult to know the time taken during the present period. The film was just over an hour and it seemed as if we were sitting in the cinema at around 4:30 in the afternoon. Points for Maven to be honest - but a boy does not have to feel what Crank had to do. Do yourself a favor - see Kuzco again.
