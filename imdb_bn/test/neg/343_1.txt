It's OK movie if it will be done by high school kids for their friends. It is called the "professional" way to the limit below. There are no plots, no actors do not play and visual appearance as you see it through plastic film. I am very happy that my remote has an FF button, 32x has worked really well. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but it does not have to be brought to the public. If you have concerns about quality and budget - "open water" was created at $ 60000 and more than half of people provided sea safety and trained in sharks. And that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event to create ind indie film.
