It's a really bad waste of your time. I would probably go to watch some documentary than this; It's really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is really terrible, and you can say that the makers had low budget due to the quality of the picture. By the lower end of the scale; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, when my child was hired I had to meet the kids because he thought that it would be good for the kids. Even the kids (3, 4, 6, and 8) thought that it was quite annoying. <br /> <br /> I agree with another commenter, will look better than Spanb. Overall: Do not just see it. No No
