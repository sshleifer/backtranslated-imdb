Director / Screenwriter Allan Barnes seems to have scrambled two different scripts together before coming up with these small fingering: A humorous story about dishonesty and a melody about loss and hostility. This is the result of a wincingly unfunny film. Christine Lahti is a harmful, alarmed TV news reporter who has made a friendship with Aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon dinners with Moore and her family - just to discover Mary Swami (Ted Danson) is the secret thing! Barnes has a strange, stop-and-start lao in her conversation that is not realistic, but effective (only growing annoying, because nothing seems to be important). Rail-thin Moore is horrified looking at her letter, she has a laughable smile but does not satisfy her as Donson's wife, and Danson is stuck with a runaway, ungrateful role. (He's just a cad there). The film is a classic case of maximum perfection (women's role in the workplace, TV news-betage, cheating family men, working wife and mother, who want more, women try to cover all the bases for women's friendships.), But not enough from these ideas Because Barnes only half-heartedly examined the matter. As a writer, he is surprisingly freed from punchlines, but in addition to one purpose, and plotting heavy just gets all fouled up. * **** to 1/2
