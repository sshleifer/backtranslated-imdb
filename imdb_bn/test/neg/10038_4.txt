I wanted to like this movie. I really did, really. I saw the preview when I was very excited, which was afraid of hell from me. But when I saw the actual movie, I was frustrated. Acting submerged, and effort at the comedy is naughtyly forced out and out of place. And I'm sorry, but being a boy followed by a turd in a bed is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on Bell's Witch legend, so I know a lot about it. Many movies are going on well, but this film should have been better. For example, the entire birthday party scene lasts for fifteen minutes, does not add anything to the plot or story and should be kept in the cutting room floor. More heavy elephants may be able to get a decent movie from this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand that I am not a figure or form associated with another Bell Witch film, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb list. I'm just saying it like that.
