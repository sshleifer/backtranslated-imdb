I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, on which my views could be affected. I have seen movies on Dogma, and this TikiA, the worst ever so far. This story is related to themes from Shakespeare's plays: King Lear, but was not successful in maintaining and caring for viewers. For the Dogma style films, even the directors of the act are very loose, and as a result, poor undefinable acting. The story lacks any movement, and soon I lost interest. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to shock the viewer, but I do not think they have enhanced the story. Miffuns Sidost Sang and Feston both Dogmuffelms which are well-managed and have good stories, so I will wait for future Dogmittles to do better. Perhaps it will prove to lift the Sandgren's "invisible man-dog 6" quality again. He is the founder of Winterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is a skilled and educative director.
