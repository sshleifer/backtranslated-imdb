Spirir: The real road house is one of those movies that I know about Clichad and Origin, but it's been great, I'm really embarrassed to accept it. Many of my friends activate, whose movie opinion I respect, think the same way. So when they tried to make a sign of it and it was written by some high school kids, who had been given a right to siggle, it was just bad; Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, Janathan Shake is listed as one of the authors and I hope her WGA membership will be withdrawn. The text was very bad and all the writers of this film should be completely lacking in the basicity and retire for the worst dialogue in this millennium. Shake seems to be the King of the Straight to DVD Siegel (8 mm 2, Poison Iv2) and now seeing this and seeing 8mm 2 I think his acting ability does not exist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " People send a punch that sends. This movie is repeated throughout, bad worse than the 1970's. Or many people involved in the fight seem to be full of cherry kool-ed for some reason. And we believe that Will Patan is a war machine; His battle scenery was so amazingly fake that I was honestly embarrassed. <br /> <br /> This ridiculous movie is full of reasoning laptops, it is terrible. For example: Zathlon Shake's character is for a day in town and already telling some girls that he does not know at all, who knows, "I'm with Feds, but do not tell anyone." Female villain who beat a good girl in a huge competition, who competes with a super hero, but easily can hold hold of the other hand with the will paten, "old man", when she does some ridiculous things. Line ("hit me once, shame for you, hit me twice, it will not happen", it's bad) and then headbutt Jake Busce Villen is shot dead in the farm while fishing in mid-fish, yet no dea agent or anyone easily goes to his place and takes him away, in fact, he can easily go because "it's the Sheriff area." The Barry Bar wants because it is "in a great position" for drugs, but it seems just right to offer all its offers just as the bar is supposed to own. Zaththan Shake's character is generally considered to be the son of Patrick Swayze, but the last name of the character of Swaz is Dalton and Shake (the supposed brother of No Swayze). And Jathlon Shake watched about 50 in this film. I saw it, she is younger than 17 years old, but she looks terrible. <br /> <br /> But my favorite stupid scene of this movie was the highest stock battle scene in the movies! One second window on the floor and they pan down as I think "Please do not tell me that he has stolen ..." And of course, my worst fears have been realized. <br /> <br /> In fact, I could go for another half-hour about what I hate about this movie. Do not wait, let's start the theatrical straight-to-DVD signals, at least in the theaters, with at least Johnathan Shake.
