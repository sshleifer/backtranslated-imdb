This image keeps a short moment in rural Russia for a mother and boy, because she's dying. <br /> <br /> I like to love the film or test the patience. On one hand, the film is beautiful, the Sparsh dialog holds the essence of their feelings. There is nothing to say, because what needs to be said is expressed outside of the words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards her mother, I think it is a celebration of unconditional love for a family. This cruelly reminds me that I can be in such situations, stuck in a lovely place, take care of a very sick person. "Matt I Scene" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Matt I Scene" really came slowly. More than 1 minute to see the train on the horizon? With the previous experience of my "Teletis" and "Alcal√°ndra", I was tempted to set up a "Matt I Scene" among them roughly. <br /> <br /> I think this film should be in the right place, to appreciate the mind. I can see its beauty, but perhaps I am not in the correct position of mind.
