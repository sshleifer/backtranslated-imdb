This is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all time. I started to see this right after interviewing with Vampire and I was completely frustrated. The script of this movie is not as big as the Grand Canyon, but the movie jumped from one scene to the other and was completely annoyed by the audience. Playing Stewart Townsend Vampire Lestat was terrible - a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was very simple and casual, obscuring the intelligence of viewers. I will give this star because Aasiyah has actually tried his best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Even then, I would suggest Anne Rice to take the ax and start hacking those who have destroyed her brilliant story.
