First of all, since I'm a person who saw the cut-up version of the MST3 movie, I can not comment on it. <br /> <br /> However, I have seen its original version of the movie in the science fiction channel and I think it was as good as anything else on that channel. Actually, I think it was one of their best gifts. <br /> <br /> I have noticed comments here that those who have written about Suleker with intelligence, thinking and maturity, at least they are about this movie and something like that. For this reason, I think most reasonable people will probably rate at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five are average to me and I think this movie is average for Saif Faa. On the contrary, I noticed that the critics seem imperfect, neutral and flip, and as a result I am standing where I am standing, like a bone, they can not find anything good about this movie. Basically it trash it because it cuts up and fricasseed on MST3K based on it. Or they seem to have seen both cuts, they were too confused with seeing MSST 3K.
