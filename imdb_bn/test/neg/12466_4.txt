Movie Title - Tart <br /> <br /> Date of Review - 5/26/02 <br /> <br /> Year of Film - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominic Swine, Brad Randro, Biju Phillips (Just), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An "expulsion" Dominic Swine wants to stay with "in" group and so she joins them with abandoning her true friends .... ... many annoying rich people Tidera said. Acting <br /> <br /> Oh, I suppose that I want that Dominic was right, but people, in addition to the rest of the cast, were probably not bad, Brad Ronfro was not at least funny or favorite. I know some others were good because they hated me .... believe me .... I like unlikely characters but this group is unlikely because they can not be faithfully bad people. <br /> <br /> According to its statistics, the only people I found it were in it and it was Melanie Griffith and Biju Phillips, but they were just right. Melanie might have said two lines, but at least it was a good character in Vizu. <br /> <br /> Envy and Gore <br /> <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly attacking from horror dialogues and from very annoying characters. , That enough violence !! All right, there was a rock that was just a rock that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To help the laser of this movie They could not add any nudity. Because someone wants to tolerate their body for this bad thing. If they want to express themselves, they will have to do this in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and "Oh I have heard that he gets naked." <br /> <br /> Overall viewing movie (reviews) <br /> <br /> Well, I know, I think of myself as a proud person who sees at least some good without having almost all the movies. I have really struggled to find some of this movie. The problem with this movie is that it is very annoying. I have already deeply hated the attitude of rich people and it also does not help. This film is actually a group of rich people sitting around rich and stupid acting. I can not stress enough boring factor. This movie tries to try and restore the real "group" platoon which can be fixed by a little harder. <br /> <br /> Why do not you have pictures from the cover of my picture or box? Well I felt that this movie is not worthy of that glory, so I decided to hire this rent, and that is no other than the Dominican Swan. Yes, I liked him very much in Lolita and thought he was so good that I tried to test him in any movie from him. At least I keep my promise and yes I have seen most of her movies, some find it difficult to find some. She herself is a great actress and I will actively defend her, but people like to act in her biggest film. Both of these films and smokers were in the same boat for confiscation, but at least the smokers had a great idea for the story and even some real good scenes. <br /> <br /> The DVD box also tries to fool you into the movie, as well as name it in front of Melanie Griffith and Biju Phillips Box. If there is a thing that P **** removes me, it's a movie that you think plastered the names of the stars in a box, "Wow, it's ____. I'm surprised how ___ I saw ___ in this movie and I thought he was great! "There can be a big name in the film for 10 minutes in only 10 minutes. Bijou was actually a part that was semi-meaningful. Melanie on the other hand, there are only 2 lines .... Please do not like Melanie much, but it's about morality and not star. <br /> <br /> In all this world though Proms will go to Brad Renfro for a just turning performance along with Dominique. Brad can be a very screwed up child in real life, but at least he can work. So a pillar of this movie is available because what I originally wanted was the Dominique Swine and Brad Randroo. I was also happy to add to the underlying actress Biju Phillips. Although I was annoyed throughout my life, I came up with some positive attitudes, although this time was difficult. <br /> <br /> I saw you Lolita and know how good the domain is if you want to see it. Or if you're a band or some offshoot fan. Uber Melanie fans will be sorely depressed. Also if you are a fan of vague movies like me, please do not feel guilty guilty because you feel guilty for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> <br /> Some movies are saying "they're good that's so bad". Did they forget to add "so bad they're good (to pass)." <br /> <br /> <br />
