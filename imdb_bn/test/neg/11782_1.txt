My Website (www.theflickguy.org) is always the most popular of this pickup as the movie. Here's a quote: <br /> <br /> "If I was sitting on the chair and I was forced to watch this movie again, I would not have thought that the hell was bad." Jim Verney, crazy man, is looking at the destruction of the earth in three hands. (Apparently starting with the movie). Now face it, I do not expect from a varnish movie, but this annoying drivel has dried me for 92 minutes-Heavy It does not laugh, it's not a camp or a gigki, it's not stupid, it's a bad thing, it's a waste, it can ruin your DVD player, do not buy VHS for use as a 29-second clearance bin, as an empty tape. Bad film duration. I really like it. "
