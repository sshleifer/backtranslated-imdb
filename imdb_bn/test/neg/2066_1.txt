I do not even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It is not worth typing a review, so I quote another user's post because I totally agree, but I can give 1/10 instead 2 / 10 "I have suffered losses to find out how bad I thought this picture. The initial proposal was committed, but later it was completely awkward. Plot - Good initial idea, but really terrible development, there were many thoughts when "I did not think anyone would do anything stupid." The finishing was remarkably anticlimatic. Characterization - all the characters were completely soft or extraordinary. Probably not - perhaps the mother, but this is the music - infiltrator, inappropriate and usually terrible. Mpurnarupe amateur. Cinematography - they have no doubt about it. The camera angle / stability / zoom level is often bad. This film has such a high score, how completely bemused am. This is the worst movie I have seen the film, if not ever. "
