They make everything very easy in this movie. It reminds me of Indiana Jones, where she hides a submarine while crossing a sea crossing. Everyone knows what's happening, if you want to get anywhere in the White House, it's easy. I do not even know why I saw half. Because I like Charlie Shane and Donald Sotheraland. I hope to be able to speed up bullets from every angle and drive faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a garage or an elite car). It was pretty stupid, in most cases I did not know that there were 10 stories in the White House. However, some conspiracies are always interesting.
