Wonderful if a man gay his malicious coworker At a yard sale he found a ray gun called "Gaydar". Point it to a person, drag the trigger and it tells you how many gay they are. She tries to do it, it works and she sets out to find out if her colleague is like her ... <br /> <br /> An incredible script (after a promising start) and terrible acting. The whole throw overacts and essentially scraps their line to each other continually. It is annoying and after a while gets really embarrassed. The blessing of preservation is that it is short, it is a sight theft cat (the love of his cat bed) and Charles Nelson Raleigh is a bit violent. But none of these stores the movie. I can recommend at all.
