Certainly the fireman does other things, like getting a cat out of the tree? Well I was wrong, and continued to repeat, until the end. <br /> <br /> The film is a good aspect of the fire itself, filmed filmed, and I certainly would have felt quite warm when watching while I watched it, which is a story of two or two hours watching the fire without acting or proposed my taste has been more appropriate.
