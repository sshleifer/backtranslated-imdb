The Sonar Arma (The Movie) The Man The Friend is an appropriate carrier vehicle for Sinatra, but is unusually extraordinarily unusually unsuitable as a suitable adaptation to the book. You've always heard about how books "change" when you're made into movies - things are cut, twisted, etc. Well, you can not even say "changed" with the movie - they just say a completely different story Character and setting are the same sure- but hesitant characterization, Polish women and women depth book in Polish. As a setting, it has become only a stage of the game, it is completely clutter-phobic with inexpensive "supporting role" players, walking on the inner outgoing street. The movie is completely different on the molake-down, franky machines and drug addiction. When this happens, Josh, Frankie, Sparrow, everyone lost their mental edge. Frankie's drumming, a common dream in the book, became her full-fledged emotions in the movie (probably Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is used as a verse, exploitavely. Acting is honest, especially Schneecklie Lewis, who is more busy than the film. But the true story of the Frankie machine is as "classic" as well as a classic as well as classic. This movie can go to Hollywood to show that it will get any right without 'dubbing and adding a happy ending. In this case, they just change it completely, Hollywood fluff is an important and realistic story cheap. I'm sure as hell as I read the first book, so the book is really good, I can not really treat it with real movies. I actually thought about closing the movie (and I did not do it), so I did not get confused with the beauty of the book. But it's an overrated film, and it's not so bad, the book should come first, it was first. And it should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
