This film has promised many beautiful and well-known actors, but a plot that was not really meant to say anything. So much potentially committed conflict among family members that can be developed and elaborated, but it was omitted and not cared for. There was no story to say, only acting, technique, a beautiful scene was closed - all of which were EMPTY But again, the performance was nice so different scenes were entertaining, but when you became increasingly aware of the lack of conceptual ideas, the act also lost its sense. So since the promised start you have become increasingly frustrated as the story went along.
