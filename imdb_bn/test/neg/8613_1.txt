Well, I've seen several movies and it really sucks ... Big Time. I'm sure, we are sick and exhausted from low budget coal for creating vampire films using the "martial arts teacher" type of movie type "actor". I'm tired of some people who have been able to fight some of the war strategies and fight on their way through a bit annoying movie. I forced myself to watch it, and one of the main reasons is that the Lead Actress is pretty good (hah) Well I hope it helps a bit and if you have time and want to rest your brain !!! Well, hopefully one day this movie will not be released but hey where all the low budget actresses will go :-) <br /> <br /> There are many blobs in this movie but I will go out to find you because it adds fun to the observer And you will bother to find it a bit of a perfectionist ;-) Cheers !!
