I have not laughed at this sunny lot - or seen a film that is impossible! <br /> <br /> First of all, I suppose that for about 40 percent of the film's length, I could not say what was going on, or even I could not even tell what I saw. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets the LSD. There are whole sections, a few minutes long, where you can see all the fuzzy and cave pieces, people and other illogical elements. I asked half of my film by doing what I was saying to my teenage girls, but they could not follow anything better than me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody lights off and the screen becomes pitch black - and I do not understand just for a few seconds. I think the longest lasts about two minutes. I think the blank image is one way to cut costs ... <br /> <br /> I suspect that "Director" has recently read a book of all books of "Sure" for creating a scary movie and decided to throw everyone in them - About 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this picture: 1 / it is less than 90 minutes (though still one and a half hours long!) 2 / die all the letters (after all, it is impossible to take care of them) 3 / There was a real good scene - when they came to see Shafts, their ropes were falling down (seeing them), a large stone was pushed to open, their seal was done. I would expect that WASN, and it was really cool. <br /> <br /> What's with the campfire scene with the shot after firing from behind the camp light? I swear the director about almost 20 times in almost 5 minutes using the same shot. <br /> <br /> And I'm positive that after the first kill, the exact same footage of the blood on the cave is used in 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> To all, a cap piece of filmmaking. I'll look at almost anything, but I want to draw the line where this is around.
