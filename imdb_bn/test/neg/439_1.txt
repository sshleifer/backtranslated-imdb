Well, what can be said about a "horror comedy" which is not a horror comedy? There are no characters in the film, but many plot lines - all resort and mostly unexpected. <br /> <br /> Computer creatures look bad, like Disney versions of larger rats without trail. The Walking Dead will see the biggest rip-off, except for the title, as dead in Landes' movies, but they have been moved far away. They just look like Amit and Bull's blood, like bad actors. <br /> <br /> Two plot lines really showed some promises (story of love and "company" story), but the director failed miserably, the author, the SFX division, production and actor.
