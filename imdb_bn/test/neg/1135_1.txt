This movie was terrible. It is very close to Eddie, Clerk Griswald's father-in-law. Eddie does a lot of work while changing good quits like "Christmas Vacation" and "Holidays". <br /> <br /> I do not really understand how such a movie thumb will be given up. Now, do not make me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but felt that this movie was completely wrong for him and generally for the character. This movie leaves a lot to be desired and really needs some big name actors.
