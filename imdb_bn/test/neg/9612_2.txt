I would not be too strict on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. This idea is not something special, but only KC, a girl who is trying to deal with the new step brother, Derek and his alarms, the crude family, when he gradually pushes his princess value to everyone. <br /> <br /> 1, the story was actually interesting. I like KC because he's smart, strong, independent, and conservative. He was well-versed and deep. His new step was harassing him to his new school by brother when I felt bad. He was a perfectionist, but is not as annoying as the next episode. Oh, and she gave birth to a nice guy, who is now portrayed as one of Derek's stupid friends. The title of the event was able to hold true tension. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not say that the show has actually been flying because the story is sometimes interesting, but now I have to replace the route for Derek. Now, between the two brothers, if there is any interaction, there is nothing there. If they interact, it is only short. Oh, and I do not want any Dasey fans in my face. People, who are called INCEST, even if they are slowly siblings. My tolerance can go so far, but it is not a point. <br /> <br /> It's weird Derek as the opposite, has become more sensitive over time, Casey, supposed hero, more neurotic than before and unlike Little kids spend more time on the plane, but parents are more skinny than ever before. But this is not the biggest problem <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from the point of view of cassie, lam, boring background music. He has gotten stupider and more shallow over time. In one episode, she got Hyuni and wanted her lover to be more impressive, so she deliberately ate herself, and blamed Derek. Now, what is a strong, independent feminist? I have not seen most of the fourth season, but I have heard that he is dating Truuman, a man who is a Jacques and a proud. Oh, I remember that fence episode. He constantly reminds him that he does not like him, becomes "torn" by the sword and at the end he is hooked up because he can "manage" him? What a bad situation Why go with a guy that's like the first one. In the first season, Casey pushed her towards him only ... Do not remember. Or, maybe I have a reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. This is not a bad thing, but I think he fell on his head in one of his exercises. And in a promotion episode, she cried because she could not find "the clothes of her dreams" and she was not completely satisfied until she became queen. One thing I noticed is that the case does not matter how bad our life wants to be, it often goes on its way (the person who wants to get it, Derek takes revenge, people love him, etc. ) Derek is still quite unfamiliar, but I really see he has matured. I do not see why many hate Sally. She looks beautiful and it is good to show a deep relationship with someone who care about Derek rather than "playing the field". He is getting better treatment of Edwin and the good brother for Marty. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can But it was good when it was lasting.
