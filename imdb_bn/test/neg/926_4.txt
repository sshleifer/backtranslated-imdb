Ignore extreme votes about "House of Wax", in no way is it "1" or "10". I saw the "wax house" or saw the trailer based and tried to think about the treachery. The trailer makes this movie very committed, which is what the trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing to be sure of with the trailer, if the producers can not combine one minute intriguing material for the trailer, but it is a sure thing that the movie is a big suction festival. But a good trailer only tells you that some things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. A little research here may be valuable. <br /> <br /> "House of Max" star Elisa Cuthbert (whose acting skills were directed by Kathy Ireland near her colleague Canadian Sarah Polly or her face Rose McGowell), and previously a music video was directed by video artist Jaume, her Feature debut This is not a good sign, but if you are like me, then you ignore them and go to see the work of production designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the appearance of "ghost ship". Waken's work seems to be valuable again, so it seems that 90% of the 90 million budgets of the film went to project design. The rest of them go to Kutbert and compensate them for the abuse that they have done throughout the film (finger cut, closing lips, tied, and roaming around rich goi stuff). By Bye-B, Cuthbert looks far more heavier than "The Girl Next Door", the big weight is far beyond the problem of a huge pig. <br /> <br /> Which means that a little left over them cast and left the crew. And judging from what was on the screen, it can actually be true. It seems like everyone has time to get their first act or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperienced or jealous of salary discrimination, the contribution of these inexperienced / disabled volunteers was less than zero. <br /> <br /> The job of the inexperienced Steven Window was probably awkward as you probably see the league with a misconduct editor like Joel Negron (insert "Pearl Harbor" here) and work to remove the majority of the prices associated with the production design group. Manage. Instead of setting the set and setting the set, the window illustrates this thing with the bad stuff and the Zarqi-jumping-bubbing camera. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and neat cutting which you use to hide the cheap and painful production design; The only power of the movie is not what it needs during its costly and detailed set. <br /> <br /> Chan Hays Screenplay and Charles Belenen (who wrote the original story) have been submitted as authors, although the use of title and wax statistics is quite similar. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror movie and it is mostly called parody (insert "van hells" here). Sunny for the murder, very scary or even strange to anyone aged over six years to be extremely extreme Especially high-level hotel heirs broke into the house during the steel bar, especially during the crack of the house, though its only half-baked striptease was the only real thing in the movie. Another comedy was highlighted when Leppang jumped with a finger with his finger and the bad guy stopped it. <br /> <br /> Good scenes have happened in the troupe's House of Wax, a candle with which to do something close to the sugar mill, conjoined twins, and many street spines (which gets Cubbert bath). It is believed that all this could happen anywhere in rural Florida, although it seems like the country of Paul Hogan in many mountains (the scout of attention location - the Gulf coast is not well known for its rotating terrain). The scenario is apparently to confiscate the connection between two sets of pairs, but most of the dialogue dialogue spreads anywhere in production or post-production. Since the remaining connections are not in any sense and do not go anywhere, you wonder why it has not been spent to reduce the Borodome factor. <br /> <br /> It is particularly sad that the producers did not recognize the mid-field production of their first heart class components-even with the existing cast. There was an opportunity to go somewhere with a city illusion of wax as there was staring them in the face. As a photographic medium, the modern film spontaneously creates confusion in nature, with no exception. Here they had the opportunity to create the ultimate style of photographic medium prepared to give a theater material. Like an influential painting, the city creates confusion of reality from a distance, but it reveals itself as a very beautiful style wax fabric. Of course, to bring it successfully, a visionary director and DP had to find out, but for all this, everything else has already happened.
