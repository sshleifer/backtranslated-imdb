If you can not see this movie, you will be buried in a dozen different ways to see the cluster of extraordinary characters, but you are going to love this movie because everyone dies after horrible death but there is nothing else. <br /> <br /> Where do I start: - Characters do not appeal to viewers because there is no person in them, I was not connected to any of them, I really do not like any of them, and I am so sick of them I was in the end of the movie that I was converted to evil action to kill them all. (Which he thought) <br /> -Bad acting; I mean, I did not get it, for example, take the Asian Tour Guide, at first she used to speak in English correctly, then her little tour boat thing suddenly became blue, and then went on to say normal English. <<br /> <br /> In the worst end of a horror: (If you can call it) The giant / human vengeance is killed by almost everyone, the last two are killed by the idiot, or they thought so! The beauty and gaik kept a pole with his heart / neck (it was hard to say) and possibly it died in front of them (in the arms reach), but later it came back and the monster / humanity was finished. Their kill (WTF) I mean why they did not just kill them when they were right beside them. Arghhhh! I meant to say that it was very misguided, he did not know where the author wanted the story. (Or he was only a few minutes short in 80 minutes, so he added some annoying twists to the film so that people can <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can return again and kill them The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's really the only thing that I saw in the end of this movie and they saw them kill me, I'm serious.
