This image has not excited me. During the Turkish holiday, I think it was playing in a local movie and decided to take the opportunity to see it. The series of film performances are well-documented, but the story has diminished in the middle of the story. <br /> <br /> One thing that I did not completely follow was how money was able to get money to give money. Guardians <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not particularly like was the missing part of my life. Bad people were able to find him, and after being absent for some time, he was not informed in detail about the prison. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rated this movie a (4) because I enjoyed the action sequence, but they were too few for rating high because the dialogue kept me less than influencing me ...
