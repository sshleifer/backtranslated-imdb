I do not understand the joke. I believe this is my problem with modern movies, or the movie that is made with billions of dollars, hoping it will be the next greatest sensation. Is not it weird ?? People do not smile anymore, and I believe that one of these problems is "disease" From the beginning, from the beginning to the end of the credit, Rousseau was seen as an eye candy with all the rituals between Murphy and De Niro, even the general imagination that made the general population fooled with pre-programmed laughter. There is nothing that laughs me in this movie. There was not too much physical trick or counted emotional voice throughout this catastrophic film. From the beginning, I bought De Niro and Marfi's match-up more than the excitement of Hollywood, throughout the commentary, the director was definitely going to shoot Hijinke and smile? Where was the picture? These are two problems ?? The director really does not have a sense of comedy or editor understands the film's value. In any way, they both spend a whole one and a half hours in Hollywood's nightmare "shottime". <br /> <br /> There is no reason to laugh at, there is no reason to follow these characters at any given moment. Movies. There was an eye on the desire to choose a hobby of De Niro, (but the director had to write the kiln on the machine so that the audience could understand it?), But it was reduced and never developed. Morfi was an actor, but outside the single opening, there was no idea that nobody could understand it. Can he afford a police officer who rents a room at a producer's house? This Hollywood standard also did not count for. A big guy who wanted a big gun, but guns were never developed, was there any true test of arms weapons ?? Even at the end. Laughing laughs rather than remembering the songs laughing Where was this television show? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there was no result. There was nothing in the middle of this picture and beyond the meaningless dribble. Random characters were started, forgotten, restarted, and forgot again. Directors and producers will enjoy this through sunny, when we, through little viewers, jokes and cliché stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this picture? Coming to the real evil on the screen, comic is a real bad guy who has separated from the two? Was there no reference to a pop culture return to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this picture? If you need answers to these, you probably will not find them in "Showtimes". I have questioned this review on the question, only this sub-parcel (in fact, under sub-sub-sub) did not fill any quotas or think of something like the value of the movie world. Sure, it was a big name and a really obvious explosion, but there was nothing in this substance. The director said that before the shoot he wanted the clichés, but not regular clichés ?? Go with bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. Jokes were boring. Characters were freak and resort. This is less than the "body-cop" movie genres. I want to give the movie's skepticism, but nothing works in this movie. Even Shotner could not save the image, even though he worked hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not, or I can recommend this film to the pulse. This comment only confirms the grave nature of the film, with the error of scary jokes and the question of the validity of their work with the manufacturers. Creators can not stand behind "Showtime", then why should we? I did not want to have a "interaction weapon" when I saw it, but I want something like that. I realized there was some criticism of "reality television" and media's corrupt nature, but that message did not stop the page. Actually, I believe I saw the "media" theater when I first saw it. Shame carries her heavy hand with this film and I can not blame it. Murphy was used as a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "coming to America"), but recently he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to move away from a movie that hunt him, but making such films is only going to set him apart. One of these movies is equal to Scorsese photo. <br /> <br /> Leave it. I promise, it will be appropriate on your final cinematic day. Oh, and if you laugh at this joke in this picture ?? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Grade: * ***** Outside
