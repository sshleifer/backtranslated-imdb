I noticed that this movie has been spent a lot of days in the movie, so this morning, I decided to see it. I've just finished the infilter, which is a great movie, and I thought it was also good. Cables from the description, at least This picture was awful. It's slowly, panning, awesome as it seems to last for 4 hours. There is no real plot to speak ... Ah! Can you say something good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but he always ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story for any support. After 2 hours, and you sit there thinking about what is happening in the world, where there are plots in the world - it ended with a surprise that really made me sick. Do not bother with this one.
