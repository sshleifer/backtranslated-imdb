The only reason this image is looking for will be due to John LeGuZamora. I remember the preview, and it looked to be another second rate comedy. But General LeGuZamo acted, tried to free it. Its name, time or not, how familiar it is, try to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite frustrated with the performance of Leguizamo. His day was "Top of the House" ("In Living Chlorine" clone), his tip-top. There is a fine line between helplessness and stupidity, and we can only say that LeGuZamo has exceeded it tenfold. She looked like she was trying to be very painful and crazy for the camera. Actually, I would say that he tried very hard. Madap's trick became stupid, and the picture was damaged. I can not say that if you give this opportunity, then I would have blamed him, if you can do the right thing, right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No group is omitted from being poked fun. Blacks, Latinos, White, Jewish, Korean, German, Lesbian, and Blinds are united. Again here, things get very overboard, and try to get many spoofed in very short periods. The film resolution takes five minutes to clear and goes back to normalcy. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, and you're skipping the plot and reality for the comedy, be sure it's funny, or you have all 90 minutes of stupid film. Which will add leguizamo's "insects" quite nicely ...
