This movie was an embarrassing one. Ummah Thurman looked like he had any kind of disease and John Travolta felt that he was walking to sleep. I hope that it will be a sequel so much that the little image is half-baked (apart from similar names and clothes). <br /> <br /> I will not recommend my worst enemy this movie. I think I was leaked and Hollywood again saw another horrible signal (I was suffering from Alien V. Predator). <br /> <br /> What I can say about this movie is that I voted for the worst movie of 2005!
