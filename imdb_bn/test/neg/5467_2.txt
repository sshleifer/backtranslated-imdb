A lot of questions have been raised about this image. The first of which is this: Why create a movie that plays a little more than a strange female fantasy? One thing left of viewers on the topic of discussion about the intention of film, it is completely different in the process of writing a script that fails to properly solve real human problems before being presented on screen. <br /> <br> Why irrational melodramatic and often humorous soundtracks? Why is too much dialogue and dialogue? Why is one of the main character's girlfriend Hooded kidnappers? What is the purpose of protecting kidnappings from abduction of lead character by completing his "mission"? (This is the moment of a classic Little Aussie movie. The most impromptu moment is a comedy from the resort.) Why is there a scene where absolutely nothing happens? (This is for about 15 minutes of film, which is at least 30 minutes long.) Why, if a man has been in prison for so long, does he not try hard to escape? <br /> <Director / Writer, who was co-authored by the script, failed to provide satisfactory conclusions in many conclusions. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
