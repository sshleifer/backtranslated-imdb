Interferencia Baker Martin Sanders (Andrés Bug) started out after some strange listening at the beginning, he listened to a mysterious man arranging to talk to a prostitute named Diana and meet him. Martin reads a local paper and soon views the front page story about a prostitution killing and remembers what he has heard. Martin believes in his friends Laura (Virginia Lustgig) and Harun (Oliver Calcutta) but they do not believe in him. Then again, the same thing happened in the newspapers when the call, people, prostitution and death were published. Martin decided that he would be searched for a murderer and who would be a stop for his assassination? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This Argentine's production was shot in an apparently 8-day period? About $ 3,000 (so why?) Sergio was written and directed by Escenzija and I can not believe Interfernecia in some amazing comments on IMDB. I have been able to write 113 of this 195 user ratings, 10 out of 10 negative words, I am sorry, but there is no way if someone scores perfectly in this 10 out of 10. A score is fixed for a movie in IMDB, but I do not really believe that if you look at the interferingia of the average of 195 people, more than 100 of them can be absolutely perfect, there is no way in the world. User comments are also amazingly positive, by IMDB users who wrote comments for only one movie. One user (besides me) who actually wrote more than one comment, gave 1 out of 10 below rock which seems to be right. Everyone is entitled to get opinions but I will reduce my life because most positive comments are set up by setting this up entirely from fake accounts. Where do I start? How can I describe the interferingia how badly I am in the world? The plot is a mess that basically survives or dies by its horrific curves, when most twists launch a plot on his head and change everything's view that went past in a clever and relevant way and the first to destroy genuine surprise twists here in Interferencia Half and it 'can not happen absolutely' in the way that makes absolutely nothing worthless and guides it so badly It means that it asks you more questions than answers. Martin became crazy? Why does he call a phone call? Why is he imagining a killer? Why did he imagine the newspaper title? There was no explanation for Martin's behavior in the first hour or more of the film, only this intelligent revelation that was in his mind and that is all this exhibition. Then Martins's missing wife and Martin have a plot in front of her boyfriend because the murder of his friends has not started for some reason. I'm sorry but interferancia is so bad, it's so annoying, it's written very badly and thought that I can not really say that it's a positive thing about. Sorry people but how I feel, quite easily Interferania is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it is both a conceptual and technically a complete mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, it does not seem like it to be honest. No, it seems like more to be shot in five days! The whole picture is a sight, Interferencia has probably been shooting the worst night I've ever seen. No attempt was made to stir the scenes, as if the makers only went to a dark room or basement or whatever the scene you shoot, you can see anything. Outside the scenes outside the scenes are the reason why this terrible irrelevant blue green color is not for a clear reason that only shows pride and becomes increasingly annoying. These strange tint is not repeated on the scene of the heart, so they are very shocking and noticeable. There's no real horror or scares, actually I'd say interfercia is more of a thriller than a scarecrow. As long as the Gorte goes, there is a freeze two decapitated head, the knife is stuck in the mouth and there is nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to IMDB, it was a budget of about $ 3,000, which interferrisia was released as a minimum budgeted movie commercially? Some people think that due to low budget, all reasonable viewing values ​​should go out of the window and our old bad words should be wrong! You still have to pay good money to watch it in DVDs and I personally think we have the right to expect some good products. If it is released and admired like the Oscars, then we can release our holiday camcodar footage to everyone (including forgetting the lens hat, including the footage of the footage and full black scenery) and can win the top prize at the next Cannes Film Festival! Though frightening acting, though gentleman's lust is actually sexy and it helps to ease the ultimate rest minute pain as an enormous bit feature. <br /> <br /> Interferencia is a terrible film, seriously I do not fool you by all fake positive comments, there is no way in which nobody involved or any kind of agenda is going to give it 10 to 9 or 10. An amateur chaos that is really terrific to sit through. Sorry, but as I can see, sometimes you have to be stupid ... you have been warned!
