Well, if you keep this movie uncomfortable acting feature aside; And, if you combine this story and the story travels around five different directions and goes without determining it to go anyway; And, if you can not find this movie that I could not find a scene in this movie which was far from interesting; Well, if you set each other, it's still a real terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I think it's the story of love about a rich man / poor girl. I never realized that this romance was never played between Kelly (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Lely Sobiski). Inexperienced romances are made worse by the complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. Screenplay (by Michael Seitzman) is stupefying point lazy. How Seitzman managed to write things without falling asleep is a miracle; <br/> <br /> <br /> I said, is this really a really horrible movie? <br /> <br /> Zero, but IMDB zero does not vote. So I give it a while by holding my nose.
