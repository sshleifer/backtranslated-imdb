This movie will be the worst one I've seen. The ridiculous was weird, very funny and heard a million times before. There was a specific mention and it has become worse and worse as bad. I got almost half and could not watch it look anymore. Thankfully, I was watching it on TV so that it does not cost anything, but I strongly recommend that you do not waste your time or money. <br /> <br /> There was nothing new in the movie. The letters were not all developed. I actually think it was as good as the little children's film that it was full of unrealistic "funny" incidents ... just like what happened alone or something. Not to be burdened alone in this house was in any way as terrible as this.
