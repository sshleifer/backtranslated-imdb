According to the best-written script for scripting (Charles Darwin), his evolution theory was meaningless, because he did not fully mention any foreign intervention. You see, the aliens have sent chupakabara to the world and they form the missing link of evolutionary theory. However, the rest of the film explicitly emphasizes that the sloppy is usually the case of Puerto Rican, so I do not really know where it fits. Are they saying that the Puerto Rican alien? However, anyway it's all pretty irrelevant. The only thing that must be remembered is "El Chupacabre", a perfect cheap and disrespectful B-movie, tension, character development, and a lack of style. A few people are chasing this goat-powdered giant (remotely resembling the middle version of the PimpinHide monster) through an ugly city street and ghettos. Our supposed uninhabited puppy and a nervous female novelist, overwhelming police and supposedly sophisticated evil scientist, including a weird infamous colleague. Since they are very incapable of doing all that, the monster can swallow all Latinic immigrants. The giant itself looks just fine and the make-up effect on the residue of its victims is fairly fair and bloody. Performance is irredeemably terrible and inducing headache. Especially, Eric Allegria is kind as a vicious employee of his first and only main role as a deadly employee. Yes, this is an incredible stupid film, but of course you have struggled with less and less fun-trash garbage.
