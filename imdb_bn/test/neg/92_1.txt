There is no plot in this film, there is no good performance, nothing is to be honest, the same songs play terrible acting and filling and if you can actually sit there and see the whole thing and enjoy it, then it will be beneficial. I hope I can give these 10, but I can not feel that it will be 1 which is generous! Ice is even a good rapper and not even worse, every bit of junk in the film, I got this movie after learning about what it was for Â£ 1.99 worth of DVDs and thought that I took an agreement, I saw the IMDB rating and considering it Not auctioned but after seeing it I found that the DVD I bought was full time, money and electricity wastage. If you have this image then two things you can not sell it or do not know about it or you can burn it!
