I found this movie on the flea market for cheap. I had a skateboarding movie because it was so sketchy. I put it in the house, the observation rules and the opening of the skateboard with an old man walking down the street was fantastic. At the moment, I realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie, but I still had high hopes for it. This movie was terrible. When we saw it, a friend of mine was stoned to death and even thought that it was a terrible and high quality waste. I fell asleep during the movie because it was very annoying and the song was very awful. I do not know that all the good music at the time of the breakdown, and the only brain lost is lost and every memory of how to play it is cleansed, but I think I would die rather than bear that pain. Also what was the hell with tv studio? I can only assume that this movie was adapted from name and title from the old Greek drama, but some plays are not intended to transform into future science-fi settings. Not least those who are involved with this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie then I can only recommend to bring a hand gun and finish it before the end. Everyone will understand why it will be a good movie to kill yourself.
