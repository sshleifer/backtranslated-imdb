I hired this movie because I enjoyed watching them with Lorraine Graham. Well, he was highlights. Everyone else is different from the whole picture. You are watching movies with you, who have looked at you, what? However, he gave some transparency as the only common character in the film, which does not actually say much for the film. Personally it was fetched far away for me. However, I did not want to own myself, even though I hired. I still think that Lorraine Graham has proved to be a strong actress and even she thinks she is not the main character, she stole the movie. My husband and I were happy and with Josh's character, I was more careful than his character.
