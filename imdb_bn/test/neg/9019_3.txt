This little ponderous late 50's sci-fi-horror schlock is not completely damaged. It is a man-made space rocket which is about a disaster in a distant region. To investigate a bunch of scientists and discover that the cosmic is any type of coma; He has been mysteriously implanted in that being kept alive by foreign embryos. However, the title of the tribe raised the monster soon thereby causing general attacks including removing partial head of his head. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is that it is pacing. It takes a while for the blood type to appear, and it actually comes within 20 minutes itself. He is undoubtedly a totally ridiculous creation, but it is not really a problem because he has provided comic relief to a lesser extent. At the end of the film, where we have the final stand-off and this funny creature starts talking to the person who died before the doctor, you will not work well. So in the very bright X-ray view we can see the alien embryo floating in the celestial body - it is just too funny for the words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, funny moments come on the night of blood cats very little and far away. If you are a scientist of 50 then check it out. Just do not expect too much.
