I can not say that "The Caveman" is a RIFF of "Cave", because I did not see it. I saw the "seed" and it is not terrible but it is very hard to see and so it's one. It is very hard to see, just as light and very fast, so you put it down to say what you are looking for. There is a time when I guess, you are scared, you judge from music, but you got scared? Work bad camera? Poor light? If there is a bigger event than this then it should be a horror movie. The story is that a bunch of cave explorers go to a cave in Kazakhstan (house of Burat) and they breed, but there is something with them (of course). And what is it? A person says that it is a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, before it is separated, but you can not see it anyway. And when you think (or hope) the film is about to end, because the screen becomes a bit dark, then you're wearing two remaining covers (two women) bets and wills and started trying to find their way. Where they have. They drink some water and do not start eating anything until they find it and start picking ... and then the mysteries of what is in the cave arise and you will only be surprised. Maybe, maybe not Fool stupid fools .... I think I do cave movies at this time, 10 out of 2 work quite well.
