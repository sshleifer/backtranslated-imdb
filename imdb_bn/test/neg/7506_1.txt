I heard the living Jackson Planet, live and work in Kentucky, Lexington. I've heard this film often before, from different people who claimed to be an important part of production. Then, for several years, I did not hear anything at all. When I see it in the local video store, it's a surprise to see the seizure of rent. So, the cinephil that I have been, I decided to shoot this local filmmaker. <br /> <br /> <br /> - And that's just the best thing. I have tried to enjoy it in my brain, in which removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it does not go on the path of horror storyline. Hey, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so sad it's kind. And they think that they are planning a signal, the director and his spouse did not listen to any criticism, I'm sure they heard. Let's tell you. Please In fact, completely refrain from making the film. Or present in some classes from pacing, tales, and good, fundamental aspects. <br /> <br />, for love of God, hang it.
