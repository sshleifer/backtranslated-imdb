Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans Massacre Police, Jack Robidax (Jean Claude Van Dam) in Mexico A small but violent city, Columbus was re-employed to help police in the attempt to stop the heroin smuggling in the city again. The ex-army forces used to be ex-servicemen guided by Benzamine Girl (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as East End of the East End), who used to learn a special method to fight against its opponents in Afghanistan. But Jack's more personal reason to take him down, which takes the two to an explosive final event where only one will be alive. <br /> <br /> After the death, Van Dam appeared in height, he could make the best picture of direct movie in Action Market. She was accompanied by many other dramatic films with Shepherd, although she returned to the high-ups, an intelligent move that made her the first famous and sadly unfortunately made her the worst movie. It's not like a movie that's bad, there's no place near it, but what I said is still standing. <br /> <br /> A very slow, anticipated movie with little to no exciting steps. In some cruel battle scenes, there is a slight slight, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slow-motion / speed-up effects, which sadly shows them even more cool. Director of a Mexican set film, Director Isaac Florentine, has tried to give the impression of Robert Rodriguez / DePapero, but it only adds frustration. <br /> <br /> Vidi gives a particularly blurred performance and he has ever starred actor Robert De Niro, that can not be good. As a villain, the Lord never chooses to leave his father. He initially received little dialogue because he struggled to wake up an American accent, but eventually he became mysteriously better. All supporting actors are equally happy, and nothing can do to increase the film's spirits. <br /> <br /> This is a feather that went from the flock to the right. *
