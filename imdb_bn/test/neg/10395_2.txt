I just hired Blackwater Valley Exercise because the covers and pictures looked horrible, and I usually do not see movies that are automatically left in DVDs, but it looked so attractive and scary! I was in a mood for a good scary movie, and to me, one of the most horrifying things to watch or learn about. Only The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both horror films, which are not only intense, but also as stories. <br /> <br /> A girl from Blackwater Valley Exorcism, Isabelle, from where to get to get automatically possessed, so we can not tell what kind of a person had to start with. But a former wireless better has been on the back of a counter-case ...? I know I know. Then they go into several stories with the priests and sisters of Isabella, and the priest hurt the sisters and messed up with Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we ask Isabell's father and his wife the question of his faithfulness. <br /> <br /> I mean, this story has gone in many directions and it did not improve all. Outlines do not seem completely authentic, and your pants are not afraid of closing a movie type, which I do not like because I could not take it seriously. There was no way anyone could direct and direct where this story was directed and in writing, so I would not really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
