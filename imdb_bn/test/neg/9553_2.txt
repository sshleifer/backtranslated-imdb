The Boston Blackie movies have some power - most of the time, pensing is fast and the hero is happy even in the worst conditions. But the plot is often accidental and unreasonable humorous bits often kill pissing (if the plot is unusually good) or simply illogical and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Blackie escaped a feather in it. Shelter (a really bad performance Steve Cochran) has decided on those beautiful Nina Foch (who keeps an excellent, rather subtle acting job). Inspector Faradad, of course, believes that Blackie Hissyceide Panic (he has received at least some evidence for him) has gone and Blackie is trying to keep him in jail after the real killer. There are possibilities of conspiracy, but going to real tense any time, we get a funny comedy routine. No one in Colombia thinks that in a film seeking a dangerous entertainment, suspending any suspension of disbelief in the cute little comedy scene about hiding an uncomfortable body from the inspector. (Only our clever hero is a fool - a fatal conclusion for a film like this.) <br /> <br /> This time is not worth it. For a well planned episode of this series, see Elias Boston Blackie.
