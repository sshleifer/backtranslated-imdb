This picture is doubtful of the worst action film I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just sad. Actually, the best part of the movie (this movie is considered to be serious) when a chicken length increases the speed of 100 miles per hour. This unfortunate editing mistake makes the film absolutely smiling for about 2 seconds, then it does not stop "at the end of your seat" when you try to find a comfortable place to sleep.
