This movie was a shit. The script hole is so full; I can not see how producers agree to fund it. <br /> <br /> We never explain anything. Acting awesome The plot sucks. This film was originally written for 8 and under. <br /> <br /> I would say this: Why only high school class is just 2 minutes? Teacher walks, finds a frog on desk, or chalkboard drawing, and after 30 seconds, the ring rings, the class ends. The kids even have their books open. Can we have at least a little suspension? <br /> <br /> Oh, dialogue Millo Jitter Review, increased fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need a line, "This is Dr. Jitter's office Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the tip; I could not keep myself together that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Or was he ever real, he is present? And if it was always, why was there a vague 'accident' match? <br /> <br /> "Meet what?" Have all the uninstalled items for it? We see these contractions in his father's medical office, and what they do not give them any explanation for, or what they should do with the story is never given. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraption? They are probably not needed. (See the movie, it will make sense). And what is this medicine to anyone? Apparently nothing, because it has no effect on the lead actress, <br /> <br /> This movie is close to a very, very bad rip in all other slashher movies. This is a really awesome Friday 13th / Halloween slopped together by a 10 year old writer. It's not enough to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.
