I was very excited to see this movie in the Montreal Film Festival. With elephants and a few, I thought American gun violence / culture would be considered intelligently and compulsively for filmmakers. Press release is committed (not many words) 'Red Violin' for the rush of gun violence, in our country, NRA-shoot-em-up to do some psychological thinking <br /> <br /> <br /> 9 After waiting for 9 minutes, sit for 9m screening (they were facing any technical problems outside of me), finally we went to the scene to watch the movie on DV (ad 35mm print co Was about?). I think I just answer my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a scary mess. We get "guns", which I sometimes saw (and I know more than a few) with the most sectarian "biker". This image then falls into the irrelevant "character development" because the letters are either a. Stereototyped, b. Lasers, C. Stereotyped holders and / or D. Rational Character Plot movement takes another 30 minutes and once we are there, we couple and / or bikers and pawn brokers. <br /> <br /> The film finds its conclusions, but without any clit reluctant. I do not take care of the white crossover letters coming in contact with the gun, and its screenplay minority characters should immediately cry out to NHHP. These people will be behind the gun because they are under the social trash-hip and look for opportunities where it is found. At least in the letter part will be provided some soul searching. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the promise. The plot outline was great. A p. In hand T. Anderson or Gus van Jundt, it can be a powerful piece. But for the bad screenplay, direction or both, this thing is an unknown mess that needs to be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My big question was MFFA's competitive material.
