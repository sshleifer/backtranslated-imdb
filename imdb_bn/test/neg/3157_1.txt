I do not get it. I just do not get it. "Burn and Friends" has been lambasted by millions for years, and I'll admit, I was one of those lambsters. Any child who shows this show can not understand what they are seeing is just a part of the trash. Barney is very boring, and very selfish. Add baby paw, and it gets even worse. B.J. Add, then you have a very dangerous television nightmare. Then, you get children. They are trying to teach them what they are old enough! What are they doing in the first place? It would be interesting if Barney and her friends appeared in Jerry Springer Shot. Must be one of the most wild moments in television history! Even more significant that this event was marked at the beginning of public television, as we knew, we saw more informative and interesting public television programs promoted in the 1970s and 1980s. A gun makes a big difference in what a selfish son is. When this program leaves PBS, millions of people will experience severe relief, but a huge base will be created in the history of television history. A message to Barney himself: You can not understand it, but your days are numbered. <br /> <br /> In short, there are other options. Good choice
