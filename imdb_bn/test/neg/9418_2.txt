When you see Castor Barry Corfin in a movie, it is not certain whether it will be a classic or trash. Estimates fall into any section in SOLO. Apparently a popular science-fiction novel, Weepon, Solo Mario Van Paibles decides to think for himself as a human-looking robot and thus called as a target for cleansing. He is secretly in a Mexican village, apparently saving the position and extra money. Pursace is cheaper than the dollar paid, I doubt it. William Saddler is on the road, because one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy the van pebble. Van Piebles easily manages to kill them all, of course, Carbin sees it all with astonishment from a distance. The film is a terrific Riff of Timinerator and Cyberbar series, and apparently there is little to do with its source material. It is written horror and acting, and ultimately a big fight if cruel comical. Van Pibleks, acting actor somewhere else, as a scream he pretends to be a synthetic meat-covered robot. Looks like he's playing robot for most of the time.
