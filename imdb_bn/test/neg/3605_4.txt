It may sound strange, but one week ago I found only the first movie (The Somers New Grove, Junkad) and only due to the episode of the TV show. I only enjoy Kujoko's character, but Crooke is not bad. However, finally I decided to watch the second movie, so I saw it. It is expected that it will be as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say it, but as much humorous American got, the more I got awake. However, little kids and perhaps even veterans would like to bite this movie (if they like Disney's old school moralization) but I agreed with Kujko. I was just expected that an eensy teens were far more hung than they wanted. Crank was a lovely character, together with heartfelt and stupid, but it was Patch and Cajo that awakened me at the end of the movie in drag. (I'll ignore Rudi as far as possible). However, great movies are not just my style and they say that you always have to be pure.
