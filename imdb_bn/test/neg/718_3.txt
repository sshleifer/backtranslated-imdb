This movie is recommended to me by some educators. From their comments, I had some pretty high expectations. But this movie was nothing but frustrating. The director's mission is obvious - using an interview between lectures / poems as a way to debate Bush's doctrine. But the director miserably failed. Also I seriously question the director's choice of the main character This is a left who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The power of the corporation increase, so what? Most importantly, this film gets unsuccessful scores in its promoting power; The purpose for those who have made it their opinion clearly. It is true that the aesthetic of the movie is quite pleasant. But most of the rest of the movie is sold easily.
