I've seen this movie several times, I came to the conclusion that Mills has made a bold decision to make a joke for Decree Guy, when the artist led that most will consider the storm, the passionate life when the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era will be angry throughout Europe. There will be a drama that has to be drawn. I understand that Mr. Forman was immediately involved in the loss of life of Inj's tragedy, due to the destruction of the world at that time, I felt that Goa was so left that his humanity was so much left. The most powerful and most obvious point of this movie was that due to the fallen nature of human beings, we are all likely to live in the flow of life, all of us have to fight against the help of God. When he used to say that he helped more, how much he can pronounce, how true for all of us! We must protect innocent and safeguard innocent. The great satirical scene which once executed the execution of the executioner, Lorango, who once condemned him, is actually a gifted element. I was left with something more missing when the credit was rolling. Perhaps less than the outstanding coincidences, and more in the internal life of the characters.
