(Spoolers) <br /> <br /> Oh, it's based on Mickey Dick. Completely obsessed and destroy him. It's total folly. The movie starts well, but at the end of the film, everyone else gets destroyed and the mind of the main star is a blank. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister is never trusted. Some very poor lighting effects The music is interesting But something else. Finally, it took me more than a month to finish the dust. If I prefer you being John Malkovich, you might like this. But BJM is such a great movie where I did not want to meet again, Pola X is a movie, I just hate high hell. The only possible tension of the film is the gratuitous sex worker sex scene at the end of the film. (Hope you do not even think about Catherine) <br /> <br /> This movie is very annoying, depressed and badly operated. Highly recommended. If you like French movies. (Instead of going to the Crimea River clock) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Repeatable: 0/10
