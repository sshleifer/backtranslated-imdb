Stay away from this ... No, I'm not really serious - I know it's a fun, campi, Chess Hong Kong Action Style B movie. I did, but believe me, it's not. Indeed, the exact thing about that description is Hong Kong terms, and then only used strictly geographically. <br /> <br /> Yes, Danny Yen collaborated with it. Jackie Chan has a camio. Storm Riders guy Ikon Cheng led the team. It got the vampire. It should be good - or at least fun, charming and packed in action. Again - it's not. <br /> <br /> I sucked this image why I could digress - I could tear it up, hack it into small, shivering pieces. But where do you start? There is so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easy and give some loopholes to this hatred-festival, tell me that I'm usually a big fan of Hog Kong. Lightweight action and / or comedy with heavy drama stuff as well. Truly good movies are really cheesy ones as well. I can sit through a few hours of bad subtitles, enough joke to see the first glider. I can manage disciplines and sisters as a convention of lovers of lovers, and since the average movie singer will push their metaphorics into their action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other source - bad when bad when I love it is bad. <br /> <br /> But this - OUR! It's just awesome, stupid, unwatchable garbage. It's really painful to be so funny or charming so far. So it looks like a Bergman film like the Chanso genocide in Texas. <br /> <br /> Why? Why waste such an opportunity? This can be so much fun!
