I did not see each jackass episode. It's gently entertaining if something else is not going on. But after watching Jacques # 2, I was a left and right lover. I had thought that I will tune Viva La Left. Boy i was wrong Seriously, you can add a bunch of 2 'grades, provide them with the same budget and I betting they could stop something more creative on the screen. I mean, Simon MTV !! At 23, where most people join you, this gives us garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything looks so strong. There is no attitude because you do not know the letters. You can not appreciate anyone left or right, or for that matter. If only thinking would be a small dose. As soon as the next shot goes away, we will not go. <br /> <br /> They can finally create a good shot and you like what you are going to do. You are sitting there, just waiting for their response, and then closing some scenes with two lam sentences and lip. What is the key for that shot or what, please? If I'm there I'll be disappointed and laugh. There are some insane things and my Adrenaline pumping but these guys ... just scripts the stupid response. <br /> <br /> Yes they are such a waste of cash to get me a few chuckles from the audience by my fairly strong joke, or giant rig. <br /> <br /> Under the jackass wing, many common people can not be taken to the hitbats, it can write many fun scripts. Or visualized with the work of visual camera. Even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script will pull a good job. MTV could bring more cool stuff to a whim screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
