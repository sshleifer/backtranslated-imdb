I am Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth is a big fan of 1947. Unfortunately, there is a lack of _all_ needed for a good movie of this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to express the sadness of the widows in the beginning of the 20th century in India and at the same time new wave of their rehabilitation ideas. Although a child appears as a central character with a widow, although very intriguing from an Indian perspective, it can still be a very powerful movie. Alas! The film lacked both sensitivity and emotional intensity of fire in the world of 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if someone thinks that the story has been given, though there are hundreds of things, I would have liked something different than that. Well, making movies is particularly unfortunate. Everything is called. Everything is shown directly. Sensitive implied sentence absence. Lack of neglected things. I could not believe that it was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> Some Hindu restrictions, such as with its own interests or a father whose double standard has the best value. Can not write a script without these old-style standard Indian film characters? <br /> <br /> Many people are praised for making Deepa a movie and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that he took a brave step, but should not one think about the quality of the movie, or should it be a controversial one? It is obvious that if you start a story like water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widow - a successful director is not accepted to achieve it. And there was nothing more than cinematographer !! Where is the diaper contribution in the picture? <br /> <br /> Talk about acting etc. - Kindly !!! Lisa Ray is a beautiful face, an extremely beautiful face - but it ends where it is. He can not speak Hindi; She could not emot. John Abraham is no good Most widows seem unusual. CEMA BISH and mercy to save the young woman! They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And it was a period film - But Hindi dialogue is a big time spent. It is as unorthodox as it even walks around. No rhetoric !!! No local slangs Do not worry The only thing was probably shooting loces right. I thought the set of monastery was genuinely realistic. The whole blue film of the whole movie is also appropriate. <br /> <br /> But not everyone, watch this movie. You will not get anything There is nothing in the story, or the direction. You will see it for the short girl's acting.
