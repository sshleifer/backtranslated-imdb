I feel the same way with all the bad comments in this movie and add them. The Australians seem to have become weak, they were brave soldiers. In this movie it was very terrible and very graphic. I did not see enough heroism, which is more horrific than hoping because I'm nothing more than what I read. We do not need extreme violence that we can use our bright imagination to go through them. It is like saving the personal Ryan, where the Nazi soldier gradually pushed his knife. For example, Mel Gibson is extremely violent for his films but also the most extreme director for the level of historical error. Io Jim's letters were a movie of war, enough of the history (though I could have been wrong) except for our Father's flag and river of the Kui river. If you did not say it correctly, it is an offensive to the victim and it is good for reading fall, and the film has not had anything interesting about dialogue for a long time and is not a good creator to kill the Japanese. The soldiers Just read the internet, mags and book history. Movies always kill the sense of perception. What they did with POWS in Singapore and in the Philippines was just terrible for ordinary citizens. It just feels proud to feel proud of me, but bad movies destroy it.
