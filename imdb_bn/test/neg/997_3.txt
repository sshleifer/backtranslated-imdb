In the 1960s, the pioneer of underground film movement, author and director Robert Doni, starred in the New York Madison Avenue chaos with his avant-garde comedy "Putney Swape". Doni did not restrict his laughter to advertisements, but black-mouthed culture, the dynamics described in the competition of Hollywood, the elite white power structure, and the character of corruption in any power struggle. As respected and aspiring as "puppy swipe", it qualifies as a terrible movie, not a shoe-string budget on amateur is made in the name of a cast named Cast and a lack of humor. Everything about this movie is revived with reform. "Putin Swape" has created controversy during its initial liberation war, with politically incorrect management of ethnic problems and consumer culture. Like the most Marx Brothers movie, the plot provides an excuse for thin, Donny's unknown gags, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> Chairman of a Medieval Avenue Advocade died during a board meeting. Before moving the body, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are banned to vote for themselves. When everyone voted for Token Black member, Putney Swipe (Arnold Johnson), only a tragedy occurred, since no one thought that someone would give him a ballot. The pink pink slip is one of the all white executives, surrounds itself with the black, pistol packing staff, and reinforces the strong "true and soul advertising". Sofa decides to change American advertising face. He refused to accept the products of the clients vintage, tobacco, or war toys. Swaype's clients brought a solitiveness after becoming CEO, and attracted a new line-up of great clients who looted money bags shown in his office and prepared for the abuse of SWEP militant workers. Swape absorbed his African-American workers, even using their ideas ruthlessly attacking them and launching offensive advertising campaign, which is called the 'new wave' of all marketing opponents. Incredibly, SWEP's conservativeness proves to be successful, but the organization has become the target of government employees who form Swipe's advertising strategies "a threat to national security". This black and white high-end comedy 85-minute comedy is shot commercially on television. Unfortunately, Downey does not know that constantly starting to be smart but when cutting these ads out of these ads wear out. The most interesting part of "Putinie Swayep" is associated with our untitled playwright with US President Mimi of Washington DC (Pepsi Harmin), which is a teetonic advisor like Kissinger, bringing an advertisement campaign for his new car, Baramon 6.
