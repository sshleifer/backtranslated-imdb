I can not believe it! They were crazy to film a film about Connecticut in southern California? For God, there are palm trees everywhere. In the first scene, a man "Welcome to Connecticut" and dropped a newspaper down, the newspaper said something like "Greenwich Herald". There is no "Herald" in Greenwich Connecticut, which includes "Stamford Advocate and the Greenwich Times". (Reflex of Stamford, Connecticut newspaper). Probably, the filmmakers should have done some research, I mean, my deity, at least the newspaper's right name or the film will look at the remote locations as far as the remote location.
