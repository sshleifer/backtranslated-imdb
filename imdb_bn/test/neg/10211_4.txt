Here in 1989 the NZ wrestler had some mag-hypo foam, and topped the steering starship, Kamala Goblin, Hul Hagan (at this time my uber-heroes one), so now it seems to me that when I came here in 1989-90 I enjoyed this movie. Huq Hagan A At Terry Ballley is a sudden bad actor and Zeus A At Tiny lister is worse !!! The story line follows an ideal WWE (then WWF), ending the line of 88-91 story, defeats good people, then lightens the line of the story to be beaten so that the good person calls on its inner strength. Vitamin E, praying, praying etc.) saying that the epic is back ..... returning standard standard formula. Only worth watching observers for your youth !!!!
