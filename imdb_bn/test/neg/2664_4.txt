A former gangster named James Cagny Richard Gargon (nickname "Passy"!) Who is now monitoring the state-run reform school as a new superintendent. Taped style entry where the whole exhibition of Cagani; He dominated the film, but only because there was not much on interest. Jimmy gives what he has hoped from his hard-hitting personality, which can be satisfied to quickly correct. The direction (though Archie Mayor is believed to be helped by Michael Cartridge) is easily straightforward without being chic, although the second half tends to be reduced, behind the film's dirty conclusion (even the Cagney passes are lost). Repeated as "crime school" in 1938 and again in 1939 as "Hell Kitchen". ** **** to
