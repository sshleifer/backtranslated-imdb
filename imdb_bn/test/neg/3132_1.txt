The film is a bit amazed, and basically it makes a scary and rolled character sympathetically exploiting its hero with horrible conditions as a hero. Samadoro, who has lost much hope, likes suicide. He has been thinking about this for more than 26 years, perhaps his condition worsens, but believe that we should do what we should do, even if it means finishing my life, my opinion is deeply wrong. Contrary to the example raised by scientist Stephen Hawking, who suffered worse for a long time! Yet, with the morals rising up, the hero reconsidered the movie in worship, and those who disagree were drawn to the straightforward stupid position. Especially in the face of confrontation with the priest there is little room (deliberately facing real life which was a very small priest). In this way I think the film is equal to the Rifenstahs Trif of Will. The abominable idea is that everyone should have the right to own life, when they think they can not live anymore. It does not matter whether it is physically or mentally harmful, there are some people who believe you have the right to choose. The same people are likely to make a case for abortion. All parts of the current trend are either suffering or out of sight from the eye, brush it under the carpet, and Mammy will say this. Okay, and we're all very happy with ourselves. So we believe that living some life is not right, life can be valued and we will decide that some people themselves can not decide for themselves, so we will bring the state to their decision. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from another Oscar contestant "Dar Untergang". Hitler certainly believes that he can carry out the nature to decide the weak. During his reign, "weak" strains forced forced abortion, mentally disabled people were removed quietly and the Jews became "human" using gas. He congratulated this movie and why it is not for the line, with its philosophy ... "Some lives are not life-sustaining". I'm different from Ramon Samadoro, Hitler and all the people involved in the making of this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and no one likes to be born. Then who can choose death? It is not about religion, it is a matter of frustration, about protecting the weak and helpless!
