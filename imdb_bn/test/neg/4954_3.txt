Although a fan of Shock and Gore, I discouraged to say this movie is too low. The effect and the work of dolls was impressive, yes, and humor was a good time, but ... something was missing. See, the film's first action was spent on establishing the definition of Jack Brooks's character, though what we need to know about his aggression is delivered within a few minutes of the first title card. For descriptions and lots of flashbacks: Irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Panning in the second phase was tedious. Most of them eat Freddy Kr√ºger, then flip, then eat more, swallow his arms and call something bachelor or rude. All the time, the verse is punctuated with a brief view of Jack discussing issues of his anger with a therapist. (Of course, entertainment scenes in the film - remarkable dialogues laugh a lot.) Then, without warning, Jack decided to kill some monsters. And then it ends. <br /> <br /> To everyone, as a hacker in the horror movies of the 1980s, Jack Brooks: Slow Slayer has a possible balance but intentional and shameless without intentional or adequate resolution. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, these issues will be solved before Jack Brooks VII: Go to the production of Jack Gell to Hell or Jack v. Ash.
