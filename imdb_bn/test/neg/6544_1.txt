Indie film redefines the term "baha" in this low budget. This word can actually be found in the dictionary, surprisingly: "Fools ... unintentionally, lazy, dead." The film redefines this term because I have to add the four words: "PC big", "torture on a sad pillar", and "pointless". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> There is no plot to speak, though there is no sleep.

Reading his "poems" in real life can only stand if there is a feeling of involvement in bloody, sexual details. "And then I rubbed his huge dick against my sweaty, impatient pink little vagina ..." Cheers! Worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes, where she had a bath or screw with somebody, but she never had the idea of ​​showing her breasts, which was apparently left to save this mess. <br /> <br /> Black men and blondes, who are divided in height of one meter, hook up: they look like a cheap variation of Rodman and Madonna (like the next two are not already quite inexpensive). Nelly Agert, Blonde, mentioned by Howard Stern of his "Miss America" ​​book. Start Egert writes that he took out his implants. Nevertheless, I believe that when they took their implant, they also made most of the meat and muscles in the flesh wrong, because they seem hungry here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> wing; He looks like Alker oker advertising angel food cake.
