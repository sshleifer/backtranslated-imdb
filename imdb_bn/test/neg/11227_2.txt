I saw bad, which is not saying how poorly the film was. The plot is ridiculous: a student shot a police officer and five others hosted him? Cheating, New York School in New York School - and it takes 24 hours to solve this climbed hostage situation anyway? Are you serious? A daytime hostage situation - Less than a wounded NYPD officer, takes all day? I understand this photo has been made pre-9/11, but still. I was surprised to see the clock how they could pull this extra plot for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was always moderate, and the letters are probably 7th graders. Child abuse child, pregnant girl is afraid, violent gang wannabe, a distraught unfortunate victim, wise-cracking white guy. Please <br /> <br /> Trying to make this hostage situation a "more textbook" and a better school conditions? Please - This is a poor effort to justify the effort of writing a movie about a child who shoots a copie. They are confused, stupid people who are stupid - fetched away - to get involved in the situation. Suddenly, as great, do not try and draw them, the most ridiculous Ziggy, who lives in the school Attic, and admires Michael Angelo so much that he draws this interesting scene in the wall. You have to make fun of me <br /> <br /> Do the protesters not have "racism" signs? A black kid shoots a black police and a black talker tries to patch it all up. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the overall message, which was badly illustrated, though some actors who went to honorable careers. <br /> <br /> It was a joke though the red sniper laser on the roof? The worst scenario was the kidnapping, goat's surgery on his friend, "Give me a promise" etc. how bad <br /> <br /> "I went to jail but now I am." Ex-XAZ University's former law "... is an appropriate way to end the silence of a movie.
