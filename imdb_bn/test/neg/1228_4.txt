I, like many people, the epic Lonesome Dove of 1989 was one of the best Western ever made, probably the best. And, to understand the certain sequels (in this case a prequel) certain certain, my expectations were lower. The Kamchancha moon meets its expectations with its marginal guidance and acting, poor welding and undoubtedly, a lousy script. <br /> <br /> Lonsome Dow calls for Captain McRae's Western hero and Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones's unbelievably strong performance. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believe that they bravely fought for the liberation of barbaris and the barbaric Indians of their colonial years. <br /> <br /> If I only saw the moon, then I think these two bone headings were a few helpless, cowards were stupid. Lonesome Dove, Call, and Macro probably pursued all Blue Dook in Texas and was never able to catch or kill him. In the Kamachchar moon, a shot of call boot hill convinces her to sit and raise the cattle. There was not a modest box-fight or gun fight in the full miniature. McCain's Wisdom and Kiss Where Mikey's Glittery Macroark Shiny Inn's School, a Scenic View. Claire's love for McKay, drunk, non-slut and Filander were completely impossible. And Maggie's love for calling, defies an isolated and sullen loner, argument. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, from the original to the finest. Credit goes to HD technology only, but cinematographer. Companse moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but sadly it does not say much.
