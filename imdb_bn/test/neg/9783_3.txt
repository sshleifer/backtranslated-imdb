"Sister Natures" starts with a new and original invisible evil, along with the use of exaggerated isolated depiction of the African desert, very optimistic. While testing pipelines in the desert, three mines were attacked and killed by their inappropriate animals, which consume their meat and leave only a half of the bone eaten. In order to drive the expedition, the invasion campaigner discovered that the monster was a highly modified ant-queen, and soon they were trapped in their own strange desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn continues to be a respected level level until the nature of the genus is detected. Soon afterwards, the film quickly turns into a common animal feature, which all the letters exit one life after another. The second half of "bone graduation" is unnecessarily boring; Inevitable love story Clich√©s, as well as in complete absence of poor killings, slices into pieces. Let's say all of the characters are unnecessary stereotypes that work and you just predict just a few minutes ago. There is a curiosity to prove to yourself that, with the power of the brain, woman out of her brilliant beauty, an abusive person who has endured herself through suicide souls? Last but not least ?? Who is the intelligent black guy who can refer to the giant by using all kinds of names of the vampu Wulfsohn tries very hard like his demonic appearance "Alien" and "Predator" outer space manaces. Shots have yawn, when the enemy infrared-vision and crumbles! The film is actually benefited from its unique setting and painful images of discrete organizations. It may be a decent gem, but instead it is less than the medieval. To avoid.
