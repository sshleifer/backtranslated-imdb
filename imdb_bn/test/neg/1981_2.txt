First of all I would say that I can be as close as possible. <br /> <br /> Be careful so some potential spoilers will come forward. <br /> <br /> I have never reviewed the movie, but I especially feel I should review it. This film is based on the popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII), popular for the last few years, for the Final Fantasy 7 Adventist Child, the most popular popular for PS1. After watching the hip and dozens of trailers (which I have ever seen, I still have seen), the film got really excited fans trail seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself also played and completed a game like a good fan, and I was very excited about such a movie. So I thought to myself, "What could be wrong?". <br /> <br /> It's okay, the movie is okay in the first 20 minutes, but the movie goes out of hand. Without any doubt, this is the best shown CGI animation, but it will not help for a weak plot, unused characters and impressive action scenes. <br /> <br /> The story here is basically These three silver-haired white-haired boys, who can not do anything with the game, are probably not all well-defined as Cephyroth Clones (he's the villain of the game who had killed all his supposedly cloned guides) for some reason, trying to kidnap him. , Perhaps to create an army? (Children?) They also focus on the story of some children named Danzen, I do not know who this child is, or what the point is, he just seems depressed. Always. Therefore, sephiroth clones are also involved in some types of projects that involve some diseases called gyostigma, it affects only children, this disease is annoying and small amounts of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> Now the clouds must be saved from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his fellow teammates have learned the power of flight, I've felt a little humiliated that these characters are flying around a city and flying across a city. If the film is not above the top, the scene will relax in it and then they will be surprised to see the incredible thing. The real problem of this movie is reasonable. Now I know what you want to say, "but it is considered to be the ultimate character! That should be the idea!" The best way to look good is to play the role of reality and the movie to follow in CONTEXT. The context and logic of this movie is incompatible, I could explain it all, but if I do that, I'll finish writing the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of this movie are also very impressive and tremendous. Just as when all the characters in the game are shown in free time at the time of their compulsory screen so that fans are not upset. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soundtrack / score (Orchestra has been done?) End of horror <br /> <br /> Big time speaker <br /> <br /> Now the end of this movie Disappointed. The cloud died, and after life, it was really cool and sweet, but after shooting the last battle of the last cloud, the bullet went out in the chest somewhere. Then there's his 100th flashback in the cloud and then there's a lively stream of fireworks. (Now I think I remember living in the game, but it was not a revival feature, if it happened, they could bring Arris back to life, thus creating a completely different story) So the cloud is resurrected and everyone has a party and the pool Dives in and we have a tiny hallmark / lifetime type moment. <br /> <br /> Do not have that movie's moments It is worth watching for its visuals. But that's all <br /> <br /> In addition to this it is not really a good movie. This is strictly for the dark fans of the game. Do not care for those who talk about plot and character and stories.
