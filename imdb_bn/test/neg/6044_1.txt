There are many mistakes with this movie. Greek fox with a girl wig, fox machine fixer during old man scientist, tough guy Jones is behind with a shotgun that has three rounds, spider man with templed hands and bad teeth etc. The make-up was so bad and they were only a few screen-visible spider people at once (can be used on Alliance Cameron Technique) instead they prefer to dress each spider in the same way ... bad. Excellent thing about Greico's acting is that she had counted how many balls she had in her bobs like she gets to speak in the script. It makes me wonder that DVDs contain all the information, such people still make movies. This movie may be bad, how do I know? Hey, another one. I'm looking for an SCI-Fi movie. The channel that is being run to further the existing Nepotism of movies and television should not be allowed to allow people.
