For the first time I saw when I was with a date, and she thought it was a great movie. I do not <br /> <br /> I saw the second time on TV last night. It sucks still <br /> <br /> This sucks as a love story. As Julia portrays a street hooker, this is annoying. To me he was a lingerie with a miniskirt and heels. He had no hard shell. He was not tortured, angry, mad, hungry or anything else. Her "hooker" character was so defective, such as a dense jircon compared to a diamond. The two do not fit easily, what they look like <br /> <br /> I only saw valuable valuable sales of 2 distorted celebrities, who were thrown nicely. They did a wonderful job that I hated for a few seconds on the screen. They were the real definition, for minor roles. All right, so the movie was not completely trash ... two unknown Selimonim cinematography. <br /> <br /> In addition to those two women, the people sell, the rest of the cast ... just shit with the big name. Both were either an ass-magnet or there was no reason to fill in a dialogue with the movie, just congratulating Julia Roberts or Richard Gere's kissing ass. <br /> <br /> How was this picture when you roam Beverly Hills at high heels and a tight skirt, people took it to you and those who work as a hotel glory, only the baseball bats hit their face. <br /> <br /> In fact, women dressed in street in Beverly Hills are prostitutes in heckers and higher degrees, but they do not see garnish or patent boots, but they can see what others can do. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Face everyday with the hope to work. <br /> <br /> About the story, July ia Roberts is pumping (yes pumped) by a business case and transmigration of limousines. <br /> <br /> She is still owned, yet how to work, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He's more than the street pumps, but the Disney / Buena Vista people make it easy to melt. <br /> <br /> Instead of Richard Gere, a gold-tooth and an AK-47 beside the Atac Case, this film will be about how to fight a woman to stay away from the rigors of prostitution. The same story, different letters will create a different perspective. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, change the black man, change the white land deal to Asian or Spanish, in the treaty of arms or drugs, and the whole idea of ​​romantic comedy is thrown. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, beautiful women are still dressed with trash, ribbons and arrows. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years ago, when I did not understand it and led the Hollywood hip. I hate it now that I can see beautiful decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is not romantic comedy. This is a story that a woman has to control until she has to earn and earn money. <br /> <br /> This is powerful women, poor women and generally humiliating women, as well as the television screen for me. <br /> <br /> Do I hate it? Yes Does it suck? Yes i would recommend it to you No ... well if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be posted? We will see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, now for all that.
