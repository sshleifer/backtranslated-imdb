Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster so humanity now lives underground in different religious cults. What is the cause of the disaster? I have no idea? Why are humanity divided into different religious groups? I have no idea. Since the surface of the earth can not support the life of man, how can humans develop crops to feed the population? I have no idea. What type of producer is eligible for this script funding? I have no idea <br /> <br /> Shepherd is one of those movies that roam around the cable channel at night. To see if there are any type of filmmakers you are consulting with IMMB. The number of people commenting on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double figures and is a movie that was released nine years ago. Perhaps those who did not see it lucky? <br /> <br /> <br /> Former Gorky Boris Dakota, whose wife and child died, met a woman and her child a few years ago And it was for him to save his life just like the future west.
