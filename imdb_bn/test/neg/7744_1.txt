Cathy Ireland: A Goddess body, an angel's face, a Smurf's voice. <br /> <br /> and a snail starring talent full of calcite. If you do not trust me, check it out: "Lane to Alien" actually depends on 9/10 acting throughout the film! Sure, he ends up skirt around a beautiful red bikini top and a wrap around the end, but too late (so to speak) is too late. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ireland is a famous scientist, who is studying in the center of the world to find him, her daughter. Along with this, he read for a man named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper - make your own joke) and find out how "Mad Max" refuses to live. Do you know that people living deeply on the earth speak Australians? Not even me. <br /> <br /> It was bad (after all, MSTD was there) and Golan-Globus production, but after all, it is said and done, Ireland is largely lost, as he is trying to find out where the photographer instead Can shoot a photo. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> One star. And if you insist on viewing it, turn off the word - save your hide.
