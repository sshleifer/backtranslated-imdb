Now a blackslave fan can recognize the elements: big afro, unbeatable babes, naturally bad fashion and some 'jive' talk. In this case, add a lead that can not work, a plot that gives little sense, does not make any hands-edited hand with any hand that is dark and the most deadly battle scene and you have TNT Jackson. Not good enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it is a wonderful mess from the beginning. I especially like the continuous continuation error and lead's white stunt doubles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I have enjoyed it almost.
