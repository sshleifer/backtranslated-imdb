It was badly shot. Like a push job, the last minute casting is obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not the film. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who is not getting a good introduction recently. This role was not for him. Maybe it's still a pleasure to have been picked. The festival circuit should have this film.
