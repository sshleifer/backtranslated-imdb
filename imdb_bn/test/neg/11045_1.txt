Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please pardon bad english). I am sorry to see these movies, such as closing the Qur'an with blood and sex. It is also in Korea how to see lethal killings and sadden me even more and Americans hear. We do not eat living creatures !! So do not say that the movie is closed for the crime! There are scenes with people eating live animals and non-Koreans think it is normal. No, it's very hateful to us. The director is a misfit, sick person who has murder with family members and has passion with sex. I hope America and France will glorify this wicked man who is ridiculous in his country. See another movie from Korea, which is how artistic you think we are. This movie trash.
