Commenter is a mistake. This is not just the Pat Paterson movie, and he did not die even after two years of production. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pinville, NC. He shot this few years after Doctor Gore. In the late 70's, Patterson died. I know this because he used my house and he kept a cat there !! Suck it. It was a big deal when filming was going on. An independent horror movie was not created in the NC. This movie does not help matters. Patterson H. Yes. Lewis used the effects of Gore. He was good at magic. His Guru's view of the physical store is actually doing well. The film was shot in a building, which also was called 7/11. You can actually see the top of some scenes wall. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script was written like a child. Only Paterson can understand it. Still ... it's entertainment and it's a classic
