Boring movie Poor plot Poor actors The movie is in a house in Morocco but in some American cities it actually happens! "Arab terrorists" patriots are patriotic "Arab terrorists" ... Damon! <br /> <br /> Although some of the movies are good (so the score is 2 out of 10). The director returns to the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism, which returns the media every day to our original, terrorists American (or western people if you like). <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two parts. The first part of the movie is concerned about the Dutchman travel (15 seconds) and the second part is about having a stay in a dark dark brown room (1 hour and a few). <br /> <br /> The Dutchman is going to reach some of the "charity organizations" in Morocco, get off the plane, and live in a dark brown room. After saying "they will not shoot us", he was abducted with another man shot dead. As a Dutch survivor Morphius, playing chess with Arab people is forced to play chess so long as you learn how to play chess! Finally, the Dutch did not publish its plot, because it closed its four fingers, but you will see this movie, because it is cheated by hair sport! <br /> <br /> When you're so tired you can not sleep
