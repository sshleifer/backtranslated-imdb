One of the short films that accompanies Oliver 'Bebe' Hardie to Bobby Ray in front of Hardie's immortal team with "Stark Aaarud" Stan Laurel. A number of critics have suggested that Ray and Hardie - a little man with a lot of embarrassment and a supernatural big man - was the prototype of Larry and Hardy, but this is not true either. Ray and Hardy play well on each other, but not really a team; Each of these films has more footage of the film and is clearly meant to be a hero, but Hardie calls him much more than the character of the "Oli" character of the "Stanley" character. It is very clear that Chaplin films were inspired before the relationship between Little Bobby and Big Baby, among which Little Trump was fooled by Mc Swian or intelligent Eric Campbell. But <br /> <br /> Hardy plays his bowler's hat, which matches his next "Oli" title (though with a full toss), and he and Bobby - after spending most of the opposition as the opponent - Done as a drunk comrade. <br /> <br /> For the firmness of Bobby Matz and Blazer, Hardy with his boss. When the exhausted Bobby tries to persuade him instantly, some of the two men have some clever tricks that remind me of a routine presented by Garc√©'s Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. Shortly after, Bobby Ray - whose short acting career did not make a strong screen personality - played an "impossible" knot that was unsuitable for Stan Laurel, when he dragged a long stepladler from many small toolkits. <Br> <br /> Paperhannars go to work in sanitarium and have mental abnormalities of mental illness: A resident advises strongly to sit in a piece of toast because he thinks he is a ripe egg! There are some black-hued racist racist (and shamelessly unreasonable) shirts, who compulsively reject open walnuts on his head in prison. When he sees a lion * picture - not even a picture, remember - it goes terribly so that it is actually a real wild animal <br /> <br /> "Stick Aude" is roughly terrible. Most pantomime and acting are much broader than it is for a snapstick comedy; Even Hardy, already very fine actors until 1925, is badly paralyzed with his performance here. There are many bad examples of shot-matching. I was impressed with an unusual camera setup, when a fat pedestrian's face was washed, and we could see the reflection of its mirror instead of its original appearance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here, once, they end up as pals. It's a beautiful ending, but it's not really made for a poor film. For this my rating is just 10 out of 4.
