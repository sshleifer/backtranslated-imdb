2001 is a movie where you do not like it, you are told that you do not 'get it' and you need to see deeper meaning and emotions. You are told that you are giving a very slow focus and want to see only sex, explosion and want to transfer this plot to you in a platter. <br /> <br /> Will we break the movie? Three minutes of blackness, something that looks like a dead hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credit. Savanna's impressive shot one minute. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Many 20-minute shots are spent on ships doing the first thing when the 'Blue Dube' plays in the background. A group of unprincipled dialogues, and a team of moon scientists found another type of search. <br /> <br /> Cut a spaceship for many long lasting crevices - three sleeping people, two known as Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in Hydration. And then there's HL, the 'perfect' supercomputer to run the ship. In anticipation, he started breaking the law of snap and robotics first. Now this is something that has this possibility. An evil, cold, ruthless super mind can control the surroundings and predict each of your steps. And what did he do? He flushed a person into space and stopped the hibernation machine so that three sleeping boys died, floating in a pig to Dave. He simply uses the aircraft, places it in a space, and closes the HAL - slowly and slowly. Then, obviously, there are some cyclical 'evolution' on Wednesday. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown of the photo: apps look alone, kill things. Scientists find the moon monolith. Kill the HL people HL dies; Dave receives a prerecorded message, and is developed on Wednesday. <br /> <br /> I do not get it. This is absolutely nothing to be bored of tears by the long stretch. Of course, this is realistic, but I think there is no reason to care for me. No matter the message, no movie can be good without entertaining. Actually, each character can be replaced with the Kino River, and nothing will change.
