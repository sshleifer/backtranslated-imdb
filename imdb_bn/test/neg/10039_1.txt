I do not understand why people appreciate this movie. I do not like it at all. I see it with many people. None of them care for it. First of all. It is simply common that another low budget studio is trying to cash in a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. Makeup is bad. When you watch the movie with additional DVDs. You will find that there is lot of encouragement for participants. There is no talent. There are events that appear in the book. The incident is distorted by the discovery of comedy and by adding it to the skits. I have read several books and saw several shows in this story. It was a serious horror story that I have always caught from all these elements. I really wish nobody could make this a really good movie It always fascinated me. Bad acting really destroyed the story. The situation of the little boys really hammed it up more When you watch this movie The little boy and his problem is that you and your friends will remember and laugh. His brothers laughed at what had happened and laughed. It seemed as though the magician had been under much threat, but it was OK to cast a brother's brother. This is a great story with her and her little problem. I'm still not telling a little girl, "Mom said that tobacco will rub your teeth." Frank Fox's statements and facial expressions are so bad. The scene playing with her after getting the food is quite stupid. From some parts of the word it appears from the movie Cyco. Also, the bed and its little "pale control control problem" is from the girl Exorcist. This movie is a lack of creativity talent. We kept the movie for a few minutes and knew it was a bumper. I noticed that the quality of their pictures was faulty. It seems that some parts of the home video camera can be captured by a person. I've noticed many people of credit had multiple jobs. Probably how the film was put together. Someone said I like this story. I will get all my friends and make a movie about me with a video camera and a computer. We do not know how to work. As long as we get it at the film and say it is good. We got a family together and prepared food. Then saw failure and failed attempts to make a movie.
