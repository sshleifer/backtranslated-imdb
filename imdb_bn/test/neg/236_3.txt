Like many movies associated with little kids, it closes the "real clever" and favorites ... and then, after about one and a half hours or so, the opposite becomes the opposite. <br /> <br /> This is the time-travel story here (which I usually love) where an adult meets a child who is only eight years of age! Bruce Willis is a fantastic and superb actor, but ..... <br /> <br /> The child "Rasti" is a smart-alike and Queen Brat and Willis Rusty has grown up now, like "Russell" has become boring, its constant with yelling That entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall, frustrating movies, especially releasing all good news. After receiving this film got the film.
