Skilled professionals live in an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night They dumped smugle They drop the pig in the parachute. They fly under impossible hazardous conditions. They work in weird dress and weirder. They are iconoclastic, insulting. They violate the rules of the command and insult the CIA for their employers. They are unchanging. <br /> <br /> No. This is "Angels Wings Only" and it's not "M * A * S * H". This is both a disgraceful mix that is unfortunately more foolish than fun. <br /> <br /> It threatens, entertainment, and education, but does not achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As far as the quality of its shock is concerned, well, we are injured by now, are not we? Is it true that someone threw a group of hard-pilot pilots to launch the secret mission of Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not frustrating. It is not educational now in our present situation, when it would be interested to know that some semi-military travel national minimum interest was not buried in a file named Defense de Toucher. OK. So we have wised up a little and are not so frustrating so silent. <br /> <br /> The problem with this case is that this ability depends on those qualities for its ability. Without that, implodes the film. A group of cats drunken CIA pilots roam the cat's house, threw girls, throwing a lamp with a silent pistol, simultaneously killing the craftman. Fellow pilot Robert Doney, Jr., says, "When you do such things, does that mean there is something to celebrate?" Another answer, Gufffing, "No, it means the time of the night." We would be ashamed if we expected the pilot to be as honest as we left. If we do not, like the movie, the movie is flat. <br /> <br /> There are naturally action scenes. There may be a plane or a plane on the flight, or anything happens to the plane. People come out from them, the luggage is suddenly dropped out of their haps, the engine fails, they survive the AAA damage, they separate during the crash landing, but we have seen elsewhere, often good. <br /> <br /> Some people might find this fun than me, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Doni Junior is as effective as the direct man. Check out other comments and if they give a description of a film that you think may be objectionable, always see it. It may have laugh at something that escaped me.
