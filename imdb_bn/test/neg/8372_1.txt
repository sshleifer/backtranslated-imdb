It really has seen the worst movies in my lifetime (I'm getting closer to 47)! The back cover of the cover has been fixed at the beginning of the film as well as the scrolling lesson. The next plot was taken and a group of corpses showed more life in their "acting". I saw it full length and the death of the ultimate character is really released when my sign of pain! The location is either vault or any kind of a rural beach. I think, home video equipment was served as camera and the light was sub-standard. The conversation was uninspired and meaningless. The actors were confronted. Which brings me to the "Make Up" topic: On seeing its appearance, they got hostage as some of the tin-agar magazines "My First Own Make Up" or similar. Why did the DVD buy me? "Love Kumar" was printed on the cover. The only connection to the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "nicronomicon", which was incorrectly translated as "light book". I had a complete loss of paid 4,70 euros for this DVD, the DVD went to the reusable box without any ado.
