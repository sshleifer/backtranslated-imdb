In 2003, three young college women, Simona (Eva Krojnak), Alja (Tanja Podokonic) and Jaana (Piya Jamaljik) in Maya Vision's Slovenian film continued an adventure by dividing Slovenia in the Kolpa River Croatia. The Eastern European version of the famous and thrilling "oriental" in 1972 turned into my favor, which denied the sympathetic identification with letters. And not everyone is a believer as a student, although Alzah has expressed the desire to be a writer, and both of them seem to be a very bad language. Alza feels disturbed with her boyfriend and just drifting along with life. Nana, even less scholar, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction of other women. I had some sympathy with relatively innocent Simona, conservative and starred eyes. The very idea of ​​traveling together these three do not just work for me. Jana and Alza see at Simona that disrespect is not understood - why would they choose him as a traveling companion, of course they must know his turmoil and attitude? <br /> <br /> Three start to relax. Undeterred by a news story of the disappearance of a woman along the river, the river on two canoes. False occult events, sometimes real and sometimes potential sculpture fishermen politicians (Jonas Jindersky) are threatened with. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed three scenes of rivers and small villages. . It may be due to the lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me otherwise. I was surprised that the picture won some awards.
