Perhaps it was created in 1997, or anyone who was able to handle it till 7th, is a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really man, curiosity is a happy and recaptured scene during the Maya? Did not you see that coming? I am surprised no crib is crawling with cameras and ceiling. Acting was fine, sure. But to me it is the only example of a film that can pass the situation and subject for the language of the movie. The incident is happening, but that's it. There is no glue or purpose that can be detected on the screen, it allows the use of pre-existing emotional links with the subject as it is supposed to do without scripting the script.
