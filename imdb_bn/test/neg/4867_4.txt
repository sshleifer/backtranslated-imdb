All of these looked pretty promising. President Obama's adviser has been formed for the continuation of the assassination as a conspiracy is being observed in the Human House. It's a nice Donald Sutherland star among several capable actors. Yet very few people have a good word to tell about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needs some depth. You can accept the idea that the President is very leftist with his ideas and some in the government want to keep him dead to stop these ideas. Conrad seems to want to lead the country on its path rather than the path of the elected state. However, there were some reasonable holes in the action scenes - Seven and Eleventants are already mentioned, and rather the violent killing system - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely underlying. His 'president's' my father 'package' was ridiculous - that happened when the President did about 10. His predecessor's final scene with Bishop was still bad. <br /> <br /> They could create a challenging, innovative political thriller, but it was bottle or failed. They went to the city of special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They can generally achieve so much. This was barely worth Â£ 1. It's my cost.
