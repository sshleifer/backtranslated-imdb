Poisonous avengers, the terribly deformed animals and the forces of human nature have returned to this continuation, which is mostly wrong. Toxy goes to Japan with the advice of his parents on his psychological advice, which is treated badly by a corrupt person in his absence, if he wants to have a tragic injury to Trumwell. Takesy and his girlfriend's newcomers, who have such a different name, are less serious, much more ridiculous tones and a plot line that basically can not hold a candle. Even if you have purchased the Tote Box DVD set, however the fully featured version is available, the only thing Gore is going for it. And if you happen to be on any other version forget about any enjoyment from this one. Although the first is a low budget classic, it is not just that. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> I.
