This is a terrible film. Angie Dickenson is a class act and always works well, but she has no other role and she may need some money to make this movie. However, he has less than 10 minutes on screen. Oh, wait, there is a feature of the release of this movie: this movie contains a small part of Meg Foster. Now, Meg is on screen for 35 years and is not particularly good, but the actress I saw has the most scary eyes. By name, you probably do not know him, but look at his eyes and you will recognize him. In short: acting is horrible, the story is bad, even the cinematography is horrific. Every time a director wants to change the screen, a screen going black is quite moronic. See anything else, even Mr. Ed again!
