Probably not the same version as most of the other versions because there is no hard hard-core sex. What does people mean by hard-core sex? Clear hard-core sex seen in Tracy Lords and "Big" John Holes movie? However, this is really a poor film, I've ever played in a big movie that saw a big name actor. The script is really poor and unconvincing, guideline and cinematography is awful and the execution does not exist. It's really a terrible film. You can see these ten times and still do not understand what it is about. The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried in their necks and a giant Lonmoyar comes and decapses them. Yes, which you read correctly, there is a scene in a roman time movie that is visible with Head Capping Giant Lonmohar! <br /> <br /> <br /> Tivaya Point. Many years ago a pirate copy of The Thing (1982 edition) was doing rounds of my Island and it was copied to a rental tune in Kaliglia, meaning that Thirer's pirate version starts with the first few seconds of caligels and the woman walks through the forest, then the titles order title Starts. The people who saw this pirate tape under the leadership of the public knew that John Carpenter was in the opening scene of the 1982 film and was very confused with what he meant.
