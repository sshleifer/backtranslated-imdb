I just saw this on TV today. It was on ABC's Sunday afternoon movie. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but it was right for low budget independent films. There are some mysteries, but there are so many bad features that really bring the film down. The script is too long, and the plot components are not very realistic, as a 911 operator will smile and when someone reports the killing, it will hang. I do not know what the writer thought when he came up with this idea, but it is not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is going to be a mysterious thriller because there were some scenes that seem to be something good, but unfortunately, they never did. There are some conspiracy elements that have been used in other such films, and in the end it has not been proven to be very creative. <br /> <br /> If it is good about this movie then cast it. Every actor in this movie has done well to work with them. Great actress Elizabeth Pena was a great star in this movie. She is very sexy, and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie that is really good, see the wonderful animated film The Incredibles. In that movie, she kept her sexy voice in good use. <br /> <br /> I can say, this movie is not really valuable for your time, but the actor was good. Unfortunately, they are all a waste of this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good mystery thriller, but eventually it became flat. If you want to see a better movie like this, look better, see Hitachi. If you want to watch something with Cast Cast members in this movie, then see another movie. If you ever get the chance to see it, you can easily pass this movie.
