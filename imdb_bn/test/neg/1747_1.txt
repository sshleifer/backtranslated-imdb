Although the acting was extraordinary, I spent the whole time waiting for the nasty boy in the movie, who received so much sadness that he got the ultimate generosity, and instead of everyone else took advantage of him and got the job of a husband whose wife died due to his death To flee, the girl wins and tries to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the influence of butterflies fails to return to him. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark film that affects every character, sometimes it does not tolerate sadness. The usual natural methods of relief do not seem to be effective, and the authorities only provide stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland, I am never going to be influenced by such amorial butterflies and I go back to the destruction of the characters of this movie.
