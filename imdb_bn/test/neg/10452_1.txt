Sci-Fi Channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; It's a shameful case. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Up. I know they know that they are the total waste and the difference between high-quality science and fai. <br /> <br /> How many years ago they were becoming all high and strong, produced a production that was not only for us, LAM and Trekkies. Thanks a lot, science! You know, you make movies so bad, even the Trekki will not be able to monitor them, so you have achieved your goal! Fire suppresses, ice spiders, mantikors, larvae etc. And after a huge helpless CRAF-storm, and they are still slow too slow than the latest flu virus! How they do it out of my mind Why they do it, I just do not know. How can they ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and e-mails, I do not even know, but it is clear they do not think most of their listeners and take care of our opinions! I think this is what sci-fan fans want! If you think that this junk is on a green lamp holiday, then in one sense one or two good productions will be reduced. At least they are engaged in collecting misfit toys; Most of the week's actors need cash once and now in the film science fiction show. You love, and hope you get some good work!
