There was so much controversy surrounding this photo that it was really embarrassing (in other words, the infamous thing between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosellini), it attracted many attention to a very forgotten movie. The story is incredibly slow, looking cheap and uninteresting. And, to keep it at the top, the film is jammed with amateur artists who can rarely speak English. I really liked the subtitles - it made the experience less tedious. Playing rotten back. The Italian neo-realist movement was big when making this film. Most of these movies are full skills (such as D'Sika's Umberto D, The Children's Air Watching Us and Milan in Milan), because they got much more from non-professional actors. They behave like normal people, but in Strombolie they behave like normal people and try to act and come very badly - like kids in school. <br /> <br /> However, if you expect that the movie has a good finish (which will promise you timely commitment to your movie), do not bother. This plot was completely uninterrupted and stupid - so many, I have really found out that I could have been less careful about the characters. They all live like the island, without film solitude and color or life.
