Positively humorous film. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Sheryl Jones and Shirley Knight continue to do this type of films, they can submit their retirement and collect full-time social security. It is speculated that 35-year-old Swinger, who works in the video game, lost her apartment and was forced to move her to Grandma Roberts and Jones and Knights, who were stupidly confronted. Imagine that Alex has put Alex in their house and Jones is going to bed with someone who can be eligible as his grandson! <br /> <br /> The sequence of video games is as stupid film as the rest. The assortment of characters working with Alex is also beyond belief because he enjoys his weed practice with others. <br /> <br /> The terrible best describes this sad film.
