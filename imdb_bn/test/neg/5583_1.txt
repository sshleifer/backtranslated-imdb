This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The film highlights the contrast between the smell of natural gas and the dirty cells. <br /> <br /> The actress is sad. I know hard work and stuff played, but for that reason it should be left to the real actor. Seeing the work of this man Michael J. Fox shows brain surgery It is well shaky. <br /> <br /> Another comment you believe is that the film is saved by Dan Gordon's acting talent as Chris. Only Dan himself or his mother may believe in good acting. <br /> <br /> Special effects on this movie were terrible. Lighthouse gas explosion had the worst effect. It seems like someone is illuminating orange light below the model made from the fridge box. Definitely a small computer animation layer was leveled up, but it did not help. I think the special effects of this movie were made and render using the single megaphone computer at the end of the 80's.
