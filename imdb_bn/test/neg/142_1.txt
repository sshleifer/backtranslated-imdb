This movie is on hyped !! I'm going to watch anything in the first 15 minutes of this movie and beyond, I have to work myself to sit down and work hard to see the rest of the film. It's totally stupid and very fake. The film's robot looks like a man wearing a steel suit and acting is very bad, especially the performers of Allian. He is completely annoying !! Do not waste your money by watching this sign in popular Zen-X police. I would like to spend my money on sleeping or otherwise rather than watching this movie. 10. If 10 out, I would like to give 0.
