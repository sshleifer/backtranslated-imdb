This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but do not see it if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> When Laurel and Hardy are the heirs of an island, ships are broken and set to fitting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 40's films were not great, this film was made in the 1950's. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember their main head in the 1930s. Short talk feature is better than length films, my favorite "May and My Pal". Another reason for this picture is horrific because it is dubbed. The actor opened his mouth and three days later the words came out. Absoulutley's crap, but let's end up on a high note, Lorele and Hardy, in my opinion, have sometimes done the best double job.
