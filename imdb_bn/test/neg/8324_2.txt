(This review is based on the English language version) <br /> <br /> 'Orson Welles' was remarkably incomplete epic - incomplete. It should have been left in such a way that this material was not found, the boring set of these elements found. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure that it's done with the best intentions, filmmakers have failed to justify the viewpoint of the Welsh, they have been able to humiliate the audience even by suppressing this version. <br /> <br /> The first thing to hit the audience is the audio quality of audio. New dubbed voices are not bad at all, they are also inconvenient - the original recordings of Wales (using their own voice, as they often did) hold some views and they do not match at all. The adjustment has not been the least effort. Add a very empty sound mix that only has minimal sound performance and atoms - sounds a long sequence of a huge festival (with the running of the buds), such as it creates about three people on a lonely subway street. <br /> <br /> However, The real problem is that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete, and it is very clear to see it. The film is firmly involved in a number of scenes and dragged towards the ridiculous length of time for the current period. Case on point - where Sancho explores Don Quixote in the city forever. It is coming to the Sancho crowd, again asking the same question - Well, in no way did Wales ever use it in any way to use it in its entirety, but it is displayed here. It will last for more than a few minutes, in fact, it will probably be the maximum maximum of approximately two minutes in the correct version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film is relatively complete and perfectly completed, the rest has a lot of holes which can not fill continuous overlays in the Spanish countryside and still more and more knocks of Don Quixote and Sancho are going back and forth. There is no end. There are no resolutions, no conclusions, no pentamels, no point. <br /> <br /> While personal films contain elements which were unavailable to filmmakers, it probably can not confirm what it will do for it. Complete, coherent work. Wells did not complete shooting only, essentially his lead actor died before he died. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just look at this skill to see the footage that would be enough to think that. Unfortunately, by putting together all in a slipshod manner, one is left overall with a very negative impression of the film overall. Especially, Akkim Tamiroff, like Saqoch, is clearly an extraordinary performance, new voices and perfectly tall, stretched scenes which can eventually make him annoying. <br /> <br /> The film was even more ambitious and complex than the restoration of the story of Don Quixote in Ososon Wells, but it has been tried here and thus the point is lost. The only person who could combine all the elements in any way, he himself was Wales, and he did not do it. <br /> <br /> The footage can be used more effectively by documenting the entire footage in the documentary. Wells are trying to create the film. Wales itself came up with even the perfect title for such a doc: "Are you going to finish Don Quixote?"
