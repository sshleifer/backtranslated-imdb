It is amazing to think that the film is coming out just a year before Star Wars, but it seems to be a million years after sophistication and special effects. Indeed, art direction and set design (excellent Victorian Space Ship) is not bad; It's the most ridiculous that the giant costume, obviously similar to the "TV in a rubber case" from LOST in the TV show. The evil cave man reminds me of some alien to makeup ancient twilight zone reruns. <br /> <br /> The script is stilted, and Peter Kuhring's comic relief played out very complimentary. This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy the bad kitschy SF. And the music ... e ikes! Cinematographers have a horrific 70th test that is not compatible with the film's length and sounds like rumming with a minimug and 2-track tape machine.
