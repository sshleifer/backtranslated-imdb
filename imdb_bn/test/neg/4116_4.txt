Yes sure, the movie was already horrific and not very committed, but the premiere and cast were good, so I still hope to be entertained by this movie. This was unfortunately not the case. The compound is good but the story is filled with incomplete and reasonably flawed. <br /> <br /> It is possible to put this movie under the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It is good enough to make a good bold movie you feel better. But the movie failed to entertain and I think that this film is the biggest flaw. Perhaps it sounds very serious and a little more humor does not harm the movie. Instead, it is nothing but a long and cheap looking movie, after the other is filled with an unlikely event, it stole a little more than other, more successful movies. Basically the "Jurassic Park" is obviously <br /> <br /> characters do not help to watch the movie look more compelling or at least interesting. I still think Edward Barnes has done a fairly good job as the 'heroic' principal leader. However, the remaining letters really get confused with the movie and they do something very interesting. The movie relies heavily on its visual, which is very poor. Kathryn McCormack also plays a very annoying character. Basically, he complained about all the characters and spoke about how accurate he was and the rest of them were also wrong. His character is not just a liking. And the rest of the letters ... Well I've already forgotten their name, I think that's enough about them. This is true, but Ben Kingsley's performance only makes this movie worth watching. He is really extraordinary in his extraordinary business venture, but from the moment when he disappears from the movie, the film really goes to the extreme speed. Actually the movie is very poor. It has some terrific looking CGI effects and even they do not have the easiest 'blue-screen' effects to appear in the film firmly. Setting is also looking terrible and cheap, they can fall over and break up every moment. <br /> <br /> The story can be exciting, exciting, or adventurous, because the story is at least interesting and compelling. . This is a very remote film with remote characters that fail to influence. There are lots of programs but they all are so ludicrous and trustworthy that they are never imagined or good enough. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < After creating some good films from the 70's and 80's, it's sad to see how much less Peter Peter had run out of the last few years. <br /> 4/10
