On the plus side these topics have interesting information on broad topics, especially related to Himalar, SS and their research branch. It has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some extraordinary camera work. <br /> <br /> But it is a very bad part of historical work. It has no clear aim and the whole thing can be summed down as follows. <br /> <br /> Established a study of the origins of the German Dynasty in a section of the Himalayas SS. They went around the world. They did some things and started the operation in all kinds of places ... (In this way, the search was done, the results were not shown, and the arguments were rarely denied). They wanted to establish one and the same thing by the Aryan race and the German people through historical evidence. They could not find any. The member of the laboratory was a professor, a member of SS and so was associated with Holocaust and saw him after the war and led the leadership of the German Institute. <br /> <br /> The information among themselves is impressive but they are not searched deeply and there is no logical argument presented in the program that condemns or exposes these people. It seems to be the goal of the program, the goal of the program is unclear, it does not matter to the subject. Witness, though presented as credible, few and unsupported. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the program does not know where it is going or why it fails to influence. Things are interesting but this program tries to take a huge area of ​​research and is not known what is happening. I want to avoid it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the bloody Hill Grillis, as well as the holy grail of Christian mythology in Germany. The aims of the campaign to find Christian sacred polishing were made, but it was not followed. The title is confusing and the contents of this document are incomplete and incomplete.
