By updating Herman Melville (!), Relating his abnormal soil to the unusual barbarous relationship of a young man, he transferred his long lost sister, who was raised by Gypsy. Or something like that ?? Nobody is really concerned about uncovering his multi-layered plot equipped with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (swim swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a Gypsy kid repeatedly killed anonymously on the street by insane pedestrians, a Rock group deaf music destroyed the old buildings). Considering the presence of source material and Catherine Danev (who has barely baked bath), I was expecting more than this one; Obviously, there is a TV version of Pola X ??
