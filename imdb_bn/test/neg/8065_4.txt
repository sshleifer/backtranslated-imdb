This image is as many as Canisal Holocaust. 'Shock' ("Oh, look at us, we've added real death to our movies"). It was not for the unbecoming non-living organisms.) These films will travel towards my dull classics. I am a huge fan of cannabal movies and zombies. But it stands, this is another example of the shock horrors spreading to the end of the slope, by a great effort to make a poor movie more popular. The sum up, flush with a crusty gore limited appeal. A fan of Gore 70 could try it, but someone with modern morality and taste wrote a little better for their popcorn-fest.
