6 comments out of 8 comments on this value have been rated as valuable, so let me fix the balance. <br /> <br /> If British independent filmmakers make this the best offer, they need to pack them now and find work in their cameras and other industries. Unfortunately for me 82 minutes I will never see it again and hopefully I'll save you some time to lose your own 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the movie is interesting, but it is not enough to keep viewers connected. Student letters are flexible and selfish and quite a bit you will not care about what happens to them. The soldiers are actually the artist of all the badies shown in the film, I have waited for Kalpana Marqueque's fantasy skills. Some effects were quite good and some imagined, but they were disappointingly frustrated by poor performance, poor script writing and patchy camera work. The budget could have been used by the "actor" (and I used that little bit of less) to play the budget or to make Thomas Brothers filmmaker or perhaps spell-checker, because the subtitles were created incorrectly. Misspellings have not been selected and corrected, the volume of the whole production is incomplete. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that positive comments are handled by filmmakers, whether they are watching a completely different movie. I request the Brothers Brothers that if they continue their job, they will not leave their daily jobs, they will surely die.
