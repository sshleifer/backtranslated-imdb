How many movies are going against all swaps, a rage TAG team runs big Google with all the money? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "Big Green" If anything, you want to lose them. Steve Gutenberg had a good resume ("boys from Brazil", "police academy", "cocoon"). Why, oh, why did he have to do this kind of movie in the 1990s and next? So, just avoid this movie. There are so many good movies there, so there is no reason to waste your time and money in this junk. Obviously, their mind had "green" meaning, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has made some cute films with Pixar.
