Jess Franco creates exploitation films, and he has created their tones. Franco is responsible for the most frustrating movies in film history, and God blesses him for him. Unfortunately, KiloMinzero's diamond is a real horror film that is not on its normal criteria. <br /> <br /> Movies should be judged on stories, sex and gore. What do you have This movie mostly fails. In the plot paper thin, a stranger is placed in the jungle between young girl cannibals. We did not really get information about why we and his father were in the first place. As expected, his father "Big White Chief" and he became naked, sitting in the tree, naked. Add fate hunters and precious stones, and you have the greedy purpose to rescue your basic girl for the plot line. Characters do not add an ounce of stock, credibility to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This image is often referred to as the same vein as the classic Italian cannonball movie. That type of cow is needed to run another way of seeking. Save for a cheaper bed heading, this movie surprisingly features little blood and hats. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can say this is that Katja Beanert, Alien Mess, and Marie Carmen Neito can also run. Near nude Actually "Leita" (Marie Carmen Nieto) hovers the entire frontal heave, although two jungle females live on the whole life cycle. Yes, there is a love scene .... Perhaps most sterile fronco has ever been supervised. The woman is beautiful, but there is nothing here to make this movie really a erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This movie only raises the buffoonery of less budget. Set ridiculous Acting is awesome, and editing is confusing. Do not put this together, and there is no real story to hold a budget (or effort) enough to shock or title. I think Franco fans have come to expect more from the exploitation master.
