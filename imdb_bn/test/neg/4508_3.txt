Demon as Victor Buono? Of course, someone who has been drunk at the time of making a counter decision. This lady is not the worst part of this innocent Mash-Mash on Hunted House devices, but I get my vote as the most interesting part of it. Although the film is not terrible, it does not communicate with the "ghost house" of the 1st of 1970, such as MTVill Horre, The Changing and Hill House's The Legend of the Legend. Evil can be entertaining in the spot, but do not expect to be afraid. It has been better communicated like this: a stupid film made by Silly's most serious view of its film.
