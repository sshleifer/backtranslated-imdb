Sorry, but Jacqueline Hyde (Jack L. and Hyde-Jakeel and Hyde) has played the worst role of some hardcore actors, clearly not a scripts written in the first grade with the ability to learn strangers. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jackie Heidi inherits the old palaces of her grandfather. Who do you think? Yes, the inventor of special form, which gradually captures his body and mind - yes, Mr. Hyde! <br /> <br /> Despite some beautiful skin scenes, this film fails to register any feelings or emotions other than uncontrolled laughter. <br /> <br /> As much as the poor Jackie tries, he can not just stay away from Granddaddy's special formula and waste an hour and half during the time.
