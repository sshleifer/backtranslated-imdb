*** Sleet spinners *** This installment story of the Full Moon franchise a bit and applies some new elements. The first is to stop a new puppy master. Secondly, dolls in this signal are well introduced. Finally, it also introduces some Sissy / fantasy elements. <br /> <br /> A new girlfriend, her girlfriend, her psychic friend and the psychic lover, Andrey Tollon's puppet trunk, fall on the infamous hotel. They can also learn tollen from some of the giants, which is miraculously responsible for secret theft for animation. So Sutreh (monster) sends the totem, a bunch of miniature creatures that look like a little cumin Then on top of the puppet troupe to take care of inter-dimensional threat that is trying to kill new dolls. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> How do the doll get back to the trunk? How does anyone remember the last ray of death in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why is a contractor with a building with history of genocide? These and many more questions will not be answered ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The original dream of this movie is played. It's actually quite good. The actors take it especially with an enthusiast unusual for a bunch of full moon anamas. Teresa Hill was especially embarrassing as shameful, nervous, psychological lorraine. The west of the moon (suji) was also a beautiful dream. Gordon Hill was a tolerant hero. But Cameron was very boring in the stomach. He died in half before God. <br /> <br /> Dolls usually have normal animated sevals. As well as with some improvements. Many people because of the words given to them by their emotions (especially Jashers). Blade Thesis, Pinhade Stain, and Six-Shooter Snicker have all developed and better sound. Stop-motion animations are only the best, especially the average of totems. They do not seem to move fluently in the previous installment of the series. Also Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull. How are we afraid of a lively look so lady? <br /> <br /> The story for the series seems a bit javascriptable. I think Charlie Band was looking to focus on a small population. The violence in this movie seems to be the same after getting reduced. Gore fans will be frustrated. <br /> <br /> I think the main issue above is that this movie can not really be with a lot of people. It does not have violence for gorewhores. The language is a little cleaner. Yet it is too violent and harsh for the wee ones. Why the movie gets less rating. I have to say that general reviews are mostly fair.
