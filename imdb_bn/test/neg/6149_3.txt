But then what happens again? I've picked it up at my local 99th store, you estimate it's 99 cents (plus taxes). I think this looks as video as a teen and think of it a cool flick. Very bad film and my memories do not match. However, this is not a very scary way to sleep for a few hours, and some vintage bills are quite clear to see Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... blah .... blah .... man, these people, I can not think of something else to say about this flick ... (fill ten space only to meet the rules of the line ...) Good Golly, It is unfortunate, how bad is this film that I could relate to it was the writing of five ficnics? So anyway, ten lines of text, ah? Hmmm, Skate can not remember about a movie that came with ten lines.
