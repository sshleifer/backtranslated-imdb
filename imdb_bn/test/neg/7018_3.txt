Luceille can not sing or act or dance. This MAME makes its performance value all the more awesome. He was not allowed to do such a small pillar that hit him on TV, so he must rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Mrs. Ball never learned that skill because there is no warmth of flexible moments. How does he feel about Patrick or Beau really? We do not really believe what we say. In the empty scene of Miss Belle, she feels like we do not have any chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or B Arthur. <br /> <br /> Also, when Miss Bel began to sing, we immediately learned that the other songs which he played in the studio have dubbed his voice for him? Before his career. It was said that he wanted to use his voice so that this arrogance and leadership mistakes When he is singing on the song, it gets worse and he has to "manage the moment" without sound. <br /> <br /> I realized that Rosalin Russell played the role of stage and film anti-memes. Also, I'm aware that Angela Lansbury won Tony for her performance in the original 1966 Broadway musical. None of these women were known for their singing voices, but both of them could drag it better than Lucile Ball. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> She is big and wonderful, catty and common in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you are waiting to close this movie and have invited you to join the fun. But the movie is never and you can not do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Known as the winner of the musical and comedy award for Sax Stage and Screen, Broadway musical based on this movie. That's the expertise and expertise someone is here to help. The poor editing and story tale in this movie is the director of his eligibility. The blurring error in the film's brutality is not a fault of Miss Ball.
