It must be one of the worst gay-themed movies of all time. Who called so-called actors that they can work. Bad words - bad scripts - to dress them so they defy gesture reality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Friends should not really encourage to do this kind of tripe. <br /> <br /> and DVD - no menu access; It's worse than a VHS tape. Once started, you will see the whole thing - fortunately the fast forward button works - without doing anything else with this movie and the DVD.
