This is one of the "family" movies, which I can not imagine to appeal to more than 9 years. A group of siblings is a "sand elf" (yes, really) the secret passage of their secret uncle country in the country, in which they were evacuated from London Blitz. ... and you have it, all one sentence. The story is about the danger of magic in childhood and the danger of fulfilling the wishes, but none of these things is examined in such a way that it is interesting for the adults or the instructional (or the opposite!) To the kids. The only reason for this is that Freddie Hymner's extraordinary talent is seen to be far away from Medieval Performance.
