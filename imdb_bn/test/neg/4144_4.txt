I do not want to write this movie to western world reviews and critics, I mean how wrong they have done in Asia's movies, which has become the main food of the Hollywood rickshaw now? Plus Jet El is quite beautiful, and he has made some interesting movies of Asia. So with an open mind I was wonderfully formed by this movie. <br /> <br /> there are good points. The story is very clever, using the M-theory to advance a platform so that there are more universes with their own versions around the world, and perhaps you Each time you are a destroyer, the energy and energy share between them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A martial artist, plus Jason Statham who is a good actor in a round For special effects, some of them are really cool, mixing in bullet and speed with normal speed, places are too cool to look at. <br /> <br /> bad point? Well Statham's pronouncement is frustrating, and some effects are not comparable to others, so it is quite clear that some money has been spent on the original mobile phone, not to others, which is probably considered to be too small on the screen or they just went out of the plain budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is done. It emphasizes a single fist or movement, it actually looks more difficult and more realistic and hides what's happening near the camera lens. For example, people with a fake hand or stunt double <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Chan always tried to open the camera and show the viewers what they were seeing, let them see people face-to-face and Fighting, somebody falling into the frame. The whole picture is more effective, and it is more effective. <br /> <br /> So close shots were more annoying than you, you fail to see the fascination of Lee's fighting skills and you see some of the difficult actions in it. Light loss and camera pan out of the Hollywood Director! Although, despite its strong foundation, it was the biggest problem, they were reducing the feeling of conspiracy and concentrating on action scenes. Some serious plot buildings and explanatory moments that are completely ignored and covered in some sentences, but these can develop some extraordinary and complex character development. <br /> <br /> It's all weak to get involved together, and stories have not been made enough. After all, it is not a great movie and its feasibility is badly damaged.
