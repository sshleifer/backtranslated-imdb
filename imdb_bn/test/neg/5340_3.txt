Well, this is a monogram faster than the horrible time of the 40s when poverty rows studios reveal many "horrible" movies which are almost impossible to be shameless ... so I was expecting the worst. <br /> <br /> This story has expressed concern about a doctor who is working on the way of recovering the dead from the full-scale use of morally usable non-utility electric devices. A dog's heart is hanging beneath a bell and twitching properly, which we are aware is its method of proof is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the spiritual effects and an important plot point before mentioning a young man is inevitable death rather than the immune sequence of those who are resurrected - even immensely with sparks. The important plot point is that a guilty killer is being executed at midnight, which will be fine when the young man is resurrected. The young man is very different after his experience, no surprise! It is strange to meet the hungry and underworld hunt and meet the specific gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It is hard to explain why this is not entirely ineligible, but it is probably enough to say it is silently interesting and different killings And there are a couple of interesting characters In the end, it started to collide with even a bit of real tension and conflict with Hitachi. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn about the worst, bad warning. An unnecessary tag, ass sorta end pain. After the plot is resolved effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the thing ... it's a dream. Never happened
