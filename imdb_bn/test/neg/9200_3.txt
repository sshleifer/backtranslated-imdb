I really enjoyed the film. It was really impressive at the time. (They destroy the arch with hair dryer - but where are they plugged in?) This is a unique film, and I enjoyed playing Courtney Dropper and Tamara Hope. I also enjoyed Funuel (but you wrote it ...) Megan Charcher liked him because he called him a dub. In addition to acting, it was interesting to show "Rewinding" and Ariel and then Megan's perspective. I saw it twice and I want to see it again
