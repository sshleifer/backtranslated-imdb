If you are going to watch this movie then I am not worried - <br /> <br /> <br /> For me, the film failed to produce grade at all levels and it is mostly British (Irish) films. The forgotten trip I can say is the best. It was terrible to make some more interesting at the start of five minutes at the beginning of the telly l. I have seen this movie with a group of friends and the press previews are ready to be critical and hopefully a fun pass within 90 minutes. But, Oh dear ... <br /> <br /> It was not funny as a comedy, a stupid story like a thriller was gentle and lazy. Completely incredible as a love story. Lack of both style and charm as most 'brilliantly a piece on top whimsy' The gambons and kine did what they had to do to earn their money ... smugglers and kine. It's just me, but other than the game to play past gangsters and jack jacks, Michael Caine leaves you cold? Justify, some of my friends think it was okay but if you go, I have a few drinks (or puffs) before my advice and leave your critical faculty locked safely at home. <br /> <br />
