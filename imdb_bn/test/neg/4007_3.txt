Finally. Here is a movie that does a lot to honor the people of Greece and Russia, such as "Gogli" Mr. For Fleck and Mrs. Low. From the outskirts of the city, some Russian embassy has been told about the tragic and strange life of the residents around and around Athens, and during their time spent, steal cars, thirst for women and make themselves fall ("We are not gay because we do not know you. And if we do, it's only once or twice. With the same person. ") There is nothing here that you have before and Well never good; Only the Athens locale adds a new innovation - even then a scene or two that is beautiful. Writer / director Constantine Zaunner's ("3 Steps of Heaven") offers a relatively generic 95 minutes, in which standout moments are stupid, sexist, and things seem to be mostly that these guys (Interestingly, like a gear, she feels more valuable.) What is actually the treatment of women? Greek and Russian men seemed to be giving a run for their money related to Italian's famous Madonna / Shot Complex. Since the time of Plato and Socrates, did life in Greece improve a lot for women? <br /> <br /> If I think Russian and Greek are equal in this review, I apologize, but non-immigrant (cab driver, for example) crop pictured here. According to another review on this site, the film (hit on its home turf) was actually submitted by Greece for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. What does this say about the making of Greek movies, I do not hesitate to think.
