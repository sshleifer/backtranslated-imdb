Steven Sigal is back! Here's his third film released this year. Of course, once as a fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can tell that it comes as no surprise as a pretty lame. Initially, the film created the title due to visible problems produced due to Sigl. He will be set-up late, changes to the script, crew etc. and usually the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent will suffice for his trouble!) It is their second collaboration in the upcoming Mercury which is committed as bad as this garbage. It also marks a big bending point in Segal's carrier because the film is the first to dig its first stock footage. There was little to ticker but this image took the biscuit. They are Bit, The Order (a movie in Van Dyne, Sigal's biggest competitor in the DTV movie!) No code of conduct, controversial and no action in the leading top ranking of Peter Weller. Interestingly, the car that was stolen from Weller's epic made about 10 years ago and was probably cheap from the garbage, in fact it is the film's best step view. The stock action of Dolph Lundgren was a short work in the video world when I was a bit confused, which escaped from there. Siegel, however, is currently the leader of the DTV Action Market, Van Dam and Snippets are their main rivals. Sigal still manages to sell movies and for my life I do not know how. Certainly fans are becoming bored of this horror, eager to get back the choices on the law. The story here is completely hair. Indeed, this film has many plot holes which are not indifferent about it. For example, there is a little girl at the end of a movie, Segal apparently knows the orphan that she gives a necklace. I do not know why, but we never saw him in the rest of the movie, or he heard his mention. Sigal has a girlfriend in this movie who is with a mentality at the beginning of the film and he is frightened by the view, which never explains at the end of the film and does not mean anything. The film is so harmoniously combined by a series of pap that it is feeling headache .. It's far away from Seagal's dumbest movie! Segal itself is like a wood, but he did not dabbed as much as he could for his achievements. Segal feels the need to talk like his gangster rapper, in his classic early films, he made me a long time in his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent days. He has a painful weird double job with Treach, who I guess is a rapper. The producers think that how Sigal's combo, plus the Hip-Hop star seems to work, seems to be funny, because with Premier Wings DMX, his team was the most successful film from under-seagulls. Clearly, if someone does not listen to rapper, it will not work. It is an action film and so must be judged by the action itself. Unfortunately the non-image back catalog was not strictly routine. But while some classic Seagal have few small battle scenery with Aikido, 90% are performed by double its stunt, who really has a harsh job in this film, it really does not affect much. There are really some fierce and bloody squibbage going on for them in some standard gun fights. This is a painful annoying experience and I am giving the same verdict: Sigal has lost it! I am asking the old question now, "Why do people still see their movies?" It is a very good and good but sad thing as a question that I hope its films continue, they can do something good again. The chances are the opposite of Seal, Seagal's ever expanded waistline. * 1/2
