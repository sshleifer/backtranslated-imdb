Clustered Land is a nasty piece of work with gorgeous actors. There is nothing more (or less) in the movie except the misuse of abused female prisoners by a suspected police officer. Setting is minimalist This can be considered as a soft-core S & M porn because the play is not without reference reference points at the time, place and political context. Because of the horrors that have happened in the fantasizing future environment, abuse has become completely personal. Pornographic aspects are justified by the warning of the universal government's evil, but there is no real reference to this young girl's torture because we get annoyed but have not learned anything. <br /> <br /> point? Does that torture exist in the world? That insulting prisoner is bad? Do dictatorship abuse innocent people? We already know that. Clown Land is working as Nunan and Isenseco Renoiros as the Darkness, but both works have been created by capable artists whose work is a historical context and depth of money. This work is sophomoric in amateur and dialogue. Below a specific thumb.
