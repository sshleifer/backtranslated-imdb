These pictures are so incredible horror! Everything about it was garbage. You can not say anything good about this film, acting, scripts, directions, effects all as bad as each other. Even the ed wood could do a better job than this. Unless you want to prolong 100 minutes of your life or film, I have advised to stay away from this movie. I forget This is the first time I wrote a comment about a movie on IMDB, but this film was only on TV and the film lovers had to tell the world that the picture was captured !!!!!!!!!!! So you have no servitude left to you. Go and hire many good bad movies like critters 3
