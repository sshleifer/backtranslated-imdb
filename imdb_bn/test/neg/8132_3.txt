I really wanted to like this movie but it rarely made 3. It is surprising that the vote was equal to 10, the other half was 1. All the characters were entertaining and even gifted, but the film was not completely closed. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; Charitative and preferred (he physically feels Marcus Anthony more comfortable but ultimately consciously sort of way ...) but he could not even save this mess of a movie. The scenes stretch for a long time and eventually die. Art fringed on the self-absorption of rock, showing how many movements in his boxer were seemingly. But in his defense it was his first film as director (who is aware) and I appreciate his labor labor. Despite trying to say it left me empty. Eventually I think the story will be managed by a more experienced director. I have seen an 'extra', from which there is a real story behind it and probably when I meet them, I will make the effort even more grateful.
