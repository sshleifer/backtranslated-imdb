I think this movie is a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a weird kid and is messed up severly! My memory could be wrong, was she just 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** Why does he dispute over boys for the past who left college and rented an apartment with a crazy girls? And the cowboy who lived under Jones, drove me out, he did not float me for a minute what happened in the apartment. I did not understand her idea about the girl that took pictures for fun and when Mandy Moore was always in her house, and it was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than her friends. I really did not find this movie funny or arts or dramatic or something, I found it stupid and time-consuming waste (DF).
