Seeing this movie really surprised me. I could not find myself completely stopped watching a movie because 3 dollars would be a good amount of money to rent a film and it would be torn off, at least I would see the whole thing and my money would be worth it. When I thought of myself, I made it in about 30 minutes of a completely unclear film, now I see a little more figs after watching this movie. I can not believe that the directors and actors of this movie actually allow them to reduce this honor! <br /> <br /> There is nothing I did not say to other critics, but in the worst of the film, usually there are one or two good performances ... this is not gorgeous rubbish. I saw good acting in high school drama. Each, and I mean, that every 'actor' is bad outside of belief, and what really is amazing is that the uniformity of evil ... Lord, must be the director. Where do they get these people? <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen. Although its ridiculous script and even poor performances are entertaining in places, I rarely use that word, but it is unfortunate that this film has not been handed over to the B-film Hell for eternity. What a good idea could be that it is a very small budget, poor sound and influence, and actors who probably have their birds acquired in children's television, and at that time the children of poor children. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie. Your time is not even worth a minute.
