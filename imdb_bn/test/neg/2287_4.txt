It's more than just an adaptation of bond: it's a simple vacancy! With the meritorious character sketch not approved by Ian Flaming, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. An old (even haggard) Connery tries to resurrect her after 12 years. The result is a ridiculous, durable version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore day!
