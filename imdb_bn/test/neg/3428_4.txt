King farewell story is playful. An American "mortal" (I thought that he and his three comrades were trying to escape from the Philippines because Bourne is not your classic disappointment because of their intense escape). But when the Japanese discover it they do not take shelter. Nolt's character (a sergeant) just went on the beach a few minutes ago and was not noticed. And incredibly, someone did not see sand on his feet, which led the Japanese right. However, Nolty was taken by a group of headhunts and after defeating the other tribes, they became kings. So he is out of war. Then British commandos appear and want to help the tribe in the Japanese war. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the unstable hamming of Nolt has destroyed an interesting story. Rather than acting like a former soldier, instead of returning to the war, now with a tribe of fighters under his domination, the tube works like his tribe. He said that almost a foreign language in English, rarely using contractions. When he spoke, he made gestures explicitly, and acted as one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Interacting with Nolt with the British has lots of activities and lots of interesting views. Tribe But Nolt's character is not trustworthy. She always seems like overacting. She is an American soldier a little more and a tribe will be much less. For example, he not as a royal king, but as a madman who really forgot him. But the purpose of this film is that the script was appreciated and trusted by British rulers. There is no suggestion that the British treat their behavior as weird. He only saw the British as a defiant leader of the tribes. So, it always seems that Nolt's character is not suitable for what is happening in the film. <br /> <br /> Another actor has done great work on the role, made his line credible, and created it an outstanding movie. But Nolty does not understand every scene hamming and what her character is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
