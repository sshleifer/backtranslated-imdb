I had no idea about these movies, it linked the plot movement line from the plot line to the incoherent ideas of others. It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Cut-up time is not in the line helps. We came back a flash in the past today and then we go back to the future to go back in the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with a horrifying line and a princess-like clich√© theme. Puper, the lines "You can not stay at my death" lines, "You do not love me too much" line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The society was very interesting in diamonds. <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems difficult to follow this comment, the movie will be equally bad.
