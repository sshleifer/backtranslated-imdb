What a lousy movie, taking me 3 times to finish it. The thing that I dislike was humorous feeling. The joke created by a 10 year old child. Not funny Actually quite annoying, for example when detective heel can not get a place in the bar, he "he took it all off" yells and yells they run the "fast foreward" slapstick kinda push ' Very stupid And his post is a guy sitting on repeated times smashing fruit out of traumatic stress disorder. Bar! And Bartender gives him more and more fresh fruits. That's supposed to be fun? And I mean ... I love good ol 'absorption gore flicks, and saw many terrible movies, but its a simple bad one. And "Gore" is not that exciting. Do not disturb. I will not recommend it.
