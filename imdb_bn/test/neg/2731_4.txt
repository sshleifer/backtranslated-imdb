For scientist-fans, this may be anything that can be on TV at any time; You can tell me about it best. Good direction; Greetings and laughing ideas, such as movies, less dust than usual, the plot is coherent and does not use any magical mysterious manifestations. Bad sides; The author tries to try the good science, but it's direction and production (eg, a rock drilling rig, using a superhuman rock drilling tool, Nori wakes up under the water beneath the surface with a bubble or high humor), character clich√©s and revelations are happening in excellent stock quality . OK tired-to-to-some-evening type evening; But do not really expect any major improvements or even talking points.
