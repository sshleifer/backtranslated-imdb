... can not fix a good script or manager. <br /> <br /> The original 'Pausidan Adventure Tourism' was a story of great courage and bravery against personal tragedy. Those who are survived by a charismatic figure of great spiritual power will take something that God thundered on him. <br /> <br /> Try to mix the follow-up mix but fails through the direction of a formulaic script and pedestrian. Irwin Allen is likely to be a great producer of disaster fixes and has done a fine job to handle action scenes in 'Turing Information', but he can not bring any human depth to his characters. If the characters are not trustworthy in any danger, they too are flat. <br /> <br /> This script basically tries to copy. So our Pete Boyle Ernest Bergenin has been difficult and objectionable (but he has a flexible heart); Karl Malden Redches the effect of the red button (and is well-suited for measuring). Slim Picnic has relieved comic for Shelley Winners, and so on. <br /> <br /> A brute weapon dealer ready to negotiate a weapon-grade plutonium for us to make the story even more contemporary. A real painful act that abandoned the men who were cruel to the wounded (their pregnant actors probably paid extra because they do not seem to have a line) and shot behind a woman - what cad! In 1972, France's rescue services gave huge thanks to Pozidan's hole hole (and on the other side of Propeller Shafet) so that he could find his product. And when we got the subject, how they got * crates * ... Oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> I paid good money when I got released. The film's current reputation may seem strange, but in reality it has received a number of mixed reviews. Some said it was junk, some said that it was exciting as real. Do not remember, someone can be at the right time.
