I've just caught "Wild Rebels" in one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" archive collections, and this movie was so bad that even the crew of MST3 could not make it entertaining. Some MST3s have "targets" which are so confusing to the idea of ​​movies that they probably can not be good movies (like "green slim") and others whose basic premises can actually become an entertainment movie if their filmmakers have not executed their execution. "Wild Rebels" is a movie whose original foundation DID created a good movie three years ago, when Don Siegel ordered the rebuilding of his "Universities of The Darks". Both films are about a failed racing driver who has been driven by a female lover driving a family car to drive a robbery car - only "the killers" driver John Cassettes, the woman was Angel Dickinson and the criminal mastermind (his final film What kind of turns wildly but successfully cast cast against) Ronald Was Dr. Reagan. Steve Alimo, Bobby Bayers and Willie Pastora are quite curious! But in real sense "Wild Rebels" is a scary film William Gueray's directive (note the final "e" presented on his last screen), which has no sense of motion at all, and everybody needs to dramatize it until it runs at least half of the shot . This is only the sad thing that does not make a ridiculous comment in this movie (in 2009); Steve Alimo's itch and Rod Blagojovich were relatively unexpected!
