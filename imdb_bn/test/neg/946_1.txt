Synopsis: Kids are not accepted at any college. He can create a "college" where he and his friends can use their money to nurture parents. <br /> <br /> A Paean of Ignorance <br /> <br /> If you believe that we are all right, man, then this movie is for you. In addition, you must understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. The kids have all of them - they just need to leave it. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that is born to everyone. <br /> <br /> You have to give someone else to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. As long as you accept the rules that are restricted, up to 300 kids may be together. <br /> <br /> 5. Outgoing lectures are often more believable than ready presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Education Board allows you to open "Charter School" with "Non-Technical Teaching Technology", it is your best interest in their heart. (They are not willing to let the low-working students go, who will finish the fast food by any means.) <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the comedy genres, such as Livestock. It follows closely the pattern. Although what's new here, full attack on higher education, not a parody of bad stuffs. It has lost sympathetic inner insight, a professor who represents the appropriate part of the university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of imbalance will destroy the film in the row behind the blockbuster. It was absolutely the case, I thought that if it took a rebel self-referential group in its entirety - for about a minute. There is no deep meaning in the film, there is no level, no self determination. It seems that they have left some children who did not go to class or came naturally. And what is the natural name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I would say: instead of going to see something with Will Tell, his joke can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
