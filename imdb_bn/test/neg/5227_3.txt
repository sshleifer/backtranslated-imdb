I was a fan of Ed Harris and I really had high expectations about this movie. So good actors as Harris and Von Sedo are always a big advantage for the director but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that the necessary thing was the worst movie in the film of Harris and it involved a huge mistake. However, I saw many bad movies in my life but the acting subjects were frustrating because of the overwhelming talent. The story as an overall seems too incredible and fake. If I do not know because of the book, 'Because I did not read it. But if the script is so bad I can not see the reason for the filming. Perhaps it was the commercial success of the King's books, or the need for low quality films for VHS era in the 90's. Whatever the reason, there was a very bad choice for anyone involved in this movie.
