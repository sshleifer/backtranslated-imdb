It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... a new seagull movie. Seagal has been playing the terrible film role after a really terrible film. Every time every movie is getting bad and bad, he's really amazing! I do not really know what to say about TYD, firstly it is a piece, the story does not give any idea, secondly he uses stunt men in all his battle scenes and ultimately many of the footage is not taken from other movies! This guy wonders how the person finds work, he sets up late and goes quickly and because of that, his films are full of plots and stunt men. Why do we buy his movies, why do we hope he might make a great movie?
