Four people (Jacks) go to the restaurant business with the fifth person and lose all the common sense. They allow easy use of clothes rather than clothing workers at the end of their centuries. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Although it is quite stupid, especially once a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is she Guess it. <br /> <br />
