I'm writing this as watching DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDB during the first song. I did not know anything about movies, but a friend said that the show looks good. It's a decent Netflix rating too, so I'm here <br /> <br /> Perhaps working at this level. But I need to say that chorus boys dance and singing seem totally naked. And a prerecorded score adds strangeness to the sinking lips. <br /> <br /> Most songs and routines are about male nudity aspects. This is my idea, sorry. Scores, so far, generic show sound melody music Nothing memorable, or especially the musician. Everything is served on the song. Which, I want to say, like the words they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially an extended joke. If jokes are ten seconds they can work. This unit is not a few minutes long jokes. <br /> <br /> I'm now watching the movie by chapters - for a few minutes until I get the answer. Hopefully one of them will be different, or enough entertainment to hold me from going to the next scene. No, <br /> <br /> All right. I finished So here I think. If you have any experience or longevity of musical theater, avoid it - it's not just quality. However, if you are a gay person and you do not see or hear any musical comedy then you may be entertained. Or if you do not see a lot of interesting nude men, then this might be your interest. <br /> <br />
