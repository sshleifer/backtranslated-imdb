I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such a trick, the whole trash in my life !!! I turned to live in France so that I was on the front line watching this terrible movie. Firstly, it feels cool, kind of chomps like a damned forest about humans. Unfortunately, it has become somewhat unique: A good start with a girl who fills a guy and meets everything she has with her, then the girl hugs her (ridiculous), quietly bits of the room, receives threatening messages in the form of a room , The film begins to slide on slides very quickly with the great disappointment of the process. The film ends with the dedication of druids galore and ancient ugly, stinky animals killing a few people coming back from the past. There were so many questions roaming around my head: Why did they bring back the terrible monster? Does the Druids look like the maniacs wearing bedsheets? Why did they bother to make this movie? The film's "climax" was so stupid that I scoffed all through it: "The terrible" stench warriors fight with two youngsters (who seem to be skilled at Kung Fu Master) and professors, two or something. Am I surprised that the giant war was so slow and irrational, or could it be a war god or something? However, his death movie was a great sight. The contents of this movie are briefly briefly: Kung Fu Mehme + Dryd Stone + mysterious murders "la thriller" + ancient prediction + Shabi Ravens + old ugly Boneless war God + nutrition professor = complete and utter, sick, vain, worm eat, God, O Allah , Satisfied, Falci, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! What I learned from this movie: - Woe to the war-god Kung Fu. - All the youngest Kung Fu specialists studying archeology at the University of France The professors are so resistant that they are being cut in two shirt-mass-whammykalit without any injury.
