I was at WrestleMania VI in the 10-year-old Toronto, and the only thing I saw was that it was quite different from what I saw in the WrestleMania collection DVD. I do not understand how old music has no right, because most of them were created by WWF, they should not be worried about licensing and royalty fees which prevent it from appearing like SNL. Season set release. Knowing about it is quite stupid, but for me a WrestleMania demolition out of their theme music is a memory that I forgot, and this DVD was not present at. What are the rights of these huge library rights to videos even if they are able to edit them so much to use them?
