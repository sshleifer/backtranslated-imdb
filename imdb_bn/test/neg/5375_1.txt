I have to agree with two other comments. I have been hyping this great new show at A & E to wait a month. What a disappointment !!! Quite a lot about the show Ryan Buell. Her voice-over campy is not strange. The sound as if he is talking in a can. Like the second episode, it's about 30 minutes or more (if you accept ads) it's being followed or followed, which he does not know. He can not say the name, any time the name will be published, they will write in a piece of paper and hand over to someone else. Especially informative or entertaining or not reliable for our rest. Why can not she say the name ... I think it will give more power to the monsters. Funny, I always thought Scratch wanted to hide their true identity. If you know the exact name of the giant, it does not make it easy for them to find out. Now the next episode, which in a short time "exorcism" head in the air. So what rayan already needs an exorcism? It does not happen, but this show has not provided any evidence or anything else so far. I can tell Ryan that if I was a small child, if I was an old man, and someone gave me a holy bottle of water to remove something terrible, I would like to see elsewhere for help !!! Also, if you do not use holy water and blessings, etc., are you going crazy in the right direction? I'll probably look tonight, but if these episodes are ridiculous, it's probably time to end!
