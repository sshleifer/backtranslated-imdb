Without John Rhys-Davies, I must admit that it will not even register in my film meter. But despite the single incident, it is not a bad little thrill considering low budget, low quality impact, rigorous acting and scientific channel channels. The effects of blood are very convincing, and the whimsy looks really realistic ... Do you think that the people who think that such people are like that <br /> <br /> From a positive side, it's like a comforter: The Night Stalker (Daren McGuin, remember?) fulfills the love boat, but despite the final cheese of this work, it still holds something like a plot and actually Your eyes trying to achieve your respect during laughing and rolling <br /> <br /> <br /> As the conflict between this work, I still managed to find some enjoyment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />.
