I do not want to see it if something is worse than this movie. I remember a lot of amazing things - a little boy is dropped from a coffin to make a rafts; The little blonde boy adored himself as a god; Lots of Peru Stock Footage as an Ideal Vacation Spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimari A vacation in Peru should blast away any idea of ​​heaven. The whole thing is so awful that an aesthetic behavior compared to plan 9 or even robot monster. This image should be bombed and should be bombed again.
