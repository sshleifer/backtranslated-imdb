This "remake" is a totally disrespectful: so medium, cheap and outstanding, it is not worth more than the wicked wicked line. <br /> <br /> This is a fraudulent script, such as serving by a story and playing amateur "acting", you are always aware of a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, a suspension which lets you enter the story . <br /> <br /> The smallest space and cells of the original Japanese masterpiece (Ju-1 and 2) are all lost here and lost in the set and space of the guest here. <br /> <br /> One of the worst, moral enormity and helplessness, which turns into a cruelly condemned ghost of both the original mother and child victims, is a brutal argument, completely stupid and hollow Buggy-Man scares are completely destroyed by scares. <br /> <br /> If the American audience is not willing to read the subtitles and gets up on the minimum common words, instead of such patronage likes to swallow hogwash, they deserve this kind of curse: The movie itself.
