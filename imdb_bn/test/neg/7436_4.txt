The problem with riding this movie is that it probably can not be used by Bill Murray, only for his colleagues the best variations <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actor, it could work. Even if they tried to get elephants across both countries, at least they would allow them to share some interesting conversations. As it stands, Murray goes on talking to an elephant, who can not answer with ironic taunts. Basically, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this film can make it more annoying, than it was more annoying to have another character close to him. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy the film elephants, but anyone who wants to see the delivery of Bill Murray's bite and enjoy a nice script, you need to look somewhere else.
