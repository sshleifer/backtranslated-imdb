Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate it, but after that it's better than others, they get worse. I hope Gibson's next one is smart. Many, including humor, that is, toilets, kids etc. How far we can see their relationship Drugs, why bad guys in South Africa! I believe that incredible, perhaps South American, some countries can make the script better in the Golden Triangle. It seems that early in the '80s, the hard-working, die-hard, sturdy docks in the early 90s were playing on the last land in the Ice Land Land Gary, etc. With the same story this one has to go on top. The attack on the police, the scenes of the beach beach condos, and at the end, was the way too much on top Gibson's girlfriend killed by copper attacks. Like many parts 2, they get worse, and this series comes at a speed of 3 or 4 speeds. 3/10
