If you find frustrating the ability of amateur acting, unintended stories, fake blood and all stupid shooting, you really have a good time watching this trashy, low rental exploitation film. Although you might want to check out a pretty good catfighting sequence suggested, the rest of the rest of the movie is not good enough for the movie. (**)
