OK, so this film is well played. It has good aspects, but the general fact is that in these years, what are gay and homosexual people fighting? Straight men "decide to be gay" and gay men "decide to be straight" I enjoyed it for the last 20 minutes, then I was really annoyed. Generally, actors play main parts of what happens in this movie, and gay gay actors play a direct role in the role. Directly managed by men but it does not confuse you that it is a movie that makes you feel inappropriate. Do not expect all the romance and relationships you do. If you are not a priest, then God will bless us with a straightforward male healing woman.
