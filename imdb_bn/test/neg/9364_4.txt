Today film's film The Legend of the Serum Fores, and during the 87-minute running time, it quickly swirled into my top five most difficult movies. It's hard to see; You are seeing something entirely alien that the film is so different for everything else. There is a brief summary: A group of Georgia is trying to build a fort to protect themselves from attackers, but every time they are going to end, it does not fall for any available available. So they go and see a lucky teller who advises them that if they want to get the castle to stay permanently, then they will have to find a young man, while building a tall blonde blue eye boy, he will be buried in one of the walls and his appearance is smoothly constructed. Ensure that it will be done. And at that moment, they are quite sure, he is pleased to be impressive in cement and eggs, like his living graveyard, he apologizes to his mother. <br /> <br /> It's actually a fairly simple story. But in 1984, Sergei Paranjovov, director of working in Soviet Georgia, did not take much time after filling the life sentence for fifteen years, we do not follow the rules of any film making. There are very few close-ups Very often we need to follow the actions hidden in the corner of the bottom left hand corner of a landscape, extra is usually easy to miss. There is very little close up and sometimes it is difficult to say whom cars are working and why. Each and then the movie suddenly turns off, which does not get relevance to the original plot and usually works to confuse the viewer. The music is completely crazy, with the sounds available, screen equipment and church organisms are seemingly dropped at random. At times when something does not seem to happen, someone breaks into a volcano, almost visible time comes along with the next scene. But soon there is a clear cinematic voice behind it so that you try to understand and understand its message. When you see that you can not believe it's one of the time your eyes get glued on the screen.
