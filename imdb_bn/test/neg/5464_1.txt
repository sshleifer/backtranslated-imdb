Well, it certainly made me wonder - I can not believe that some have made an Australian film that is even more annoying than Somerset. The story is unlikely, unlike the characters except Freel's and Melman's characters, the characters have a VAST array of facial expressions: a happy and happy, and "sex scene" that can be too much face-to-face and annoying lover, having low-budget porn flickr at home. <br /> <br /> This movie is seen in a 30-year-old movie that was on my side. Seat .... to rise and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is promotional posters.
