Twenty years after the release, I did not see this picture for the first time, I did not get it completely. Why is this so huge hit in 1986? Her amateurishness drips from every scene. Junk hair and predictable. Sex scenes are exploitative and at the top (that does not seem to be Miss Rudnik's beautiful boobs!). The singer is "schrecklich". Gangsters die in breaks, only the real funny scene is the big shoot, it's a feature that fits the film firmly in the middle of mobile phones. In 1986 (and apparently still reading my colleague's IMDb's comments), I was not able to understand what inspired the excitement of this exciting audience, how vague I am.
