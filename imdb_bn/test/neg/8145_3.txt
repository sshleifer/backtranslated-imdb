After two years of this brief, the last "Our gang" was summarized. After seeing this, you wonder how it is that even long. After transferring from Hell Roach to MGM, the quality of "our gang" becomes nosyued, and this brief is a perfect example. Gags are all very weird and the happiest days of his life, Frogie's last line can make your mind feel bad for the rest of the time. Making a film is a very poor example.
