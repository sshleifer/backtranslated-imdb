iCarly that's all wrong in the world All major characters but Carlie's brother and Freddy Morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam voluntarily damages other people. He broke a child's locker and was forced to pay 100 dollars to fix it, and he went on to say what was "unfortunate" and Freddie's cellphone. He damaged at least 300 dollars and he paid more attention to some food. What a bad situation ?. He was the only time Freda's fun to mourn when he felt every crime. And Carlisle just came out of her because of Carly. <br /> <br /> Carlie Hall is "I'm perfect, whatever I do is wonderful." Girl type What he does is for his own benefit and often he is pardoned for himself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's shit. Something like Fred Fred? He laughs. Sam destroys a kids grade? He shrugs off it <br /> <br /> Do not even start on me humor Sunny tracks played every moment. <br /> <br /> Sam: He is not hot: Yes he is yes, you are ok * Thousands of humor * <br /> <br /> Humor lowers others and uses vague talk and occasionally using the same words It disturbs almost trivial things. <br /> <br /> All the 'Super Shooter Special Technology Effects' do not have to be mentioned, they can do in Windows Movie Maker.
