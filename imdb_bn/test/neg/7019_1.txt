At the beginning, I really love Lucy. Her TV show still makes me laugh. With Chaplin and Keaton he was one of the greatest comedians of all time. However, his performance in this movie is frustrating. He was very old, and the lens gauge filters thought him as a mist fox in London. He could not sing, and his voice was so painful that he started crying through every song. Her dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a Lucy fan, this is not shiny on the wrong, sad performance and sing it praises. I like to make a charity screen in the terrible world of Lucy with her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and "Maem".
