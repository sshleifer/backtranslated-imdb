Last night I got to see Prozac nation's initial preview screener. Because I love Kristina Ricchi, I was very excited at first, but because of the continuation of the film, I began to wonder where it is going. Based on the real story, it can only tell you from the headline of Christina's rickshaw and her struggles with depression, drugs, friends and family. In my opinion this movie was moved very quickly, and it was very dramatic. I used to say that there was a dramatic moment in every five minutes, and the film quickly passed through her life and there was no room left for us to connect with the character of Christina Rixie. Kristina Ricci's performance was always fantastic, but Jessica Lange stood across the whole film, and I believe the success of this film will be for her and Cristina Rixie. I'll rate 4 out of 10 and I'll rent it to you or ask Elizabeth Wertzell's books to read them and they're good enough to check out.
