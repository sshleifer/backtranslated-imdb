I read recent comments and could not wait to see the movie. However, even after sitting under the preliminary "dream" of 80 minutes, I did not make a jump and unreal villain, I was very disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only movie that was still 80 minutes long. I could be the reason to edit it for 'R' rating, but the original was more than ten minutes of the type of "kill bill" type. Reality loses appeal when blood is spread like Hajj. The killer who is supposed to be a "ghost", can tear off someone's head with Job (Ala King Kong with T-Rex), live with everything, and end up with Soprans Finlay, and you're probably the most popular movie of last year. . After watching the film, I felt that I saw countless movies with the same plot and method and felt mostly unhappy. Everyone saw what I saw it, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, watch Halloween, it's certainly $ 10 worth. When the hatch comes, let's hope the next book is based on the chest.
