Completely brain dead workers made in the Philippines. It is the mode of Filipino movies that tries to pass itself as an American film in the international market. Rather than a slow start, takes the movie and never gets frustrated again. It was actually a disguise of the worst movies of Chocolate Norris: An American prisoner in Vietnam who suffered brain damage by the Soviets, who intercepted a microchip in his brain, so he programmed to kill the United States President Pope. His old friends (played by B-movie Stalwate Max Thayer) were sent to stop him. The strange ridiculous action scene, made of cruel acting (a sure view of performance as the Soviet commander of evil Nicholson's!) And the incredible plot is given for the photo of the most impressive action given in the general public.
