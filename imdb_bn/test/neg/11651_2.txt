This movie was in vain. I can not even call it science fiction, since it needs more space than just a place. The "highest question" is not even set in place for the whole movie. The story / plot is a pair, nothing to write about cast, though it will be weird with the leading movie in the middle film ... In addition, it is not particularly exciting or relevant. At least it is consistently consistent with low quality standards, nothing or nothing is standing in it. Everything is equally soft. I usually find some values ​​in "Space Fills", even if it is limited to semi-budget pain on low-budget pain, only 90 minutes, but the "maximum question" did not give me the satisfaction also. All in all, a complete waste of time.
