It seems like the previous critics have seen that the other movie than what I saw tonight ... In fact, the reason I was registered on IMDb is that of the film. Sure Bobby Phillips can "fight" and for this, I can give this movie 2, but the rest of the film is pure crap ... acting bad, plot bad, camera angle bad, and the effects are bad. Make sure the physical shape of the actors, but they can not work! Sometimes I enjoy watching bad movies for laughter, but the film did not have any attraction and after seeing this movie I apologized to see it. Of course, if you want to see a medieval war without anything else, this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this film! PS: Sorry for any spelling mistakes ... I'm tired of this movie!
