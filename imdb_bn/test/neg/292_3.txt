Repetition: Salmon leads a small group of special agents who specially find and return the missing people against all possible hindrances. Their last mission is about their grandfather a granddaughter. It seems that he has been caught on the web of the cruel criminals and the absence of all those who are searching for it has gone. But librarians now manage this case. <br /> <br />: It is pure and b-action through and through. The original phrase for this is unlimited supply. Ammunition has an unlimited supply, they do not have to reload once. Bad guys have an unlimited supply, so there are some shoots in the heroes. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them try to confuse useless (and always fail) plots. And there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (it's like Erica Elenac's performance, what about it?), And the actors do not seem to care more than the picchor (and why they seem to not feel like anyone else?) <br /> <br /> And most of the B-action movies have unlimited guns. But this seems almost a ridiculously bad kind of almost. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kid. <br /> <br /> But again, I do not expect much, how can I get an action movie called Librarian? And it is actually distributed about what can be expected. More than 90 minutes or less bad steps with some views to connect points. But I am not uncertain if I can say it amusement, it did not keep my interest very long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
