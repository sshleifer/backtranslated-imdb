This scary movie begins to ample amounts and a moment I myself thought "this is going to be really good". However, it gets rather annoying rather quickly. Acting is fairly good, the position and the story are rather well-started. The problem is, kill enough on the screen and you end up having a monster where basically tail and moving. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I was thinking that the movie is going up and going to be the winner. Unfortunately, the film has rarely shown the giant and lies behind the DVD because it tells me that the desert was literally alive below the people and was able to eat their meat ... Now it was some of the movies, which were almost unexpectedly the situation. Can make unauthorized visitors unhappy and it can raise tensions, but those horror movies should be done! Instead we have very few shots of animals or animals, and when we see it, it is basically defensive. Still it was not bad at all, it just needs to be more dangerous less hunting and more chomping.
