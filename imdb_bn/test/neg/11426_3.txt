Because I have never seen this movie at all. Although this film is not some fun, but it's the most fun moment, but I do not understand more than 15% of people (the third English fiction includes the English couple) that what people are saying. Three short stories, not really, but only in the most unfortunate and useless people could have imagined and used to mean abusive language. It's not funny, it does not find fun, it found no sense. 4/10
