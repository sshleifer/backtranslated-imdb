The summary of this movie convinces me that it is the story of an extraordinary woman who challenges her by challenging the conference of the society. I like powerful female characters and expect a movie along the lines of "Chocolat" with a less eloquent story and more bite. What I got was a throw of frustration characters. <br /> <br /> To be effective for a character driven movie, I have to feel a connection or sympathy for the people. There was no one that I could add to the movie. Grazia (Galino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") is mentally ill, perhaps hesitant, which is often rude, offensive and violent. Her husband beat and yells, when she is not hurt or slapping someone. The children are asleep brats. They shout each other in the movie and the woman. They attack other children with no concern. Violence begets fierce. It seems that it is an island of helpless, aggressive, violent and rude people. Meanwhile, there is no island. <br /> <br /> The direction is not mandatory. There are introspective scenes to try to be industrial, but instead the viewer's birth. The location is fantastic, but the degree that can be caught in the film also fails. <br /> <br /> I suggest you stay away from this film's failure.
