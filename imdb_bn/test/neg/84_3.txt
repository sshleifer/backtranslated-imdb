Seeing the title of this movie "Stupid Tiners Mite Di" believed me that it was a fool of some kind. I later discovered the original title "Blood and Gotts". Both titles are confusing though. It's a fool, not a serious splatter movie. This fails in both cases, something in between. A group of teenage-teenagers attend a SÃ©ance at a wonderful house and then begins to murder. The sound over known, it's not. Well, these movies do not add to the constant stream of similar movies. And it is made badly. Due to the lack of light, the whole film is rustic. Now this effect can be very effective, but it is not in this case. Young actors are not acting very badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. Actors are clearly waiting for instructions in many scenes, but these are too late. This could be the editor's mistake. Characters are irrational and story lines are just stinks. The term is sometimes terrible: the conversations are unknown, but when the loud or the actors scream loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie ever, but it's still the worst one. For me a 10 out of 3.
