I think I saw a very revised version because it was not as much graphic as I had - based on the other reviews I have heard. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. The main character is a sexually independent soul, and 3. Being placed in the external locale of Asia, "Laure" There are the same flash as the predecessor. <<br /> <br /> I found this photo path very gorgeous with philosophical things that I am not really interested in, such as frenzy between Lor and Nick, open relationship, "I'm glad to bring her joy" ... something along that line . I can not relate to this mentality and movies / characters really do not light any light. <br /> <br /> The second half in search of dead tribes seemed as if it was a completely different movie. One that I did not care about. At that time, I just hope that it will turn into an obscene so that at least it can maintain my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I did not get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll have to leave at that.
