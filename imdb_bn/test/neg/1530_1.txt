For the first time, I'm out of the kit with most views. Oz is a terrific, scary, voyeuristic series. Manufacturers have their cake and eat it. Oz, MC, etc. are used as ultra-crude signals, in which the full visual imagery can be imagined. It allows viewers to show intellectual excuses, so that the soap optical nongres are torched with bad things with humans. <br /> <br /> Remember, when you watch a episode, remember that when a disturbing, violent, silly, deceitful, illogical, ill-fictitious play is published before your approved eyes, hundreds of bad kids in the world's poorer areas die due to food or water. Goes. <br /> <br /> The exploitative drama at Oz worst times. It appeals to the greatest innocence but says it is serious and meaningful. It became hot and cold and changed from a fortnightimo to pianissimo more often a Mahler Symphony. <br /> <br /> The dialog is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian. Freedom with the reality is stupid. Here's the painful ownership of a nightclub, which Ozz has reached in its Fifteen finisher, with a laughable cloud contact lens in one eye, releasing any drug-free stays. Here there is a fierce quarrel about the temperature of the earth, begging to kill, but it is certainly rejected by that barbarity and he is spending a little bit on cutting the impossible throat. <br /> <br /> Visible, slowly showing up at the speed of seeing the viewer, think about what happened instead of just the trash shown. Do not worry, treason, a murder, a sexual scene will be in one minute. Finally, the oz obviously provoked. You do not have to feel embarrassed about carrying through its flow. You can see it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything to a huge surprise (or the same word but for voice change). <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a stranger and excuse yourself based on the skill of the production team, post-modernization, etc. When they blame for high quality aircraft, they appeal to the lowest general index. <br /> <br /> Really, a disgusting series. And shows it every hour, rewarding its producer and actress and creating ad revenue for the channels that show some people who do not do anything better than looking ugly and unnecessary, hundreds of children die, which can be saved by life. Spend by dollars this terrible, successful, widely acclaimed series.
