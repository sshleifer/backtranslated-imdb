This horror created for TV did not end with it. This made a regular weekly series which was even worse than the pilot / movie. Often, most of the movies in various professions have some kind of realism and they certainly make it exciting. This was not anyone. It is successful if you want to "drive". It resurfaced over the cable several years ago and has failed again. Richard Jacques was not the only release part of all these films who performed as Chief Chief. Cameron's 60's Batman is more than a series.
