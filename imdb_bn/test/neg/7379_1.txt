Anthony Bourdain said, "I wanted to keep my head locked in the sand, dragged my eyes and jumped from a mountain." This man's effort shortened my feelings about this rogue waste. Futile, self-motivated, worried, and just bad. Bad out of understanding What else can I say? If you are unfortunate in some area where this part of the stupid trash is playing, please please be kind to the soul and avoid all the costs.
