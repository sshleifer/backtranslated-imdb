*** Spokela *** *** Spokilar *** <br /> <br /> I saw this screen screening yesterday. I already started choosing Team Robins and loving science fai. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, cinematography was interesting, although the future filmmaker's perspective was realistic but still interesting. I think in my mind: "This is a very intelligent scientist film that I have seen for a while". Then they could not just keep together. <br /> <br /> Although initially there were many "rough around the edge" problem (i.e. edit, and later some writing / plot development), this issue was forgiving. After losing all the speeds around the halfway path of the movie, they fail, and then the film gets tired when you realize that it is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robins could not breathe the life of his character, but he could do whatever he could. Her female opponent (her name now escapes from me) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for movie sculpture seems to be that filmmakers can not determine whether a scientist is. -Free movie or a future love story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The future was realistic but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I like interaction with other minor characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some text was interesting (early). <br /> <br /> She does not remember Maria Gonzalez (name?), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** The following speaker *** <br /> <br /> Some questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I think many future things in this movie are convenient to patchwork stories Was there. Such as viruses Obviously, the virus that they gave at the end of this film became physically 'scared', so that they could intercept other sex scenes, and then they could report it uncontrollably for code 46. Then they take him away and remove his memory and finish the movie. If you asked me to finish the classic 'dream sequence' out of the copper <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, are they a clone of his mother, many innumerable exploration around the girls? That may be some interesting stories to be made. <br /> <br /> First I like greetings to everyone in the world. But especially because their accents were not convincing, it became violent. I found it, will undoubtedly be more ethnic and culturally exposed in the future, but by this it started to feel like an AT & T global networking business. <br /> <br /> How could they achieve if they were 'outside'? Busted for code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' is not well defined. Sometimes it takes as trivial as the visa, and the other time it was vital as life or death. Again, loose definitions allow it to be used to combine different parts of a plot. <br /> <br /> Well, I started to be negative about it, so I stopped. There were some great scenes and interesting things about this movie, but it only gives it 4/10
