I do not usually write reviews, actually, I do not write reviews. This movie was so violent that it actually inspired me to inspire me. Try to be a light heart and cheeky teenager comedy related to the natural touches of virtual sex; Virginity, boys etc. In addition to the main character, he apparently turned his perfect son into a technology fair that he made with the machine. <br /> <br /> What looks beautiful? Well, that's not it. Acting is the most half-hearted and I've never seen it scary. Unfortunately, they seem to be a true supporter of the script and the film, which probably explains that I have never seen any memorable production in them. I do not bother to name the actor, nor to learn their character. Lady lady does not cheat or kiss you, and in this way you do not care for her. Even though the script is crying for you for the sake of recording, the male friend of his top female does not express any sympathy. The only emergence he will get from you is extreme anger and sudden violence. Only half of the actors were female lead actors, who, despite his weak role, really did what it did, which was not much in the light of such terrible work. I will not even talk about the hatred of 'bad boys' of that plot. But then again, no plots? <br /> <br /> I unbelievably expressed this picture, because I can not understand the stupid curiosity of writing so many scripts, without producing, working and directing. I can only wonder. Within a half hour of the film, my colleagues and I were surprised to see such a wonderful example of film, that it ignored the gathering of us, the logic, the class and even the oppressed story. I have no idea why people want to infringe film industry by publishing it to the public. This is a movie trick and the best left to collect dust in the warehouse forever. 1/2 of 10
