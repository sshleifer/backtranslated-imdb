This is really awful, the most extreme effort of a comic adaptation of the movie. The worst thing that could be about this movie is, about every possible thing. Music, acting, lighting, set, "special" impact ... The only positive things I can find are that Sue looks beautiful in her blue tights and thing make-up is almost passable (only face). That's it. Zip Do not disturb the bootleg copy tracking; It really is not worth your time. Even the "Captain America" ​​film, which was canceled in the early 90s, is less exciting than riding on your seat, when you try to bear this mess.
