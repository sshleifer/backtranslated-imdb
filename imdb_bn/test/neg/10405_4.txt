This is another variation in the story of sharing the fate of two children and their children. SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by and is seen by Hoyd Morris (from television), because it's a story that is padded out for the length of the comedy movie in a half-hour situation - but with a lack of laughter, or it's different from each other. Different different restrictions <br/> <br /> Doris Day has decided to call for the postponement - and why it's rather easy to see. Even Cast does not help to attend some fairly reliable actors. Brian Keith, Barbara Herschel, Pat Carroll and Alice Gahstley do their best, but the script is really a problem and should be obsolete for the big screen. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be said about it. Leave it and Miss Day shows any number in its more appropriate movie.
