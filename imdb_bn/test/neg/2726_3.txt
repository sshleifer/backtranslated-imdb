"The Venditor" is a weird little Canadian B-movie. At first glance, it seems to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator" counterfeit, but weirdly it will share some attributes with the original "Robocop", which was not released even after the "Vindicator" appeared. 1986). Coincidence? Who knows? However, the story is this: Scientists Karl Lehmann is a beautiful person who seems to be working for a super-duper secret government hi-tech research laboratory, why he is reporting a lazy master named Hayet, whom he initially wore project fund. Movie Karl had a loving wife in the house and a child on the road, when he suddenly died in a "lab accident" when it made all the more sad. But wait! Carl is really dead after all! Kennett has expelled Carl's brain and entered his pet project, some types of experimental biological space suites. When Carl got up inside his new body, he realized that a little brown, trash in the lab and fled. This is a problem because the mechanical case has been programmed with the "angry response" program for the reason (only for the reasons for itself), Karl could kill anyone of someone else by touching him. In HeideSite, a little addition to Carl's mentality was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Rob-Carl walks through the movie for a while, some random hood muggers and other mixed background characters, until he is killed, he returns to his home and communicates with his wife (this scene is thought to be heart-touching , I guess, but it becomes ridiculous because Carl's robot voice is so heavily synthetized that you understand the word that you understand ). He must have told him to come out of the city and did not return after being in trouble, but he wants to stay and help him, Jadad Jadd Yaad Finally, Commando, led by Hunter, under the leadership of a clear ninja assassin, is employed by a gang of Thugs, using Karl's wife as a bate and enslaved (but laughingly looking cheap) Moeem ensues. <br /> <br / > I'm a B-movie man, but "The Venditor" was so much a donkey that it quickly turned into a high comedy. I think that a good Han Stan Vinston rob-curl suite went into design, because it looks pretty good, but the rest of the film is inexpensive, suffering from the kind of appearance made for the TV. The script can work a lot, but still the filmmakers were going to produce "Robocop" air and ran to find "Vindicator" so that they could not be charged with the execution of their execution. Judging by other comments on IMDB, I have only seen parallelism between "Vindictor" and "Robocop" and obviously "Rob" is a superior film, so you do not have to waste time. If you want to see a movie, you can sit through this piece of vague, which can be best described, is best created by the 8th grade of "Robocop".
