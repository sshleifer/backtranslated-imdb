Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon started in Switzerland because the world's leading detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) managed the Nazis, and managed to steal a bright scientist from outside the country and friends Tobey (William Post Junior) in London. But London is as safe, Holly? Dr. Tobey has created a revolutionary new bomb scene that will forever replace the bomb blast and he has agreed to give it to the British government, but those who are worse than them, and plans to steal Homer's famous foe Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atoll), the bomb scene is hidden and Nazi sells. Scotland Yard's Bamling Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoye), Dr. Tobel's love interest is Charlotte Eberly (Karen Verne), murderers, mysterious scientist and an annoying coded message and homosexuals. His work is done to keep Tobel alive so that he can show off his bombs. <br /> <br /> In the series of Fourth Holes in a series of fourteen Hollywood movies directed by Sheryl Holmes and Secret Weapon, Rothbone and Bruce Hall are portrayed as Moss and Watson. Did it. . Edward T. Lowe junior script, Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartman Sir Arthur is based on Conan Doyle's short 'The Dancing Men' and it is not a tradition of killing victims because it's a war-related adventure story. Neglecting everything from Homes, Critical Offenses and Mystery Solutions As much as I am concerned and so far I'm concerned and involved in Nazi and the place of war as a retreat of the story, weird and did not sit well with me. The dialogue is not uncommon, Professor Moriarty thinks that if they could not come with a villain for it and it was completely more compelling than the others in the series, then it seemed. However, at least it's short. <br /> <br /> The Director Neal does his usual work but you have to reduce it and remember that it was made 60 years ago. It does not have any real style or imagination, and both lack the atmosphere and conspiracies. <br /> <br /> Technically, if there is a fine, black and white cinematography fine, I understand that a computer color version is also available. Actually, Bruce and White consider their normal comic relief turn and Rothbon's hairstyle ridiculous and I'm glad he changed it for the next purchase. <br /> <br /> When Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Arms were a disappointment, when compared with other nice entries in the series, I can rarely recommend it and all the other well-made things seem to be missing here. Finally, leave it and see something better, only for hard fans.
