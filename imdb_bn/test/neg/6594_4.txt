Where did the script writer find VV1 for this movie ??? High School Outside? This movie tries so much to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but instead, he turns him into a terrible, durable career. Filling all the line clich√©s but the amazing acting was not bad. As usual, it's a bad movie with pretty good actors. Michael Jackson, Jizz, actor, I'm sorry for him! I think he could do well with weak scripts. I did not think that Flex could not look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did everything he could, but later when he made all his white clothes, hey, he was lucky! Other actors starring Debbie Row, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were quite good. In addition to Leicester's acting actress, she was very young and healthy while playing lease. The actress did not see anything like her while playing Diana Ross and I could not determine who was the woman until this film was too long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Against Michael Jackson, or Michael Jackson. It's not something to change someone's opinion. In fact, after watching this film anyone will get the only opinion, O God, this movie really sucks! And where are Michael Jackson's wonderful songs and songs? There is no one found in this movie. I love the soundtrack of this movie anyway and if I could, I would probably buy it. <br /> <br /> Although it's a very interesting, campi movie in Lighter Park! If you want to see some light that does not cause much trouble to your brain, it's a great time to waste. I would probably see it again, because it's just so bad entertainment!
