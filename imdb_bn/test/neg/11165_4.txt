Recently I found this movie in one of my husband's VHS tapes (after which it is used to record stuff from Telelie). It looks like the film has ended in eighty and I do not think so. It has not been released to me (DVD or VHS) although I will browse for a copy. <br /> <br /> This picture tells the stories of three young people: two daughters, one adolescence and many other small, and a younger boy who went to live with their mother's brother and his young, silent Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers living with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant regulatory dog, who forces his young girl to wear a silver collar, when he and his brothers watch a heroine show in his toy industry. <br /> <br /> Irishmen (small) develop a love for each other while they live in the same house. The girl helps her uncle get out of the store when her brother helps her uncle create things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> The image contains many troubles. During the dance of dance, dinner and some forbidden love, his wife was treated as unclear (literally) possession of the uncle (pictured by the collar). Interestingly, though, I saw more clear themes in other Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> You are surprised that the British film industry and the BBC are not launching any kind of secret agenda. However, despite not being a child movie, there are lots of curiosity, magic moments, and an Irishman did some nice paintings.
