Wow, this is a big time for Christian Christian bias! This is based on a Stephen King novel and he wrote such prejudice and then Hollywood has even rushed even more. In this film we work as a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest, both stupid and at the same time see to be unclean. Of course, the devil has captured the city, so perhaps his influence is in this son, but they are the general picture of Hollywood. They never show a minister who works like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest and works. And - another "paid" - they make the character of Satan the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max Van Sado played the Devil and made him the favorite guy. Wickedly, Von Sido played a number of roles after portraying Jesus as the 1964 film "The Greatest Story Ever Tolled". You think why the actor has become so bad? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie does not make it fun to watch the other mid-characters. <br /> <br /> From what I have heard, the King Book is even darker and more sick than the hated film. But well built. Really, who care. Kings and Hollywood deserve each other.
