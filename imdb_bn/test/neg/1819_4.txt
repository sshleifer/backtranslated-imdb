This film can be frustrating, like cerebral and intense movies that have been successfully successful in its success, but not so. It is best confusing and irrational. When twists and turns finally reveal itself, "Ah, I get it!" I muttered something along the line "OK ... whatever ..." In my opinion, when a movie releases a main plot, it does not have to apply a flashback sequence, it gives some guidance to prove that the viewer will be able to understand the truth. But this movie has a flashback; And kicker here: it flashes back to the scene that the movie was not even there! <br /> <br /> The letters were stereotypical, unsympathetic, and completely ridiculous. I think romantic Lead's "steamy" love scenes were the most unwelcome and stubborn that I saw in a film that was not obscene. It seems that the director was frustrating and weird with the loving scene, but they were really simply stupid. <br /> <br /> And do not even let me start in Crawfry Accents and second-rate sets. I think the movie was set in New Orleans, but the accompanying pronunciation and couple Blend city shots can also be from this film in any United States. <br /> <br /> I recommend: do not disturb!
