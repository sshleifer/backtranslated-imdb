I check out this free at the library, and I still ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock really is in it, but only five minutes are seen in five scenes, and even painful to see it. The rest of the film is so bad that you will spend most of the time hoping to finish as soon as possible, but if you are one of those people who have to finish the film once they start. Everyone else will just stop it. Do not worry, you will not miss anything. Bullock lines (looks like you were deceived by seeing this scene because in this case their name is plastered) Like the conversation, the lines of other characters are truncated: <br /> Lisa (Bulac) - "Danny, please say <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Do not you know Bhadde?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I know No - this is something to do with my dad. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" What does your father mean? "<br /> <br /> Not - "I do not know - the **** up or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry, Lisa. I do not know. "<br /> (Dr.) <br /> (After some time) Danny -" My father is some military friend. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> What do I mean? <br /> <br /> The bottom line - just do not tell.
