Before I saw this picture, I heard some negative comments about it. However, when I saw that I found myself "OK, it's a little slow but it's pretty interesting". In the end it was created, it created a complex moral conflict, which still poses a complete convincing decision with the amazing dramatic consequences of the film's context. If it was followed, it was a great end and it would give me a very good impression of the film. However, due to the end, not only emotions, but the unnecessary happy-ending ends without real real credibility, but in the context of the film, you do not see any character clearly that one of the characters can finish his work which will end his life. May be, but not unreasonably. Incidentally, tell me here if I missed something here and why she lived so I could have survived because she was justified and it broke the whole film for me. <br /> <br /> The transition of Kevin McKidd's characters is going a little bit up to the end and it creates a very strong moral triangle. <br /> <br /> This is recommended if you prepare yourself this image. Walking out while mom and sister lying on the bed. But do not look even further until you have only one pinch, but many mountains, salt.
