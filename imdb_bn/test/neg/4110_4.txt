(Synopsis) In the year 2055, in the rich time back to travel and hunting a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McComback) has created a machine that can take people over time. Charles Haton (Ben Kingsley) took this technology and opened a business identity as Time Safari. With the money anyone can travel for billions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Rair (Edward Barnes) is a team where he takes the big game hunter together in a spotty watchwatch that could kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay at the waqwaite and will not disturb the ground or some animals around them. Unfortunately for the human race, a hunter's step and a butterfly killed. This small task has a great impact on the climate of the world and creates new species of animals. Evolution Of course we know that it is now changing by time wave. Trevis and Sonia try to stop the dynamical process before it becomes permanent and people become extinct. <br /> <br /> (comment) The movie is a little slow and the idea of ​​going back with time and making some changes was a little bit. The death of single butterflies is simply ridiculous due to the change in the atmosphere and the evolution of the Earth. They change the appearance of Chicago's Galaxy, but looking for the futile new cars in the future. You can wait to see this DVD in this imagination. (Warner Bros.
