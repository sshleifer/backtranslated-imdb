Oh, I laughed .... It's all ... an Asian / White family, an inactive Asian boy ... The healthiest person in the BBC will see everything. <br /> <br /> What to say Tribe: There was a slight insult in my eyes, which this screen was for one episode and only for one episode. <br /> <br /> When you've taken the BBC for more than a few years (Fawli for example Towers) and then it's rolling ... it's a disgusting disagreement. <br /> <br /> It is based on all political-correctness and without any humor. <br /> <br /> From the heart of hell directly: But what would you expect from the ultimate left wing BPC ... I mean the BBC.
