Generally, I can not even stop seeing such a trash, but playing a role is a favorite hobby for me, and thus I was the subject of this movie. It was a lot of garbage where I do not know where to start. I would like to sit in the Marathon "Plan 9 Outdoor Space" waiting for another minute to reverse this. At least 9 plan was not an agenda. In fact, the media can represent extremist agendas and how they can overcome the media. This is a horrible time when the whole group is not unreasonably presented with any defense and any real information. I know this commentary went more social, but it was not possible to help, as this movie begged it. Imagine a pro-Nazi film film merit is being strictly reviewed. Does not happen. As it can sit, people who make this film face themselves and probably have to go to the Communist Enclave where the campaign is taken.
