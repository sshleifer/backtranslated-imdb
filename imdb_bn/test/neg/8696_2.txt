For a truly wonderful movie, you can try to see the film about Assisi's St. Francis - good for any audience. The movie I loved most about this movie is Mexico, and it gets the movie up to 2am. I was surprised that these actors were not terrible, they were like desert people, they were like deserters. And Moses has been called a conversation impediment, but certainly not here. Even in the "miracle" scenes emerged and unbelievable. And if you can believe in the story of the TV, then what? I talked about dumbing down, I thought this hallmark movie was kind, and I can see why others hate Hollywood. I just do not have some of this corporate profit grubbers. You will not have any religious religion to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid, you have to be bored, nothing will be done, silly and religious. And for a real movie experience, try "short cut in silence", this is a highly rated movie.
