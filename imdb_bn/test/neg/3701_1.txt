I know many people like this event and I apologize to this show that it is wonderful but this is the worst show ever made. Of course I'm sure I can be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson does it. I mean checking the cars and doing something that is so awesome that the car can beat the plane! But Jeremy Clarkson is just sad. Here are the reasons to hate this man:. He thinks it's cool to run motion cameras, which measures your distance and time, driving 200 mph down the road and measuring your average speed with two hours of rest. . He definitely thinks he is better than Richard Hammond and James Girl. . He got my best friend kindly. . She just screams at the kids for a photo. I'm sorry the top gear but Jeremy Clarkson is a scary one.
