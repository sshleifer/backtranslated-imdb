Stage star Grace Hayes this unclear little film star. A few years after the stage, she is going to a small college town to see her raised child. The child does not know his mother and when he shows him in the local malt shop, he is very shocked. One part of the problem is that he is a college shoes. The other part is really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A great contributor to the college. So, he has the idea of ​​compelling the young to become mature. He talked to Peter, who was raising the person and his allowance was full - hoping he would rise in the ceremony. It also thinks that he keeps a screw in school because he thinks that all these kids have to stop playing around and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now it's pretty slow here. To know the value of hard work, he rented a bunch of singing and dancing in their malls selling them. Talk about the alleged !! What will happen next, and especially a good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version is like a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney musical! I try to do something else to earn money from the kids ... or maybe sing and dance to sing until the song is sung! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said,. There is not a very good movie on the map with any sane, it's a vague movie that must be obscure! However, it is very interesting that in the film Miss Hesse's son, Peter, is actually the son of his real life. The only problem with that is that Peter Lynn Hayes is a really awesome actor. He is not enough enough to be a leading man and he comes off as shameless and uninteresting or cruel objectionable. In particular, the stupid impressions he made are really bad and then there's the gelatin's carrier that you spell out. Despite this terrible performance, he has a reasonably successful acting career. If you have seen him at Jossis Boom BAH, then who will believe it - because he is welcome as a bobonic plug!
