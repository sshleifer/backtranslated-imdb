The film begins with a wireless gunfight, where three bandits are quickly gunned by a hunter hunter - a monster hunter, who carries more than just a surface without the name of Clint Eastwood Trilogy (for the doler, the dealershare is better and better for some And good). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, one of the bandits, bandits one gang leader (Gilbert Rowland) rides away with cheats and gold. Soon, Rowland cats up and finds where gold is hidden. But, at that moment, the army roams and kills the treacherous ... Bamara. However, Man with no name Winne believes Roland knows about this treasure and probably holds a medalist traitor given to Roland. A weird banker, is also thrown into the mix. All three want gold and three looks pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not particularly prominent Western. Most of it is a plot, some of which are not as interesting as George Hilton (Uruguayan, despite the American name) Eastwood or some other premier spaghetti Western Star, but most of it sucks soundtrack easily. So often music acting does not come close together and it seems to be adding randomly around it. Plus, it's not really a very good thing. This is not clearly the work of Enio Mikron - Spaghetti music director. <br /> <br /> Overall, only one time passer - and not particularly good for boot.
