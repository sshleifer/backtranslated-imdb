For the first half of the movie, he has his way to the King's Palace and helps lower people in the next half, especially "Catherine" (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> The Good - Fantastic Set Decoration (i.e. the King's Palace) and the costume make it a visual treat. Language is very joke Ian McClelane and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this movie becomes very annoying. It needs to give some surprises after an hour, but on the contrary: it rises. The script definitely needs some "necessary restoration", what do we say? The picture may look beautiful, but it is very long to sit for two hours ....
