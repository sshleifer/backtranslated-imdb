Is this supposed to be serious? I do not hope This is one of the most pathetically ridiculous movies I have ever seen. I picked it up for a cell phone on the "bad movie" shelf, it sure is up to the store spot. What can I say, the effects of Gore have spread everywhere (somewhat perfectly), some are actually watching, some feel like a teddy bear that has caused accidents with teddy bear bottles. The music is one of the most fun stuff I've heard, something I've heard ... I have to continue? Do not bother until you see every other unfortunate horror movie in the store and this is the rest.
