Let's see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists forced some cardboard scientist to take some foreign drug tests on some cardboard drug and abducted. This unfortunate excuse for Humanoids will be sure to smile when you just get to the desert! Drug tests have given them the ability to sense the other world ... Religious fantasy world! They are full of birdboard monsters that look like pipyear make-up. Everyone drages the hell, the only poor goat that goes to heaven, where he probably can create this masterpiece of turmoil and spend eternity with blockheads. I think I'd choose for myself Hellfire. If you do not throw stones, see something else, in that case, you can actually like it! Could not hurt!
