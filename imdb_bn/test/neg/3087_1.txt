The film's producers are hoping that the film will help sell Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately, it can not save what is already captured on the screen. Despite some neatly shot European positions and some hard production design elements, the film mostly fails due to the strange, incredible romance between Braver and Acleton. An unnecessary filming experience.
