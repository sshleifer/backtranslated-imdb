Bardem is great. Actress is great But Amnabrake did not have to do this like this. It is just that he protects his position in euthanasia, a very subtle problem. But because of doing so, he can lose his point: The film is false, objectionable, strategies and sometimes very annoying. Some visual advertising elements, more than a movie. The woman attracts this mind-sick person incredibly, whoever wants to kill her, can not understand the effect. She does not think of any one and thank them for their care, love and attention. I think Amenabara may have thought otherwise about this, but I believe it is not the way he liked it. He can make his point stronger by expressing other coins without currency.
