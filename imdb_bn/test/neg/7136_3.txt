Ober Davis (Amber Tamblen) traveled to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller) and was caught in the same mysterious curse that killed many people. He tried to solve and correct the curse with one of the other groups. <br /> <br /> Dushyi reshares everything for the first time, and it creates only a few fears. The first Grudge was one of the best movies ever. The courtyard was good but the acting was wood and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. The fault of the fault 2 is even more silly and less scary. Also, Dairy Movie 4 has made it almost impossible to take these movies seriously, and there was a problem in direct face to me during the "horrible scenery", which would encourage laughter rather than scary. How does Taksee Shimizu make his own franchise objectionable, but he is successful in creating a decent environment. Unfortunately, he kept slow motion in the film with a bunch of slow characters and furry tactics. Obviously, he did this movie for money and I'm glad it failed. <br /> <br /> The screenplay was quite bad, mainly because it was not sensible and they did not develop letters. There are three different stories in the film, and each of them is related to "fault". The links were weak and a bunch of people were killed without a real reason. They do not explain the rules of curse very well and because of the death of everyone, it has ended some of the blood bath, although the PG-13 rating is going to be interesting, so even death scenes had some hair. The dialog was weak and the letters were better or better for not being desired. <br /> <br /> The act was similar to everything else and it was much worse than the first. Amber Tamblyn was boring wood. She seems to move very slowly on the screen and all its emotions are fake. Sarah Michelle Glaire was right, though she was just a cameo. Jennifer Bells gave the best performance, she had some good views and was of effective type. Arielle Kebbel was just fine, a little soft. The rest were horrific or just too forgotten to mention. Overall, The Grade 2 was a series of frustrating. It lacks a lot and it's not valuable. Ratings 4/10
