My mother, my cousin, and I'm a great Jane Austen fan. We know all the words of Pride and Prejudice Masterpiece in 1995, and Emma of Guindy Paltrow has seen an embarrassment repeatedly. I have read all the books, and I have even sat through knowledge and sensitivity and persuasion even a few times. So my mother and I thought it would be nice to see the film in the North of Uttar Pradesh. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is about the worst movies I've ever seen. It is worse than the Alice Thru locking glass of 1998, or the 1939 Nancy Drew film bought Wal-Mart $ 1 (my previous "worst movie"). The first is wrong, which you noticed in the first scene, that "heroine," Catherine, has an awesome and strange fantasy, inspired by trashy novels that will not touch the hero of a Jane Austen. His dream is throughout the novel (day and night), in which he was taken with a sticky whip by a slightly disgusting man, dragged across a field directed to God, which suddenly he would rescue a person suddenly. White horse <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " No aesthetic classical music or English country dance here! It is almost clear, almost at first glance, that the actress (for a lack of good sound) chose Catherine's game to be completely closed. Firstly, he is rather overwhelming, and is rendered even more so by his non-Austenlike behavior. His appearance and movement is just wasted! Plus, they are completely influenced and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills mostly affects all actors of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Big, Marie Antoinette-style headdresses ( For the most part) Correctly clash with Style Empire Gown. A friend of General Tilani, French woman, has become black like a nightmare of some ancient Goths - she has an interesting match with Michael Jackson in black dress. Her face is even sillier by a huge crescent beauty sign in her cheek. I was also surprised by the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all women were defeated. <br /> <br /> There was another immunity that kept with my mom and the "bath" scene was laughing laughing for ten minutes. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a large bath room - probably not likely, probably in the early 1800's. Then we have seen that all women wear large Chinese or plastic plates, they are surrounded by strings in their necks. Plate floating horizontally over the water, containing some mysterious pieces ... something. We had soap it, then the perfume herbs, then finally, when the mystery began invisible in the substance shot, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And what is wrong with Abbey in answerland is not half. My alerts are anyone who is considering renting this movie: Keep your hands. And if anyone is considering buying it - well, I do not know what to say it. <br /> <br /> You will think that when the actor and others are making this film, about 1/4 percent of the way they will get it, they can understand that they are making a monster and stop it. Unfortunately, they were not, and North Crushed Abbey was released on earth.
