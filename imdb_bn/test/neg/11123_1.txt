Chupacabra: Dark Waters must take place as one of the most cruel Moroccan movies ever made. Because of the involvement of John Rice Davis, I was expecting at least some changeable entertainment and after seeing this film, I can honestly say that I reduced my opinion about Mr. Davis. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. Davis has more claims than a nice actor, cast and director. It is unfortunate that Mr. Davis was a watch-observer and hoped that the check would not bounce. She just showed that there would be an understatement. But at least he showed. Other casts seem to be acting as waiters from their respective jobs at Los Angeles restaurants. Talk about a cast unknown! Cast such that the movie does not appear again. They act as auditions when they wait in the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What about special effects? Stratopham, Starfofam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects seem to have come from eight of my games in 1980. I've seen some terrible special effects used in Sci-Fi channel films, but this seems to be seen by some to cut and paste in kindergarten. I hope Mr Krebs and Spong-Bob will see the end of the war. Note that all the accounts of the animal describe it as a small rural-like crater. It was a good movie for Leprechten-like character. Instead, we get a giant fierce animal that is shown walking with stop-action speed-up effects which is ridiculous. Whispers are in one place and then it goes down at the speed of the hall and it looks like some sunshine.
