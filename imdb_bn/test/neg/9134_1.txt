Koyaanisqatsi and Povqqatsi both beautiful films, but let this final installment of triangle be a major. They are very stocked with footage and photography, very little content. Executive Producer puts his own picture in the film ... It is just provocative. Perhaps they could cost $ 3 million but perhaps it could be something. I really thought Steven Soderberg managed it because it was so bad, but Guanfrey Rezio and Povaqatasi, the director of konoscativity, gave the order. I guess they did not have the budget to make a decent film. You might think Francis Ford Coppola wanted to be part of this movie and helped get more money together.
