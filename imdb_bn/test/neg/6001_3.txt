I usually like Jackie Chan movie but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 battle scenes that are less or less than all normal values. The bad thing about this movie is that it has many focus on car chasing / racing. Car Chase is not so bad (although not as exciting as the battle) but car racing at the end is extremely annoying. Basically it takes everything that makes Jackie Chan Jackie Chan's film and excludes everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional tendencies are lacking in their usual humor. <br /> <br /> I guess I was a bit worried that I saw one of the terrible dubbed versions. I usually try to see the subtitle version ... I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I just found the Jackie film worse, and this is the beginning and the difference in Hollywood movies. Not so good. <br /> <br /> If you are not really funny or have a lover of motorsports.
