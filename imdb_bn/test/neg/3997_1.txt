Before I watched this film, I realized it would be a low budget film. But even by this low quality this film does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that movie makers had less budget or bad acting, writing, direction, sound, music and editing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the 'action' screen closes and what we can see is the next effect, which seems very fake - even less budget Movie values ​​too. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for doing so much evil in Gore. At the same time, Peter Jackson had created a similar low budget 'bad taste' and he was able to roam more and hoot more than he could show in this film. <br /> <br /> level, I can not recommend this image to anyone. Make it clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
