I originally broadcast when I saw this hallmark television movie. I lost interest in the story because a character was called Direct. I just did not have the exact frame of mind to see this image. But Hallmark stands for the best, quality movie. Now, there is a reason to give this image a second look. Pierce Brosnan will have the opportunity to pass this as Clive Owen, who played "Damon Willow", after James Bond 007. Clive Wayne may have to wait until 2008. Another reason is that female leadership Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown) and in 2003 won the Academy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Joan is also in Whitehall as "Mrs. Youtube". I like the opening line in this film: "Release my heart from this terrible, lonely place. Do not send me love from anywhere, or I'll die, I'll die."
