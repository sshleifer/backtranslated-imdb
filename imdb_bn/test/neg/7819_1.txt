Ever wanted to see which movie could decrease? Well, look at it! This movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Racism jokes, incomplete jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, wheel jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating peacock jokes, young jokes at the age of old, cancer jokes, gay jokes, bop jokes, fall one After one face face, joke, rape, curiosity, junky drug abuse, anus adultery jokes, their coffee back-up jokes, a bunch of nudity joke, the most swearing Who can say it's more a scene da joke, samakamitakari joke, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and people! <br /> <br /> The worst part is: What's funny about it! (No one can find it most fun to start from.) It seems like when it may not be bad, it puts your expectations down a new one, because it feels different to the viewer. Bad There was a scene that almost thrown me and almost completely disappointed at the same time. I do not think I should point out, but again, I am sure that other scenes will give people a similar feeling. The film was really sensible and a little realistic, when suddenly a scene was piled with the trunk bag's nostost residue and some feet were thrown in the ground, only a bunch of beer bottles Torn in his head. This is probably all while he deserves it at least. Thus all thoughts of 1 more point drift are deemed faster. This is actually a horror movie. To teach the student what to do, it is necessary to study and hesitate in a small part of a film school.
