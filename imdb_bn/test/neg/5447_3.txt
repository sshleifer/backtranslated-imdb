I'm not really sure why this is so much complimentary about the weird movie. I said - I was actually sitting for a full two hours and I could not say that it was not completely non-recreational. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and it is clear in this movie - he is an experienced producer, so he has created a movie so many times, and can understand what goes on in the process. But I think it was quite different - capable of being able to direct a movie, but in some way flat and direction less. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and it is over, I think, in the last product - it seems to be a group of sets that have failed in its continuity or its continuation of its character. <br /> <br /> Fun, watch, but better? No
