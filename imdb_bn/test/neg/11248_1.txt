This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The main center of this film was a painful black-colored man, which was a barbershop for painfully distorted response exchanges. I do not laugh at all time during the whole movie. I could have been sitting in a US barbershop and heard this brutal smile, and even came out with a beautiful hair. I do not understand this mess received any favorable reviews, why so few people have so much money wasted? Here the characters were about fun or care about anyone. I am not really worried about road competitor barbershop Nappy Cutz who can go out of business. Do not waste your money on this one, because Hollywood is the only way to stop it in pieces. 1 * 5 out
