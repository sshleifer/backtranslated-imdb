Oldbaw is set in Korea and the drunken cum-su-oh (mini-sik Choi) is started only to kidnap his friend from the police station, dei-woke up and find himself in a small room, which he will do The next fifteen years will be captured. Dae-su is fed and cared for by his unknown detainees but not allowed to go out of the room, the DUS itself begins to train itself to get rid of the cement that bricks it off with a brick. Chopsticks But before the end of the dei-suo, he is unconscious and when he wakes up, Dai-su, himself on the roof of a tall building and free of all financing. Daeu-Su immediately tried to find out who was in prison, after seeing the beautiful Mido (Hei-Jung Kang) with two fall of love and with his help, Dae-Su has finally found that what she was looking for came true but Price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was co-written and operated by Chan-ek Park and got a rich review (how the distributors were left out And they can choose iguli plaster on the video box), and even won the grand prize kanese jury when it was nominated for the Golden palm-old boy is so obviously true classic? Well for me it is because I do not understand why it is so much like it and I say so much that I hate it except one or two isolated moments of each other. In the beginning I could not read in the story, I did not like it, because I thought it gradually slowly and slowly gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually Slowly get bored. Rather plain and very well executed Until finally ending Hyde hypothecation of Dae-S. Newenzin's Alps, it seems that the makers wanted to finish something happier. I was almost asleep in about two hours, I was very annoyed, the violence was taking place and I think about the fact that most people seem to have problems. In fact, there are very few body compositions in about seven and a gentle sexual scene, it's not actually graphic or memorable. I'm not warm for any character and when I take the full idea at an old age and fail to deliver it, and this is a movie I can not understand why people like so much. Based on a Japanese manga of the same name, Oldbie's film looks just right, there are one or two wonderful moments here, though everyone has a series of clashes in the series of Halloween war. I was absolutely unclear and thought that the choreography of the war was quite dusty. True on-screen violence is very low, Day-Su has a live octopus that is apparently quite normal in Korea, some war scenes, a mud arm, some teeth are drawn and it has some blood in it. <br /> <br /> The budget was around 4,000,000 USD, which is a fair bit illustrated in South Korea and New Zealand. Acting looks correct but it is difficult to know when the actors speak different languages. <br /> <br /> Old year is a movie that I'm free, I do not think of subtitles or foreign movies or I follow the whole thing and pay attention to the plot but I do not like it, and it's easy and easy to do. Apparently the trilogy of retaliation of the second director Choi-Uk Park, Including the sympathy of Wyensans (2002) and Lady Venagen (2005).
