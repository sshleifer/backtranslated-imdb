I am giving this movie a "2" rating to Vampire Assassin because it was not sex or nudity. Even more, I'm not sure why this is ever made. It was like a training exercise to make a movie with a very limited budget. Derek and Slovak characters were the best actors. They closely followed the player's pants and silver belts with "Bike-Dude". She was very right. Most of the film was depicted in a distribution warehouse. If you are tired of seeing Kung Fu kick boxing stunts, you can check packages of Scott Tissue, Windsacks and other clean products. You have a lot of time to do this, trust me. I started to do almost a list. Dialogue and Kung Fu stunts were extremely slow. They talked slowly, fought slowly, I do not know why. At least with the extra-slow delivery of the actor line, you could hear everything very clearly. I'm trying to find the best thing to say about this movie. Finally we found it to be the best, but it did not. Actor really knew martial arts or we were never able to decide whether they are playing martial arts. You can see yourself and decide. My favorite line was like something (speaking vampire :) "What are you looking for?" Other people respond: "Work your bad teeth."
