Worst.film.ever needs to say nothing Aaron Carter is completely annoying and the rest of the cast will immediately burn their agents. It's really a terrible terrible movie from the beginning to the end. I can be more intelligent in describing many movies (many) flaws, but I will not be disturbed and get very angry to make appropriate sentences. <br /> <br /> In my childhood, I hated everything about this movie and was not so bad as "so good" ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Gavin
