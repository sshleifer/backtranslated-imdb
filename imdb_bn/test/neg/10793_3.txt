Abysmal decoration adventure in Jungle Ladies Section. Lousy audio obscures thanks to the ignorance dialog. And it's great talking about the film about not talking in English. There is no adventure available here; This is a jungle adventure with a wild adventure and a wild animal attack with flashing. <br /> <br /> Three pale faces float in the African Desert of Dope and fight the hungry tribes of the Amazon. This wild female has just improved out of Stone Age as makeup, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology innovation. Despite their frustration for "Hus-bahnd", women force that they fight men and burn the weak. <br /> <br /> The only thing of interest as if there is a question, young women engaged in cleverly designed animal skins such as bathing cases of 1912, got lots of wrestling and bad dance mixed with the stripe moves of the 1950s. No nudity or commendable violence. On the other hand, you may be hamming interesting local songs for days.
