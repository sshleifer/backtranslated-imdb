Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the money! In the hat advertising and merchandise, we have done so much bomb attacks with cats that we almost believe there is something good about this movie. I thought the trailer was bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should've gone with my instincts. It was a full piece Hollywood trash. Again, it proves that the average person can be believed to be some good that they feel good, that would be good. The film, which was about 80 minutes long outside the humiliating truth, was probably started with a moth-eaten script. It's a fool's humorous attempts to fail, and awful pastel sceneries are full chock. It's a destination or direction to jump across the entire universe. This is then compounded with ............................ Yes I will say it, bad job! I could not help but felt that I looked softly every time "coffee talk" Mike Myers opened the mouth. Was the cat intended to be a medieval Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Decotta Fanning had no rewards, but Mr. Myera would disappear somewhere under a stone until Austin Powers was ready to make the film somewhere else. F-, 0, on a scale of 1-10. Save yourself money!
