Please be sure that this film does not accurately depict our mental / mental status of our soldier / sailor / pilot / marine soldier as an American service member. <br /> <br /> It's called ... <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge vapor lid. Horror acting (apart from the little girl) character backgrounds are weak and funny, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I have created an account with IMDb to warn with someone <br/> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucant should really be ashamed of this movie. If he disagrees with the US foreign policy, then he must write a letter to the US government, do not punish the entire English language with the fictitious film of the monument.
