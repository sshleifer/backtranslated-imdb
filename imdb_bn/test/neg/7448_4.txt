I was a huge fan of the main robot. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that I was disappointed because of this first sign. <br /> <br /> There are many problems <br /> <br /> While the film can see, there are many bluepers on the screen which are visible to all, cable, cameraman etc, from any kind of Irvin Kreshner's descendants. Feel completely unacceptable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a robot. There is no surprises in humanity found in the character here. Real frustration when someone thinks that his "soul" is back at the end of the first film. Here his attitude does not show any body and makes him sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Cain is a poor villain. All right, I know that Badikker was better than the first picture, thanks mainly to the performance of Cartwright Smith, but usually Tom Nunan has firmly made a character that you can not be less aware of either or the other. <br /> <br /> What happened to Old Man ???? I am grateful that he has not been reached by "beautiful" but his character change here is not less than silence. In the first movie it has become clear that he hates the strategy and attitude of Dick Zone, and yet he is not better than Jones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The poor replacements for the disorderly, obnoxious, OCP resident genius for the disorder of Bob Morton. <br /> <br /> Save the sequence that is stuck in the Action sequence, Murphy. Beside the kainan truck, rude and nasty and irritated instead of entertaining. <br /> <br /> And finally. What's with musical scores? Do not tell me that Polondauris could not do this immediately because he was working in total memory. A series (TV or movie) soundtrack is part of his personality. Part of its character. When you delete it, the characters we see are damaged. So Leonard Rosenman's shame is shameful but shameful. Here his score is worthy of lurid, camp and inferior cringe. <br /> <br /> The story will be fair at its moment. Here's a lot of originality. But it tried a lot of new things to take a movie. Will be a good perception and simple genuine "Vladimir", moved to Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The final event between Robocop and Robcop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for a long time it's a serious disappointment.
