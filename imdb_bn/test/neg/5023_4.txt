To be completely frank, the popularity of this show made me sad. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it's a few good moments, sometimes cute flash laughs flash, and, unlike many animations, dignity. However, this is a complete story lacking essential elements of the story. From the beginning, its premises doms to be stereotypical. The main conspiracy centers collect a fragmented gemstone before being covered by the temple and often suspect the genial epic fantasy. The story follows a familiar pattern of fight against enemies for gem pieces and thus it is quite predictable, lack of complexity and easy to lose interest in. However, many immunizations have been shown, a poor place can be deeply retrieved, realistic characters. Sadly, nobody ever saved the story of Inusha. The main character of kammam, stereotyptical anime heroin (and the original work of the original particle, Rannima 1/2) is very memorable for Akhenen; He is kind to other women, but many men, especially his love interest, behaved with unjust, unabashed, unjustifiable cruelty. Inausa is a hard-on-out-in-in-in-type interior, and Miroku's "distorted" stock character buried. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot and these characters - namely, nothing. Despite the constant action, the story does not progress. Regardless of the regular romantic moments, the main relationship is not. Despite the considerable time, the letters do not really change. And to add a cherry to mediocrity sundae, all these stagnation stretches in around 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My final critique of this anime animation. Of course it is not ugly, but it shows almost disrespectful laziness to the makers. Animators seem to be enjoying the wind in the wind through the long winds of the wind, where they work, but they move a background. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no reason to see Inuyasha, a keyboard-perched fingertip with all the beautiful animations in the world.
