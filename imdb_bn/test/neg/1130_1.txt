Last night I saw this movie, and I say, this is the worst thing I have seen. The whole picture is a train debris, and it is not the actor. It's awesome scripts. <br /> <br /> ** Spiller ** OK, Eddie lost his monkey to a monkey. His silent boy disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> She gets a free vacation. He goes along with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boat crashes. They stay on an island. They stupid and look closer to the nearby hotels do not even bother. <br /> <br /> OK, so that's it. What makes this movie kind of humorous. It's very awesome, mountainous, and stupid, even you can not laugh. And it's not funny fun. I can not laugh the whole thing.
