All right, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith, Miss Herningbone-Totten, BBE (Backbone of England.) In the first scene he died - OK, people; This show is not a backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Weel from Old Battle, Old Colonel Cricket and now Manor Illuminated Lord. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a toy boy next to the 20 year old and next to his 20-year-old head of his own, but still dark (Brit Spell, Not Me) . All right, they have full knowledge and compliance with Colonel Cricket (they even go round for Christmas!) Still, he has considered the kernel enough to say his own age (what it means!) <br /> <br /> David McCullum As such toy boy says, equally as immersive glamorous as his immersion. Pillar did not bring any cover for her in the story, so she gave him a Hash Hash Job in the circus. <br /> <br /> And finally <br /> <br /> Miss Polonia Teacups like Susan Hampshire, Honorary Headmaster of Venerable Girl's Boarding School, serving deep in her office, with profound advice for deep, mad advice for outdoor world life just before graduation . The best bit of his advice: "I just went to Nanchiro (the local style home in England). I thought it was very nice, but, in fact, is not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - there was time, your character was running the whole show. They will not write this way. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - like a casting and setting, do you have to rebuild your "Bridehead Revisite"? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They have taken this 1-dimensional supporting role because they paid so much. Finally, acting is one of the oldest jobs (you have another name!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: Lots of lots and lots of backlighting. They get it almost out of shooting - "Hey, it's just sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: Leading Lady cried a lot. Without crying, his eyes moist. This is the act of romance novels: Leading Lady "Dew-Eye". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he loves, his eyes Still, I will give Emily Montmare a reward for working with Spotlight in her eyes (I wonder what they used to communicate?) <br /> <br /> Finally, the fourth warning sign: there is no screen female character "Mrs." She is either "Miss" or "Lady." <br /> <br /> When all was talk and done, I could not tell you who followed and who followed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, the LL said that he and his parents were in Japanese jails The camp is lost and the baby Sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile, there are some young people who have come to the house (when I do not know) in a few days of hardship and living on the street of the manar street, if SHE can find him on the street.) Both wounded by the casualties in Nankarcha (This romance story will be "shaking away" for a while!) <br /> <br /> Great play
