I agree with a commentator that says Glenn or Glenna is really impossible to review? Neutral If someone does that, the film will be seen as a delightful one with its merit, which is ridiculous, slowly speaking dialogues, generally moderate and cast with zero production quality. Yet, such an assessment does not capture the experience of writing this film altogether. It is not true that the film is about transvestism and it's a controversial lifestyle in the 1950s. It does not have to be separate and separate conversations for individual alternatives. <br /> <br /> No, what makes Glenn or Glenda? An interesting film after 50 years is that Ed Wood kept his brain in such a way that, despite his superior talent, such as Hughcock or Goddard, he was never known as an auditor. Wood is not afraid to express his own deepest sympathy in London, despite the application of tolerance for Glenn or Glenday. Indeed, by the end of the film, it can be understood that Ed Wood's glenn character Glenna will be able to kill the opposing opponent's "love and affection". Glenn will bring her wife repeatedly to her future wife Barbara. Psychologists even assure Glenn and Barbera that Glenn will be invisible to psychologically, Glenn will be invisible. So, when the wood can usually request transvestite tolerance, it is not sure that he wanted it for himself. <br /> <br /> Besides, wood that did not fear to throw everything else beyond his mind. The screen He did it with that hand-stock footage he could get his hands on. If not, so what? What Glenn or Glenda had seen in the audience was particularly the most unusual of all the strange fantasies of Ed Wood. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I Oddly memorable effect, despite its technically oppressive qualities, I can not remember that it can be rated.
