SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film was completely different from the book (The book was not just classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was right. In fact, I do not really remember much about its performance one way or the other. But the big disappointment was not with Mrs. Moore. <br /> <br /> Why did anyone decided to make Millionaire's heart suddenly rewrote? (I am referring to him as "millionaire" because he had a different name in his movie book version - just another variation.) <br /> <br /> Those who did not read the book must have won nothing, but in the book version this man is very ruthless and overall Complex She is very impressive. The whole plot change that has been changed so much in the film. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that many movie books are widely altered. But I thought the character of Redford was a kitten. It was not a fault of Redford (he could have played a great actor and brutally well) but without those qualities, he became another dazzling man in love, so the story has become a love story related to a woman and two men. This was not really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> It can be a lot better. Even if I could not read the book version, I did not like it all, but often changing it often made me down a few points.
