This version of "Moodle Flute" has never been seen that the funniest is not the worst producer of the opera, it is the worst video production ever seen from any opera. <br /> <br /> I have a big opera fan and I have more operas in DVD than movie. The set is cheap and sugar. Papageno does not even have a bird's costume. She is dressed just like some people. The word is mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVDs have been digitally restored from this DVD, but they are not bothered about it. Also, the language has been changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie version of "Magic flood". It is a illustrated performance and it does not have a good performance and it is not very well pictured. You can choose another available DVD of this opera and I guarantee that it will be even better. My choice for the version set by James Levin, with David Hockney set.
