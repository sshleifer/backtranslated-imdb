My best guess is that this work will come out of the DVD a few days before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The time line covers all the places. It will not be so bad if it eventually leaves some mystery. It was completely hypothetical. The bitch loves to be upset, strangers want to know why they hate him so much, the unfortunate girls die terrible death, the worried girl goes home and looks crazy. Outcast girl brings evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. The strange kid knows what is going on. Oh, and little sister is not good enough for Mom, the sick mother is sending a small girl to bring her baby son. <br /> <br /> Okay, there were some great moments here and there. First of all, Sarah Michele Geller's character died within the first few minutes. Definite Plus Do not see that coming. I did not expect the wife to pour Bacon Grease on her husband's head. If the film can hold such thrills, I would have liked it. At the beginning, so much promise was shown. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated because I enjoyed the first one. It jumps me, I do not expect most of what happened, and even though I asked some movies, it was still a fun watch. I wanted to be surprised because I did not see any preview for this series. I was, but the wrong direction.
