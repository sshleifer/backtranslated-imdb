This could be the best game ever !! But after the 3 killings and the end of the game makers just drunk! This is the combination of Prince of Persia, Hit-Man, GTA and the Second (Saladin) Coordination of Empire. <br /> <br /> Yes these four games, as described above, are considered as one of the greatest games of all time. <<br /> <br /> You combine four and you get this game !! It's all good aspects of four games such as acrobatic skills, secret killings, open world and history! For the first 3 killings, you think this game is the best !! But for the third time, things seem so repetitive that you are just hoping to finish the game. <br /> <br /> I played it on a PC and the PC version is terrible with glitches and stupid side missions. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good game but can get it for XBOX360 or PS3. <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, this game comes from the makers of the Prince of Persia. Of course the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and is not better than the four games mentioned above!
