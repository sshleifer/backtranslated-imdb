This movie was terrible. It's not something that people have to pay. It seems that some Christian groups make people transform. I do not understand why it was released in theaters and not on TV. <br /> <br /> It started like 50-year-old fashion B-movie science-film film, but it quickly changed. About 30 minutes of the movie starts talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It quickly comes to the pure religion region. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a Saif-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; Bad camera angle and amateur <br /> <br /> Ignore it!
