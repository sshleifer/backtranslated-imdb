Anchored April was one of the last films of Harry Baymont - he managed to do more than just a few of these films. He made the film "Messi" in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening achievement, it says "from Elizabeth's novel" and completely eliminates the author's last name ... rather weird, but it may be a von army, they might not have wanted the German Association ... I heard it when Frank was published There was a funny name like Morgan (Wizards) and Jesse Ralph, who played WC. In the unexpected field of field at "Bank Dick" In London, two cheeks (Anne Harding and Catherine Alexander) decided to hire a fort to host their two friends, but they did not decide what they planned. Reginald Oven plays the husband with multiple personalities. As well as from some fun moments, it is quite slow move. Ralph is the only bright spot here, as a very caring charge, and the film is quite unclear and in most cases the film is out of focus. All the obvious backdrop of Italian opinion Here's the only saving grace: Turner's classic version is only 66 minutes long. Very bad they did not give a big role to Frank Morgan. It was rebuilt as a British film in the BBC in the year 1992.
