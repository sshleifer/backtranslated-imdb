First of all, I'm a great fan of Tokelian, and as one, I'll make most of his critics civil in his books. <br /> <br /> This movie is an ideal adventure movie, it specializes in Nifty special effects, beautiful sound track and fine. Now if this movie says anything other than the Lord of the Ring, the reviews will not be as good as half of here. <br /> <br /> The problem of this movie is the basic story line book from Tokikaze, but then it goes and "Hollywood" can do everything, numerous scenes of the book have been free or changed, the characters have also changed from the book, which I think Be punishable! Deeper insight into the character of the film, I know that it is almost impossible to make good films from a good book, and it does not work here, mostly the motivation of letters becomes lazy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As an adventurous movie it's adaptation of the Tokianian at 7+ / 10, it's 2/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to tell the truth, what is Ravendel Ford doing on Arvon in the world? And for the comment that this movie is "Best of all time" I can say that you are a very young boy, or you have seen good movies ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson called this movie Should have had adventure movies based on the Lord of the Rings.
