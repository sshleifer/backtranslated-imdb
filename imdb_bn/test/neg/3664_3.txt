I have to start by saying that actresses and actors did a good job for what they did. The problem with Dark Reality is that you have a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and enthusiastic, he finally ended the film. From the beginning to the end you can say that the film's rail quality is low, but it also hurts further by hiding the poor playing and cone cameras. The words are not muffled and often times understand. I'm sure the director (director) gave the argument to stimulate panic status among audiences, but there was enough material for him. The result of the camera and the way it was highlighted was a sign of top syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A fundamental unfortunate female abduction story that keeps the girl in a frustrating position for the right reason. Billy Bob from Lambs' silence used his prey better than the NetWane. The biggest problem with the story is that the dead always disappoint the main character of his mind and the second time they show that I am making rapid progress because it is trying to destroy the only decent part of the film. <br /> <Until the end, the way the indicator combines it randomly shows insignificant things and ends up the film with firmly visible scenes (not due to the light, angle, and the horrors due to the camera). Houston definitely definitely tried very hard and it was similar to a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, it's okay, but be careful that the quality of the movie is enough to stop it.
