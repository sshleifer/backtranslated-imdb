* Instead of Elite Sniper team inserted 24 hours or more, digging and disappearances decided to take cover behind a big rock in the first scene. * When the hero "runs" to rescue his wife, he actually gives it. * When the target target is within 20-30 meters away from a building, the hero uses his scope. In addition to this, most non-elite soldiers will make the shot from the hip and still hurt that opportunity probably will not be able to focus on that closeness. * There is a satellite that can be seen horizontally in buildings. <br /> <br /> This list is endless ... and the movie is sometimes the biggest hip of duality in my DVD player.
