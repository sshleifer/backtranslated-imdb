I really wanted to see this movie - I thought this plot was really unique and playful. A police (Andy Garcia) is a boy who is dying and needs to replace bone marrow for survival. The only match convicted killer, who escapes from jail <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Keaton is a great actor at the time but here he is quite annoying. It's just the top where you're just taking care of. <br /> <br /> Garcia is good but trying very hard for a film which is not equal. Barbit Schroeder (one of the most promising directors with a "Barflee" movie that did not have anything in America's market) gives considerable amounts - I genuinely think that the script was a criminal here ... it's just a big mess. <<br /> <br /> The film has finally ruined many good elements, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. What should be a tense and thought-provoking film should be a ugly action ugly.
