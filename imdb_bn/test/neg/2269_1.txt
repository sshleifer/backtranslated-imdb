This is not a good movie at all. I can not believe that fifty years later, the film received a national award when such gems of Marathi films were so systematically ignored. It got a very overrated movie that too, very lucky. It was given a national award, popular opinion was collected and is now going to represent India in front of international audience. Well, anyone with a limited understanding of quality movies is very well aware that this will not even be nominated in Oscars. <br /> <br /> I can not understand where I can start. There are many things which are lacking in this film, which are considered as extraordinary or even national awards. This film will be considered as the best film of this year, which will show favorable judgment towards biased prosecution of Indian people who fall this year and those who realize this movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> The selected topic is great. Is it important to create such a movie? But only those who are able to handle them by. Does Sandeep Sawant do not measure the work ?? Not even close His direction is confusing, There is no clear thinking process. He tries, but can not explore the depth of the letters, especially the grandfather. He is not able to show the initial fears, anxiety and then the frustrated separation and grandfather's courage. When we should have been shown spending time together, he wasted our time in the hospital. He is trying to rank in everything without any priorities. He does not understand his subject correctly and is actually counted against him. <br /> <br /> However, Caste does not help Sawant. Worst job ?? Amrita Good Hope She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job. How does she get her flowers? Very lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely unhappy welding. It says that he has gone out of the way of doing even a terrible thing in this movie. Should the actor be more responsible for his MSW's work ?? Golden kulkarni Amrita did not understand Subhash. Under the constant stress of MSW, it is important for them to work in a quiet, solid external project, because they reassure patients. Aswari of Amrita Subhash is more afraid and needs support than the person she is working for. <br /> <br /> The second worst ?? Arun Nalawad I have never seen more wooden faces in the Marathi film industry (though in today's Hindi cinema it is abundant and everywhere). He is the producer and so he chooses himself; No second thoughts, no consideration. Even if an actor is forced to pay the producer to do the job, there is a good actor to play this role, but Arun Nalawad will not let anyone else do it. On the aspiring and unexpected, he contributes to contribute further down the movie than everyone else combined. His acting research and lack of basic performance skills are also lacking. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is unclear. The movie is technically lacking. It might be better to work on an FTII project. <br /> <br /> upwards; Excellent performance Ashwin Chitale. It is surprising that such a young boy can give such an honorable performance. He kept many actors today for shame. Strangely, but he brought his own innocence to his character and made it a memorable performance. Also, Sandeep Kulkarni has really given a very credible performance. Really made all his efforts and it shows. The script is very well written. <br /> <br /> 'Showing budget' can not be a valid reason to appreciate this movie. All the lack of finance minister's dogs in Marathi movies Cricket and Hindi films sponge off all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scrap. This is a sad thing but there is still no reason to appreciate any wonderful movie. 'Dogi' was a bright movie and it was also made in the budget of a shoe maker. 'Dogi' was also technically lacking but it is well researched and well-made. It is a detailed description and supported by wonderful performance by everyone and it creates rich movies. Why not get so good recognition? ?? Only biased judgment proved my point. <br /> <br /> The lack of research and no funding, which makes 'Shwaas' such a bad movie.
