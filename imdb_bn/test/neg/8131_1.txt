I unintentionally went into this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> I would be happy if I could give back time or get back easily. <br /> <br /> It was 7:30 pm until the Cinderella Man did not start until 10am so I entered the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20 ... and I boldly say that God has reached him (or It has withdrawn) and allowed me to punish myself for my movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a high school project or It was the best fit for the jet ... and I think I better see the performances that I worked for Louis Llapp in French Shorts. Maybe it's because I'm M Canadian and this film was for the LA Fudge- packing crew and their sympathetic dame. When I realized that the whole audience cracked me for jokes and entertaining ... I fully understood the frozen ... but I just could not add it. <br /> <br /> This show has shown me how to build, guess, gay male date and relationship. However, even if the film had their purpose, I think "Gyneans" focused on too much attention .... humanity was missing .... But again, it was probably the point ... Avant-Gard ... And to create a splash. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing with low budget and poor equipment, to make the movie "loud" as much as possible to get the crowd and cash back. . I was really willing to read instead of my Sheldon van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was completely wrong in the audience.
