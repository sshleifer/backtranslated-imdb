"Where is the pop?" At its first end, George Segal got up from his bed in the morning, Chavez kept the gourmet suit, and entered his mother's bedroom, later we realized that he had to give a deadly heart attack and get his life forever. This image is about the level of humor from most of the pictures: Madness, which merged with Morbid can be taken as brave. <br /> <br /> Segal plays an attorney in New York who lives with his supposed siren mom. Ruth Gordon), whose life is more complex, while recruiting a nurse for the care of the old bag, her dream girl was deliberately decked like a Florence Nightingale with the initial 30 Van Davis. Her hesitation: how to integrate lovely nurses into her and her pesky mother's life. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is one thing about holding one picture together. His frustration, his reaction, his nepotism almost neutral (whoever is that whatever?); Where the film fails in other areas. Ruth Gordon's character is terrible as mother. In the beginning, you can not understand if you are not barbaric of its character or just deliberately blurred to leave the boy. To the end, it is clear that he is just a nut. When Segal came to visit Van Devi's house, Gordon's eyebrows were wet and he found an average, terrible look. He wants that infiltrator will remove him from the life of the son; He's counting. This is not a senile person mode. You are not getting consistent performance across the whole picture, perhaps the director (Carl Reiner) blames Gordon as well. The elderly lady of Ross Gordon's "Rosemary Baby" has become more successful because Ruth Gordon usually has a bitter response to the actor, the impressive person. But when Mia was very fearful for the war, Gordon became even more tired, her fans became deeper and deeper, and we were afraid of Fear; Such imposition is truly awesome. Here, we usually told to laugh at what I thought was boring, and if Gordon is helplessly damaged like this, then we can be. But she is selfish and meaningless, and it spoils little humor. <br /> <br /> There are some good smiles, though. A court scene with Bernard Hughes's military officer and Countercurrency punk with Rubber Rinner is fairly ridiculous, and Vincent Gardena Lombersis makes excellent changes as a football coach. Seagal's brother, Ragan Lieberman, is an inspiring bit of ninja robbed by the Mughals while leaving Segal, asking him to wear him in the house - and he gives him a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> But many scripts are badly captured and can not be easily understood. Why is the lawyer in New York living in the first place in their own habit? Why Segal is loving his mother, try to reasonably reason: "If you ruin it for me, then I will throw your f --- ing into the heart." Why does he know that he is going to go mad and he is living in LeMman Park? After leaving Seagal's Gorilla suit why does he take the taxi? Why does not he all along the taxi? A fun bit has been liebman, as Gorilla, muggers terrorists. Why Van Devi is coming back - his first husband was Coke, why would he want to get involved with this bunch? I think if I keep it in Karl Reiner, he would have said, 'These crazy people, they do not understand.' Which is a convenient way to excite a lousy script full of holes. Do not need to understand the behavior of moments from moments of character, but their motives, and where "Where's Poppy?" Separate shower; The situations are created just for joke, and most of the gags are shot, they do not create anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reyner is most guilty of this whole lie. How has he gotten such a ridiculous fame as a pillar of my comedy puzzles; Basically, while talking with a funny voice, he had to keep a microphone in front of his carrier Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks. His son Rob is a master of ten times skill and intelligence as a director. At the showbiz, the Renaar buttons are pressed; A monkey could do its job. And that's the most obvious of the formulation of his deeds. Why are tight and close-ups shot in New York, but the country's scenes are remote and supernatural? Curl Reiner's guide, Clustrophobic for the city, Spatial for the country. Older people are not able to find out what's going on in the final insane scenes in the house, the camera is so far away. The sudden ending offers a resolution that seagulls can reach ninety minutes early; It can not determine how Rainer can finish the picture. So he just cut it as another example of "craziness". Rainer feels like fools craziness, and craziness without logic is always fun. Not this, and the creator of "Where POPA" Ruth Gordon drops Pepsi as its fruit loops.
