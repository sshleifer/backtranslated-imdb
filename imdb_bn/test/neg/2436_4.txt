This movie is playing like an English version of ABC after school specialization with nudity. It surprises you that the target audience should be guessed. It is not that the authors were probably involved in selling a potential plot. Although it does not possess a specific watchability, virtual sex is fluffier than dandelion meringue. If you are a snod, then it's a good movie, watch out, and it's your only tape.
