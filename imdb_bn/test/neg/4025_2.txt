I hired this DVD because I'm a great science fiction fan, but this thing (I would not call it a movie because it certainly shot very quickly on the video) seems to be that they went along. I'm still not sure what it's about. These guys are dressed in some weird S & M decorations and I guess they are not too meaningful for other planets, however, this is less, less, less, budget movies. If this is their first movie, I'll have some slack of them, but I think it's like their 5th film and it's really bad. <br /> <br /> Not too bad acting a good actor. This director may have been out of his mind to work in such a horror movie. Please do not waste your time or money on this DVD, do not please people. It does not have cost of .99 cents to rent DVDs. Actually I'm going to tell them that the DVD was objectionable to get my money back. I do not believe in giving anything to all the bad reviews but I'm certainly here My suggestion to anyone involved in this sinking ship - to get another job to get out. How could you make a rotten movie like this? If possible, I'll give these negative stars, it's terrible.
