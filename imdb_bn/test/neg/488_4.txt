This brief director was director Dell Lord's last and only short-lived. The problem: it was quite weak and the caf√©'s view was mostly the most carbon copy of Kelly's short "busy partner" (1944). The scene asked was quite funny, and started part of the cafe part. But there are a lot of plotholes in this brief. For example, why can police hide the garbage when coming in? Remikke, "Cash and hash" (1955), Director Jules White corrects this and the reason for the sticks hidden in the garbage is the gunfight between police and armored car robbers. The scene was completed with Karlie in "Dulphful or Egg" (1941) when Moe caught a fireplace problem. The wonderful house part is nothing but a sunny view outside the wonderful house. Top off it, in the end it was no sting. Ratings: C-
