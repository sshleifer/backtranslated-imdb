Once, while returning to the 1940s, an actress named Vernica Lake lived. A beautiful, talented young girl, who once had a high demand for Hollywood's big budget. In the late 1960's, fast forward, age, alcohol, and the bad luck around were all spoiled actresses. Now a quarrel, Miss Lake has followed the steps of her colleagues (?), Joan Crowford, and Bate Davis, and decided to read back on the good ol 'reliable horoscope. But fish feasts? Really? He probably could not have been washed that. For it's fine sort, Flush Feast is an useless pile trash, probably one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. To bring Hitler back to life, a scientist plotting with Nazis, youth reconstruction tests, which bring maggots, which are accurate, bring magazines. Unless you are a huge fan of Heater Hughes, run away and do not look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this 40-plus flakes, but it seems that this successful career has really become frustrating, really sad. Flush Feast is almost impossible to get around, and by almost, I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of the Nudist camp photo, and the person who briefly brought us a few years after, bloody, the greatest B-movie ever. One has to wonder, what would be like a blood type if you do not cooperate with Grinder Steve Hawks? If so, then God will bless Steve Hawks. You do not believe that religious, group-blooded desire, Turkey's brain can be much better than testing with Magogots and Hitler, but it's really true. So forget that you've ever heard of this and found a blood type, it's just waiting for you to entertain. Fast forward Some years later, Veronica Lake Hepititis died, broke, and forgot. The end I hate you, fish fits. 1/10
