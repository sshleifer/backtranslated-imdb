This movie is maddening bilateral. At one moment it is making fun of Latin America's American, American tourists and banana republic, the other wants to touch with touched villages and orphans. Even the revolutionary hero, a revolutionary, once became a parody of the revolutionary. But the part of the comedy is not even funny, because it is evidently stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, "hero" is basically a rogue with the heart of gold. Add effects of this stereootypeal word, Latin Americans who are talking to each other in English, and a villain that disappears from the story. And what's the point? It is basically no solution with the promotion of the revolution, and there is no plan (because there is no way that they can lead any country). The US government is bad people, but who will earn this production money? Not some poor peasants, definitely.
