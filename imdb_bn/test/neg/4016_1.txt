An "independent" movie that we will never forget about the back of the box, twists, adventure and a mental courage. This film makes us fooling to see Rachel Lee Cook flapping his acting role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is not going to give you anything. The story goes nicely, new or important publications to keep us interested. There are three "boring" letters for our care, forcing them to have small grains in the story back. You have reached the end, everything in the story changes and instead of helping to catch the audience, you go without any idea and more importantly, there is no interest in "Why". The director, who considered the concept of co-stars as good, came to the film without any prior experience or knowledge about making a movie. The whole piece looks like a college "art" film, which tries to hide the lack of true genius by a new genius filmmaker.
