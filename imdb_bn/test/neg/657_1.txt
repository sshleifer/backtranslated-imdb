According to Hollywood standards, this film was filmed and edited as a Hollywood movie, and so looked like a movie that went out of Hollywood's production studio. Where some of the ats stop staying away from the Hollywood standard This is the greatest movie of my life ever! I'm not kidding The story was so incredible and unreal that I could not keep my smile on the movie theater while watching this movie. I know what you're saying, "It's a horror film, it's not supposed to be a good story, but it scares you." Tell me something good, at least the bits of the movie are not even scary. It can be very full of stupid bits that cancels out the very small mystery. Acting was terrible, with the murderer's abnormalities, you see through a cage-free jackcking flashback. I got a feeling across the film that I saw something that was thought, written, produced, and directed by a high school teacher who saw a lot of pornography. Please do not watch this movie, spend $ 8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which is more valuable than your time.
