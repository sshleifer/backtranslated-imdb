Negative Chief's son has been convicted for his father's death The evil antipathy doctor ordered him to run. Then he comes back as a murdered tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "film"? If it is called as a horror movie, perhaps there was a slight bad judgment involved. And for a comedy, it's still not funny. I do not know why people make such films. I guess you should be a really stupid mood to see it. Or you might want to see the incredible "monster" tree, which gives a new dimension to a "slow death". Or maybe you want to test all the great acting skills involved. (Mrs. Kilgoor!) Or dialogue and screenplay, the year the Academy Awards was oddly neglected. <br /> <br /> "We will not try psychology on that tree? Perhaps his mother was afraid of oak trees." 2/10
