Being a fully furnished film buff with a house decorated with a furnishing, I'm a big fan of IKEA. My whole habitat, virtually, is cheap packed with brittle-grain particle-board stuff. And you know that all these stylish family items of IkeE are funny names - a booklet called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called Groundle - well, it just adds a whole euro-charm. <br /> <br /> Like the interesting names (but horribly translated) items Ikea looked at, I'd like to provide some translations in some reviews about the Swedish "Crawfervaque 3714" made. Key comment: "It's pretty cool for low budget movies, it's great to see what Hollywood budget can do!" <br />: The movie stock is painful, light pedestrians, cinematography reluctant, sound recording. Keynote: "David Linchske Saifai is set in the strange odd forest town!" <br /> <br /> This "actor" is acting for free, the story is round and tiring These ideas are ultimately attempted to exist, but are easily hypocrites and the settings (especially the inner) are filled with cylindrical and ugly wallpaper. Key comment: "The edit is done well and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that CGI studio does not have to come out of compulsory CGI effects." <br /> Translation: When you're on Scachecart When it starts to begin, it digitizes all the Macs and hides the incompleteness for a three-minute compression. <br /> <br /> I got an opportunity in this DVD because I tried to get a kid for independent films, especially those who are facing the costly and fearsome trend of science fiction. I mean, the best science fiction of all time was not realized with little or no budget, sponges and special actors. For example, Peter Fonder echo-alert-time-travel took "Idaho's transfer" to Flickr! A classic. <br /> <br /> "Kraftverk 3714" is not fit in the "carefully created, low-key, concept-based science-section" section. It consistently focuses on some characters which do not do much and do not say anything interesting. It goes round round and round. It's too long (it's coming from a major Tarkovsky fan). Worse, the concept of "reality transfer aliens" was done 40 years ago in the pastoral areas of Twilight Zone. This is not just a well-made movie - and I really wanted to be it, frustrated! <br /> <br /> However, because I was an Ikea fan, I observed a ground-demonstration. First of all, anyone shopping in Ikea knows how cute shopping cart works - four wheels multidirectal. The cart can spin a perfect 360-degree and it takes some contact to manage them as a pro, since any brilliant Ikea shopkeeper knows it. Well, I'll be disappointed, but one of the actresses of "Kurtvarovic 3714" goes to some ink-weird grocery stores in one place and what is she pushing? A multidirectional shopping cart! So, it is not an Ikea invention after all, but it is another wonderful invention from the Hei-Duo country (let's call it "takelby")!
