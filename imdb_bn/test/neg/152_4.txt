Frankie Munie sees Jason as a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built in small or big lies that most of the time it puts in trouble. However, he can not escape from his teacher and before finishing his deadline, he finished his creative writing homework. He is running a bike for the teacher to do his homework, but he pushed the car. Because he explains the situation of the terrible people (gamatti), he gives him a lift in his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his house in the car, otherwise it does not mean that Martin Wolf (jaymitt) steals it. <br /> <br /> After a few months, Jason went to a movie and saw a trailer that surprised him. Because the story of the movie is based on her homework. He said his parents but they certainly do not believe. Especially his father used words that insult him. Jason went to L. and decided to find his father to find Wolf for Jason to be a liar. Wolf denies this, Jason takes action and destroys his life. <br /> <br /> This is a short story about Big Fat Leader. Well, as a child's movie it may be light-hearted but there are some flaws that can be asked if it is possible. For example, to solve this small amount of money and to solve the problem, to go to LA with a friend, to install a telecommunication system overnight, having access to highly protected homes and offices of the filmmaker. Is it credible? It's not Well this is not a kids movie but kids that are gullible. <br /> <br /> False Big Fat offers some little pleasure to its target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fat liar for this to say a good movie. ** Out of *****
