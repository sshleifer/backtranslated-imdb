The presentation is very shabby. (My idea) is often as documentary. Michael Moore's "Documentary" - Fahrenheit 911FAR is more convincing but most of his media and political effects are there. I will wait till Saturday when I see the episode "their game of life". The IFC goes to the right of the center. I started a collection of IFC movies from the Internet for "TGTL" ***************************************************** Want to see a good documentary? Hold down the history channel or try a picture. You can not go wrong with my friends. May be wrong. In the 70's, there were ten years of rehabilitation. Or so old times you have to believe. Disco died and went on forever. When Elise died, we all are sorry
