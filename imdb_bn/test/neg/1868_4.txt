Some things just do not have to be dead. We just do not like it or do not keep coming back for more. I guess some people like to beat a dead horse The first 'Gholies' was a wonderful hit and its first sign was a better movie. The third image took a more humorous view and at this time little libraries began to welcome them. I think some of the Hollywood thinks it was a brilliant idea to revive the franchise, but the result would probably disappoint fans of previous entries. <br /> <br /> Process: Actually acting is very good for a movie. this. A silly, but fun score. Moving at a right speed Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. There is a little more conspiracy than others and at least at least try to link with yourself as the second and third type. Cons: It's not nearly as fun as the predecessor. Although it has more plot than before, it's a fantastic ridiculous one. Bad effects The original Ghoulies only exist in flashbacks and here they serve with no other tricks which are served with any other purpose than comic relief. Comedy is saying, all the attempts of humor are lame. The first movie is straight sigail, but there are many loose ends. For example, I think what did Jonathan really do with black magic? It was not spectacular in others, but the direction of this film is particularly colorful. Final Thinking: The first three 'Gholij' movies dream of bad movie lovers. This is the fourth, and so far the final sequel (let's hope), a bit of isolation. Of course there's some fun, but it's not the same. Others are also in a lower budget, but the people involved keep much more of them. Whether you are a completeist or you want to see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. Otherwise stuck with just three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
