For the worst movie in November 2004, the dance would win a Razzi (can be done overall) if it is global. When it is played poorly (acting in the show / attitude / yawning / over), no match for Hell berry Antra Mallini. Although the catwoman was in the store, it seemed like there was no microprocic dress hot actress and some action sequences, dances. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 0/10. Still, I think the movie is not worth 0. It will be negative or subdued infinity. <br /> <br /> What's the plot outline? It is a money-laundering, arrogant, full-minded gesture of a fool, a less proficient, less efficient, lofer who is considered to be an actor story. The story is so small that if there is another sentence, IMDB can ban me for writing a joke. Talking about the story? Like a bunch of super slow moving people (sorry, 2 in most cases). If you have purchased a new DVD player then do not try this movie. You will end up believing that the DVD is hit by bad shape or DVD player. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> At least he realized that there are not many dialogues in this movie, because the accent Molly and Abhishek Bacon (at least at that time) can not talk to the dialogue. So, you can sleep your way through at least movies, some annoying words in the songs of the intra-malli song. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Bollywood movies then watch this movie. Once you've tolerated this movie, you will be able to see and enjoy a Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> More than 3 hours can not be tortured!
