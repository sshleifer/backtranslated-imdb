Monsieur's mind can not be said more than Chapel's cloak, it's actually worse than that. First, Carlos Mensia is a jack ** which is fun as a basic, which is not saying much. This show contains lip spoofs of American television advertising and political issues, and Mencia's "comedic" politics insights added the lower quality of the show. Above all of it, Mencia tosses in more lame racial joke and I can count on one hand to stole Jeff foxworthy line. When Carlos receives some ridiculous smiles, in the rest of his time he spends time humiliating everyone, which exploits his own audience members. The exception of the South Park, pulled together and with Friday night stand up, this show marked the end of the glorious day at the show of Chapel, among which it was before you went to Africa for those who heard you.
