I saw "Cadishashak 2" at the age of ten, and because of the Horse Scene I am mostly sunny. I realized that the movie was empty ... I could not compare well. It's stupid and not even funny. Core cast members who did not like to star in this star, probably made the best choices that they rejected; Why, why did Chavy Chase come back? And how did Jackie Messon, Robert Stack, Diane Canon and Dan Eckorid take this swell on the world? I believe every person who is connected to this junk with his name, even this junk (eg, caterer) is ashamed of his release. So, above all, it's terrible, terrible and it's beyond anything. You avoid it like Ebola virus.
