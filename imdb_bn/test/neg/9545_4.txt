I'm the only person who thinks that the entire forensic and scenes of crime communities in the United States must hate this all-powerful slap in front of them. One Rookie Police is the first to appear in the criminal scene first, where her backup is so slow that she has time to send the baby to the person who bought the body in the local store to find a disposable camera. While returning (no other senior police, SOCO or other support for the famous Jolie - it's not New York ??) It started to rain and after standing the proven photography he stood up <br /> <br /> I know the camera name Like, because the photographs were so incredibly detailed that there is no zoom to distort the image !! The horror continues: - Not in the film (I'm afraid of the general), but in the character of Lincoln Rime. Washington has played This person, instead of a highly trained but invisible local Crime Sina test, has been a highly dedicated forensic crime scene tester for years, who has worked with a stranger police, a rookie policeman, who has come forward to look for the very clearly established sources, and before photographing them Move and thus pollute each item and DNA Pruff Make ilinke impossible is impossible. Now that bright idea was? I know that anyone will be able to suspend unbelief in a degree, but those who are saying this picture, the intelligentsia must completely disassociate their ability to feel that the film is trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I gave this picture 4/10 for the great acting of Washington and Miss Jolie's lip, which is the only item to suspend my disbelief!
