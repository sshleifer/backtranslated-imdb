Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent film, but I have some problems with this film. After all, I do not blame the actors of this movie, but less or less, I have a problem with the script. Also, I realized that this movie was created in the 1930s and people wanted to escape from reality, but the script considered Anne Soren's character weak. He stepped back in the scooter and I felt as if he could end up with Paul Kelly's character. She really cared for her and her family and did something for her and she gave him to the end of the blue Hamilton, who was out of my opinion only for a good time. Paul Kelly's character, though an activist is a man of honesty and really loved Kiti (Anne Sorn) in opposition to Neil Hamilton, although he loved him so much, I could not see the depth of his love for his character. The production quality was great, but the script could use a little work.
