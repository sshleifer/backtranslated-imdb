It's not terrible but what's the waste ... Laugee Gaga, Bad Music, Poor Drawing and Animation ... <br /> <br /> About the impressive number of animators and interlists in this movie (from, hum ... a hundred around the world Hundreds of different studios? Come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie!) I wonder if credit = one person is drawing one! Line rough, 3D work is inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this movie) but the backgrounds are fixed. The story is rather stupid, away from BD's precise cleverness, and clearly targeted international audiences. Distribution of a movie around the world does not mean taking a world-wide for a simple-minded person ... During a challenging time, a cultural object is even more interesting, even if it's a foreign movie (even if it's French in this case) it's worse!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some new stuff is doing well (the wolf likes the character, sometimes, with the explanation of the stone, but this is not cool) References frustrating (music, SMS-note), even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird called short message service: no one knows you imagine?). But, hey, it's a M6 / TPS production with some silencing deones ... kindly. <br /> <br /> Astricians have spoken irregularly and obelisks too. Gaudírics may be great (like book) but he very well relates to a "good man" love relationship (with a reluctant female character). In fact, only Vikings (excluding wizards) are fun. Too much action, not enough laughter. The best part of the movie is credit. No music, but some are still there. BD Style. Well, definitely, Asterix is ​​not created for removal!
