'It seems as if you have the power to suck your brain right from your head.' -Patty <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paty (Christina Rixie) is a satirical teen girl, disturbed with her very average-average small city. Until a woman is kidnapped, she gets disturbed and finds what she believes to be perceived from somewhere in the poor lady. Now, with his valuable cat 'DC' And an inactive FBI agent (Doug Doug) will find him. <br /> <br /> That Daryan Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty stupid and humorous is often almost flat. But there are some talents in this genre. Dogle E. Dog Cool was good in Ranunsea. His acting as a 'army' was really fun. Here he was destroyed as an explosive FBI agent. Although he has a good view when he imitates the cat. Patrick's father Makhail Meikan! His character will always be the most understanding guardian to live. This poor man has crushed his expensive cigar, arrested for lifting his kitty, and getting bitten by his nippy wife, and still does not get angry with her daughter for all her troubles. I was like that of my old man. The only true performance is Cristina Rixie. She is not as annoying as a patty entertainer, but her sometimes very bad conversation pulls down her performance. You can recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Avvvy Loves Raymond), old lady of the wings and Chester Cliffs in this picture. This is a movie which all these actors probably want to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I can not actually recommend the 1997 Daren Beat. Some young people (under 8 years of age) can enjoy a little, but others should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good Christina rixie film, I would recommend Adams Family Values, Opposite Sex or Sleepy Olow. If you are behind a fun family movie, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
