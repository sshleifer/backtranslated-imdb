Due to the time spent in Albany in New York, I raised this issue, I knew some people in the movie and I started to do it with the opportunity. In the efforts of the comedians, the lam, the compulsory girl-girl scene is ill, the plot is unknown, the act is in my worst, and even started to give me special effects. I understand that this is a very low budget movie created by a small independent company, but if you're going to flick a science-fierce horror with giant bugs, then giant bugs will not be completely incredible. People want to see the giant bug. That's half fun to have fun. And if you're going to make the giant bugs totally unbelievable, you can get the actors to correct at least the tongue-in-cheek ("You are stupid! It's not you! You have their stunts holding Doubles!"). Be prepared to waste the two hours of your life that you will never be able to get back.
