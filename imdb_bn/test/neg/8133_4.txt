Julian Hern√°ndez is certainly an attractive and curated personality on screen. In fact, his character mostly carries the whole film, or what's appropriate for it. The problem is that no one comes except his cheek Paul (played by Marisa Pettero) and Paul Lacquer (as a comedy / date / boyfriend for some characters). Hernandez 30-some Cuban traders, and unknown sex, who came to LA and got the job of creating a gay documentary. In the process of filling a group of gay people while searching for the subject, he came out ... but much more. For even more than 88 minutes, the film has been clearly stretched and paded with devices in various film-schools, most of which only blocklessly block the story (which is not too much to start with) or directed towards overall amateur-drugs. . <br /> <br /> No shame, because there's a love story here, and the last three minutes, when Hernandez's Sebastian finally clicks on the rich West Hollywood runner (with Lonnie Henderson's nicely) and they have some sexy vivacious kissing Share, it works even though that came before. But we are not really worried about any other character or their situation: why would there be a Eurotrase affair for the handsome Danta boyfriend? He will not And do not allow me to start "rules" for friend dating of Sebastian's friend - I do not know, no men, hell, no intelligent person, duration, will apply such restrictions on myself or others. And please tell me Sebastian gets a leaky banana (which naturally shamsu, right?) Gets stuck on his butt and he needs to go to the doctor to remove him? <br /> <br /> I saw Hernandez receiving the award as a "short" for this movie - it's likely to be the same. Saying all this - I am looking forward to seeing Hernandez again on screen, with a well-scripted comedy, more assured.
