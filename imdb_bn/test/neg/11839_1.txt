All right, lets get one thing straight, I love dinosaur movies, even worse ones. So let the mind move forward with this. "Raptor" is not really a real movie, it's actually a film to be composed from "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Bid of Primacy Spasci - Kornosaur 3". Eric Roberts has some new footage like a sheriff, and his Busty Sidekick is confused, scared, or trying to express on the psychological scale anyway (badly), but how can they react to something illustrated some years back? . The producer (yes, Roger I'm talking about you!) Even went to the lengthy rental of "Carnosaur" to play a part of the game so that deadly death scenes can be reused! So this film is cheaper cheap. See the original movie, there is no Oscar winner, but they have some of the merit and entertainment values ​​but avoid "rapper". Oh, this is the most vulgar sex scene to run for about 10 minutes! Do you think they are trying to pad while running?
