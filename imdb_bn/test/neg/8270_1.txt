Wahhh manna is terrible !! <br /> <br /> In such quarters, the Canadian film does not give a bad name or a name. OK, to be fair, I think most Canadian films give bad names to Canadian movies. <br /> <br /> (The most wonderful couple in the history of film), the most annoying thing is editing and movie motion. It's like a drunken drunken drunk <br /> <br /> Best wishes to see melodious melodies. He is the only thing I keep watching. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has been interrupted. <br /> <br /> Although it is a bad Canadian movie night, it feels good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie? Doane? The only good point (very bad they did not have their ideas to hold the camera for more than a glimpse at a time) <br /> <br /> The Canadian Hall of Stunning Movies
