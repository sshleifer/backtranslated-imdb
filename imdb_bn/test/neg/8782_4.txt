Lone Ranger's unchanged sources. It shows who he was and how and why he was a ranjar <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - to review and introduce Line Ranger for the audience of the 1980s. Though the problem was off the bat. In the studio, Clonanton Moore (Original Ranger) has been ordered to stop watching Lone Ranger anywhere. It led to a nasty little war made in the title. I refused to see this movie because of how Murray was treated. They also hire the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spielsebie was very handsome and muscular, but there was absolutely no charisma and just could not work. Actually acting in his full voice was redubbed by another actor! Also its closed screen antics (public drunkenness and human beating) does not help issues. Acting aside, the scripts are dull and slow. Also the Ranger itself does not appear until an hour! The film was very violent for PG when there were some allegations. But I do not think it was bad. Here are some (very few) things done - photography was really nice; Michael Horses was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is very funny like Wilheln and when Lone Ranger finally sees (The Glitter from the William Tale Overture Soundtrack) It's really encouraging. But, above all, it's an annoying and terrible attempt to bring Lone Roger back. It's easy to see why the bombs. A 4 - for most photography.
