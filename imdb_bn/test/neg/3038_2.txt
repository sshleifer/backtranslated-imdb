In any way, a film must watch the film in the original WASC. In fact, if it is not cool in the first 25 minutes, there is no logical reason to look at it. The remake takes them 25 minutes and turns them into a tiny rain hit in the middle 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> Now I do not have anything against PG-13 films, but the trend around them is getting faint. When you see the PG-13 rating, you expect a movie filled with false fear, teen t.v. Or music is big, and a plot that has been used several times. Do not even ask for gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it is not good to compare the original WASC and the remix, but I think it needs to be done because the whole idea of ​​the new is based on the beginning of the original. The feelings that are felt through the first film do not appear in any way. Even with amazing settings or great use of lightning. No tension, mystery, thrills ... nothing. The film becomes very slow before it becomes a little more interesting, and it appears when it is unfamiliar. Chasing sequence is probably the best part of the film because there is at least one feeling "What next?" But that's it. The conditions that Climax has set up are expected, annoying and lack of doubt. For the most important view of the movie, it is essentially a suspense for the most important scenes and is essentially a cool hiking. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that this is a PG-13 horror movie but if you respect the original. Why is it the most important situation to change? Children do not have to live! After the end I thought this movie was in vain. So baby sitter playing a cat and mouse with a cat ... what is this? Then, the order of the hospital was simple fool. And worst of all, it means that there might be a sequel way. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Comilla Bell movie. He is delivering a clever, credible performance. Her role will be rewarded for her thousands of teenage fans, though her best projects are to be chosen. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. We will be encouraged to support any film for some people to support the genre. I do not agree If we ignore movies like WASC, the producers of Horror Movies will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, false scares filled flame do not flicks. <br /> <br /> Watch the original instead of the original "non-stranger call" because it's better than the first 25 minutes full (unprotected) repetition.
