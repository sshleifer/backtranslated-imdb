I hate to be very critical, but this one was really bad. I like the Belvedown brothers, I just want to maintain more talent among them. I like the general plot, but not as much 'tried' was as concerned about the performance of the quality and not doing 'doing' properly. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from the whole thing was feathers. He reminded me of Smithy Trek from Dmitry Valten (Jeremy Roberts, I believe) 6: the invisible country. Just without hair. <br /> <br /> If you have a MVP program on your Hollywood video and are really trying to get your money, but you have chosen one of three MVP movies. It's worth it for some laughs. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive special effects on the whole show is the word of Stephen Belvedin's rifle fire. I think it gives you a bit more on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
