This is the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever seen (worse than Deadly Ground and Fire Down Echo-Piffell). I'll start with good points ..., it's got a stylish look for a DTV movie and there are wonderful scenes ... it! The story can not really go anywhere, it's just like an array of pieces of good stages, so sagle shoots are bad boys (body count is easily found in his bloodline!) The plot is irrational complex and confusing, which do not forget you guys who are good and bad. Acting (I'm using a short-term term) I can always accept medium-sized, normal wristwash expression and wood acting, but others, especially the brights, are quite frightening. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why is it bad boys later? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he said, that the store I could choose was the worst movie! (My hand was damaged until I started catching him) <br /> <br /> However, I still see the half-dead dead or I'm still going to kill and I do not go back for more humiliation in my shop, but they It can not be any other way. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip - it gives me a Sudanese desire for half a dozen aspirin. <br /> <br /> All this is his best in Segal! The person who earns about 100 ebs and it seems to be good, he is a person who will never stop, he will now retire leisurely! And go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My rating is 2/10 (1 point for the scenery)
