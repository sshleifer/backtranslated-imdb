This documentary is rife with the problem. <br /> <br /> How proud is a documentary about your own family? I think you are interesting in the subject. I was bored with it. This is not an impressive story to me, and I do not know why you thought it. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that it means, but I want to say: Most people in this movie are not just interesting. And that's okay, not everybody is beautiful. But your camera technique, to put the lens in their mouths so you can not be embarrassed by their unpleasant look, because it's filling you 47 TVs, it's not enjoyable. I had to hand over my hand for half the time, I saw myself Martin, shining, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth. Actually, I'm not trying to be inhuman, but I'm pulling the camera again so that the strangers are not breathing in my mouth. <br /> <br /> This "film" camera works rank amateur level This is a camera work you can see from family Picnic with everyone from Camcoder. Unfredible framing, unstable, even static shots are also undoubtedly done. Try it a little bit, if you're going to do this for a living. <br /> <br /> I can not honestly say what is the big deal on this issue.
