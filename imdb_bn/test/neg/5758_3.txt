This was bad enough. I really hope there is no signal. Perhaps this piece of plots can tell you how to leave, that it is open for probability, but not, it really is not. <br /> <br /> There really is nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was fairly good, but there was nothing to write at home. <br /> <br /> There were some hot babes in it, especially Elina Madison and Alexander Ford, but the people had nothing to see. PG-13, definitely an R. It tells you that the slashher direction was less than spectacular. The crown of the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Temer fear scary.
