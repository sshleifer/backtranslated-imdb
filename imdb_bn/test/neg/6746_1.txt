I am still trying to determine what was the aim of this film: 1) How to show stupid, unorganized, unusual and proud police (I can certainly add special adjectives here, but I think my statement on this is clear). 2) How should we see how a curved psychological crew does not know himself, what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Until the culprit answers, whether the criminal will repeatedly ask the same stupid questions to show whether an immediate detective will solve a case? 4) Or to show that any 90-minute film ingredient can still be called a movie? <br /> <br /> It was such a movie, anyway - did not disappoint me. From the first 10 minutes I thought that this film will not be nominated for the Best Film Award, and surprisingly enough? This was consistent across the whole time. Was it valuable enough to wait to see how stupid it would be and how it would end? And I was not frustrated there. <br /> <br /> Was it waist full time? Yes Which raises your question ?? Why did I see it? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought it was a great candidate for it, but unfortunately I had too much coffee ??
