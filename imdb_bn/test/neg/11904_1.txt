I saw this movie on the TV show and it was incredibly awful that I could not switch it. The faint screenplay writer has removed every single piece of intelligence and intelligence from the story of Oscar Wilde. It's very important because performing terrible, clich√©d-camera-working and closing music will destroy anything similar to any kind of decent script. The worst action comes from Patrick Stewart, who is known as the most hammy, talented, little lip-Shakespeare ghost. "Get out of here!" Like a pantomime villain, he shouted at one point. The real horror movie and why it is wonderful because Stewart could call for it, she broke her reputation by unexpected pieces like this and XMen.
