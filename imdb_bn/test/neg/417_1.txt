The uncertainty of the plot has been mentioned by several commentators, especially in the difficulties that French McCannas could have used to suffer, and some of its calculations were impossible, including Langdon. Make every thread decipher in minutes. McKenna is branded; After a few seconds he was ordering, and after a few minutes, he is running (literally) about the operation charge - in real life, he will be disappointed. And, naturally, like the thrillers, do not kill the murderer heroes, his only cripple explains that he was not on the dead list, as he shot all other innocent defendants. I have always used the Independence Day as a symbol of the real horror film (US President Commander Jet Plane and Alienas of Heaven Hack), and this effort closes. For such an incredible movie, Angels and Demons have an outstanding number of expected events. When did not he get lucky to get his award in Volkswagen? I cried, "You will swell". Who does not know that the heroine was going to find Lab's body? Who's not the Buddy Spot? Technically, the film was terrible. The conversation was clearly obviously unknown, when the next church opponent in Rome was deaf music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The romance of Rome was like the Vatican - this is an achievement, because I'm sure that the Vatican officials were sure that they wanted to shoot this race inside and around St. Peter - and internally believed. Rome is a magic place, and I fleetingly enjoy watching it.
