I really do not think of creative ideas based on these movies, but seriously. This film does not have a coherent part of the game. It seems to be trending, buy rights and then create a movie that makes the audience free to do whatever they want. This slaughterhouse is almost entertaining because you know that you are hiding behind the lack of skills and money control (not yours) that allow you to do it. Play a game, or hire someone and please make a real movie, or stand in a boxing ring and your butt will be handed over to you as you do not claim. <br /> <br /> Wow, 9 lines are text and I'm done. Sorry, you have to add bug blah
