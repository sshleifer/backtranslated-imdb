I will leave this wonderful wonderful movie to my Bitterrs, slap in this amazing wonderful movie and make kittens, and just say I thought it. The great thing about this site is that you always get different opinions, and all the ways, to find them. Do not have any film you will come out of the film with. For me, those who saw through simplicity and shenanigans have my money. One died in perfect condition by pointing to two grand moments related to Pacino. Meetings and airports. That's another, well, what a waste of time. Completely. Doing the same thing over over the pasino, he has served well by adopting performance around five addicts in his protégé levels. Everyone always says, but this movie can be so good. Sure they all can be But really most of them should not have been created. Including this one.
