This show bothered me. It takes slots near the night that can be stored for fresh prince or George Lopez. Even the whole house and Rozen They are all better than improving home. First off, Mother Jill bothered me a lot. She is an oversensitive whiny baby and I really despise her. Brad is a fat toe, and he's very annoying. And younger brother, I do not even know his name! I do not always see him! This is probably not the fault of the actor, but perhaps it's authors. The team is just a stupid donkey Although Jill is definitely my favorite, I do not like any of them. The only reason I gave these stupid shows three stars is that the star goes to the stars. Like middle class, he is still a painful younger brother, but an older brother, and I like his funny character. Another star goes ali. As cruel friend, his character is liked. Other than Randy and Al, this shows sucks.
