In this film, Gary Oldman plays a defense attorney who was formerly a prosecutor. He is a little troubled, but instead of a metaphor or literal monster, less or less less than playing regular people. The funny thing is, he does not quite pull it off. I guess you can get quite normal from Kevin Bacon was quite unclear. In the park, the scene was very long way through many ways. Wonderful sexual scenes with Oldman and Karen Young seem to have come from a different movie, although the rest of the time was fixed by Miss Young. This picture enjoys the oddity of trying to cover the forecourt. And fail Do not disturb.
