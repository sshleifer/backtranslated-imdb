I actually liked some things about this game. I loved the first person's perspective and we were willing to have that choice in the first three games. There is nothing to see the monster going around your face. The graphics were not really bad, but it was just a shooter though I liked more things to communicate with. The music was fine. What I hated was the movement's smoke and goal was total pain. The story was too long for words and with no originality there was more of the same old thing. The inability to save was awkward !!! Some of us have a life and want to save to finish the game later. I sucked kind of arms, too. This game is fun for a while, but this is just the first three and only good, if you just want to shoot stuff. I suggest it for the first person playing novelty, but that's about it. Play it at your own risk.
