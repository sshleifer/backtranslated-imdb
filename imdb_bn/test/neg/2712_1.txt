This is the 80's filmmaker's misuse, unless you are a pre-teen girl. Depending on a big name like Madonna, a story line that physically attacks one's intelligence and humor which is appropriate for a nursery school. If ever there is a doubt that I think this annoyance of a film clearly shows the complete lack of acting talent Madonna and I feel very embarrassed by her. The only thing I can not believe is that they let the director move closer to another movie. Madonna often publishes a movie like a child with a child like a doll and often speaks like a child. It is painfully evident that the only reason for this movie was that Madonna was a big name in the pod music. Pop star does not see this great move. Stay away from all costs!
