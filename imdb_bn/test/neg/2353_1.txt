Hitcoak is a great director. Ironically, most of the time I wasted time watching movies. I fully admired the Hitachi on visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> The first positive. Hitako invented the concept of camera investigation. Curious eyes that are capable of keeping information or searching. This is not a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Hitacho thriller and Chase made the movie quite beautiful. She has a profitable style and always thinks of the audience. They give their regular thrill, humor regularly jolts and regular shocks. In short, he predicted the audience's original needs and played them like a fiddle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of people are mostly fools. Food, sex, danger thrill and little comedy. Hitcoak meets these requirements on the screen, without the exception of food, which judges her size, she closes the screen. <br /> <br /> It is scary for the viewers to snatch most of their films. Hitachi's camera work and visual grammar are mostly commonplace. His expertise in making simple pieces of stories about how his films can be kept visible, intelligence of his camera work, and his skills to create task-action set pieces. <br /> <br /> So to "Sabotur" This is a light heart romp in the "39 steps" vein. It jumped from the sequence in sequence, until it ends in piece set of Hitachou final law. <br /> <br /> At an emotional level, the relationship with Rabbit Donut and Madeleine Carroll can not be compared to "39 steps". Therefore the entire story lacks a certain power. Plot easily depends on the new scene, rumbles like a machine. And new scenes only bring us closer, because it is not a threat that police flees from the police from the hero, his move to stop the villains from plots or sabbatical plots. <br /> <br /> The usual hiccocos have logic errors. For example, by handcuffs, a person frees himself by using a car fan belt, etc. (why does he not move away from the car? Surely he is not limited to handcuffs? After all he can swim!) <Br> <br /> If you want a 40-plus Hitler campaign wars, I would suggest you to see a "foreign journalist". They both make a great ending with naughty cheezing movies, but "foreign reporter" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, spills off rips nicely in Spielberg's "minority reports". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Some good piece pieces. Still, there is nothing to sink your teeth.
