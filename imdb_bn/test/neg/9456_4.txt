Sek !! What we have here is a mess. A lot of a mess as a painfully dull, half-assed excuse for the exploitation. One and only brought by you, JG "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same from Moonshine Mountain. Doctor Gore, formerly known as W. Shady, I think, is inspired by some Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The dead Mr. Patterson also acted as a hearty scientist / plastic surgeon in this joke, who recently lost his wife in a car accident and was madly sad, the fact that the next step is to kill countless women, then the perfect companion is "gathered" You can loot some graves for body parts to do. It will not be easy, but Greg is thankful to Greg his friend, hand in hand and hand for moral support. <br /> <br /> If the evidence is needed then some people will not have the goal, here, the gang. This Patterson Hyde clearly did not give directions to a business, which is very low, well ol 'H. Following G. in the footsteps of Gore's master. I did not see any Gour movie that simply refused to give a single reason to see the flat-out viewer. Even holes in the boring are boring. It's almost ridiculous at times, but it's impossible to know whether it's deliberate. I choose "no". <br /> <br /> Charlotte shot in North Carolina (California Ack massacre house), perhaps, in a 3-digit budget by a person, as it may not have, which was probably realized for a drive-in trash, so maybe our good ol 'JG will have to give a break, I mean, he tried (I guess) which can be said for maximum, and this film is a better budget for the big budget The hero of the heroes throws out these theaters in any theater, though, I realize that it is not saying too much. Besides, Doctor Gore Patterson's previous failure, has improved in the Electric Chair, so it is quite possible that he had improved his craft during that time, he did not die, so it's probably not all terrible, especially DVDs compared to other movies, how to make a doll, So what's hell, check it out. 4/10
