For an indie film this is probably better than 3 out of 10, but in general, it only gets 3. The effects are not terrible and at least some adults play an adult role in their children. indy low budget horror films do not The acting was very woody, but at least they were a good "display" than some movie in the shoestring budget section. It impressed a lot inside a building than a friend's basement. Completely plot is not the worst. It is a resident of Evil Rip attack an evil corporation attacking a small city and makes an outbreak zombies of people. I might have liked to have seen animals of another kind than the big Baddie just to be another "super" zombie. I try not to write spoilers but one of these reviews will be so warned !! Spoiler alert !!! Only a few kastamai not only to tackle the past jumbira (ekaiguli are recycled over and over, but at least 5 people playing them). But one of the plot twists did not really fly with me. The deputy corporation who goes inside turns out to be a payroll. He killed one of the other employees in cold blood and then he met the officer's bad guy while talking about cleaning the net. The deputy only showed us that he is a real bad person and he can clean it (like killing all living witnesses) there is no problem. But then after 2 seconds, he is helping them. কোনও বাস্তব "হৃদয় পরিবর্তন" আবেগ বা কিছু ছিল না যা আমাকে মনে করিয়ে দেয় যে এই খারাপ লোকটি মাত্র কয়েক মিনিট আগে একজন নিরপরাধ লোককে হত্যা করতে গিয়েছিল এবং তারপরে প্রত্যেককে তাদের ত্রাণকর্তা হওয়ার কোনো সমস্যা খুঁজে বের করার বিষয়ে কথা বলা হয়নি। There was no event or nothing to buy me to buy this. If you are a fan of low-budget flicks worth watching, otherwise you will not enjoy this.
