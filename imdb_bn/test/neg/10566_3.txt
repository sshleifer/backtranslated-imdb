A supernatural animal cross-country on Earth and soon its laser rays close the eyes of almost all people (his goal is not severely stopped) to fill the gun, and then his soft claw with which he wants to tear and the people eat spleen. ! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll give it some points for some fun at some time. I actually enjoyed the stupid ray gunfire at the beginning and later enjoyed some of the effects of the above effects. However, when the giant provides the only true entertainment moment of the movie, it does not help, and he does not have a screen for a large part of the film's ongoing time. Acting across this is just terribly terrible and amateur and our lead hero Sheriff Cinema film is very irrational to bagging very hot chick. I also need to close points for copying from different programs in 1955. When the monster is not on a rage, the nightbust becomes very dust and eventually his attacks become repetitive and expected even when they get less fun. See it back with the 1951 Thing and see a giant in the loose film by creating distinction, plot and detailed attention and rock formation.
