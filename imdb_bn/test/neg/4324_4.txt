Perhaps Lon Chanie Jr. supports the weakest film in the Kharis series, despite the presence of John Carradine (mistaken concept as Egyptian High Priest) and George Zuko (as his predecessor, is concerned with a bad case of Parkinson's disease). Famous animals - if it was indeed under the bandage, its contribution was as good as the least! It's a visible within 60 minutes itself, I guess, but the quality is drastically lower than the two previous entries, and the end result is strictly regular and not memorable. The only interesting feature here is that the female lead Princess Anaka is considered to be a resurrection, she mentioned a big deal in the previous movie, but did not really see it.
