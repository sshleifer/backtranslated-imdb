It was revealed in the first 25 minutes that the authors really wanted to make a feature length movie, and perhaps they certainly enjoyed the whole process, but then it seemed that it needed a suitable plot! If they can do the best, the 3 worst characters enter the real world and have 'all kinds of fun careers' but they have to live well! I could not laugh once, and the whole "Baron Munchuson / Time Bendits Adventure Adventures" was going in the middle, very poor! Convaluted, conrived and very loose It seemed like a trip stop to a decision that they could think that it might 'drag' it to a feature. <br /> <br /> To cover the finishes of the pores, such as the characters of the royal Vassi, the writers were required to write them, Jeff William and Mary and the era of filling in sub-stories / time themselves. If he can do this, then why they did not write to themselves alone - dua ?? And the myth of the myths? What was that for? What was the point I mean? Did he do it, and we've heard anything else about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is, when I like the series, it is a sick thinking, seemingly inspired project. Keep this way, the plot was so poor that if we did not already know the letters (and there was a certain loyalty to see me as a fan), and we only relied on the story, it would have been flat in his face! Best it went straight to the video, and will not be made in the first place at worst! Or maybe that should be the other way round ?? Really awesome ....
