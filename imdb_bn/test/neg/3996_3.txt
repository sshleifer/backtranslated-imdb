I was initially interested in this movie, after reading a summary and seeing some interesting screenshots, and the promise was for the horror movie for the Dario Argento Style. Of course, I must say that the movies of Argentina were not consistent at times, and some of them seem to blend in with a vague linking plot by affecting some of the pieces that are visible visually. <br /> <br /> Since Argentina has been credited as a writer, I would say, I'm not really surprised. Even when his masterpieces are tested, while at the same time displaying the same tendency to string in related scenes for casual effects at the same time. However, Suspicius also had the benefit of a single protagonist and a clear opponent, as well as the scenes contributed to the last phase. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the church has nothing in between. There is no main character, no playwright; Without it there is no real plot to speak, and there is no cross-index, no measurement, no emptiness and no solution. It's a complete hollow, incoherent job that seems to be sitting in Argentina, 'Hey, it will apparently create an interesting scene ... let's do it!' The picture is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> This can be interesting at the beginning, and the Sovi direction is excellent, I must say. The ingredient is not to blame because it is compulsory as much as possible. However, this good aspect pays attention to the terrible failure of the script and there is absolutely no idea in it. The attempt of central integrator plot is nothing more than the theft of Prince of the film Prince of Darkness. Events will happen entirely because the scripts want them, and the responses to those events are completely impossible. The story is damaged continuously after a point of flow, simply because there is no ability to suspend the mistrust; It's very funny. There are many practical errors that make it very embarrassing that it has become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it is more artistic and has been educated in different works, it may be cold or black. If it has been fleshed out in an actual solidarity details, it might have been gripping. But it was not anymore. It operated best confusing and, occasionally, mad. Plot is not turned on but followed. The letters are almost forgotten and deliberately changed. No argument is ever implemented in any situation. It may have been scary or interesting, but the kind of feeling that makes more effort towards a photographer ... much more <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More styles than substances It's the worst Argentinian style, and it's strong support for normal criticism.
