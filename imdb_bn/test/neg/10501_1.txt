So, this is probably the most movie movie you will see. It's with "krebbons" and "Southern Consolation", but if you have a bad movie fan like you, then this film torture will make you enjoy most of the year. Why does the camera make old-school Kung Fu sound when it zooms? Why is that random guy stuff a Nascar Memorial Plate in his bag? And whatever he is? Why are they playing hawk after death? what is this? Highlanders? Dracula McCloud? Who care! Just smile it. No continuation of this movie, no plot, nothing, really. Ron Hall's passion is always close to the range. When he is sad, he is happy when he is confused. The rest of the paper bags can not work on their way. The special ("small bus" Kinda special) effect is placed randomly, and is not required. If most of the scenes are decorated in a table, then it is equipped with a table. Mail Novak has AUDACITY to stop the camera for its line, and it's not even edited. They just keep filming. In fact, half of the film does not even have the film. It's 1/2 film, 1/2 hands on Sony hands. For most films, they seem to have left their boom mike in the house. There are no holes in this movie, it's a confusion and a mental pain mine field! But oh I love it! Thank you Ron for the cinematic hatred. I went out and bought it, because it is very funny fun. ($ 1.99 in Amazon, and I hasten it!) <br /> <br /> "I have a weapon! I have a weapon! I have a weapon!"
