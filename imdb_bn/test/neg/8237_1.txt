This movie reeks. No money, no acting, nothing. I was caught in the late night show of 3 late and I was forced to comment on it. This movie has nothing to suggest it. I can not believe that it has never been released on American television! None of this film can do their work outside of paper paper. Lam's comedy tries to fall flat on their face, special effects contain a worm-like handpuff "monster" ... I can not tell you how this product is rock-down. It looks like it could cost $ 50,000 for the shoot, but it could only be 16 mm and it's probably a warm guess! However, I quickly lost interest and had to sit permanently to see "Mattlock" instead of finishing it. This is how the film is cutting !!!
