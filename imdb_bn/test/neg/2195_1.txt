When, when, would Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I do not believe that people actually consider this film a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system can ever retain intelligence like an intelligent scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you actually try to use it for a while then you will become blurred. <br /> <br /> It can not be done as it did to "tracing" humans. Network security will prevent that happening alone. The original stroke logging was humorous to say the least. <br /> <br /> About the software that was installed, any system administrators will be able to install such complex software until it is installed in the production system, test, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the worst part of the movie was "Virus". No viruses operating on any operating system will work on any other system. And a few seconds for a virus that could take a mainframe, that's just the beggar's belief. Superuser access that does not require an open remote connection, which allows system files to be deleted. <br /> <br /> I could go but I would not be bothered. <br /> <br /> A porno is a good idea to plot out that junk this pile.
