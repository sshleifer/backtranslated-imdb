It was actually a pretty dull movie. I think the problem with a French horror film, French fear or something would be easy because this movie just was not that awesome. Seeing special effects with Mummy's ghosts, it seemed that they were not included in this film, although some keep them on production later, because the actors react to them. <br /> <br /> Plots are just monkeys, which are the opposite of the real story. I think it was based on a French TV series, where it had to be moved to a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break it multiple times. (So ​​how people stole Mona Lisa!) From the 1960's version of the movie, lovers and police officers gathered together and tried to trick the giant. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure Mummy was supposed to be a bad guy. During the movie he killed two guards, but he just wanted to get the next life.
