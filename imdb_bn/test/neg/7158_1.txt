Theatics and drama included in the film are fantastic, but far from the facts and difficult to study. Dr. While quoting Baughan, where the documentary Marmen attemptes to connect with Mary Magdalin, then Bovan explains that it is used for literature (not the story of that time) for historical images. In fact, he said that he does not believe that Mary Magdalene Tabluet's Marianne statue is a statue. He also commented in his public letter that he did not want to use his words for this documentary, but sought information about Philips (literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> So, what we are here is a director who took a clip for the fourth century of Phillip Fantasy, and especially used it to support the Orthodox inscription of the 1st century. A very sad stretch and Dr. Bovan has linked Jesus / Mary Magdalene as "science fiction" - this documentary should be properly labeled.
