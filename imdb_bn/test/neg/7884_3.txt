A movie about a French girl is raped by street hoodlums. The rape scene itself is shot in all its details with all the male and female organs and their interactions are clearly visible in the camera. In a fit of anger, the victim keeps his friend (or his brother?) Gun, shot him and goes with arms. He met this prostitute, who saw his pump shot down, they got up and looked at Paris. In a continuous series of mad, meaningless and wild killings, girls enjoy more murders than before. A poor guy gets **** hole shots. Many murders have good levels of sex thrown. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the most violent, I would say that the personal savings of Ryan probably had more violence. Violence is what you are looking for, but there are many more movies here. And if it is sex then you would recommend one of those XXXs. <br /> <br /> I went to visit this movie because the media preached it. The film itself is not a big deal, some violence like handheld cameras and sexual shots I am surprised to see the 15-year-old film of 15 years of film in Sweden, they will be able to watch XXX movies.
