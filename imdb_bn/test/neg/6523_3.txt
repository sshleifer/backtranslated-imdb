I did not like this movie. I hope this will be like the 10th state. I was frustrated when I did not discover it. I found it just simple nervous. The acting was bad, the incredible characters and time were jumpy to jump. If I just want to see the mood running around crazy dude, I'm sure this theme has better movies. I can not believe I wasted my time at this time.
