Tran is a famous critics who praised a Dubbo movie <br /> <br /> This picture is a wonderful story where a lover sells his love for a boyfriend, because he wants money to save his mother and also gets forgiveness for her. LOL <<br> <br /> This movie is crying <br /> <br /> The entire first half keeps an eye on romance, comedy which fails to work, flashing shock but the entire second non A mess and climax <br /> <br /> Aditya Dutta's direction is bad, music is the norm of Himesh. <br /> <br /> Imran plays a serious role, but his dress, song. The path of walking through the trick is similar to that of his previous movie. Unsatisfied with Gita Vasra, Ashmit Patel failed to believe that she was very good at this moment and then Mithun took some screen time and he is right, but being forced to break into a song, Ranjit is okay
