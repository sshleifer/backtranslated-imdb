Firstly, after finishing this photo last night, the first thing that came to my mind was "why the title of 8MM 2?", Because I have clearly seen the first and what is it to do with the first film plot? The same thing was the same that the couple had to go into pornography and it was not necessary in the plot, because eventually you will see that I will not loot, it did not understand in any sense <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his partner are in Hungary and While swimming in the neighborhood, a woman noticed that she is very attractive, so when they see her in the club, they decide to have fun Takes. And there is a steamy threesome. But diplomats make pictures very intensively when sending them all because they fear that it can go to the public and make their career dangerous, they pay the person who sent the picture, scared the diplomat and kills the people " "Leading to a murder case. She and her fiacee girls decided to find out their affair with them, but they did go further and get darker as they got more into themselves. <br /> <br /> What could be a good thriller, turned out to be a vague and good thought movie, which was sad. As I said, there is really no relation to the title, so do not fall for it. This is not just a sexual thrill that gives no idea, but it is good only for that night, because most of these movies where it is very close to indecent, can also be labeled as a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
