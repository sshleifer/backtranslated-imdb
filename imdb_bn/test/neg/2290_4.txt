Not as bad as some people ... It is an unauthorized bond film and a re-establishment of "Thunderball", written by Kevin McClory (co-producer of "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very funny, a wonderful bond-villain from Maria Brandoui, Kim Basing and Barbara Carrows are like "real" bond-girls, Rooney Etkinson and really great Edward Fox, who really refreshes the "M" role. Actually, the whole film is refreshing and gives some new emotions. Shawn Connery It's once more confident and charming, without it she looks a little too old. But okay, he was interested in seeing the original bond and in this role one more time. The locations are also generally - Bahamas, France etc. The only issue of genuine failure is the music score, "Never Say Never Again", the song O.K., but the theme song is absent. One by one, the comic and stupid Roger Moore like "Moonraker" is an excellent effort to make a difference from the movie. If there was only one story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and did not really need a remix
