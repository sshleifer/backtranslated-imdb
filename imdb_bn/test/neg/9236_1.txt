The populist process of Ultolicker exposes itself to all the titles from the worst to the best. He does not take any care of the art (or there is no source), that forces all those people to think that they have been misled by his movies. The problem is, the effort is very clear, and the facts arise with all the intelligent and overwhelming inclinations involved, this effort fails badly. <br /> <br /> In this "Turkish" movie (who knows that the original or original was made, since it seemed to me very Hollywood), Altylokar is trying to be a bit tarantino. (Mr. Teertino, if you read this, watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) He does not use the subtle steps he can use, what he does uses the extreme things and he becomes helplessly stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü is just as pleasing as a forensic guy with cow's hair. I'm telling him personally to feel and feel about this movie. Because I really found an insulting role for him. Damete Ewegerva was also uncomfortable to suppress her genetics, and did nothing other than fraudulently showing everything. Another special stupid view of this movie was the 100% faulty speed setting. Things need to be taken gradually, the continuous stream of views. And at other times, it slowly slows down slowly and slowly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Even such a move is not half the frustration of what he has done in this movie. At first he can not learn how to imitate the managers, whom he never communicates, then understand what is not in Hollywood, and then take personal lessons from Jakey Demirquez or Reh Edem on how to drive the plot ideas. This flawless film may not even be preserved by them, but perhaps they can take these steps and create future visual films. <br /> <br /> The way I saw some infamous failure as Pronggunda and Ostestop, and I still are not saying this one was the most Turkish movie.
