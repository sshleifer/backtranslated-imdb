It does not look like a movie and thanks (down to 90 minutes) thanks, it felt more like a potential business in computer graphics: Most special effects are guaranteed, it is sure. But that's not a great cerainly even a good movie. It does not say absolutely unheard-of-sight, because it is possible to see what is possible in CGI or GCI, or is it possible to say what it is? <br /> <br /> I read somewhere, "You can not fix it to the room", can not be corrected with a bad story and unpredictable actor, cutting room or even the most impressive special effects! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> And this is not as common as low-budget stories, they have to create a fantastic country in Mexico? <br /> <br /> All right! Just because of special effects, the rest is the absolute trash!
