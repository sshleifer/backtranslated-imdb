I hate a movie that does not end there. I do not like how good or bad it is, I do not like to leave without conclusion. Such shows will emphasize a waiver ... Something like that: The movie that you are going to watch is no end or highly confused until it's final. <br /> <br /> The last scene in the movie we have a row with Dame and Dominique, and she said, sadly, I thought that this could not be the reason because the fingers were girls or children. Then it ends! Sure, smoking gun, so say, son of de son, but what about the Dominican girl? I really thought we could discover it! However, if you do not want an unwanted movie, then I'd like to avoid this one. Otherwise, I usually think of movies better.
