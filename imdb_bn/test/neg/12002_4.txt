I could not help but see time every 5 to 10 minutes because I pulled this movie a total. Childish humor, cheaper looking set, the effect of cheap search, "lawfully blonde" is a plot that seems to be a "general suspect" and so many incidents that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere since 1996. Only she left her as moving some left camera as her trade mark, but where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well, I feel insulted at the age of 12. The best thing in this movie was the amazingly amazing Karla Gagino that only stole every scene. Sadly, there were not many. 4/10
