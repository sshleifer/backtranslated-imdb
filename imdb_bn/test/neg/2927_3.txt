It fails to pay the bill as WWII's first few years of condom set in a romantic comedy. There is no sequel storyline or description when photographing the problem nicely. Starting from the mystery of the murder, it does not give any hope to its actors because it goes through recent history. Depardieu is spoiled in a trivial role, he is probably not comfortable with the game. Adajani can not carry pictures The hero is not; Perhaps an imitation of a hitco "wrongly charged" role lacks it balance No heroic, ridiculous, or suspicious. <br /> <br /> This could be a good movie. I remember "The Lady Vanishes", which combines mystery, romance and comedy in a serious film related to fascism.
