There was a theft from the opening "Eight-Furious Freaks", which is not a film that is not about this. Spell and passers-by the words that apply - as well as with others who can not be repeated ..! The drift type comes back to the city (?), Meets old friends, etc. ... the usual annoying child, single mother, local loudmouth etc ... special effects, foreign ships, atmospheric disruption, (O, didn " Close Encounters "do not see?). Well played? Good story Good camera angle? Well cut? Not here! If you do not rent, you do not share the cost and supply a lot of beer. Do not watch TV, go instead and drink plenty of beer - you'll enjoy more!
