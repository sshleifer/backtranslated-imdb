Honestly, this image is not. Steve Gutenberg constantly strengthens his strong man's dialogue and then he always gives naughty eyes to everyone. He was not just believable, he thinks he is trying to be a badass and he sucks it. I think of him as a million dollar father with two pairs of Wolseen ... So, this is a big change. I've rented this movie for San Bienne, and he died (normal). Only this time he was confined by a boat anchor (Patriot Games), a giant satellite dishes (golden), or run by cow (field). He just got shot, real quick and civil shot, and I got to this movie that they did not kill him in a very discreet and morbid way. How tragic it is? I was only looking for it for 3 seconds that Shan was there, and then the rest was garbage. I actually tried to see the plot and understand, but not really one. Mission with the hole seems like impossible, "Oooooo! There is a joke! It's the leader of the group, and no one expected it! Let him trap! Clip and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
