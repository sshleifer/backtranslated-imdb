Only Hollywood's audiovisual fantasy world can be incredibly stupid with the FBI agent. Good guys are fools enough to get everything they want, answers phones, steps up, everyone can find everyone who is looking for a debris expert. Oh yeah, and then we get Hollywood superherine. He can be shot, even if he is placed on it and then a long flight of steps falls, and then still on top of his stupid followers. Each clich√© you can use in Susense movies is used. I just saw it because the Yuki Amami is so hot. Oh, ,,,, but it's great to see how morally higher the FBI agent is when he is sure that there is a bomb in the opera house and he does not listen to the alarm. Who is writing this script ????????????
