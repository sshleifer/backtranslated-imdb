In Borneo, this World War II film tried so hard to work on so many levels, it is embarrassing for them that all of them fail. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is a fledged American who witnessed the execution of the execution of the death of his Japanese colleagues. He wanders deep in the jungle of Borneo. Cougie Nigel Havres, who discovered Nolt's adopted tribe. Nolt, now like Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. He defeated a strong warrior in a bloody war, and his chest was a stripped tattoo (a dragon). Now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket, things are not going well in nortland. Horse seeks the help of tribals in the Japanese war, who are attacking the island. He learned how native using machine guns, and started shooting a whole lot. As the tribe has become more successful, they are running against the new squadron of Japan, which is not like any other. This team cannibalize the winning villages (they talk about your happiness) to increase their strength and they move faster even in the jungle than the jungle. As we know the results of the war, we finally know the victory of tribes, but with heavy casualties. Here come spoilers: Havers are injured and return to "civilization". He gave the position of the state and was captured in Nawal. Howers then goes through the trouble of releasing Nolty, and finally the credit roll. <br /> <br /> The direction of Milius is certainly enough, but here the screenplay is unclear in his motions. It presents story ideas, then get the idea of ​​the next story so that they are abandoned. Nolt terrible as the soldier turned king, is trying hard to channel Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz spirit. He speaks of freedom, the beauty of the forest, and the prosperity of his people, and he does not believe in one second, which he does not believe. He is often funny, especially out of the jungle in his early garden, and he spread the word like another hippie. Nigel Havers Spends Movies like Rolke Welch looking for Nolte. Out of the two, obscene lesbians go outside, most of them do not have sex, and remain stunned in a vague relationship, which certainly speak negative. <br /> <br /> Horse often rotates and there is internal conflicts, it tends to bother the tribal, but nolt's attention gets jumped. His colleague straightened into the British Army's army Tahiti faster than the Bouti Landing Party, but I saw everything related to Borneo that it is very humid and very green <br /> <br /> Climatic betrayal, where the hawker gives Nolte's position away, is completely perfect for no reason. Without leaving the film, there is no reason why the House does this work. I was angry, whenever the Howers and Nolt were going to the Philippines on the same ship, the ship started to move around and the hawks went to the new hold to free the nostalgia. No goodbye kiss, but Hawara tells goodbye to the king, explains the title. <br /> <br /> Would you not bother if you fought with war and an enemy squadron was feeding your comrades? These elite Japanese squads are not shown enough, although their eating habits are so terrible, I'm going to be a good mentor right now. Similar spectacular enemies were managed more effectively in "13th Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other interesting ideas were dropped. So what is the reason behind the death of so many backward people in modern technology? Why does King Nolt allow Bright to use his subjects without much hesitation? Why can not Hollywood actor Douglas find a suitable actor to play Mack Arthur? Finally, "King Baidaye" is not legendary, not equipped with strong leadership, and is trying to do much more than things without thinking and exploring its options. I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This image is rated for powerful physical violence, strong gun violence, some miscarriage, some prejudice, some sexual references and adult conditions (PG-13).
