I can not believe I even lost a netfix erosion in this whole piece of CRAP. How long does this picture take? 15 minutes? What is a budget Fifteen money? I can spend hours with my Sony Camcoder and the kids can get some better than these treacherous lamps, and it is also available on DVD! !! Classics like The Stieffather did not release the tragedy on DVD, but this part of steam shoots made it in the format. Here's my rating one rating, hopefully the overall (already) double rating 2.5 goes down.
