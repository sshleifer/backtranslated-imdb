Wow ... Larry McMartree As a big fan of western stories and especially the Lonesome Dove series, I look forward to the moon in the moon. What a tremendous letdown My expectations about the extraordinaryness around Lonsome Dove were set too much ... stories, characters, cinematography, music ... it all worked out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Characters are completely colorless, dialogue confiscates and nonsense manners everywhere in the plot. It seems that actors are reading from telepathters. I can not relate to letters, good boys, bad guys, even accessory characters. David Midther's performance has been particularly outstanding. It seems like it went out of class eight grade grade school performance. Sorry, I want to find something positive about the moon, but I can not do it. There is nothing there.
