From rarely alien sounding lasers, from an elementary school style shuttle crash, "nightwish" is classified as a harmful mixture of fake blood and bare chests. Nearly the pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempts to recover from a lack of concurrent or effective stories. Although acting is not often shocking, many young, aspiring, actors show a hidden talent appreciably. In particular, Don Leffert and Jamie Jemelel, who threw a good shadow in the light of this otherwise terrible movie. Nightwish will never set up to know the talent of making this film in Little Maryland.
