The title of this review is a surprisingly abstract parody of the song "My Favorite Thing" from the first line of theme song of this movie, "Sound of Music" (my opinion is terrible). And this funny little detail is the only aspect that the "body shop" does not make. "Doctor Gore" (1973) Recommended for my fellow Gore / Trash fans. The film, which is almost entirely JG Was created by. Patterson Jr., who is the producer, writer, director and distinguished Dr. No doubt, it is suspicious that it is funny, and everyone involved, perhaps Patterson, was particularly aware that they were not created to be the best composer. <br /> <br /> Brandon (Patterson) is a famous but completely insane plastic surgeon, hiding a model from his favorite wife Anita in an accident. Along with her hatchback assistant Greg (Ray Mehffe), she kidnapped a beautiful young girl from her own body parts to make herself a new, perfect wife ... <br /> <br /> "Doctor Gore" is doubtless 'so bad it's kind of good' A film, but it has the qualities beyond the ordinary ridiculous trashiness. Mad Science has always been one of my most beloved themes, and, actually, this is one of the most dangerous things for the funny trash flick. Clearly, in a minimum budget shot, "Doctor Gore" has paid some tributes to James Frank's best works "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and early Tromas / Herschelle Gordon Lewis looks at the appearance of Falic "Blood" Feast "(1963) - This is the only cheap and crawfier. Definitely j. Yes. Patterson's intention was not to create a funny cowboy flick: rather than being a bad, strange colleague. Brandon's role is to give Pietersen some hot, rarely clothed young girl (who will end later) as a participant in Dr. Brann's laboratory). <br /> <br /> Most Gore is really well-prepared with a short budget. There are some very funny lines in the conversation ("Get it, it can be a door ... and place a coat so they do not see you are a hanback.") In addition to the previous theme song, "Doctor Gore" has a luxurious appearance called 'Bill Hicks and the Rainbow' - my new favorite band, Note For the rest of the picture, I was surprised that Bill Hicks and Roy Mahfou, who are acting with a hacktacked assistant, are both pairing or even the same person - both are the same, and the two related fat, red bearded people see this as a film that is a weird coincidence Will be. J. Yes. Other than Patterson, most cast members have never made any other films. I saw this first picture of some of Patterson's. Sadly, people died due to cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a film that is not for everyone. As a matter of fact, it's total shit. But it's funny, and curiosity and inexpensive camp staff are my fellow fans recommendable. The dictionaries should display a screenshot from this movie under 'trash flick'.
