If it is not a Disney movie, then this movie could be better than this. I think that the young girl who was playing Charlie was right, you can say that she is really trying to work properly. Teenage Shiroli temple was not right. I think they spent the last time of their childhood, the first hour should have been about young Sheryli, then the last hour should have been about the old Sheryli. It was not a boring movie, and a good Sheryli temple story.
