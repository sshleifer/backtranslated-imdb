Obviously, some wanted to keep an eye on the "Blair Witch" wave. <br /> <br /> This movie was set up like "reality" spectrum, which is recently popping on TV (and I must admit it to get a kick out), but this movie is very cheesier! Perhaps the first three-quarters of the movie "Participants" roam around the house. Give me a break It's not a good time to think about going into the ATIC for 10 minutes. There are no unusual events blatant setups. No strings, but very perfectly captured camera. "Participants" were not very interested. Two secret guys who do not take it seriously, a girl who is afraid of the hat drops, and captivating of the supernatural "supernatural" personality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, they pull each ounce of the movie and stuck in 15 minutes. I admit, I spent time pacing in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie. Money has a fresh situation! If you are looking for a great story line .. see elsewhere;)
