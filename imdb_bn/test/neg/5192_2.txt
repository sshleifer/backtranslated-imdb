I saw this photo 2 weeks ago on the snowboarding holiday, so for me it was my mind in the mode for the holidays. The film has a number of sweet snowboarding skills, which covers the film in action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching the extreme sports channel. Sadly the story was quite frightening, the act was very good, with a fairly small cast. This picture is apparently a comedy, at least it tries to be ridiculous, but it seems the comedy and the story were written by a teenager. There is no depth or purpose in this story, and during the movie, the comedy struggles to do more than a little sniper. It may be eligible for rent to watch snowboarding action, but again there are plenty of movies that are dedicated to Snowboarding Stunts and do not show any unnamed misread story written by the United Nations.
