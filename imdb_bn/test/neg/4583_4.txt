But like a Disney film two generations ago, this picture failed as well in the accuracy section. But at least Disney used a Sky Terrier. <br /> <br /> True story is a hypocrite for movie producers? I do not think so. We have enough documentation to accurately represent the exact story instead of imaginary accounts we have imagined. In a few days, a film will accurately portray Bobby's owner John John as Edinburgh Police and will accurately portray Bobby's license payments by Lord Provost. When that happens, I'll be in the theater.
