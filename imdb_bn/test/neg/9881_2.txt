My first impression was when I read the summary for the upcoming movie, it was going to be very different from the book. The movie trailer said that 19-year-old Vivian, after 19 years of age, was set on fire in America. She met Aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. Working in the chocolate shop on the day, he must admit that he will never be normal, because every full moon, he has become a loop - a mythological creature like a thought that can be closely related to rotation. <<br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book I thought that changing the age, changing a setting, and a little bit of career change could not affect the story, so that I could drag my tears. My eyes went out of their sockets and bleeding in the movie theater field. <br /> <br /> This film unknowingly killed many important characters, one of Vivevan's mother Esam, the father of the fire that was supposed to be from the fire bat, was killed. I pushed that aside and ventured into the movie, thrilling and a little annoying. Running through Romania, the camera angle was decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was ... interesting ... but it left me with an impression, "Why look like Vivian, and why he is wearing a hoodie?" I'm going to the next section of the movie, I must say that the scriptplayer author Vivian and Raffe seem to support the handless rather than attracted to the relationship between the character of the book. He was the leader of five. The cousin (surprise!) Anast Astrid, who was in the novel, was a bitter and hateful rival on the soil of Bhovan and I could add that there was no relation between any of them. <br /> <br /> Discontinuity of the character, Gabrielle became the leader of a pack and Vivian pretends to be his partner, so that they can fulfill some vague predictions. His physical appearance is not just 180, from the book's description, he was obviously the father of Raf. Yes, okay, this is a pretty little obscene orthodoxy, who makes all the tight up. <br /> <br /> The little thing that bothered me was like a forest hunting scene. The red head was standing from the rest of the crowd, who had been "free to kiss their enemies" before their prey and became prey. Why was she there? Why does he look like astrid? I think my mind is not able to understand enough why why this character was present in the movie without any explanation, since most of the hunters were different than kissing. <br /> <br /> I love how Amba was totally cut out of the movie. I like how legality was involved in the law of the past, in the supposed dramatic scene where she wanted Vivian to learn self-defense to his father and to learn his father's self-defense, then asked him to "kill" him. A tragic character. <br /> <br /> Letter 180s a lot while they are completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt that some people were obsessed with the novel, half wrote the names of the characters, wrote a few links here and there, mentioning that Gabriel was a bit blurred, Eden was in love with Vivian, when he discovered that he was one of the legends Loop-Girl has found and "somebody" is killed by "silver bullets" and some The happy ending is because the Wavian is finally the one who likes him for him. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2/10 because the camera shot was relatively modest, and the welding could have been worse, but as far as the instruction is given, loop-gear leap is why? They want to fly in the human form air (with their pure backs and sneaky impressions), for a short time beating them, and then fall on the ground as a wolf? The only aspect of this movie that saw me scary, tragic ends were wolf, beautiful scenes, and eye candy boys. In all, I must say that in order to enjoy this movie, one must have misconceptions, strange phenomena, which are not always explained, indecently provocative, and can not read the book or read the book. Must be ready for
