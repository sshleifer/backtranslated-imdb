Like the poster above, I burned the title that I am getting another piranha ... This movie looks like everything is worse on the poster ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, lazy acting and just plain horror storyline ... <br /> <br /> There was very little to see that was valuable ... how the movie was released is also outside of me. <br /> <br /> Make sure that you want the movie you are buying ... and it's not. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie I bought was "Piranhaa" and "Piranha, Piranha"! "That's really ... this is the only way to sell this movie."
