"Problem Children 2" was a complete waste of my time. The original movie was not very good, but it is a classic than this movie. The first movie went to the top, where the scenes of one of the most harmful children of his life was visible in the neighborhood. Here, it goes even further on top. And one view of this movie proves the theory. The order of that carnival ride was too much for my stomach. It's boring This movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (four out)
