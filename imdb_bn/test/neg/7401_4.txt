I just saw this first part and decided that I did not see the second episode but I will not miss anything. The cinematography was right, but beyond that, this plot was a commemorative story and a war of run-of-the-mill. Actors and actresses play their characters without any emotion, and the make-up is really bad (with her white hair and Hei Wisinger, Heiner Lautterbach can give them some of their more dignity and common sense respectively). If I saw our two or three films about WWII (most of us), then you will only take the problem of seeing the third or fourth, if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot. But Roland Susso Richard seems afraid of doing this, you can often feel her smell about the bourgeois and Jezuf TV channel's fear of Jezi's expectations of the film. Millions of euro were spent for the creation of annoying and unexpected German films. These millions of dollars can be spent for making three or four independent films, but not, let's give some directors who will create a movie that tells people that war can be interpreted in a reasonable way. My suggestion: Read Joseph Haley or Cart Vanguat instead. They will say how war is! Or give me a million euro and I take a better picture than this load! And another topic: Why is the film with WWII or Holocaust when the German films are nominated for the Oscars only? Perhaps the only reason behind the production of Germany's film is good. And that should worry us, is not it?
