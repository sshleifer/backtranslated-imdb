If Yuram Globe and Menheime Golan are not enough to remember Rondon here: they are some filmmakers from Israel and Finsia who established the Canon Film Company in the early 1980's. Menchim Beguni was the only Israeli to get worse news than these two men. Probably initially had the ability to get bad news, but Globus and Golan sent a god to filmmakers, because your script could play poorly to pay for your movie happily and there is no director and director who can not work directly. Actually, you've often got Imran that people will only walk up to Joram and Menhem will ask them for some money and they will claim them without seeing the restoration of the filmmaker. If today's producer is so reliable nowadays <br /> <br /> Although young warriors are not a canon film, Galbus and Golan gave it its meaning and it has its signature on it. It has been badly managed, badly edited, badly edited, but it is the script that overcomes you and attacks you with its horror. It starts with a bunch of Han School Jokes, which is involved in all kinds of Janny Pans, in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays as a sexual comedy, and it happens like a shock when the young fighters have a vigilante movie. But it's not any kind of vigilant film, such as Extremator 2 or Death Wish 3 (Watch a connection? They are both sequels and movies made by both Cannes movies), no seri it jokes a ridiculously bad alarms movie superb boy high school and their poodle scumbags About going to a mission to wipe out. This film proves that Glasgow and Golan are making payments to the public irrespective of their ability to make films, and you have to think about them who think that they are going to spend their entire reserves to build complete safe movies.
