Credits at the end "All managed by Shigeru Izumiya". This is a good way to give a phrase because it seems that the elements of the film have been gathered from different projects, even if it is trying to do all the work continuously. It felt more like a music clip thing that is sold in the market as a monetization feature in that video ad, but only here we have marketable music and live performances, without a view, which can go to the market a weird music video clip in Japan. Anyway <br /> <br /> <br /> It makes zero sense. Apparently this is not very special, although it has moments (for example, the female animal "death powder" which covers a bed base and some morphing sh!) And it is certainly an art feeling. Usually I say the effect of the Delinquentes, but this film is more annoying than anything else. Do you think the cheap video effects from the 80's 80s and 80's music videos, which show them so many dates, like a picture in a photo flying through the screen? There are many such effects and without any apparent reason. Most half-assed conventional attempts come in the form of a photo collage. The picture sort of look like the album cover. Anyway <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what I saw with the subtitles. The Chinese (or those who contain highagulipfics) sometimes appear to say nothing and the English is often seen without the Chinese. English subscribe to death with a lot of talk about life (this is possible?), And a mind without body, which comes close to a compromise conflict between the characters of this film. A man (a scientist, Dude) says that death without life is death and another person (a converting friend) who claims his mind is outside his body, now he has swollen "death powder" in his mouth; and now he is a secret animal and not; The transformed dude apparently p! Ssed off about scientist dude's claim. Anyway <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
