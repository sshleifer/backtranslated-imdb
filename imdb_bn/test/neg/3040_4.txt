The rebuilding of the 1979 Horse Classic's Simon West is a kind effort to bring an old school thrill to a contemporary audience. Gifted teen is playing Camilla Bell, when a stenographer fails to call even a surprised, or even surprised face. Wonderful disappointment of the audience range from stained-like quotes like people creating exciting music for a cat running outside the shadows. This plot follows a teenage girl named Jill Johnson (Bell) who forced her father to pay the bill by marrying her father. For the night, he is invited to work in a room in the river and it is simply an easy way to cash in on the money. But he does not know, a stranger is hiding in the house, and constantly harassing Jones. A merciful excuse for a film.
