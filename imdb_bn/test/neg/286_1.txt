I had a very high expectation of walking in this movie. After all, Ocean 11 was really a great Hollywood product. Its quick-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script is one of the most fun copper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money it made, a signal was on the way, and I was excited for one. <br /> <br /> Not saying, I totally blown up this movie. Fly away by how terrible mistakes can go. Everything was going for this movie; Completely original cast, story of the same director, insane and close-set antics. How is it probably wrong? <br /> <br /> it starts simultaneously with the most painful and unnecessary opening sequences and flies from there. After a few scenes between Pete / Zeta-Jones and Cloni / Roberts, the film apparently spends minutes in Andy Garcia Waltz from the scene, telling every member of the Danny Ocean's eleven eleven to receive his money. When I say that these scenes are here for Andy Garcia's running time pad, because without this ridiculous weird shots, its screen time will be better under five minutes. <br /> <br /> This is another big softness I had with this picture. Passing is so disrespectful that characters are completely excluded from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. The character of Barney Mack starts with the script and comes back without 2 dialogues without any dialogue. Garcia is shown for the first few minutes, and finally comes back for a short concise scene. Roberts initially shows up for about 5 minutes and is not mentioned again until about 20-25 minutes. Even Clooney himself spent a large part of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> It would be all right if the picture is interesting. All the time 90% jokes are completely flat and those that work well are shiny pricing. The "plot" is arbitrary value, and left me deceived feeling. At one stage of the film, they took the $ 25 million job of a $ 100 million document, raised before the two-week deadline for Garcia. Many characters even speak silent on how to waste time for this work, but they do it anyway! This work has surrounded the work for more than 30 minutes, even they can not do it, and someone offers this feeling that this part of the plot has only added the running time to the pad. In addition, they spend millions of crores of taka at the cost of tools to draw this task. You can wait to see what you can do to get this job done and realize it will cost more than $ 25 million to drag it. Obviously, for this reason, they have to stop several jobs to earn money. The beauty of the first film was a big moon, and it was dragged very impressively and complicatedly. Here, they work so many things in many ways that they push them all because they will make a few hours long film to explain them. <br /> <br /> We all know to walk in this movie, then there will be a big turn. Thus the nature of the copper film Twelve edges of the ocean laughing at me; Because it was not funny, but I could not believe how I felt cheated. I will not give it up, because I know that most of you will be stupid enough to throw money to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> What I say is more than 2 hours you are already sitting completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was excited to see this image, after 11 ocean worship. I gave up the feeling of the theater as I pulled it with a genuine particle cast and the crew of this movie would really appreciate me in this figure. I did not give 1 movie in one movie of IMDb.com, but for the first time everything was there. Warn yourself ... 1/10
