After a very strange, strange opening that gives you a wonderful "Chesson genocide" -filing, everything falls apart. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Anyone who has seen this "fool-in-the-mill" can find out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is not a small girl tortured and murdered? Will this be the movie for us next? Torture and torture of children? What's wrong with you guys? The linchpin really has a disgusting, ugly mind.
