Medical students hook the hook and die together in one bunch of Yuppies. Then they count the time before the brain's death and then start CPR and heart disease and make each other alive again. Julia Roberts was in the film that the truth should say it all. The Flatliners Group is like GHOST. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and wants to see their old dead friends, so a better way to do this than a bunch of medical students will kill you for five minutes and then make you alive again. The rest of the film has problems with expected relations, and predictable "If we kill each other in Gee Mei, then some of us die?" D home !!! This movie was supposed to be called Brain Dead. Characters are portrayed as a medical student, then they are surprised that if they go to school for a foreign education letter. The only thing to keep the film in total laugh was that they did not restrict their fingers in the electric fingers just to "die". This picture has been a great three Stoggie comedy movie.
