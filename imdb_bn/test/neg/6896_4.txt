I took my family to see Barnyard this past weekend. We were looking forward to it but my kids were not there, my husband and I will leave. Coming from a farming community, we found that the men of the film were slightly boring to hold on to Boayin. We felt like watching cross dressing cows or something. It was just curious to hear a male voice coming from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on a different website, I felt that the animators might have leaked this issue. I know it was just an animated, ridiculous show but keeping men's body parts on men, my disbelief had to be postponed so that I could not enjoy the movie. I know udders can be found fun but they are certainly used. Which of the other animals in the film did not feel the sex body parts described above on them and I liked to make the calf the most correct, if they were all drawn. The kids still enjoyed the picture, though we took the time later to know the difference between bull and cows.
