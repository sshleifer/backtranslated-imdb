Although not generally for my romantic drama, this picture kept me a little brief. <br /> <br /> It was promised, the characters and relationships could be deeply dissected, but the story does not seem to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Especially the three generations of the family had many possibilities, but thus did not fully extend themselves. It can make the film more easily easier for a film related to lost and loving. <br /> <br /> I think the writer lacks the direction of the film, though Harry Connick JNR and Sandra Bullock have tried to frustrate a little life in the outline of flat characters otherwise. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, in some parts you develop the plot for different reasons, it is just this film superfluousness, and a little flat overall.
