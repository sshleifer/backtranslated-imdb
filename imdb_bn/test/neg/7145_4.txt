There is nothing new in this movie. You have not thought of anything before, nothing has not heard before. The story of a gay man in a small town may be killed and people's response can be broached in many ways, and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy. One of the biggest drawbacks of this movie is that it is not a movie and not a documentary. The directors used the replica of the original interview and actors played them as movies. The result is weird And finally, I've read in previous comments that said that people who do not like this movie are homosexual opponents. I'm sure that these comments come from people who feel themselves tolerant but do not tolerate other people who do not like this movie. This is a fun world.
