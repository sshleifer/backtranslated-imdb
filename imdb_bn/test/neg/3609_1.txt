<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I can get more emotional acting from my pet fish! <br /> <br /> It was embarrassing to see Pete Postlethwaite, to act with whom I respected as an actor to act! <br /> <br /> I think that the cardboard emitted from Stephen Belvedin did a better job, and actually became more vivid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This can really be dangerous to your health!
