I went to see a random heart with 3 friends, and at first, I thought it was only me who was not enjoying the movie. After all, I did not like it as well and that has won all kinds of movie awards. Well, it was not just me ... no friend of mine liked it. It was incredibly slow, many dentists would like to get drawn. The only step in the film is the preview. We will not walk from the theater because we all saw more things happen. We were smart like 7/8 people who were walking. I have never been able to act in a movie of my life, but I must stay with me. It's all difficult for me to write, I think it's relatively easy when it comes to movies. It takes a lot for me to think it's great, but it's not too much for me. This movie does not even come in good categories. The film was not too much about 2 hours, but it was like a separate story in both of them, but they were not seamlessly sewn together. Plus, "Soundtrack" could make you call it even annoying. Similar references like Sinefield reappeared (again the difference is that I like Seinfeld). This film was a jazz reef that it was playing, which sometimes seemed very inappropriate, especially when people were related to death plane accidents. I mean what I mean to understand, but believe me it was awful. I can not say enough to not waste their money. After leaving the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie company and wanted my 7 dollars back. Shaish, I said that I will not say anything for that money.
