I Koyaanisqatsi and Povqqatsi are both a giant fan, but this movie is not just good. The critics below are completely accurate that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really kept continuing to hope throughout the film as well, that was left after that. Maybe my expectations were too much, but I felt it. <br /> <br /> Repeat the score to the old two - if you are a fan, is not necessarily a bad thing, but only a piece that stands by me as being fresh. It was good enough, but I would probably check the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But if you see this movie, remember: if you understand that you go ahead and split it at any time - you will not miss anything because it will not be better . <br /> <br /> I'll give executive summaries here (alert! spoilers!): Many shots of athletes who have enough Nike commercials, sunny man shots, WOM Dummy of the famous people (WTF do they think here?), some children Children (cuuuuute) Bichin "Photoshop effect, some imagery that is meant to compare the flow of water, information, money and people (I think) ... and then the fast relationship of mass violence A bunch of scenes in the scene ... and then a bunch of stock space footage. <br /> <br /> I can recreate this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch: <br /> <br /> A head head and Lycra is playing with children playing with children playing kids with a 2-second string of happy parents with biking shorts; "Network" in 5 seconds of the scene where the man is "the basic power of nature" and how " Q flows, money is excluded to "talk involved, Reginald deinira head with a brick was 1 second, and then around the Moon biyanera Alan was standing about 3 seconds. <br /> <br /> You will go there - this is 88 minutes and 50 seconds of life that I've saved now. Of course, I got a copy of the effects and applied filters or two, so it will not look like a stock in the flat. If you read this article by Steven SÃ¶nderberg, hey, I do not want much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "life like war", then instead of saying "Colombian bowling" instead. It may not be so fashionable in black holiday crowd, but at least it's fun.
