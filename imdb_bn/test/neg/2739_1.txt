General horror movie ... I will not bother you about the summary, Core, Armageddon, an evil schematic military officer and one or two solutions - all Nukes will be together and if I can call, you will have a movie that way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, nicks are more useful in these movies than Swiss Army knives: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ends ... Enter the name of the important city "Want to destroy a tornado?" Nuke "Insert Another Important City Here" ... is a volcanic eruption? It's Nick! Is a Nick closer to go off? It's Nick! Coffee cool? It's Nick! Did you like the transformer? Nick himself, but I can not guarantee that it should be fixed ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many more such movies can be made before each other copies start? I suspect there's still a lot to fly with a nick ...
