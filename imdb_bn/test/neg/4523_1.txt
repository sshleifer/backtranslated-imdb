I have not seen TV series or previous movie. Perhaps I did not really enjoy this reason. It's annoying and not just funny, it's pretty nicely. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be considering the budget, it is shameful that they can not even do any suitable work. <br /> <br /> We went to the movies without any exception and hope to see some funny movies which will not be too much on the mind. My friend falls asleep halfway through the movie and I hope to finally take the next 2 hours to spend. One hope, which died with the last credit.
