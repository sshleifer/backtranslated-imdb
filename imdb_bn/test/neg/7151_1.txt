Help, I've finished the movie hell! This is what a completely stupid film is Really nothing good about it <br /> <br /> Tell the story to spit: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly remote: an EU anti-terrorist group is watching a full bag full of xtc pill following a bunch of people driven around Western Europe. And the worst thing is: they're honest about it! <br /> <br /> 2) Acting levels are very shy in all the faces involved. <br /> <br /> 3) Some speculators have decided to speak English so that they can be caught in the international market. Ugliest Advertising Never! French and Dutch Native Sparas are all smart words but knowledge and results are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is completely misplaced and selected ill. Some of the effects of cameras, editing and working are supposed to be style films, but this story (text: anti-story) does not mean anything to understand. <br /> <br /> 6) Hadi Maa Wildschut hero fails to believe firmly. A true actor Usually I will give an extra point for having around him. But no, sorry, not this time, I just will not forgive my soul ...
