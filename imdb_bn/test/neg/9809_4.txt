Fantastic twisted movie, here and there are a few good moments, with some unclear blood pressure scenes, but it's good for yourself. All the characters are okay, and the story was much more probable, rather bloody, but blood-synthesis scenes looked horribly real and as a result they were very annoying. It has been well-written and accurately written, and it has become really interesting, but it did not increase speed, plus I found the end of frustration. Linna Quigley did not have such a small role, I was also disappointed, and Stephen Knight did a good job as lead, because she was very nice, plus I got it in a DVD set that was known as A taste. Evil, with a bunch of other horror films. There is a lot of blood, but it is not all glory, and it was good for its low budget, even though I said it could not only survive its interest. This is a fantastic curved horror film, where there are some great moments, in the view of some vague blood corpuscles, but it is very neutral for myself, I will pass, but I think if you have nothing, then it is a clock value. To do well. Directions are OK. Eli Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane do a good job here with decent camera work, and it's doing a good job in low budget, but speed is extremely inconsistent for my choice. Acting is okay. As great as Stephen Knight's lead, he gave obscure, stomach, sick, and a very wonderful performance, though it seems like the most awesome thing about him as he is a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is okay I guess his short time is sin. The rest of the cast as well as well. Overall I'll pass, but I think it's worth a watch that you do not really have anything good to do. 5 * out 1/2
