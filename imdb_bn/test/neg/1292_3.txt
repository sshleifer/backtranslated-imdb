I'm sorry, but this movie is a shallow way for me. Meanwhile, a taxi dancer trying to do it as an actress with Perez boyfriend Keitel. First of all, what a taxi dancer hell? Even after sitting through this, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspired DeLorenzo to follow her like a boyfriend puppy. There is no reason behind love, it is just like that. There is a time when characters and events really try to drag you into the heartwarming but it rarely works. For Katelle's character, or the only character with whom it seems only for you, and it only works well with it. The other actor and character were the same as the others. <br /> <br /> This script is not really difficult to create as an actress / actress. It has been said before and it sounds like the language and dialogue were written by a street pump. Finishing ... Well, I do not want to waste it. Let's feel it is unhappy. If the story is good to start then I would be more annoyed. The instruction is really amazing with nothing but average, but nothing that is really painful to see. To repeat the performance, Keithel is the only one that is watching observers. Although I could not have seen Tiger print bikini underwear, <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Eddie Bunker shows. As a reference to that random, that film is how random it is And Tenantino have a favor by showing his director friend for about 20 seconds.
