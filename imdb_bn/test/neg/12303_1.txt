Shameem shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Do not take the kids for this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they will be bored and frustrated. Of course * we all * have read Theo's wonderful child book and of course we have hope ... but it's a pure trash. Dr. Seed will be ashamed and certainly will not give her "thumb up" in such a tremendous effort in the classic capital market. <br /> <br /> What a sadness. <br /> <br /> Spend your money in the book. If you are a copy owner, then buy the book and donate to the toys for the Tuts program. This movie is not worth watching "free" tickets. <br /> <br /> Stay tuned with the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual screenplay - Save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on the wire by Saint Patio's day. <br /> <br /> How shameful shame they are !!
