You can not really blame the filmmaker for praising the chain because the industry is almost everything. Most of the stories you've heard about this "freedom fighter" created by Communist Cuban government after China's death are mostly. Che was one day's threat of murder. Here is a list of major works for Cuba: 1) Death penalty has been executed to satisfy thousands of innocent Cuban men, women, and children for their desire for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Cuban economy and the world of good standing with rest. Cuban peso was equal to the American dollar. Now it's basically useless. <br /> <br /> 3) The issues that are involved in diplomacy, economy and the military always fail. She did not finish her first year in medical school, and she was only in a real fight, where she surrendered with a fully loaded gun. <br /> <br /> 4) He took the biggest property in Cuba to set up for himself. He had a custom made TV, a swimming pool, and a view of the ocean from America, a yacht, 60. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you think that what I say is lying in what I say, then study some. Compare Cuban export from 1950/60 to today; Talk to people who were called so-called Cuban "Revolution" in the 1960s or who were their parents; Read all reports of murdered innocent people; Read and read the reports from people who serve under Che and Castro, and how they run away because of bad, hateful people <br /> <br /> Please and please, always remember to read or see everything. Stop taking everything to value and think IT
