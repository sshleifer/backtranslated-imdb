Some films are simply fools without explicit explanation. This is one of them. The sound can not judge wood, stupid plot, and never-expected results. The only thing about the ability to show this image is that a little clothed woman (and silent people for your ladies). The warrior woman and the leader of Valeria are quite attractive to the eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, See New York. About 2 / 3rd of the film seems to have been depicted in high school basement. Deadly sock dolls look like scary as a sesame street monster. In the trash B-movies of the 1950s, it would be better to agree with Latrine that better work. The only thing I can think about is that it was not out of the outer space.
