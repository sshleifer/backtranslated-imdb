Drug runner Archi Moosh introduced his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Cotton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually a secret police officer. During the bomb blast in the colt factory, Moses accidentally shot Kate on his head. He survived the wounds and later arrested Moses. Colton's tenant murderers will be frustrated and both of them have to live in mutual hatred. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's film is generally hit and Miss Egypt, his jokes like his fans or hated by everyone. This is not as stupid as her other films, but still can not overcome a lazy script. Comicchanges among Sandler and Damon Wains are incredibly fast, with slow action sequence in slow motion. Some of the action scenes ?? Flying an airplane with no engine, night chase through a car a forest ?? Quite absurdly contrived are Ideal for this style of acting, Sandler & Wayans with a good pairing. In short, the picture is stupid but fun to see. <br /> <br /> Grade: C + M Who Review by Zest
