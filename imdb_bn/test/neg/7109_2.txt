As a fan of Marlin Dietrich films, I feel very concerned about this "documentary". After reviewing RAW from national critics, I could read the Revi review. That should stop me. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply annoying and obviously too overrated. You do not even see the dicky. She discussed her movie and this video, listening in the background. She is almost nothing but complaining about everything. What a tension! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, the Maximilian Shell, has repeatedly complained himself and requested to stay in the camera ... will not be useful at all. He only refused to cooperate. After a while, such things get really tiring. With his attitude, why will the inscription continue with this project? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
