Despite reading the article about the director of the magazine Tatler, I was interested to see this movie. I do not judge the movie or may not be director or not. This debut feature was very difficult to see. I have shown the split screens in the film's confusion, some supporting characters have performed poorly, and I have seen this movie a copy of several other films. There really was nothing fresh about this
