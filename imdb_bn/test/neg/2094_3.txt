Samuel Lack is not forced to make mistakes. Jackson car snake on plan! SNAKES low budget on a training, no actor (talk) features, but some fantastic deminently visual effects. An attractive young girl (Julia "Ryan" Ruiz) does not want to like anyone for her husband; So he is under a strong hypocrisy that there is hatching snakes inside his body, slowly devouring from the inside. His only hope is to survive a snail living across the border of Texas. Time is running for him; And he was kept on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Long before the snake leaves his body of debris and is rapidly growing in size. Train passengers are now trapped and soon for a snake meal. There is no doubt that the 91-minute Flick is the best in the final. Also the acting credits are taken: Albie Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
