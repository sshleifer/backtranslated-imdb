Eight young people were brought to the exiled blackwell hotel to clean up as a community service. They soon discovered that it is the home of Holkining Cyclop (Why), where there is something to collect and collect eye ribs. It does not help that the watchdog (Steven Willler) had an earlier run with the beast four years ago. <br /> <br /> My conviction slash film Most of them are neutrally operated and acted, but they still have some appeal and entertainment value. No evil is a good example of this. It's violent writing and acting features but death scenes are quite good and movies are proven to be entertaining. September 13, Monday 2 and Halloween: The proof of resemblance is the mid-way mix. I really like the idea but it does not work very well. It really was a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Image writer Dan Madigan just focused the death scene and apparently nothing else. Death scenes are quite good and horrible. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative killings. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite beautiful and unknown. Because these characters are one dimensional and we do not know much about them. It was difficult for these people to feel because they were quite unlikely. Cain is surprisingly mediator. I was expecting her screen to appear in Scarer but she did not do a job well. A second rate is Jason Voorhees, if you have to. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this picture will probably not help or hurt their careers. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are not terribly terrible. There really is no doubt about some secret death scenes. For this reason, the movie does not hold a repeat of a lot of value. Also, if you do not like Slashner films, do not spend time with you. It will make a little change in your opinion. Finally, see No Nobil is a decent slash film but it is generic and forgotten so it is not worth seeing it. Rating 6/10
