Who gave this guy the money to make movies? There was nothing funny about it. The dog is the most fun thing farting about this piece of illness that is true of it. After all, it does not have anything to do with Christmas, it only takes the name and those who like the original Chawi Chase count them. They took Randie, 'I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweat pig' (the only thing wrong about part 1) and I've created a 'movie' about him ... his family is just dead, but not 'stars Not cute 'kinda moronic, but' do not touch me 'kinda moronic You see this pile of dirt that it takes part in the DIES! They have not even hesitated to have a growing impact ... the only thing that comes back to the boat when it's a fake background ... When a pigfus quoode is in the water, you can publish it in a light studio. This movie was not sexist (uncle Nick), racist (uncle Nick) and should never have been made ... any ... could use so much to throw money in a volcano. <br /> <br /> OK. I hope that I have reached you ... no one warns me and now I have nightmares for life Merry F * Christmas is coking.
