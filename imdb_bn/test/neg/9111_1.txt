***** I release two 'twists' at the end of the film. If you want to watch this movie for some reason, do not read it. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's bad. And for some reason, Shane Bean, one of the most current actresses, has sold his soul and has been present in it. The only consolation is that the authors would have realized that someone like Steve Gutenberg was finally shocked, his life could never kill a cold man like Shan Biyan. Instead, in the end, he was killed in what seemed like a wonderful twist, by the good man who was supposed to be killed by Biyan, but in reality he was his master and was responsible for his own death. Do not worry. I do not destroy anything for you. Acting with Gutenberg's patent "Hei-Luc-i-CÃ´n-Can-Pool-a-Chuck-Norris-Face" is a spectacularly unexpected, harsh man influencing most of the world's two hours. During the torture I could have written and cut off both hands, it has been added to a conspiracy that at one moment it is an unknown serious error that if the virus is wrong to see it in a moment, they will run away, at another moment, Steve Gutenberg bravely It is circling, throwing, interrupting and usually misusing this 'virus', which is your There are small balls of soap to keep the appearance of distinct collections of pines. My final word? If you are frustrated and feel that you want to be a bad comedy but want to laugh mentally but not worse, next time it will be tapped at 5 in the midnight channel, when you realize that I really say the truth is true.
