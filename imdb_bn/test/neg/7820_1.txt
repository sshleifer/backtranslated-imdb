For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now, I know why. It's not just a comedy that even fails at a remote fun time, but there is nothing to smile about the movie. I was even worse than I wanted. I hired this sucker and still felt cheated out of time compared to the money. I've never seen a movie that made me feel very annoyed. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. I really do not know how someone can actually work in such a movie with a common sense. I've used IMDB for a while but poor helpless people are forced to register to help renting or stabbing this steiner !! Really a waste of time and money. I would say that the plot line is awful.
