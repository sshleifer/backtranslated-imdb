This is a lower average "whodunit" with each cliche of the routine in the living room. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent working in government work and he must have killed a scientist in the bombing to defeat German U-boats in World War II. There is nothing to recommend to this film, because there is not much to do with bomb or scientist or war plot. Charlie Chan fans probably find this movie frustrating. Who is dunit? Who care?
