There is nothing that the audience can point out and make "good" calls. The acting was dull and sedated. Set and cinematography, it looks like someone who grew up in Starbucks and tried to make perfect gap commercial. Characters have no drive, motivation, or reason for us to care about them. There is a lack of interest and tension, which is difficult to follow balance action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it will be boring like everything else. <br /> <br /> This is not funny, it is not romantic, it does not reflect the condition of the person. If you want a good stoner comedy, look half-baked; If you want a good studio drama, watch the touring. Instead of one, I gave these two stars the only reason because in the middle of the 90's it was fun to see some familiar faces. The film is a shallow reason to give even a star, which, however, again, it is a shallow movie.
