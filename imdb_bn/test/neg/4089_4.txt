Well, I have seen this image rolling in the hope that I was wrong .... The film was moderately fun, and annoying at the worst times (the slapstick comedy styling, smile ... not me, to build a ship with the oldest equipment). I was very disappointed with Steve Carroll's lead. I saw the official US office, cracked me a lot, I thought the 40 year old virgin was good ... but Ivan did our best - why did he accept this script on the world. And, for Morgan Freeman - he's old enough to know old. So, the idea seemed reasonable, the actor believed in me- but the house to execute the execution and nothing was written in the end, it looks like they have exceeded the money, or the ideas. This is one of the most fabulous endings for me I could imagine. They adopted a biblical story and pushed it into a story of warning on local environmental issues, even not a global matter, but a local bill - Javan! <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the rigid start, gradually became worse and I was washed, all by the time of the credit.
