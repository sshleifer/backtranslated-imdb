I found this a great disappointing experience! But I've added a better alternative to the style similar to this entry's footprint. <br /> <br /> This "Felixia's Journey" is confusing. It's a drama. But it's full of stereo-type! <br /> <br /> So, it supports non-extravagant mood without justification of fairness and fairness, black 'n' is beyond white trial which is suitable for 30 seconds of "news" ads, which makes our multimedia experience diversified everyday, Especially the news bulletin, such as real or confusing! <br /> <br /> This is so far revealed, it reminds me of the story of "Little Red Riding Hood"! Consider innocent young man who is released without any evidence without any boundaries bound by the guards, and his 'Romeo' is released without any evidence for the search, who did not address him, lacking the lack of substance in Versace's voice. 'Hands to save' his friendship with his impossible story! <br /> <br /> It seems that the director and the management team, who does not believe or pray to God, even during their frustration! <br /> <br /> So in this first setting, it is orchestrate and tells a lot about what will happen! A nightmare journey betrays the essence of substance without the fact that fairytale resolution, without the truth or honesty or credibility! ... then a twist and all the ends. What a disappointment! If you want to see many more high-end movies with more credibility than searching for the same themes, see the 1983 Paul Cox / Norman Cannes "Man of Flowers" with more powerful insights !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will not be disappointed!
