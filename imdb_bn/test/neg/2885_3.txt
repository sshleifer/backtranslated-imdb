Elfriede Jelinek, is still not a family name, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her novel gives birth to a movie which is the second prize for Kanse and the top prize for male and female leads. Am I not a dinosaur about aesthetic gratitude, or is the industry so violent that anything goes? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A Turkish flop in the film industry is measured by a box office receipt or critical reception. 'Gobble, Gobble' and Piano Teacher are the perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing horror of this widely praised film can not be overstated. It started very badly, as the viewer was disturbed. Credit halts overwhelming views for more than 11 minutes. We introduce Professor Irika Kohat, apparently the piano is a stony professor, the pride of the direct writer. She lives with her husky and domineering mother. Dad is an academic madman who passed away for work, disappeared and disappeared. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, its disobedience is beyond registration. What we see in the movies (and I can read in the book, all I know) is an instant, exploitative, unhealthy tale of an emotional pandolum that jumps here and there without moving. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not at all, because there is a handbag in his two shoulders with voice on his shoulder, which pardons forgiveness. If a critic has to find a litemph (why not do it easily, do not use lady words), Elkier's fiercely changing temperament will be. <br /> <br /> A young boy, Walter, is a 'low voltage' engineer studying, whatever happens, and at some leisure moments, playing Ice hockey, becoming a talented Pianist. Face Elrika at an old fashion recital in a luxury apartment what she could be or may be in Paris. In the glob fashion of such industry, he immediately fell in love and started 'Cherchej La Ferme'. <br /> <br /> Tortured Erika likes for hardcore pornography, which is briefly shown for a few seconds but graphical <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She soon announced her love and followed Erica's Ladies for a long time, where she was involved in smiling and incomplete oral sex. Erika maintains control over her boyfriend's swain. He promised to send a letter to him for more delightful exchanges. In <br /> <br />, a nervous student is gently jealous of Walter's generosity, for which there are literally shirts before rehearsal for some future concerts, Irika fills the student coat pocket with broken glass, the fines of those fine pianos Creates anger. <br /> <br /> Share the next big scene (Genetic Self-displacement etc) with his mother. Erika wants to be dishonored, confused, shrieked, etc. Sensevel Walter became disturbed at this moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> visitors can only fear bad Irika took Walter to the skating rink, where he practiced his ice hockey. They retire from a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to prevent tugging hands at her trousers. Her 'baby gary' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Hmm <br /> <br /> Returning to Walter Eric's apartment, hanging repeatedly on the floor, to snatching but thrashing, perhaps seeking revenge for the reprisal of an insult. Can you guess now? It's not too deep or difficult. Yes, Erica became a hunter, she became a barbarian. At one moment, she locked her mommy in her room and was choking Erica, afterwards she was kissing with her face, having sex with him and renewed her love affair. <br /> <br /> Am I wrong in this summary? If you want to watch the movie, then I do not recommend you <br /> <br /> <br /> If I wanted to challenge human relations through this film Illustrations could have been abandoned in the illustration. But I do not like 'because it is a cheap and painful film that appeals to the foundation of emotion and does not say anything. <br /> <br /> I want to say that parental guardians have been suppressed for love, it is looking for it inefficiently. In pornography, when it is literally released, pink and blurred, under its nose, she senses that she does not feel hurt, blah, blah, blah, etc. <br /> <br /> No explanation for the world, its stunted. He obviously created a demon from a person who was present in the supernatural - but surely we all know that a person is potentially a violent rapist, because it is his essential nature, but he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small turn if there is patience to stay there. Before going to the final scene, where he packs a knife in his handbag, because of working as an alternative to traveling underwear thin student For Walter <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. He did not hurt himself in any lethal area and leaves. Roll credit <br /> <br /> If this is the second prize in Kanas, how bad was the rest?
