Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) got some objects and a pillar from an ancient Indian cemetery in Marissa, and while cleaning a float, they were attacked and killed by Skeleton Man, being a mysterious. Thereafter, the military team, hosted by Captain Layier (Michael Roper), found out two teams of four soldiers who disappeared in the wild. They face Skeleton Man, shooting him while killing each soldier. Then Scrutton Man goes to a power station, and Captain Larry is supernatural to explode the facility of destruction. <br /> <br /> I bought "Sculpton Man" in DVD to watch a fun trash, but I became very annoying. , With shoot and explosion, annoying and intelligent shit. The impossible story is completely disconnected and it does not give any idea and the military team is made up of immersils, which shoots until the supernatural skeleton man is completely killed. Their leader is also the most stupid, with the complete advantage of eliminating the extinction of the legendary warrior hunter till the end of the destruction of Rip-Off. In DVDs, it is possible to use the fast forward button along with the movie and reduce the grief of the viewer. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sculpton Man"
