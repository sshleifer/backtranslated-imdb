Lucio Flori, a director who was not well-known for his neutrality, advised him to be sick of the black magic of Touch of Death, made for a TV movie about Lester Parrons (Bret Halsey), a psychologist who was killed in the murder of rich and wealthy widows. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> did not proceed Ntrana, a mysterious killer and some heavy handed kapityata 'comedic' scene involves the introduction of a strange sub-plot. There are many graphic killings which are extremely violent and horrific in true flower fashion, but it does not stop due to the high level of blood pressure and even the poor efforts of Phuli. <br /> <br /> She gets along with many other films like me, when Lucie is behind the camera, a comprehension story is not right in the agenda. This movie has many extraordinary things which made me a bit annoying: Why did Lester start using the method of elimination of his first victim? Why are all its victims hairy or nasty? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not understand its popularity, I have seen most of his films so far that lack both proper reporting and technical skills. Touching death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
