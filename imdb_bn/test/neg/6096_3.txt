I can only assume that the previous post production company came from execs ... <br /> <br /> was present in the UK premiere last night. Jane and Brooke were present (perhaps they knew I was there) and undoubtedly they were big, but one of the movies is Turkey. I sometimes feel sorry for them, when the audience laughs out in a serious 'thriller' scene. <br /> <br /> But perhaps I was missing the point. Probably the tongue-in-cheek was a material object. If so, pure talent If not, career genocide. <br /> <br /> Plus, Jane is always burning, and Brook can actually work a little bit. The other half said (as we ran in the movie, broke the broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this photo because they both seem to be wonderful people! Script writer, however, should be marooned.
