Tele Savalas Performed as a pano villa, notorious Mexican band / revolutionist in this account of Villa's RAID in Columbus, New Mexico City in 1916. Villa is really a historical person who I am not. I am very familiar, so I will not say much about the film's historical details. As a movie, it's not cool, though it's a smattering of both action and humor here and there. Colonel Wilcox's Chuck Connors' performance of US Army civilian commander near Caucus was lifted up, and Clint Walker as Villa's Gringo Sidekick Scotty did not do much for me. The movie is definitely a fantastic low budget effort in limited technical standards. For just one and a half hour, with a runtime, I have to say that this movie has been dragged into places in particular in the last 20 minutes. The United States Villas Attack was an interesting (if overall, planned content plans, not particularly important) historical sidebar, and possibly better treatment. 4/10
