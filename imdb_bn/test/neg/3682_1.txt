Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror film, not thriller, nor suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Horribly bad. After many years of hiding here at IMDB, I have really been setting up an account so that I can warn people (here at least one critic) do not see this movie! If it is not wise enough to hit your fast forward button, it may make you want to lose your bad or low-key movie, or at least desire for your life. <br /> The truth is, they loved listening to the sound of "advanced" DVDs (another terrible thinking) that they were thinking about what they thought. Producers say that there was enough number of suckers to break the image of Wall Kilmer at least international distribution. <br /> <br /> I was unfortunately unsuccessful in choosing movies to watch, which is a subtitle in the Russian dialogue. That does not mattered much to that. Stop listening to Russian, translate it into your head (if you can), just make it hard to tell how neutral it is. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie "1" because I can not give it a lower rating, and because it has achieved a tremendous thing. It somehow does not feel clotrophobic in a completely subterranean movie. Now it's a doubtful achievement. Here's your spinner: And last, holy mother (no curse) It's like they've gone out of money and decided to stop filming right away. The film's "climax" literally ends within a few seconds, and I am sometimes resolved by the easiest counter that I have seen in the film. If you see it yourself, apply your easy exiting process to the Close button.
