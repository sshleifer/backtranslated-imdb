If you really want to enjoy Don Wheeler's Magic (?), Check "Allian Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but it's not. The Alien Factor is rather fantastically less expensive considering the budget, and it is fairly vague, but "nightwish", which I guess is like the update of Allian Factor, it's just plain mobile phones. The actor tries to sleep through his role, especially Mr. Montone Sheriff, and instead of the bizarre (but stupid) looking critter of the giant Alien Factor, there are some stupid Halloween-mask stuff. There is a crossover crash in the world and of course there is a critter inside, who runs around the vaporizing people. And tear the arms etc. And he has a calm ray gun that he uses to evaporate people until it gets out of his hands. And that's really about it. "Allian Factor" hits these messs, but if you really want to see a good Don Dahler movie then check it instead. And RIP Don Dahler, 12/2/06.
