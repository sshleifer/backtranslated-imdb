I go to this game and I feel right. I just expected a little more. Hacking the main problem with it is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions, you can not get it. Also the graphics are not as good as Pandora Tim and double agents. This game can do with some improvements, it says that if the guard is wet in the water and you hit a sticky whistle in the water then the guard will break but nothing will happen. In my opinion these three are the worst out. I did not play the first but Pandora played this and the double agent yesterday. This game deserves a 4/10 though. Can do with some improvements.
