I had no idea that this movie was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is lame enough. Why do they make a movie by this name and make their name more soil ?? I found it a complete disappointment. If I knew that this movie was becoming stupid, I would have stayed home and had some other recreational activities. Of course, I would give them cool effects credit; But as a murderer he may not feel as terrible. She lacks a number But I will give them instructions for you. Plot was a great idea, could only be done in a very good way. Probably in the future, WWW will live from his Moroccan wrestling and stay away from the film industry.
