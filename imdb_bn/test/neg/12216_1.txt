I ordered this movie on the internet because the Turkish movies where we live is very difficult to find. I have heard from all of my friends about TV series and Turkey's work, I look forward to seeing a breakthrough in Turkish movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> I and my husband (a Turkish movie starter and a Turkish movie starter who only sees it through) because we paid for $ 20 DVD for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is confusing It was not, but adding people to the dogs in the ocean with dogs and using some toilet humor in the script to create 'Hollywood' does not work for me. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost scary that it was not funny and was not realistic and as mentioned by other users, Turkish customs and lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Camera movement was of no importance. Adding some cinnamon (never seen in cartons) and broken plates - Greek style - only makes the film more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am shy of this movie and all the words of the way the news was made. Certainly sure movies are made by Turkish operators, which deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I can give this movie 1 out of 10.
