The image was half as much as I was able to determine what was going to happen. This is a movie dog breakfast about four families, Thanksgiving dinner. Cliches and stereotypes tumble on each other. After ten hours when --- all is okay, it seems like ten hours --- you are surprised at everything about what. I do not want to see a movie about squabbling dinner table. My own family has enough. Turkey looked very well. The rest of the people unknow me.
