Do not watch this movie, go to see something else ... I was very frustrated, I can not give this movie a rating better than 3. Acting was great and I really like Villam Duffo as villain, but I can not see why this movie made it big screen. The story is outdated and shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ TV series / movies. The main problem is basically nothing happens. Let's kidnap, let the murderer pay the wife of the kidnapper, the police look stupid and annoying and extend it in 95 minutes, got your "clearing" movie. Only 1 because I could not rate it 1 was one) Dofo and b) "Plan-B-Ending". There is not enough time you can not afford a kidnapping movie ... 75% End of this ending ends with A, 20% ending B and 1% incomplete something. Annoying, annoying, annoying
