This movie is recommended only for insomnia: It will help them to rest by keeping them asleep. The five year old could enjoy it But for somebody else (with successive fans), what a boom! The "ancient" plot is memorable of "Return of the Dragon", and this movie is just as inefficient, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is a bad movie. So far, this second (objectionable "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first movie) I gave 1/10.
