(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" is something like this. The down-their-fortune farmer's pot ends up growing. DEA Agent hit in the city. The farmers hide the pot DEA Agent leave the city. The story ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This Flickr features some other stereoscopic features by artist, middle direction and so much screenplay ... but it did not get any stories. . And since the story is the basis of each drama, "cash crop" is a complete failure. Very annoying recommendation
