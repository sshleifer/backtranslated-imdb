CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ out of 5 stars) is a harmful excuse for a movie ... If you really enjoy annoying, obscene jungle movies like torch in the scene of graphic violence. To search emerald and cocaine for a pair of drug dealers traveling to the jungle of Paraguay. They meet other young travelers and their two hot babes Sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist who has definitely wanted to prove that cancer had never existed and it did not even exist. One of the two vendors turned into psychopaths and told him to hide where he was seized his jewels and tortured him and killed a few natives. (And how can they tell him that he does not seem to speak his language for the first time?) Well, the netizens are not immediately thrilled with the white people in the jungle and they have taken them all for some revenge tortures. Poor performance, poor plot and poor direction. There is no sensational moment for the entire 90-minute draw. Even special effects are not particularly believable (but some shots will still keep most visitors crawling). The only good picture of the whole movie is that when two women are captured in mud mud and the heart of the Natives touches in the presentation of "Red River Valley". The picture below is a quote from the quote but I would not be surprised that many viewers are not saying the same thing at this point: "Oh God, please let him die soon ... Oh, let him die soon, please die soon."
