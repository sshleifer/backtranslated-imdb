I could crap a good movie It is a waste of time and money. It makes me sick that such films are actually being created and people really think that they are good. When I like teen comedies, they are well done. Although this movie, this genre takes a new low. With such films, people think that it is really good to create this throat and to ask the uncertain people to pay for it to sit. This is sadness
