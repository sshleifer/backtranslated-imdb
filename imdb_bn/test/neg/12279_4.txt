This movie is still exciting with violent, original dialogues and cool letters. This is a most moving story and very true in life. The film began with activist Leo Fong, who is heading towards the end of his career, who is frustrated in a big case involving corruption, blackmail and murder. This is where the killing started. From the beginning to the end, Fong distributed this action should see the caper. This film is co-star Richard Randry. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this baby as a child, but when I grew up I realized that this film is very beautiful and not very good. I will not recommend this photo and it is very bad.
