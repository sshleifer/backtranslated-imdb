Hey everyone, I want to give you some crazy information about this movie. I was actually one of the make-up FX artists who helped create "animals" for this movie and I would tell you that the original animals have looked absolutely amazing. I think when we got back the first pictures from the set, we were all talking about this shame that this creature was in a movie that would probably be quite poor. <br /> <br /> What really happened was Jason Palmer's original make-up for Saskatcheck, but for some reason she was again shot again. Sadly, Jason had died in the weeks before, and the rebuilt creature was not close to being as real as one. It was quite sad for me because it was Jason's final movie, and she got cheated to find her final fame due to bad re-shoots. However, I thought that you can find a tad interesing, and if you want you can go to mmmyeah.com and see some "behind the scenes" photo. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, Jeff
