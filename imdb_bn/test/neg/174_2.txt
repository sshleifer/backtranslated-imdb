I heard people compare this movie. I would never guess how this comparison was made, because this movie was not comparable to Sideways in any way. <br /> <br /> These 2 films were different from Star Wars and Thornbirs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've never seen worse camera work in my life and I'm comparing it with home videos taken by people of 5 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm giving these two stars, only for interesting interviews of French wine type and how to show American wine companies pushy and corrupted (all companies are pushy and not corrupt?) I think it's 10-stars Yes, it's negative 10) to provide, harmful, terrible, terrible, terrible, VERTIGO-INDUCING, 5-year-old-good camera mess.
