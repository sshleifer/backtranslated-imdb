This film tries very hard for the movie "Action", but it unfortunately fails. <br /> <br /> Steve Gutenberg plays the head of an elite counter-terrorist team who tries to keep a mysterious group (?) fail. From a deadly nerve agent to steal. <br /> <br /> Story ... acting ... special effects ... all flat flat !!! <br /> <br /> Definitely must be avoided! !!!
