Lack of touch to JP 3 Spieberg. This is an all-out attack on the emotional "dinosaur" in your mouth. This image was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell to see. <br /> <br /> Script link! Asking it at once and then missing many questions answered. Also, we do not really get gratitude for all the precious people. For example, William H. Messi is very talented to compete with Deano-Thogs for our attention. And Laura Darn was especially sympathetic to JP1; In this film, he simply embodies a hug on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The full JP3 experience was you. Too much noise, many surprises, very few letters are going to die, too much expected, vicious violence. <br /> <br /> Wise word: Close this island. <br /> <br /> (I've rated 3 ratings for this special effect; I've closed other 7 points for any originality.)
