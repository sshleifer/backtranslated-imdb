I love the so-called "Blaxploitation" film and have seen dozens. Cotton comes to Harlem, Shetf and Hammer, has some great value and it is very entertaining, although many are very cheap and stupid, but still entertaining, such as the Brotherhood of Death or Coffin. However, Dolmate manages rarely for style - it's simply cheap and stupid and not least bit fun! A few years ago, I saw a takeoff on "Mad TV" in Dolmeight movies and, unfortunately, the true dolmet is not good at all. Like parody, acting is just rogue. Rudy Ray Moore Balasa has a piece of wood to have all the charm and charisma. He can rarely read his line and his joke is a joke - his kicks have repeatedly missed the target. As the rest of the actor, many can be even worse. My favorite FBI guy who could not remember his line and really struggled to find them - but they were not bothering again in this scene! In fact, most of it was unaware that it was difficult for me to determine whether the film was used in a fun way. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite these awesome performances and performances, this image is worth seeing, you are wrong. Even expecting to see some skin, will be disappointed for perverts. Nude women in the film look like really unfortunate prostitutes and nothing becomes as remote as their breathing bodies. I think the old people look nude - actually old people are naked - this is not worse than "women". And for Rudy Ray, he has "male boobs". Any black super hero or anti hero that should look bad nude !! For goodness, keep your clothes people and do not see it that come with a script winos !!! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently, this movie has sequels! ! I can not imagine watching them, so you have to find someone else to review them. I have seen panel 9 out of spaces, outer space and robot monitors, but I do not think that I can bring myself to see another dolmet film - they're too bad!
