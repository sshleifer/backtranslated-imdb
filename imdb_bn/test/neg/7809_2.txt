The dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (as Tom Stinsfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Stars Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Miss Red thinks Mr Kutcher Gay Kurt works for Red Babe, an anus retentive Terrence Stump (as Jack Taylor). Kurt agreed to "house" for the boss, believing that it would take him to Reid. Mr Stamp has a pet owl "OJ", which becomes a toilet cocktail. <br /> <br /> It is limited to "G-rated" pre-teenager "R-rate" rentals, a movie to get you limited. This is if they did not see the plot before, and especially like Moroccan rattles. Remember, people pay for doing this. <br /> <br /> ** My Boss Girl (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, his Red, Terrence Stamp
