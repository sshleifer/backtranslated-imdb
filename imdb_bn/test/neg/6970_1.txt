Considering the film's reputation as the worst, I was waiting to see Woods Crumpas Opps (my word); The other Woods I saw is no longer necessary - but the referee Madness (1938) film making school, GLEN or GLENDA does not easily come as 'enjoyable' with its success. <<br /> Also, this must have emerged as the legend of Heroes, Nadir of Lughosi (his directorial debut with three directors): It is surprising that he was genuinely aware of what kind of film (considering the history of the actor), heavy medicines And the camera's mere stupidity). Besides, Lugosi's stupid delivery is perhaps the most painful of her here ... even though the Wood script is likely to blame it - the impossible conversation (repeated with "puppy-dog tail" and "big fat snack"), he handed the sick! However, wood itself plays a central role (under the name of Daniel Davies) - and, like this region, being perfect, proven dog has become! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was likewise uninterrupted (he was also present in Jail Byte [1954] ... but, at least, the painting where Glenn finally gave her Angozer sweater wear; Tim Burton's boyfriend Biopic ed Wood (1994) His famous poster! Eventually, the modern film is present in the potentially fantastic meeting between Wood and Ocean Wells - for all purposes and purposes, Gullen or Glenda ed Wood is in Citizen's ear (1941), which is a shocking tale: In fact, Most threads of the plot are in stock footage galleries (many of it are irrelevant, such as the wonderful examples of S & M) and the sequence of intrinsic dreams. (Is highlighted by the presence of an unclear giant, which will highlight the harmful stupid eyebrows that Martin Scorsese weeps with jealousy)! The film's cordial effort, however, can be hit by each and every run by perfect amateurity of expression, appealing for the explanation / attempt of transvestism for tolerance and psychological discovery. <br /> <br /> How much is it worth? I saw an "Extended Re-Issue Version", which was unsecured for six minutes' unused footage (directed by Dr. Mary Kennel) on the original release! In addition, my copy was often stagnant (which forced me to bring the audio back to the track for a little bit back) - though, thanks to it, it was a mistake to convert the source of DVX, which opposed the film.
