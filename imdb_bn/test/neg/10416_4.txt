Although it is mostly a well-designed piece of film making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already frustrated, this movie will send you to the end. <br /> <br /> If you feel somewhat depressed, this picture will be another topic in your life, which will be bitter. If you think that it is your fate to see a movie that has been completely destroyed for the time being selected. No, you will not be able to make it through this movie (I've 'b', btw), your life is so safe with more knowledge than gym. Then you may think that you have fooled yourself, and it is actually a lot worse than you previously understood. You might feel a bit annoyed to get your attention at Jim. You can slap him around a bit with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> Sad, as much as I wanted to like this movie ... I hate it. It takes a long sad road rather than a great path and then suddenly, for no reason, for any reason, look back at yourself and then close. <br /> <br /> Jim does not have an epiphany, at least one that is not mentioned on the screen. Jim has a sad life and an unfortunate set of options. He invented something which could be related to anyone and failed to make any significant progress in his journey of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Certainly no one can write Happy Ending of this movie. Others say it's not a Hollywood story, it's great and it's real. It is made well. Life is a struggle at times. If someone wants to know "the answer", they can shout from the roof. <br /> <br /> I still feel cheated because the movie pretends to say something. You think that it's going to say something, if you suffer a little bit of it, then it will have something to say. It will stop you and think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Strategy for using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it is completely missed.
