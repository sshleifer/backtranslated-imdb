I hope this film is to be shown primarily before the election. Bush signals give the last shot! This movie was just awful but I still see this. ** Small Spyler ** I think CBS has got the same people who gave semi-half-minute memos. What's with the bad boyfriend story? The performance can increase further or the dialogue may be more like the movie Ed Wood. Who came with this script please write off Close. If you want to see the appropriate B-grade disaster film then see earthquake, flood etc. Avoid this mess of film. CBS hints to avoid showing us this shit. Let us re-run the CSI instead. Good acting and more credible
