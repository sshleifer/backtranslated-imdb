I incorrectly caught this in the flipping channel in the middle. I immediately recognized almost everyone in Caste, "Groovey" on one side of the haircut, and wondered what kind of films can attract such cast of past and future stars? If not seen the original, I supposed it could be Poseidon Adventure, it was probably a ship of trouble. I was wrong! For my life, I can not imagine why any of these great (or committed) actors and actresses would allow any name to be associated with their trash. There is no story, performance compels everyone, letters are a parody of the natural disaster film roles, which suddenly unite by an event, and the bumper sticker encourages the real meaning of life at the level of philosophy. <Br /> <br /> Only Sally Field, Michael Kain, etc are just good enough to see the terrible performances unusually. They will need money badly. Can we blame the manager?
