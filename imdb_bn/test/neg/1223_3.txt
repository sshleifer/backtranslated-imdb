I saw all three categories and story lines are so frustrating. Jhan spent so much time in mourning that he did nothing more to hear Duval. And Tommy Lee Jones will not be so weak as a young man, unlikely yes but never weak. We never see why they go back to Lonesome Dove ... which is basically a dirty hole ... why they will leave Austin all the time, where they are heroes ... to do nothing during the whole movie ... I'm shooting for Blue Dook I was transformed and he was completely wrong. There are no warnings about how many segments there are ... it ends. This mini-series can be "somebody" ... sad It was like parrot and guided by Jag
