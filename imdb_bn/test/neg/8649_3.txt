If this film is silent then French will be to reduce silence. Do not take a cast of completely unlike characters, they have nothing to say, immerse yourself into the whole thing with vicious violence, and you've got an excited dash source. Subtitles can be "Sleazy Hollywood Style Trying to Make Money From Chinatown Rip Off". One minute of Bruce Darne is better than anything from this flick. However, I did not like the film.
