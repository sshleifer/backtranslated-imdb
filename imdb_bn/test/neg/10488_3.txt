Well it's very awesome, and I'm very scary, easy to skip this film. What do you expect from Carroll Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman, and my personal favorite Roger Ready for headlines, summaries and actors? Yes, B Star John Agar is here as a sheriff out to rescue Robot-like Ape Texas from a NASA test here. The movie has tremendous performance, awesome scenery, awesome special effects, and awesome lighting. You can not do anything bad, as long as I can not find anything good to find other bad things other than bad films. It has many moments of portable short and unexpected humor. Missed cues, unclear pas, off-screen terrorism, an incredibly inane score, and certainly John Agar try to best his level to be the origin of the film with a perfect performance in this muck. The beginning is the toughest part, because it appears that these two teenagers seem to be benefited forever to travel on the road behind Texas, where they will take retaliation very soon and take their own vengeance ... yes right! Night Fear! Ah!
