**** Contains spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a Rachel Leigh Cook dog fan, I've come to the end to see this show so that I can see it. I can see it many times so I pressed it, and there is something about this show that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that it was a TV-making movie. Not only that, but it was created for lifetime, which is a channel which I despise. Because it was made for TV, I could ignore huge plot holes. I can ignore the huge lack of character development of Eli Shady character. I'm George C. Scott and Rachel Leigh Cook Cook, who were both very talented actors, could definitely have avoided, of course, they did not reach the best of their skills. Don Dimont's character was so clever that I saw that when you saw him, he was a villain. I can also overcome the obvious mistake in the timeline (she is raped during her winter break, and then she has her baby for more than a year.) <br /> <br /> More than what I can not get: two for child custody Trial In the first trial, Hefajat's children were given to the father because he "earned a degree in educated, well-educated college and had full-time jobs."

The child is <br /> <br /> This problem is that during the trial, a 30-year-old girl rape a 15-year-old girl and brings her pregnancy to consideration! Whether or not he is raped or not, he had sex with a minor! Do not consider the judge choosing to keep him in custody because he is a "mature adult?" Adults do not have sex with adults! <br /> <br /> This is not the worst cable movie you can see, but this is not a great show. ** **** Outside
