What the world needs - another superficial cookie-cutter Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen film. This movie gives horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereototype "Junior High" experience. They all do something to learn to think nothing completely prohibited. I can not stand a fake French accent, or those boys who ran in the mopeds who finally "fell" for juniors. Why am I putting everything in the bracket? Because of all its stereotyped reasons. The pair is not even accused of having a stereotypical grandfather. They should even be happy that they have a grandfather all. How is this Mary-Kate / Ashley mold suitable? Those who have been fixing a single guy in this one (gasp !!) are their dad !!!!! Yes, folks, they are actually a mother who is present for five seconds. I was not sitting in this thirty minutes and I can already say how it ends. This movie is so kind, it is Miss American as an academic bowl. Really
