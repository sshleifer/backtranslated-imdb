I originally saw "Griesel" for the presence of Michael Door, as I enjoyed his fan screenplay in Star Trek TNG, but he never saw him from his makeup. Dorn seems to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, with a social conscience, type of thought. Yes --- for 1965. Today, the themes are so appealing to the so-called "palms" of Spike Lee's even that of Belberd and Sophomerick and Karnabala. <br /> <br /> This crime-copper flick has twice the complicated laboratory - triple-, and quadrilateral-cross, but the plot scheme is so gradually that it breaks itself in the first 30 minutes. In most cases, I only saw the speed, and a low interest about how each scene will work. Here's a cool throw - you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from the better movie. Why are they all? I was suspect 1) working, and even some money, even if decent. 2) Perhaps the director knows these actors playing classes and social connections around LA - you know, maybe they participated in his support as a fellow-struggling film on the third and fourth levels of the Hollywood scene. Well ... but the movie was half-baked --- really "finished." I gave it 3, though my affection for the actors was devaluating my respect for their previous work. Let's hope everyone has done more professional, more carefully, and has come to more thorough projects.
