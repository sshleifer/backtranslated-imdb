"Red Sonaza" is faulty, weak and lacking. Even the camp-ness is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "red gold"; Clothing (Although the red gold costume is ridiculous, although it is such an ironic that the woman is afraid to touch the male due to being raped, even when she rains, she likes to wear very little clothes.) And the music is by Ennio Morricone. Still, the movie is somewhat noticeable, but certainly not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple and they are not even bothered to make it interesting. Some good action sequences and some laughs, but the story may have been forgotten, both are present, but in many cases it is seriously defective. The movie itself feels very serious and tries to print but fails completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know who is bad? Hers or Arnie's on top; He can not work There is absolutely no chemistry between two letters that makes the story of love incredible. Sandhal Bergman was worse, who was a chief villain who worked worse than papers. Ronald Lacey had some good role in his role, but my God he looked terrible, he made a lot of changes from his (only well-known) role of "The Lost Ark Riders". Maybe there is something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991? And anyway, what did all the actors in the movie do with "The Lost Ark's Riders"? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Toot Lemko appeared in a role, it seemed like a reunion of "riders of the Lost Ark". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attractive (sword) during the war, many of them are useless and weak <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
