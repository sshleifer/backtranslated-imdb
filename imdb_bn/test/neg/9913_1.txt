Anyone who has complained about Peter Jackson for making a film, he has to sit through this CBS "Event". The 45-minute story has been padded for 2 hours with unnecessary subopts, which combines blood-to-play TV drama clich√©s. Bad science is a major reason for fatal weather disasters, so I'm not going to complain about it. Foolish science may be fun to see if it is executed in a fun fashion. Everyone can be overthrown without destroying the 10 subplots ... which are considered to be central plot, how to kill this movie. A character tornado Tommy, who is very boring stereootype, for viewing in section 6. <br /> <br /> Remember that I am not bothered to comment on special effects. Their quality should come as no surprise. <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
