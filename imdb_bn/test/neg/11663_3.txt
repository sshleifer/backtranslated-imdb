"Confusion" When you see this glimpse, you get the experience and then believe that you saw something worthwhile. In the CA desert, there is nothing better than three semi-psychic travelers who say this is an amateur and simply stupid fool The film is mentioned in a horror story, a lousy screenplay, and just a few mention of some terrible aspects.
