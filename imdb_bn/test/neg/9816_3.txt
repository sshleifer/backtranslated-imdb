A dried teeny Linna Quigley drinks milk, strips and murders her sister and her sister's lover after sexual harassment. He goes to a refugee, two blackmails out of his mental institution (one by one "Carroll Burnt Show" regularly played by Lyle Wagner), with a best friend from Amy (Karen Russell) and sleeping with their psychologists. Outside, these two men hate the mafia princess (!) Stop taking their medicines and invite their six big boys to a large party house where they are very seriously arranged by a glove, skin and skin. The Secret Mystery Killer. <br /> <br /> Fierce David Burton FX is so bloody, but it is so absurd that they take the quality of one type of qualitative value. Goes for the same movie. The conversation is so weird and isolated, the film is so unreliably read and edited and acting and in other worlds, you start to doubt your individuality. This image actually tries to have a plot and three-dimensional character, but it is so badly directed that what if Ed Wood rewrites the Eggman Bergman script! And it has a mature morality like a good bargain movie - a good person needs a "decent" person, so "enough to keep your disguise" will be enough girl. See it for yourself ... no! <br /> <br /> Lina (the only reason I was interested in seeing at the beginning) is a lot of fun, there are more conversations than normal and different eye-popping nude scenes. . Unfortunately, he has completely disappeared from the final third of this film and suffers from the film. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
