Forgive me, but director Peter is horrible. If you can not come to us with a plot, why not kill a cat or a dog. That has surely reached the audience. This viewer is tired of seeing animals dedicated to the plot of a movie. And, believe me, I saw it coming before the package opened. How can you guess A cute creature then killed it in a horrible way. I was not a fan of De Mornei and why did this performance tell me. Briefly and briefly explain, I found her rather silly and definitely annoying. I liked Bandar, but it seemed bad that he had to play against De Marna. She did much good in other films in "Philadelphia" where she had some honesty in her dialogue. In this brown he tried his best to keep his character real. But the author, Green and Rush, did a good job in preventing it with their curiosity and conflict dialogue. Please do not let us enjoy such entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by freaky plots, intelligent animals and usually long wind chimes. I got to go away with him, make me mad.
