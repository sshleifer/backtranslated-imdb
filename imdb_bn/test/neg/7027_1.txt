"Maem" is a disgrace to many things - Lucile Ball, a story that has been called many times and in the overall music style. Mr Ball did not understand his character at all and he seems to be heavy-sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but it's not enough. Production is very chic and cheap looking, sub-par songs, and almost every joke misfires. Also, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to be slow gradually to avoid all costs, but to see the delight "Annie Maam."
