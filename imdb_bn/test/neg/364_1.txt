After all, let me start by saying "The Outsiders" and "The Hit Hit", as a loyal follower of C Thomas Howell's career. He was an up-and-coming star in 1980 - with hits such as "Soul Man". The future was brilliant for this young actor and there was the possibility of going away and really insisted on himself in Hollywood. Put it this way - there was a part of Tom Cruise's "Outside", when the Haol went on to leadership. See cruise today !!! But the picking material like this drill will simply deny the carrier's carrier more - if it is possible. Why does he like things? A small part of a bigger movie than the hard-hitting will be more beneficial for him. <br /> <br /> Originally the story is held in the eponymous world where everyone is underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a shepherd - protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing a donor. He is a hit people in other words. <br /> <br /> Sets are so bad, they will not be out of the Thunderbirds episode. Slower usage repeats unexpectedly throughout the film, but it is well-backed by bad acting (and bad is a similar word here), any consistency, scenes thrown at any reason for any reason, that they seem to be on a corn flakes box and stupidity From a directional style that bordered Oh yeah, and the storyline was very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> I hate writing bad reviews about movies - especially those I love really like - but this film is so bad that I do not believe in it for a second that anyone can be proud of it. I am not a film producer and I am not a director, but I will hide the amount of money and time I used to spend in this movie. <br /> <br /> In childhood - it was a retention time and energy and I would never recommend anyone watching this film. I came free to buy a DVD player but I still turned things through half because I was still embarrassed for the Hawl. Come to C - Give yourself some credit and keep yourself away from these unexpected surprises and try wolf down and take a good part - but small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because of the setting for 0/10.
