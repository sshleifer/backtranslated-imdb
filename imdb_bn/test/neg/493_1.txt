This movie was based on the departure of Rob's Halford of Judas Priest of British Metal Gods and how the band replaced him with Ripper Oven, who stood in front of Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God might be some great in this movie. Instead, someone in the office who does not know anything about metal music decides to drain the water. From the change of Metal Gaud's title to the street 'Safe' road 'Rock Star' to Lam Soundtrack, the film plays badly. I was really waiting to see my professional life ending in the metal band, and many points of the film made me very less. The soundtrack is not very metallic for one, and the end of the film is LAM. There are some brilliant spots in the film and the actors but overall it fails as a whole ... 1) A film based on the metal band should have a metallic soundtrack. 2) There is no metal about Marquee Mark or Jennifer Aniston. The idea of ​​'Heavy Metal' is to see the film, Jovi, Warrant, Def leopard and poison. Your idea of ​​Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio and Black Sebastart shows the film for a good smile.
