When I first read about "Berlin amer" I did not expect much. But I made a trivial movie about the right people, the exact location, the right music and the fashion that at least seem to talk about Hip Berlin. But eissler fails, it is so ridiculously unreasonable. This is the complete lie of what is happening in the so-called Berlin scene. Of course it's not about Hippens, but you can expect more from a movie sold as a "Movies in the movie". <br /> <br /> And in addition to all the credibility stuff, it's actually a bad movie. Medium acting and a rather annoying plot. Interesting some actors have proven in other movies that they are genuinely gifted. So it will be really poor indicator skills. <br /> <br /> Do not bother watching "Berlin Mango Me" until the age of 17, coming from some small town in West Germany and after completing school you want to go to the big city after you. Then you could actually find it enjoyable and completely cool.
