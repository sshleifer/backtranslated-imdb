This anger has so much failed to make me angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtleties and compositions of Regio's first films have gone, there is nothing but the hash of digital memorized images, whose only purpose is to do terrible bad things. Star Trek-like warmhell graphics, slow-colored sassapps, obviously the confusion of counterfeit computer icons and athletic competition shots which, incidentally, show that no one ever was able to top (or even match) Lenny Rafnstahl. In the 1980s, dynamic film companies "Do Hu", a producer of "civilized violence", associated with a spinal cord, "recklessly" refused, edited together with an overlay of video color? There is no intellectual, emotional, or finger link between the RAJOO and multiple digital effects artists collected and modified, and I want to warn that he wants to guess the warning story. With all of the "dramatic advisers" involved, some shake their own feelings of saying something important and believe that they are all failing to say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch a lot of television can make such a movie and believe it is meaningful; This kindergarten stan brakage, and finally uninterrupted in its uninterrupted clarity. Here is the only irony and tension (in contrast to "Quanissacatio" where the strangeness of the evergreen looks and surprising general pictures forced you to consider them) when I watched the DVD shake and dropped it. This note is based on reflection instead of MTV, reflection and reflection for Chomsky crowd. Two stars for the Glass Piece-Caesar Frank-style music, and some enthusiastic tailoring features from Yo-Yo. (I hope for him that he does not have to record his part in the playback of the film; there is something that you do not even have to do for piccine.)
