If you describe any of the scenes; The nightmare of your children in your sleep, your daughter's daughter, while talking to the ghosts, looking for a missing child at your abandoned child's night, fears that your blood is falling from the blood of the murdered blood. From the floor above ?? Then I'll say you're a horror movie. But some how 'Wicked Little Things' was not just scary. I loved a horror fan and I position, the main plot and I liked three leading ladies. I do not want to see them hurt, I want 'bad guy' to get just a dessert, the rest of the cast always wants the canoe sheets, so I was two-way with them and it played each clich√©. The book - even in the torch battery, even the pitch is running in the dark, as you turn off the voices here. <br /> <br /> I still recommend you see it, but if you are new to horror movies or under 12, you will meet it all before.
