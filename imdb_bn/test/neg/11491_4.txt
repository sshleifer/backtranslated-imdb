Freddie Fasith has come up with a story that will convince Putin of Russia's western suspicions. Forrest Rushki established a ugly person who wants to return the country to the President - Stalin's communistism is not so much but Hitlerian fascism is even more. In fact, his political manifesto could have come out of Main Kampf instead of Marx. And, the ultimate destruction of biological destruction of the Russian Federation of Lun for the cleaning of ethnic cleansing popes. American tenants understand the dreams of his fantasy, genocide with the Russian issue, but then enter Pat Swie's dirty dance ... and, yes, the things are really down and dirty. He is a former US operator-turned drift, Jason Monck, who is listed by the British Government to see what the Russians have. Like a little sidebar, the voice of sweat is a monk! (!) A Russian beauty Allen (played by Pretty Marta Kandova) has performed in the previous mission of the former committee state. Hardman Swayze sets out to defeat the evil Russians, who make a passable job. But young actress Marta Kandova steals Flickr as her 18-year-old Russian daughter Alan's newborn, who threatens her father to threaten her favorite mother Russia.
