I was very excited to see this movie in the first place but one of our teams decided to look at it at night. I started arriving and started walking and tried to get my money back in this movie. I think the movie is very boring, selfish, and not true in many aspects, including "gaming". I have tried my best to not be able to sleep during the movie because I have seen one of the worst horror films ever seen. The scary movie series was scarier than this movie. A gothic girl, an overworked business man, and 15 year old geek, and some random guy in a video game that is a tragedy in a bad plot to start with an audacious killer. Then they tried to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kissed another girl 10 minutes after killing her girlfriend and saving her. The movie was packed while the film began, and more than half of the people went away before the end was over. If you want to waste your time just 1 hour and 16 minutes to see this moment ... be ready to feel cheated.
