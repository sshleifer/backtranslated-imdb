After reading the reviews, I am not the only person I am so disappointed in this movie that I feel very relieved! I've read a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, all his books, most of them more than once. Of course I love the notebook and the walk to remember ... I have not seen the message yet in bottles or at night, so I can not comment on them ... <br /> <br /> But I've seen this past weekend, dear people and I was very annoyed! The film was not good! While singing movies alone, and not thinking about the book, it was still a terrible movie. I did not receive a lot of emotions and results from this movie which I enjoyed from other movies, especially The Notebook. I was laughing and crying and worried and not afraid! From the very beginning I noticed how everything changed! Similar to the book, the only thing about this movie is that there is a man named John, who is not Savannate and Svenvan is not the daughter .... His father is being overwhelmed with coins, his part is just part of the book that went alongside other parts. Everything else completely closed !!!! Firstly, Alan's younger brother in the book, not his son! Why did they change that, I do not understand. How much more intelligent it was in the book when Team Sawanah was just some older and they grew up together and allen wanted to work with horses and autistic children. Saavanah was inspired by .... which did not happen in the movie .... oh ... And in the book they spent more than the first two weeks and then 1 night ... why they went back and forth ??? I could go but still without the place! So basically, if you are a great fan of Nicholas Sparks, then do not waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and nothing like book!
