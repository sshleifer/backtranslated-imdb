Every movie Quantin Tarantino has become worse. I would like to believe that most people will agree with that statement, but as shown in the "Ingredients (sic) Basterds (sic)" ratings of 8.5 / 10, from 100,000 ratings, there is no sense that this general film does not seem like a public. Even his best work, Researcher Dogs, was not 'Best Composition'. The problem that you claim to like the work of Tarantino has become commonplace. As soon as possible, you are ready and willing to make the boat people happy in another bandwagon. They will ridiculously play the terrible act and completely ignore self-motivated writing, so that they can be part of the exclusive club called "Everyone". This movie is so horrific, I swear that it will definitely be a little bit of a joke to see how much her tanto will tolerate torture and still appreciate her. Already, like other critics, it has been said: "The previous Tarantino movies were from the people of love with other movies, it came from a person of love with his own writings." I could not agree more. This film is nothing more than high school and dictatorship, which is made with the ability to play high school sports. However, thanks to the general public coming to the public, I am sure that it is still one of the best films to be made. Bravo, Tarantino You've always pulled one of the best real joke out of all time.
