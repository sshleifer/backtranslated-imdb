This hurley was performed in the 1920's. A black-owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt police officers. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's Terrible Vanity Project. It tries to mix comedy and drama and both fail. The comedy is not funny and plays dramatic and poorly. You think three comedy legends - a film with Eddie Murphy, Reddd Fox and Richard Prior would be great, but not so. There is a nonstop oath and the open scene shot a young man in the shooting of a dead person (it seems right). Also we have a beautiful lace rhes that are dereaded playing Madame. One of the "comedic" highlights has long, unreasonable and deadly fierce battles between her and her dying. An annoying, offensive and stupid mess. The worst Murphy movie is not quite pretty but. A 1 all the way.
