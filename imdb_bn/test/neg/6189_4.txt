Do not redeem this overrated classic in the atmosphere and drill dialogs. Bauer, a French thief who is hiding in Algiers's Kasab, police are trying to find him. Meanwhile, he tried to find out a way to fall and escape for Lamarr. The film is slow to start and does not really go anywhere. Recall Casablanca in some ways, it is a big theme lacking than the humans wanted seducing a good woman. All talks and discussions with endless scenes of Lamar wooing in the unrivaled scenes of Bayer among his fools and the shades of the bay. Personally, I did not take care of Boy's character for a minute, so the tension was totally unknown. <br /> <br /> The 1930s character of the stock was damaged by the mushrike conspiracy, like the actor Hennchen - the people who are not explicitly involved Algiers. Cigarette Gori Boyer's fool's intelligent jealous girlfriend <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems exciting ... very bad we do not see it for ourselves. The finishing is completely anticlimatic and it seems extraordinary because it's not a happy ending to Hollywood; That does not stop it to be sad.
