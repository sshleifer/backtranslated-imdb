* Combined speaker * <br /> <br /> Chaplin had his perspective on the evil of German fascism, playing the twin role of Tommon's dictator Edenode Henkel and one of his generation, the unreasonable war of the First World War. The hero and the Jewish sailor Through the events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and Marx Brothers, Henkel discussed the deal and declared war against neighboring Austrilak, when many collected flat flat set pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The speech is indeed a bold, memorable highlight of the piece - but the film is often not sharp or funny, which is enough to satisfy the needs of the Creator or the repetitive viewpoint of praise. The best gags are far from Hennkel's exhausting posting and the barber is trying to move with a big bombshell (a gang stolen from a gunfight at Gold Rush) and then trying to move with his head vessel, accidentally stopping the pants. Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slowly, brutally incompatible and completely annoying, though the barbarous spell in the sunny days is often long and difficult to endure. Chaplin was not a genius, but the talented even produces frustrating images, and the Great Detector must have written this way.
