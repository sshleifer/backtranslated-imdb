If you are a fan of snap-stick, this cliche is for you, terrible writing, horror performance and cleanliness for you. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more to the list of reasons why this movie is being sold. In a nutshell, in a race of 200 million dollars in New Mexico, they travel together with 100 million passengers. And yes they all are obviously super heroes, because they can climb on a 80+ mile trekking train, survive in numerous car crashes and can get endless examples of direct cartoonist Rodruna and Quiet Antrix. <br /> <br /> If you're a young person, or do not want to think about a movie, it's for you. An actor is not credible outside the boyfriend. Lovitz preserves 1 movie with Hitler Bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save yourself pain and $ 4 hours)
