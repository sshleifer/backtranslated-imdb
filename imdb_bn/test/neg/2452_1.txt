When I think of TV movies, I always think of this movie, I have seen it in Sky Movie a few times, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw this movie, was just browsing, and here it came in: -S <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Fleming), leave on vacation, his son (William Fleming) bought this vacation resort, in place, did they see Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owner of a bar?), and Kathy Johnson . <br /> <br /> It starts like a wonderful romantic thing, starts reading for William Cathy, and becomes Paul Linda. <br /> <br /> Some people go out on the street, his hands, Joseph (Joseph the Deep Sea Diver, some dive, a light, or some, and the religion is transformed) have some signs on him, he says take care of this person There is a gap between my memory, then there is a wide gap between the virus, I think Linda suggests her help, comes to healing, Kanni is infected (William Casey's arm is a f ), There is Joseph with the virus. <br /> <br /> Paul said some lines of Yusuf, then Joseph goes to Stumble, the next time you look at Joseph, he gets cured about how to heal it, then a beach party, the end.
