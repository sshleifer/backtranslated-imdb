It hits me that anyone can rate this film too much. It is no understatement to bring fetched calls. It was ridiculous how the man was managed in such a short time to build a wooden floor in the underground room, or perhaps he was the best chaplain from Jesus. Thick Sheriff played by White Acton looked like a refugee from Jerry Springer show and I found blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. Here in the UK we have an expression of 'Mutton like a lamb' which is perfectly suitable for it. But it was not bad at all, when the last credit rolling and 'The Last' came, I enjoyed it very much, it was quite brilliant for a hot summer pot of a TV movie, if it was kept in a movie-release video and video. At any time in the discount shops.
