Okay, little town, weird Sheriff? Check out. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Sheriff's hot daughter boyfriend lovers, Sheriff hates? Check out. Corporate land developer greedy people? Check out. The developer's rank-and-file is suddenly releasing a primitive giant, then pressing it to cover it? Check out. If they do not return to the public's warnings of death and destruction? Check out. Asian syngai special effects that can be made from camodaro 64 computer? Check out. Sincerely, almost all the clicks on your general Saif Fi movie have been dropped into a classic, so bad-good movie. The only scientist / expert missing is trying to give his knowledge; There are three students with a Paleontologist who mostly attacked my bone bricks in the film, but basically they are basically additional. And I can honestly say that I have almost made this prediction; Those who survive and who do not (although I want to say that the actual death time of one hour incorrect characters has come). I swore that if they gave me all the letters, then I could have done this movie myself. Despite all this, the movie is fun to watch, if there is no reason to play MST3K with your friends. If you're having some fun, it's a great movie to watch, so I give this movie a wonderful tribute 4, although it's a lot more for all purposes and purposes, to get a very low rating. But if you find a movie with a real plot, original character, or a special effect, will not you be protected in a SciFi movie?
