I do not know what the makers of this movie were trying to accomplish or say, but what they did failed failed. Of course, the object is not completely confused with the viewer. I just watched this movie because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it was proved that he was younger than his little camio. The whole concept is ridiculous to go to some wild car trip to this kid to win a big money award from a gas station game and meet all sorts of all this kid.
