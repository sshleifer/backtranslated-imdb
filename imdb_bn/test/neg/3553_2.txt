After reading the previous review I had such high expectations but it was very slow and the plot was so basic that I thought I would read wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Be differently, but watch each other's progress. Guess what! Both of them give scholarships to the same university and their father becomes a lover till the fence with a young woman. Failing to cope with our young hero, the density of the court has ended but how the decision of professor and drop studies will be decided and what will be selected from the lakers. During this emotional period she was not for her because the heroine decreased. So for 5 years they went their own way. He returned from Spain and lost the differences in the game and our hero is married in two weeks. Mother tells him that he can fight for his love, so he preaches his ongoing love and challenges him in a basketball shootout. He wins he wins he loves he wins. Well he won but decided to dump the other girl for our girl. The last is playing his basketball and his child has duty. Sorry 2 my high score To read Mills and Boon, she scored 0 for my companion for a soap story
