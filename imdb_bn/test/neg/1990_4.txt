I am surprised that the "hospital" has been very well received by critics and public. I found it dreary, visually ugly and generally meaningless. The film progresses (relatively) after the first approximate 40 minutes, but it continues to be very distant (non-irrational reference) in order to be successful, and there is very little material to succeed as a drama. The uncertain voice of the film is his biggest blunder, even the spectacular (normal) performance of Scott beyond.
