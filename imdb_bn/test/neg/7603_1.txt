Unfortunately this is not a movie that at least laughs at your incredible folly. It has no entertainment value. It just sucks plain. I do not know how much this movie has bothered me to start explaining. I think what really takes the cake is intolerable soundtracks. It seems that someone takes a simple beat and then enters Amok with a synthesizer of 5 years old child for the rest and tapping it. This is really terrible and if it is not enough, there is not a view (= word) in the movie without "music". At the end of the movie, you are deaf or cut off your ear. Which one will protect you at least from sleeping, because nothing is happening in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad acting, some cheaper and incredible killings, there is no story (it just jumped from one scene to another and the audience is trying to make any idea of ​​this) and in the last 30 minutes you can witness some of the worst "special effects" . It's very annoying. Do not watch this movie! You can do something much more like looking at the wall or reading a phone book. How much do I mention to suck soundtrack?
