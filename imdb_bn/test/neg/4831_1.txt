Wait until you see this one .... I even read this review even after. There is no other movie till now. More than this .... One thing I do not understand is that when you are turning off some English flicks, why do you add your creativity? With the money spent for the production of this film, producers should dubbing the rights to purchase for "cellular" in Hindi and release the film. They may have acquired some ways that I guess. If I had the chance to rate this movie with 0, I would have done it and the most kind of performance Tanushree Dutt and the girl played Aftab with Sidekik. I do not know that my problem is that I have seen cellular much earlier than this movie ... but it can not be the reason for supporting this movie ... I could go for hours but I do not have time to discuss this ineffective shit, I am a movie Do not want to remember those horrific scenes ..... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this flickr.
