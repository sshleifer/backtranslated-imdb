This movie was sugar and it was more than that. This guy gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I was so bad because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he is married. I was a little distraught because he was not a gorilla wife: she is now the wife of Gorilla. When she is a gorilla her should marry her then the headline will be more knowledgeable. These people are also in the middle of the jungle and they all want to go away. It's not just a B movie, it's just like a Z movie I do not even see any banana for a wedding gift. Oh, right he was not cursed yet.
