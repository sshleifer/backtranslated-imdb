I just saw this movie and I would say, it was a good movie, I loved some good people and I liked the killer robot but there were some holes in the movie. The man's name was ... smoker. I think people will have to file a lawsuit against the producer of this movie because how long it was long ... first half hours were good but then it was only I was happy to drag ... it was over ... but still the killer robot and love some good people of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best two bucks that I've ever spent because I like it like a stupid B-movie and come. This is a B-movie
