Another audacious and ultra-lazy movie of 70/80 retaliation? Wes Craven launched a popular trend with his "Long Last House of Left", though "terrorism Express" like other rip-offs, "I spit on your grave" and a rip off like the "Night Train Murders" According to the story, there is absolutely nothing to do for this new movie, so what is left for director Ferdinando Baldir is to make the puzzle-factor quality by a thousand! This actually gets rough rough near that end of a soft-core porn flick. Three frustratingly frustrating walkmen from Rome to the night are Amok. They excite male tours and torture sexually. Things go out of control and a traveler comes to rescue a prostitute who surrounds the three. It was not a very perfect movie and enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood. Such films are generally notorious for the order of barbaric rape and discrimination against women, but sex in "terrorism Express" is not always uncertain. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time in their face to face them and then get themselves something! The music is great, the conversation is funny ridiculous and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. Villains are jumping and train passengers are so fast, they seem to be looking at the set. If you are as lazy as your absorption, then this is your movie. However, your hunger for blood and controversy will not be clear. "Tired Express" should be in pornographic pornography video.
