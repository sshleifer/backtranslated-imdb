On the way to the beach, four young men entered the house of Lord Alexander after going out of their cars on the way home from day one. They do not know it, but the house they live in is the place of Satan. Zen (Camille Keaton) is the only female group to be sacrificed. Her male companion was intensified for her help, one of them suddenly killed Lady Alexander. The thing really comes out of hand and is killing everybody else present in black mass. Four tried to flee, but soon they discovered that there was no escape from there. One by one, they fulfill their fate. <br /> <br /> Ganga, at the tragic ceremony, I was positive I would enjoy Gradually burning Gothic horrible my lane up right. I have read many of Ricardo Frider's films, such as Hornock Dr. Hikk, The Ghost, and I Vampiri. Sad sessions began to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work the way they should be. The biggest tragedy with the tragic event is when the movie is watching this mess. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film has appealed to me or did not work for me. Unlike characters, plot intrinsic and schizophrenic, and panning is terrible. There are some uses of some damn pearls that do not go anywhere and only help to make things even more confusing. In addition, something interesting for the movie mostly does not happen. Four Lead realized that they were in danger, I was good at care. And I did not understand the reviews that I read that appreciate the role of Kemilie Keton. If you consider a passionate wave for acting it's an awesome performance guess. The very definition of three male lead nondescript They have nothing to stand up to. The supporter cast includes some favorite favorites like Luigi Pistili, Lucyna Pazlu and Paul Mueller, but nobody gives anything to do this. In fact, Muller's main contribution is to try to explain what happened in the last 80 or more minutes of a two-minute long association at the end of the movie. This is a weak attempt to give a wrap-up to a weak movie.
