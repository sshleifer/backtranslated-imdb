I saw this film without much to know about this. Split screen device was immediately annoying, and things did not improve for me after the title sequence ended. The plot, character and dialogue were very sticky - the poor man came out of the house from the humiliating family, wants to get out of 'many', revisited himself, changed his voice, got dressed in another's clothes, and received it by gay. He adopted his way to become a part of the international drug trade taking British hospitality. <br /> <br /> The makers of this film should be prosecuted for Patricia High School (talented Mr. Replay). The triple screen for me, with more than 120 minutes, emphasizes almost non-existing editing. It can not determine which image works and it is the most powerful, why not show the three and you expect it to be right with it in them. With this any of the gimmick characters removed any connection or interest with me. The dialog was repeated three times in each conversation, as it should be said that it is an important / ongoing / deep moment, all right! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
