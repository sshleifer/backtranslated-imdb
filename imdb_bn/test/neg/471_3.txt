It can be a great movie with evolution, biology, creative work of science, research and a lot of education possibilities for teachers about Darwin's life. It is a historically incorrect and Mexican soup-transforming a true story in opera melodrama. Darwin gradually lost his religious belief, though it is true that it was not entirely because of his discovery during the travel of Biggele and his daughter's loss. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but it did not literally make him mad, confused and disconnected from his friends and family. Darwin's discovery of the author of this screenplay writer. Thus, it can not be used as a place to learn something about Darwin's life and mind. According to most historians, the theory was ready after Darwin's Beagle was over, and it did not want to go to the public because he wanted to develop more results and tried to test more information. In film, it was a fictional conflict with Darwin on his religious beliefs and mental illness that after the death of his daughter, which prevented him from coming to the public. <br /> <br /> This movie creates modern conditions, creator scientist debate versus Darwin's life and time, thus immune to it. It is not like attempting to further develop biology in Thomas Huxley, but a person who is interested in "killing God" in his own words from the movie and wants to destroy the church, who will adopt the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it is a lot of synthesis of disconnected information. Was there. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and unreasonable person, the synthesis I have explained is that attempts to try to ridicule the atheists active in speaking against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas only after a gradual publication, and before working for Darwin, he felt that there was not enough evidence for evolution. One month after the rise of the emergence, the first source of his emergence was published. He was a firefighter, but it was not necessary to "kill God", only supernatural beliefs were not sufficient evidence. The debate creator versus scientist is shown throughout the film, and creators are part of the catch-phrases such as "this is just a theory" discussion. Of course, there was no conflict or cacha-phrase at that time. In fact, the positive response to this statement by the Anglican Church Origen has revealed that in some sense they see the work of evolution in evolution, expressing contradictions in the way that portrays Padma bridge screenplay. Another dreadful aspect of this movie is that it gives wrong ideas to the general public that scientists have done research in the study of a poor man who wrote too much. Nothing could be more from the truth. The concept of evolution theory has resulted in the results of the thorough observation of Darwin's form alive for five years at HMS Beagle and gradually improved because it can be seen from Darwin's travel notes. The only important part of Darwin's life was the Beagle Journey with the concept of "intimate species", although the journey was only mentioned at the beginning only and there was no effort to show the book as an elaborate analysis. Observations To make it worse, Darwin was shown performing a single test (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and, ultimately, dropped it. And I'm not really sure that such a test actually happened. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment. It is not a worship of Darwin and science.
