For the first 40 minutes or for that, the real pleasure to see Luna. Characters and their situation are interesting and look good on photography and location. Then Jill Klerberg invented his son, Matthew Barry, using heroin and the film began to emerge and then became absolutely ridiculous in his illness. <br /> <br /> The Clayber asks him why and when he started using drugs, and he never received a direct reply from the visitors, which would be a little helpful. He does not care about anything, but it is not right because we clearly see in the wonderful first scenes that he has considerable interest in stopping his mother's song, baseball, sex, and obviously marijuana. This film is for those who think that Junior has been involved in solid medicines because mother and father were skilled, who missed her piano lessons. I think this kind of dangerous and emotionally challenging drug heroine was chosen as the next generation intellectual catalyst. There is much discussion about the love of the soil for the boy, but it's really about persuading Bernardo Bertolucci. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this picture? I was more concerned about what he wanted to do as a actor than what I was going through his character. ** **** Outside
