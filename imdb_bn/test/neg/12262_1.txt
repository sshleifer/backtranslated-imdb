This picture could be great- but was not there. The talented dinners and the filmmakers' friends who wanted to help them are some of the lightest ink in the genre. The main star of the film plays a good leadership role. She is believable and who has frightening Italian eyes. However, he never came across together with the worst rejection of the actors. The film's opening scene is the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like gay porn Thankfully, no one hijacked off. It is mentioned that rape scenes rubbish. The sequence of prison was the best part of the film - though irrelevant. The movie soundtrack (if you can call it) sounds like a teenage boy first tried to use Kuliad and some sample CDs. It's annoying, repetitive, and very hairy. Actually the whole picture is lam. Find out when you can still!
