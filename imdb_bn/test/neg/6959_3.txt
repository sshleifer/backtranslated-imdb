Well, we're J. Who got the boy from the grandfather and the chalk, the good chalk. I think this movie will be very good based on reviews and it started very early on my movie scale, but almost half of it just lost interest. I'm really upset, maybe you can see what's going on at the end; The story is mostly thread-bare, I've waited more than 15 minutes and missed something! This image can be a small job, probably about 45 minutes an hour maximum. It starts well and ends well, very bad to fill the soft, annoying, dull, and lack of time but everything. Some people like this for music; I do not take care of jazz and I do not go to the movies to score them, I'm going for a story and when it is drawn ... well, ratings fall into my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Well Open, Great Off, Boring Fillers. The story was quiet, but if you do not know that one quarter is going on the path but you have not seen much romance.
