I was scarred permanently by this terrible film. <br /> <br /> The movie's main action is nothing special. It seems that there is a group of snake-worshiping tribes in remote mountains of northern China, where female leaders and decision-makers instead of men. I think among some people, "Suqubar" is enough to create a horror film ... However, sometimes Chinese people were flowing in the village, they had an innovative conversation with local girls, made them incognito, and then abandoned them. Unfortunately, for men, women spelled them from the germ of the snake, which would die dead within 100 days - on their necks like a pregnant woman dries like live worms and snakes - if they do not return. <br /> <br /> Forget the cover of US video. There is nothing to do with this vampire, although there is a oppressed blood-drinking scene. The title is only slightly suitable: the Latin verb "sukubure", which means "to lie down", and this is the word Sukubus, which is the main female, who will induce men to sleep. Indeed, it is men who are seducers here. <br /> <br /> But this ridiculous film is not the main action that is so obnoxious. It's a little side story I'll kill a calf performed on the screen and ignore the slaughterhouse. Participants seem to be very experienced, though it is really unhappy duty that they do in real life; And I'm sure they ate the animal after ... though I'm annoying my entertainment as "entertainment". <br /> <br /> I can ignore what I want (or ignore it) completely exotic shots of innumerable, unidentified people, who prevent timeless animals from eating stories. He started the movie by stopping a live snake with his teeth. In the film, he swallowed a bug, a camouflage, a walk (I had to leave the room after this), and an entire mouse (I stopped watching at this time, and lost my appetite for days). Let me stress it that it was completely unexpected, and there was nothing to do with the film ... If it does not have an incompatible reference to love portrayed in the film, it is a blind, selfish, lethal survival process that separates the helpless! But then again, I'm probably just advisable to get vileness from my head ...
