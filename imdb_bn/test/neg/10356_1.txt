I've usually taken some awful conspiracy instructions though rather dull show but season 3 although I usually have a great fan of this. What is the meaning of the episode heres? <br /> <br /> This story finally reveals that Silos deliberately allows Bulldog - a pilot was captured several years ago during a black ops mission - to escape, to get back to the cylinder ship and Galactica to steal. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he will realize that Adam had left him in his fate and became so angry that he would kill Adam, which he was very close to. <br /> <br /> The problem is now - setting up Ceylon so that Buldog thinks he has run away from himself. This means that Bulldog closes the ship without any assistance. So she killed a silen and got out of her holding cell - which we saw. Then, we think that he walks on the flight hangar, a cylindrical warrior able to enter the ship and learn how to handle it, jump back and go to Galactica. Just as <br /> <br /> <br /> Now Starbucks had led one of them to work in the season, which was not reliable at all, but before going in contact with Galactic, he had to fly visibly from the orbit. Buldog had to program his ship so that a few shakes were generated through the hyper space and thousands of light years away from unknown direction were driven to catch galacticas. How does he completely manage a ship program that includes alien technology? By touching Ceylon, they connect to their computers, there is no visual console or keyboard. And after performing that miracle, how did he know where the galactica is located, and think Galactica has gone three years ago and since the syllables have been avoided - is it not to leave Bacon behind? Any suspicion suspicion can apply to any scientist-fi show, this episode still does not understand in any sense in any sense.
