All right, this was a risky move, to rent this flick, but I think I had nothing to lose. I was wrong. Next to this "Bloodsurf", I've seen the worst "horrormovie". Nasty actors, crappy technical outputs, crappy stories and so on. Soundtrack is not bad, though. That's why I voted for two votes. And of course the cats have a positive surprise. As far as the best actors in this movie ... do not rent or buy. Stay away from here and hope that this horrible, horror movie will disappear from some obscure existence and will not become a "classic classic". It most definitely does not deserve any recognition.
