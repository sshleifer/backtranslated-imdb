If Steve Reaves is not the weakest film, then the White Warrior must be one. 18th or 19th-century Russian (??) Steve plays a casket fighter who is trying to run a sedentary Russian rage with a rebellious band in Russia with a rebellious band of Russian white tunics ... In most parts, the body of the Great Reeves is a secret , Hidden within the knee-length tunic, even with a more working Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is rather less than a moderate waist with only a good wrestling scene. That great reeves shows off physical. It is one of the most historic times in which Swav tried to remove Riv from weakness through swords and lunar customs. From the script the conversation is difficult to understand at different points, and only the commentary from the story tells the viewer what is apparently apparent from the scene. I apologize for the image being made by Revis, but to try to get out of its toga and sandals and tribune armor, it helped to turn it into other historical characters such as Morgan Piret and Baghdad's thief.
