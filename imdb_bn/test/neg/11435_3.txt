I had said for a short time on John's spiritual experience. I supposed the picture would be interesting Actually not all. Not so deep for such a thing. "Everlasting Life" Everlasting Life Death experience and "Dejavu" The film is not as a comedy, but not funny at all, at least not yet released. It's very na√Øve Shiny film but naive film. One should avoid. Medieval sequences seem to be coming straight from the fairy tales and it does not matter. Isleman Davidson is so charming and doing his best to Voet. This movie is a common producer and photographer. The movie was launched directly on the video so I discovered it in a video store. This is a sadness because 'I know that the voice was deeply involved with spirituality and the film is not so deep about it.
