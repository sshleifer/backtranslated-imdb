I saw the comments from the Turkish people (which I am not), that this film has been fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. I just want to say ... Turkey could be one of the most annoying and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, this movie was exactly what I had. If I was Turkish, it seems to have more impact. But if you are not from Turkey, then I recommend that you do not spend two hours of your life. <br /> <br /> "Remote" is ending forever Many scenes are long lasting with very little or no purpose. I do not even understand the director's motive, with a lot of views. It indicates that the director used to make movies of his own car, apartment, and friends ... all right? It shows. It shows a low budget. Acting poor So if it is a cultural thing. I just do not understand the basis of a movie base of this story. It's incredibly annoying.
