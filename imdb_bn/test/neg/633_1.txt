We all know that special effects spend money, but it seems they could get some good shots using the money saved in the script. The train is probably a model of most running shots, the helicopter is probably made of the computer, it looks like the end of the sky spaces, it was a decade later and there was an excuse for spacesballs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Please
