Once Once Theresa Russell made some half-decent movies, I hope her two attempts at least 6 or 7 (among 10) qualify for the rating in the last decade.

Lines are distributed by line actors as they read in the first rehearsal or even a casting session (which actors do this for their agents, but do not want them to be effective for them)) The set and props seem to "off" in any way (what kind of a police department would allow a detective to be shelved full of file holders in a complete living room wall case?). The screen is continuously divided into meaningless times and datelines, which are present with any rhythm or reason. Now, if the script writer is standing here after the light up of the film festival screening, how would these doubters doubt the true clever plot of the plot to make the maximum change in the final five minutes? Well, for those members of the audience whose other film experience is Cable TV: Movies and Surfers, Dude; They may be bamboozled to bow down their heads in agreement. But it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in his life - and is not a close friend or relative of a crew member or a relative - can fall for such a long caner. Despite what the DVD is The box can guide you to believe that this film has many similarities like Sunset Boulevard (Heteroconstral Device) or Hitchcock (Schizophrenic Satellite Device), which will urinate the soaked Jim Beam Bottle.
