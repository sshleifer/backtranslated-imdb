Despite all star cast, this attempt failed in the epic. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes combined by a very very, very clever social commentary. It seems that with each new dialogue, the author writes with the new character, "What is not clever, is not I smart, does not it bother social commentary?" And, sadly, the answer is always "Um ... no." Too much neglect of more self-absorbing material like soap opera (in the worst sense of the word) compared to the film ... and a clear attempt on television immortality. Thankfully, this young man has died. Empire Falls falls flat.
