This thing, it should not be called a movie, it's worse than "Manos", but you only have to look ridiculous. If you see it in the video store, it is rented, if you see the 10th anniversary edition, yes there is a special version, it is worth 10 dollars if your friend lends it to you, but you will see it. The acting is very bad, and the cow is so fake. After seeing this, you ask yourself why they insulted this art? It seems that your Nazis do not melt like "riders". If you manage to see it, be sure to vote for this movie as 1 (terrible) so that it can do below 100, it's really a spot holder. I'm surprised it's not number 1, okay.
