The story is not very powerful. Do not expect a movie "Bourne identity". It started strong, sounded by the Russian speakers and it even credible. (I'm not an expert in Russian language.) I still believe in what the potential of this movie was to Moscow's dark sad look. If they feel bad they take almost half the time, they really miss this spot. The acting was poor, perhaps the story was not very strong. This is the part of the film where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is talking to the CIA on the phone, as you hear a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F! Too bad, the author does not even give a little effort to give the original character depth. Also, a cheap and simple ending bit. <br /> <br /> Plus the point is almost all the scenes where there is read. He's not doing that well, in fact, he's not. But he really looks great in this movie. Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment. Rental element ?? Probably.
