For many years Ed Woods' classic 'Plan 9' has been considered as the worst movie ever made. Forget it, roller blade is seven infinite bad. Cast Famous People are made up of brothers and almost famous or have been actors and actresses. Planet and script exist along with the plot. Classic ed wood using stock footage while running is not made in wood style. Instead of continuous slow motion and repetitive action. And the roller is not seven even in the seven! <br /> <br /> This film must definitely see how bad it can be to create a movie. Independent film makers hope everywhere.
