Last night I watched this movie on TV, hoping for a realistic account of what might happen if some prevalence of infectious diseases is occurring. I was frustrated, and I think the movie was rubbish. It does not seem real to me. The acting was somewhat horrible, especially the doctor. He was the worst about who I saw. The whole thing played like CNN's worst case scenario. Even compulsory disaster movies do not seem bitter to the people's bit. I've seen some disaster films, especially those weather, which are really bad, so they're having fun. It's almost as bad, but it's not even fun, it's tedious and annoying. Do not get bored with it.
