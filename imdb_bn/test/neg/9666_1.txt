I got it on a box set named Broke School for my birthday. Well, seeing a person watching the DVD and being amazedly surprised, I got into this goat. It was worse than me, and I did not expect much. This film originally came back to life with the story of a man's death and crowd and another calf strap story There were some interesting ideas that were never followed. Now everyone says that there was a lot of people, could anyone tell me? I saw the head bad, brain tissue (or something ...), and a bad effect of blood coming from the penis area twice. I said that the man threw my man in the bone, he made me fool, this is the only good thing about this movie. And that gay sex scene is just thrown out there. This act was oppressive, really, blew it. That Asian chick was annoying, then the boring Mexican boyfriend came to kill only. I say if you find it in the box box, it is fine, but do not spend any money on it.
