In recent history some videos have been made as amateur - at least no one has been published by this unused distributor. Each frame of this film is a blame for the better films of the past. The term 'clich' means new meaning by a shameless writer / director, who must save their imagination for minimal effort to do the masturbation, which does not harm the film's audience. Less than the skilled technicians who helped amateur night's 'awesome' efforts contributed to poor cinematography and ridiculous make-up and special effects. Unfortunately, talent that shows the reflection of the fame that one or two of the film's amateur actors produce this image will show a hint.
