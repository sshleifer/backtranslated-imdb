When you are drowning, if you are one of the few full-time staff parents, then the head of the family who is not already own. This parent's parent section gets a big ZERO. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides she will help him in a shopping trip. Just a stupid movie. Glad I have a TvO on the remote and an FF button.
