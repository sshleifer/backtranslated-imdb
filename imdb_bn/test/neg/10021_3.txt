I think that there was a more suitable title for this movie, because it was padded in hell and returned with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found Pri in his original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just love finding VHS old slashers because the cover artwork is fantastic. Generally though, it shows that the film is less than superb. Priy is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be fair, okay, okay, with the kidnapping of the killers in the forest. Hearing the used heartbeat is a great effect that make excitement as you see. This film is essentially a big fat clinic and when the "Campfire Story" section is rolled out, the film takes a new direction and spend about half the time of the story behind the murderer. I actually had quite a basic idea about this. However, the back story disappears suddenly and shows us some stock footage of a burning tree (the lack of budget really starts to show). After that, we were taken to the wild by fools. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is embarrassing because he actually makes an effective killer. Pick like cropsy from the burn, but better. For Gore, there is not too much, though it's OK to have a face facing up to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will not recommend this movie to anyone other than the end of slash - it's really a big mess.
