This week's wonderful screening turned into a horror movie The Nun (La Manja). Seriously, I think horror films should try and bring more fantastic titles, even though the story is about the character described in the description of the title. Who knows, soon there will be spinoffs like our Makkah, The Priest and others related to various religious groups. <br /> <br /> The basic foundation is very straightforward, that the nun garb dress that can claim the title) is almost the murder of former convent girls. Some conspiracy seems to be involved, Eva (played by Anita Breem of Iceland), as the daughter of one of the victims, goes to discover with the help of some good friends, such as a rip off I know what you did last summer (also mentioned, by the way ). <br /> <br /> As soon as the number of bodies increases, it is our emotionally harmful (they are not always?) heroes to uncover a nation against time and save the day. The end of the sins of the mothers, the film was unimaginable, as a beginning of a dream. I hate the sequence of dreams because it's a pretty cheap strategy if it's not done properly, and there are some of them in the film. <br /> <br /> For a while, the movie was wrong on the ZooOn. Dark water references lots, and for these situations and plot points in the movie, these orphans can be retitled again in water. However, there are plenty of plot holes, so the story is not looking very deeply. Hope you return to the mental textbooks sad knockdown and set the sets that can compete in the recent Thai horror movie drama. <br /> <br /> The well-forgotten, highly-accented English accented of accented. And since most of them are happy with the eyes, the story needs to be woven in a love scene in the middle of witch hunting. What gives? Hello, Hantu has got, do you still remember? Then again, the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated / SFX which is designed at every and then, popping up of various fashion, screams from just awesome audiences elp. Characters violate every void rule in donkey notes with horrible expressions, so that you only know their desserts and hope. <br /> <br /> Can you possibly enjoy this movie? Sure you can. Make sure you see it in the entire house (it should be easy because local people are awesome for some distance), and those who are frustrated may laugh at the "horrible" scene. It's pretty fun, and adds to the atmosphere as well as on the screen. Sound sounds do not even come near. It seems like an episode of Scooby Doo without Wikipedia, and it is a sad fact that the filmmaker's moments should be censored for PG rating. Those have probably been the best bits, now the rest of the sensor's floor rotate on the board.
