Steven Seagal has created a really dull, bad and annoying movie. Steven Sighal plays a doctor !!!!!! ??? This film has received some step-by-step scenes, but they are badly managed and there is nothing to do with the rest of the film. A group of American Nazis has spread a deadly virus, which can erase the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagal's character) tries hard to find a cure, and that patriotic story. Patriot is a highly annoying film, because nothing will happen. It is filled with irrational gaps between boring dialogues, and events, and stupid actors. Steven Sigal took up entirely the pictures in this movie and I will not recommend this gaff to my worst enemy. 3/10
