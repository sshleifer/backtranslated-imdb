I've seen several Wixel pixels and sub-roza extreme movies, and found a lot about them. <br /> <br /> I saw this SRE movie much less than the others. . Perhaps it's a comedy / horror movie, because it's more than direct fear, and maybe it's also because fun has not registered well with me. <br /> <br /> This is less than less than 70 minutes. Start the credit as the last ten minutes starts. There are some credits, guides, and behind the scenes which are behind the credit running. <br /> <br /> The SRE movie continues to be small, and despite that the pad is still feeling out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was stuck in a shoes, and unable to replace it, she was "Dunk Oneshoe McGroo". Due to panic with pirates, his parents highlighted him with a Christmas trip for Christmas. <br /> <br /> Many classmates die, and some who do not make a decision together. They choose one after the other in McGraw, who wander around the sound of slogans. <br /> <br /> letters are a wide range of stereotypes, such as the Dakas, etc. There is an odd couple in a strange couple sex; The woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, people wear a large paper watermelon thong on her head. It reminds me of some unfamiliar sexual scenes of director Rhesus Dream. <br /> <br /> The film's quality is good, and there are a lot of extras. But basically a fantastic silly movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well, I suppose you can not have many Christmas horror movies. Still, there are a lot of other useful features.
