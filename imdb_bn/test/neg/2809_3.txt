What a shame It could be better. The main problem is the script and the star. Can not determine if the film can be a snapstick comedy (very unknown and routine type) or can not determine whether the old East Germany and its chickens could have insightful mockery. The next attempt to flop after him, however. The film does not hold well together and the end is very artificial and incredible. The German comedy about any stereotype is tragically strong. <br /> <br /> Characters are one and all the stereotypes and key character directed by Kim Frank is the ultimate color. She can not just carry the film and is probably chosen to face her kids. It can not be the fault of all the actors (he is a pop singer), because the script does not give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> Together - East German style entertainment and time is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the film is in no way disrespectful and abusive. The film seems to have come out by people who did not give it their best and just wanted to get quick profits from some cheaper laughs. (If they give it the best, it's a tragedy!) I have seen it with the East German audience and I'm sorry for them. The GDR regime was horrible in almost all cases, but those who lived through it were better deserved.
