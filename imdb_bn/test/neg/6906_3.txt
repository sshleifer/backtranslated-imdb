I have taken my 4 year old pair for this movie today and I will not recommend it for children of their age. <br /> <br /> There were many war scenes throughout this movie, which I found very violent and my kids became scary. <br /> <br /> This was the top of my children's head and the scene of death was very scary for a cartoon interested in children. <br /> <br /> I became frustrated because we all want to see this, but it just does not cut. If you have a child under the age of 7, I will not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> This story makes me crazy during the whole movie.
