The movie is simply terrible (2/10). Although the actors are trying their best (better sometimes, not more) but have special effects ... let me enter this way if it does not have any, it would be better. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Sadly it's the opposite. There is nothing left for the real atmosphere And it's all very chaotic. Maybe they had too much material to show in 2 hours. However, if you want to watch this movie, I will recommend you to watch the TV series (the same title, same actor, even the plot is the same) which was shot at the same time. It's a lot better (9/10) and there actually made the story :)
