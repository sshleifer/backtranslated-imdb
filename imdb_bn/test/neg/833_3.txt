This is a classic example which is a sitcom when the TV is much longer. Everything gets tired and the jokes begin to repeat over again. Okay, the first couple from the series from the beginning was quite good. Your Death Manager (Simon Cadell) was run by a demonstration directed by Roth Doc, a clear woman who wants to be a yellow coat, alcoholic child-hatred puncher and Judy Man, a humble jockey, and a stand-up comedian. Earlier it said, it started well but it is running a very long way. Once Simon Caddle went away, it quickly swept away, you got a string of stringent stories and Ruth Drug (again) got herself a new entertainment manager. When a comedy is pictured in one place, the number of jockeys that can be cracked is limited. Unfortunately this joke had jumped on every joke 3 or 4 times. If this comedy stops after the 2 series, it would have been the best classic ever. As it will be, horribly originally thought for the last few series.
