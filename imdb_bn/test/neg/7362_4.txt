See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. When my heart starts to gradually, slowly, gradually, it is gradually slower. My Wallets <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know the exact recipe for making a movie, and thus used the method of throwing everything into the old amateur cooking system. <<br /> <br /> This film is truly rolled into one of the all in one of The Shining, Poltartist, Amitiville, and Heelier. Surprisingly, I know, but the truth. Have all the tastes, you can taste each of them, they just do not mix well. I'm not going to go under the wrong list with this movie; Short, good cinematography, moderate acting, bad dialogue <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> If multiple plots are running simultaneously, you may not end up in different. And does Jumu run into this problem? Similar to Freshman in English 101, you finished your story with Elixie, "The little car disappeared in the dark ... and the last" Uhh, wonderful. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The last left me confused and frustrated; Almost empty Take your $ 10, rent the shining, poultiger, and heliery. Scare the pants on yourself, give a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed. <br /> <br />
