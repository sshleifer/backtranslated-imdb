The frightening action movie that led Franco Nero to share with the cowboys hat, the gun belt and the coffin in the DNAGO (1966), with the bachelor's ingredient for all the white graduation! Despite the fact non-stop action, the film is completely clutched and curiously funny - with Campi Villene, to boot Christopher George. Susan George (no relation) Niroy's war veteran, smoker husband, whose attractive villains are attempting to push her oil-rich land - but the latter is the martial arts (and stunt-heavy) gymnastics of Niro. The solution to their problems is to rename them as well-skilled ninja, because it is the fierce enemy of Niro (the show has been played by Kosugi, who appeared in two more series and is now involved in another!). Climax is in a hiding place where a person destroys George 'army' and keeps his gang from the previous conflict; He is the perfect way to send his generosity, however, is effectively done.
