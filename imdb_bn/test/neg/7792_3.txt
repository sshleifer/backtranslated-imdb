The title is from a passage in the Bible (Duties 28:28). Let's say it has been taken out of context too - but still, where the title of this annoying movie is raised. Other critics do cover the plot details so I do not rehash. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, gave a lecture on "One of the Functions" where he discusses how a person can meet someone else and they can enjoy a "calamity crisis" in their lives where they own and displace themselves May Fair trial He is saying this in the podium at the moment because he is keeping an eye on Leonora Vale in the audience - the woman who turned her ownership. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here is a Hombon psychologist, and we believe this young, beautiful lady falls for her and she and His wife comes in happiness. How to respond to a cheating wife while learning disbelief, it is far more impossible. She just can not understand, but she forces her husband to spend a few months with holiday - "So we all can get some relief from this helpless pressure". Give me a break I just wanted to reach the screen through pornography but not just fornication but intelligent wife. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is the result of this brutal relationship? I think it was a poor decision because it did not look at any plots in the twist, because the whole movie is completely expected. At the beginning of the film, you already know about the resignation of the wife, because she calls on the bed of the deceased person and does not express any desire to her. <br /> <br /> The script is not defective, but Nobel Coward terrible miscast (although it is its play). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen. Michael Redgrave originally played the role of his interesting, but was replaced at the time of the filming. What I was thinking was that? In the end, the husband or wife can not feel any sympathy for one of them. I think Margaret Leighton plays quite well strumpet part. But perhaps he could not overcome all the negative aspects of this movie. Also, in the case of many British productions of this era, actors clips, fast lecture patterns cause dialogue to be difficult to understand. I saw it on TV and can not rely on closed captioning to fill the vacant places for me. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time at this time.
