I just saw the first show in each series and what time wasted. The girl from Emmerdale had to be fat so he would be a fat friend, but losing someone lost each. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I think the whole program was only trying to reduce weight, but then they never tried to make love story, o God, what is the time and the time of the wind? ITV2/3/4 Yes this event has not been repeated how good it is. <br /> <br /> I mean the box does not just waste money. <br /> <br /> Be careful
