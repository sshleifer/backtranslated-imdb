I think this movie as a movie frustrating as the ostrich director, Joel Shuachar. A group of medical students activated to die for a few minutes; After the resurrection, they discovered that their sins were disclosed to anyone or to others. Some characters are visited by the dead and some seem to be deceived by their guilty considerations, it is not clear whether the connection is right, but the scenes look like six forms of art films. Why students use their test as a title that will make them famous, it is a bit of a mystery, because the results are completely unacceptable and the movie has been mentioned many times, it has been documented long ago. Nevertheless, Shumkhaa is excellent for her Batman train to train with old old painted neon paint and colored lightbulbs. And William Baldwin is a sloppy.
