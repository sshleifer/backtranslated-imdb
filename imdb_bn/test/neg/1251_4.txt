Many believe that Stu Anghar is the greatest poker / gene player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - the smallest of energy, but a huge heart to play. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a kind of Hallmark film about the dangers of gambling. Sure, he won, he lost, he beat everyone by playing gambling, sex, medicine, and more, but where is the real game - who is called him as the greatest card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Very flat, and definitely annoying at places, these four get because we can learn something about the Stu guy, but the card player Stu, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indicate this perfect example of not making a movie about cards: In fact, the ESPN coverage of the world series is even more spectacular. <br /> <br /> The waste of a great opportunity.
