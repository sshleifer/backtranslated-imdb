I usually finish every movie or book that I start, even if they are poor, only 'I hate to leave them. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for Spielberg Magic - I hired foreign films, and I've rented old science-fees (recently the rent of Soilant Green - rent). I like both Hollywood action and slow moving character development. Praise of different films need to be communicated differently. I can not find any such released material ... the action was so wooden that I am not at least bits at the end. Character development was virtually absent - you are sorry for somebody, or even have not even been identified with them. Finally, there were many pieces that were not just associated. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - good to see the colors dry ...
