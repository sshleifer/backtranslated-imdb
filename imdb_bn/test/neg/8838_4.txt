I did not see it at the beginning, I did not understand it, and it bothered me for the whole movie. So, do this with me: Wayne (The Good Guy) Stankoop, jumps with a driver (!), steals money (?!), and takes it. <br /> <br /> Unarmed, a driver dies and another wounded by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then it happened. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne left the money from the dirt, rescues the girl, enters the city, gets screwed by the ek (dead is very bad about the guy. I guess ...) and then say that he means money in the scene Got back. And everyone is okay with that. <br /> <br /> And good guy? And I'm sure that at the time, hand held flashlight was not small. And in 1862 Bell voted his first phone ... were they at home? I'm thinking so hard about this? Generally, I'm happy to hang the verdict for enjoying a movie, but this one bothered me. And that's a sign step really does not work for me.
