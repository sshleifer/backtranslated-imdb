Polar Express Director Robert Zemkis, I Love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and K Freder Robert Room (no question mark after a movie title !!). And my favorite actor Tom Hendes The reviews of this movie were absolutely unanimously that it was an instant holiday classic. Eighth and Roper Enthusiastic Thumbs! Even the written review of Ebert gave it a full four stars! Wow ... all right ... this is what I will see! But wait ... The motion capture used looks really weird. Hmmm ... maybe I'm not interested in it anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, you common?" The polar express is called a train conductor. The boy is reluctant, and without him the train begins its course. The boy soon changed his mind and jumped at the right time. <br /> <br /> Most of you have decided to jump on this train and wait for a TV train or a tenant express (Hey, I'm very cute and clever). On the other hand, I was like a boy who was skeptical at first, but see what all these events were. <br /> <br /> I just lost 10 dollars and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain my stomach ache. Polar Express was not so funny that it's not funny. There are no stories. No salary is closed You sit there through this series and you wonder what "does all this have any points?" If the scenes were entertaining then it would be one thing ... but they did not. <br /> <br /> This movie is an emotional, a soul, an ounce width, and the maximum: a fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> and talk about ways to look at these characters in seconds. Saying that this is the same technology (speed, I'm sorry, Capture "Performance") Galom was used to make real shame because Gallum was credible !!! Photo-savvy does not translate well into this medium. You're using animations, why not design characters more revealing? Is not this the only film with real actors? They can certainly have it. We all know very well how we walk, talk, interact with things. It is not impressive to see it on an incredibly finished screen. Unbelievably completed caricatures have proven all credible, Incredibles. As a result of Polar Express now they turned dead dead bodies and dolls into dolls. They are running and talking, but where is the heart? Where's the soul? What we see on the screen is that UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so awesome! <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where the boy got up and left the boy taking the ticket of the girl from her seat. She wants to give it to her but why do you sit there "Why ??" Just leave it back! He certainly lose the ticket and ensues "adventure". And then there is a boy that is trapped behind the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can not join the kids anymore? And then with this annoying "35-year-old voice it's" all know "baby, it's all very annoying. <br /> <br /> Oh, there's a song! A girl goes behind the train where she is alone, she's singing herself. Then he obstructs and joins! They take a hand and finish the song, they see each other's eyes so that they are lovers, very painful. When the waiters dance around the train, I will talk about how to serve hot chocolate Do not know the details. "Keep warm hot!" One scene where Tom Hans has slammed his knee in the air, and his hand should be one of the most memorable BAD scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now I'll kill myself ... I need to look somewhat painful to clean the palette ... yes ... it's better than a deception polar Express. <br /> "There is one thing about trains Not going anywhere, it does not matter what it was decided to fix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For God's love, I decided for you! This is one of the biggest films that spread incredibly thin among the books of children's books. It happened with Greench and Hat in the Hat, and it was also terrible. But who can punish them? I used to give the book, The Beersteinstein's Beer to to Much, Junk Food, and it can be transformed into a feature film, but it would probably be very nice. But at least ... there will be a story and a dot, which is so lacking in Polar Express.
