A caper movie completed by the number of "Italian Jobs". The horse behind each candle cliche, it will emerge a special height of the movie and a movie footnote by the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that all of the "Italian work" has no imagination. I've seen it all before and then done well. Acting cinema is completely acceptable, but the film does not break a whole new one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All of them are so expected. Even the heist and car's Chase scene, supposedly highlights the movie, seems quite ordinary. This is particularly true because they appeared in the trailer for the movie, so I already wanted to know what to look for. For me, a Copper movie can only be pulled off if it has elements of reality - maybe, just maybe, it depends on a deux pre-machina or "just because" moment. "Italian job" parts only throw the window, computers are doing something that computers can not do, good people can not kill their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not only the police car to respond to the streets. The explosion, operated mini-operated or even a low-flying helicopter operated. These cities have to be a hack to not have any response rates. <br /> <br /> The acting is effective, crew (Seth Green, Jason Straathham and Moses Def) to show the least fun. Mark Wahlberg is very cunning as a "wonderful guy" hero, when Charliez Theron is the only actor who is known for displaying any type of range. Donald Sutherland always acts as a class and they see Wahlberg's deficit at every point together. <br /> <br /> Overall it is a beautiful unintended movie. IMDb rating has been given, these girls really love this movie, which I can understand somewhat, but there are such better copper films - even the latest "11th ocean" pain is also out-of-non-event. The Italian job ". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, think about what happens to Norton's character. We are meant to be happy for the good boys because of his death. Especially it seems to be long and painful? He did not deserve that, he was that Simmer. <br /> <br /> *** Last speaker ***
