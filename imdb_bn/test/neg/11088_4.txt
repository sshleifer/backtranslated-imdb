It is difficult to write about 10 copies of so many film noir. There is not much to say about it. It's not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a lot of silence for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Henryd plays a tough guy here. He is not the one that I want to play such a role, but he is good with her. However, he is a fine actor. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine with cinematography but not memorable. One thing that stood out: accidentally ended. That was a surprise. It was astonishing to see the title "Ho ollow Trif" under the title. I have never seen that movie. It is always called "scale". <br /> <br /> If you read a "fictional movie silent", do not believe it. "Kal" is not a proper adjective for this movie.
