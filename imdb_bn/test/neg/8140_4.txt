It's a story old as a man. Jealousy for other people's wives and property <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Booor ("Perry Mason", "Eronside") is the manager of a runner planter who seeks Malik's wife and feels that he 'treated with respect'. Pete's wife, Starlet, was repeatedly barbarous after killing her husband Paul Kawanagh, who had seen everything, and the woman, the domestic worker (Gisela Warbyshek) There was some intelligence to take revenge for revenge, among which was another young man (Carroll Verga), who Burr also said in love. <br /> <br /> The verdant becomes toxic, or it seems that it is, Gorilla. Petan will have to associate with the Congress if he wants his marriage to be over, because he goes to the forest at night. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable. But, Petton will never be afraid of the excitement of this movie. With a sharp missile out of his chest, no creature can harm him.
