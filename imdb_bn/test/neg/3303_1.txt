After all, you do not take this movie seriously. Unfortunately, it takes seriously, but it can not be helped. If this animated Nenja Flick can be respectful, that is the story of the overwhelming, bad plot, the story of the ridiculous time of murder, and an insulting guest appearance that will make you laugh or cry (or both, like me). <br /> <br /> Although I usually have a fan of Nizami / Samurai Anime (to make a number of names and scrolls in the city for a few numbers), this should be an exception. For the record, from a technical perspective of its time, the film was very well animated and produced. It's just that the plot of the stock. The authors of this film have clearly decided (I do not know for any reasonable reason) can create any script for the lack of script if the whole half of the world is looking for his father (he learns) and dies for the war. In this process, he saved a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl residing in the village of Apache, friends with a friend, whose members tried to kill him, met his family members, he knew that his strange places and circumstances (And who later dies in movie some time later) Even this ridiculous plot twists can be forgiven, but then two come to the "guest appearance". # 1: After listening to Clive with two cows, Zero has met a person who introduced himself as "Mark Twain". At this point, you're probably saying "whats ****? !!" This "interview" uses one purpose: it completely denies a film that tries to add itself to an educated historical background. In the 1860s, these problems for the American research were frustrating and did not realize that the real name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Ziro finally finds treasure, it can be seen that it belonged to Captain Kid. I can now hear the groans of hate <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a running scene. These scenes show different characters, they are moving steadily for a few minutes and they have many. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />'s, it's Feel free to have fun in each of its possible ways and have fun. Do not just take it seriously. 3/10
