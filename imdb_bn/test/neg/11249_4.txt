Barbershop 2: Behind the business it was not real as well but it was fun. The movie itself comes with a lot of little things, which makes the original idea even more enjoyable. Taking money with a very thin plot behind the business just seemed to be another perfect sequel. Cedric Entertainment's flashback seems to be the worst way for the audience to try to destroy the terrible excuse movie and to adapt more with a character. Overall Barbershop 2: The business behind the business was not necessarily a seagull, except for elegance, spirits and sparks.
