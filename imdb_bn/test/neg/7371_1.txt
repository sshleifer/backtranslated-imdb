A movie about an interesting and sensitive time of history, was painted beautifully, an unexpectedly trivial and retarded production, fairly clammy script, poor continuity, intrinsic slash music, sweet welding and pallid performance. <br /> <br /> It was a toss up between script and performance which was bad. The script probably won - The historical background, backstory and description of the character described the painful details in the conversation. Actually this word is not how bad it can be described. <br /> <br /> There was a huge intersection in about thirty minutes of pre-release screening. Almost one hour there were many who were laughing loudly I'll add Franklin, I love Canada, and love the historical movie. This was really a close.
