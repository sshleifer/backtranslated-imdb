Thank God, I did not handle any heavy machinery, it could even be the worst disaster. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same shots, medium shots, medium shots, medium shots, snows The story lines were rather empty. William Hart was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random shots in the scene just added a lot to include them. Arbor had more shots to travel to his car than anything else. The direction really does not take us into any scene and it does not feel me for any of the characters. If IMDB had the option, I would have set this a zero price. If you can not sleep, great spacious. I have been in my life for two hours and I will not be back.
