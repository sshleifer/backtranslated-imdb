There is a political interpretation of the film, but "Horser Master" is not one of them. I received this thing from Newsweek and other editorial editors. Will you see horror movies now? Come on! All I wanted was a good junky sculpt film, not another "Bush Bad!" Shouting Joe Dante wants to publish his politics, let him go to Air America. And if you have to insist on making the "message" movie, be a little more intelligent about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another political horror film (God help us) to think about it before You can
