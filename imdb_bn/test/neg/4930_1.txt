It's almost as stupid as me. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ It reminds me of a scene of "scary movie" where Carmen escapes from the electra killer. There are two signs, a "security" is marked, the other is "definitely death" (I'm reading from memory). Like <br /> <br /> and the movie of fear, the letters always look at the direction "sure death". <br /> <br /> Why did the girl start a fire in the teller booth and close the door? He wanted to die in the fire instead of the man? Oh, why did they sit in the seat after cutting and defeating the driver and instead of killing him, saw him by the injured person or at least killed him? He was running on their friend and killed him a minute ago, yet they scruples ?? Oh, hundreds of things are more ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was a road, you can not run a single yard due to the hole. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Looking at the ratings and comments, I feel that people are watching completely different movies. <br /> <br /> One thing missing, that's the infamous red toolbox from "when he was out". The movie that resembles the stupid behavior of incredible plot and characters.
