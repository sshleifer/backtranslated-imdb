****************************************************************************** *** ********** This movie stunk. Just let me tell you what I was able to say about Carriopship. What do you think Sam? He was with a guy who told him that he loved him (3 times), he was hot, and while trying for him (Josh Hartnett) he got stuck with him. But, he decided to stop with him, no, he betrayed him with a sticky, ugly, insulted, rich and barbaric person, who never said that he loved him in the whole movie (oh wait, he wrote on the wall, which count? ), And needed to leave her during her time because she was afraid (Chris Lojour was clean). Who do you want to live with? I was sitting through the whole movie because it was Josh Hartnet and hoped that he would eventually die. I want Jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of it. The whole "your mom" thing was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people around here do it but I think that Kelley deserves it. Jasper had to say it to Sam, he needed a good stick. How to start romance is a mystery to me. They did not talk to each other, so I do not understand how they got together. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... it's mustard or autopsy or ....." Oh what an come. The supposed romantic line was so stupid. Plus he's Sosososososososo UGLY! I must admit, I've cried this movie. For a long time, really hard. He did not die, because he broke the heart of Jasper. He cried so much in this movie ... He tried to laugh for him but he could not stop the tears. He cried when he said 1) He told him that he loved him 2) he got sick 3) Chris Clein came back and he saw how much he pleased him 4) He died. When I cried, he cried, because he loved his life, and told him, but he was not very careful and he loved a man who kept him in his time, and who did not cry. 1 1/2 Star is the only reason I love Josh Hartnet! Alas, Chris Klein, your mother! - Wiley's sis
