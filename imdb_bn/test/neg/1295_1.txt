Avoid this movie. If you expect "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you can not enjoy more than 'turning'. This film does not give much more than two hours long, stretch-out, complete hours of complete annoyance. <br /> <br /> Cast members like an inferior petunias work in such a way that the water poured out on the bed and gets angry with the bathroom irritation. This script is totally unrealistic, and the movie does not have a sense of disaster film. Actually, everything about this movie is bad, without the exception of Tom Corten Unfortunate that such a good actor appears out of such a smoke, has turned away by a flood of false representation. When this movie was made, Poseidon certainly turned into a sea of ​​water in the shy sea. And, Shelli Winters will be killed (from Poseidon directly), anyone who dares to see this kind of movie. I'm rating this image 1 out of 10, but it's really worth zero. This movie wants to avoid you, or to turn the water completely. And, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It even wants you to see "Jaws" (1975), and may be a great white friend.
