I saw it after watching "Death Tunnel" (the question is, the worst movie of my life that I have ever seen), so that you understand that I went on a little bit of my eyes watching the director and producers of the cinematic moni. This one is in charge. First, I thought the director and producer were the same guy. They fulfill both Kid Rock Dawn the Beauty Hunter. I have seen TAPS investigation, and I'm not skeptical - I think TAPS is the closest field that will sometimes reach the scientific method. That was calm and trustworthy - I believe they are frustrated. <br /> <br /> But it's like taking a tour, like the above mentioned critic, above. OK, tour, fine, but "investigators" and "group leaders" began to make a beautiful penny and it seemed to be financial investment on whether the money was frustrating, so when they had fabulous stories, give me a happing tea spoon Take salts <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone else mentioned, I could have made that which I wanted to see in almost 50% of the time. During the rest, I could not do anything. In addition to any context in the photo- I can not accept the time of day, camera type, humidity in the house, dust particles (which is 75% or more), weather and other factors. I can not even help thinking that anyone can do anything. <br /> <br /> Why would the band keep the door from the number? Vandalism? During the TAPS investigation, they tried to dig the death certificates of those nurses - and they ruled only one "accidental" (people did not want to demand suicides officially). However, when a guide is mentioned, he said, "Yes, and it marks suicide." It's really felt like guides in the homes of depressed homes here in October. <br /> <br /> I like interviews with patients and staff of the old hospital, but it has really given a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I'm glad they said that the workers had the best intentions, and there were not some wretched wardens. They were not the best method, but all of them were. They were frustrated to stop the disease.
