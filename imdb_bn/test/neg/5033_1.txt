I turned this off in the first five minutes. It is very sick and annoying, while closing the moment when the beautiful white horse was entered into the slaughterhouse and its skull was bound by a small tubeized device. This animal was lying on a floor in shock condition before it died. The narrator said that the animal died instantly, not so. I do not agree with animalistic, pest or any living creatures graphic realistic. I was very frustrated because I just saw a 'face without eyes' which was a brilliant film and this little film was connected, which was lost on my night - as I did not hit a fly, do not remember this barbaric documentary. <Br> <br /> Another review on this page is reading, I saw they used the aesthetic word - it's not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary is very clear and deep but not aesthetic.
