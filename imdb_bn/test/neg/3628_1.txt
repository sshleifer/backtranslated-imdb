This shows sucks. It was held on Friday in Roller-Coaster and undoubtedly I will judge fairly during the Friday programming programming theme ... I still think it sucks. It's really super lame. Jolly and his fool buddy sucks weak letters and pot and is really hairy. <br /> <br /> Long continuity and pot sucks and I count the conversations and weaken the joes. Suffer humorous and lame sucky letters, and a disappointment worth the full show immediately watching. It sucks and really, really hair. It really will be one of lamest shows on TV, really worth watching the observer. I can understand how birds can get weak and dry before a letter gets it axed?
