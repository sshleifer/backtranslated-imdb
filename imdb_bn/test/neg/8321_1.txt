Are we serious ??? I'm out ... just, wow. I think this watch was seen on the Warren's old issue. This sad, originality has completely died, instead of creating a new idea of ​​what we got, a fake reintroduction of an old plot line and "switch it" only change the gender or race of the original character. It should be sick and tired, and everyone should be sick and tired ... but I guess it can only be a gem and possibly a defect in the deaf ears, which can hit the toilet water well from 3:10 to the west. Umar ... (wait) ... 3:10 yummy! Thank you Hollywood for the film killing as an art form and turning it into commercial barrels of neo-pop junk and barbaric obstacles ... wonderful !!!
