Personally, the book is a very good writing, amazing, thrilling piece that did not face trial in the film. The film's main parts were disappointed by me, watching the movie at 12.00 am to see, because it influenced the "different" results of the movie. It was a bit preferred beyond the movie, but above all, it was a lack of plot. <br /> <br /> No one could read this book, I can see how this movie will be viewed as invitation and entertaining with its debate and mystery. However, a dedicated reader who sent it to seven readers, I did not see a strong connection between them: both movies and novels. <br /> <br /> The main characters are absent (such as Maximilian Kohler) and with the survival of last cardin in advance, the plot of the film is torn apart, and the plot of the film has torn apart, and thus, the story ends with various steps. Hashyasin was also portrayed as a simple white man; compared to the novel, he was portrayed as a Muslim; His purpose in the book depends mainly on his relationship with the entity, but his motives in the film seem to be based on money and more work than some personal tie at work.
