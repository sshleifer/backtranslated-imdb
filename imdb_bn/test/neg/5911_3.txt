Just read through other comments here, and it was a little surprising that nobody said anything about acting or plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are not great actors <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh people Every time the movie tries to "fool you", the good guys are going to lose, you know the scenes: "What? Good people lose?" Oh .. I see, it was just a strategy. "So awesome, you can spot it a mile away. <br /> <br /> It was 2 or 3 fun moments, but it was not enough for the day. <Br /> <br /> This little silly comment will now be 10 lines. Many people will be filled with it, because it will be worthy.
