Someone decided to create a "black version" of the aircraft. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to create a really, really bad "black version" of the aircraft. <br /> <br /> Someone really is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spend all her time twenty minutes and instead of insulting the audience and cast intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. If there is nothing else, it should be remembered for that achievement. <br /> <br /> This is not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's a bad thing. A really, really bad thing. It will be a waste of time by point dot point. The best thing that can be said about the movie was that it was a purple plane. Please have a favor on your behalf ... Buy a picture of a violet plane and what you can offer to this movie will be the best achievement for you. <br /> <br /> This definitely goes under this section "What! ^ @@ & *! What do they think ????"
