First of all I have to say that I rarely review movies, if I have only been bright or disappointed that I thought it would be good. Many levels of killshot were a big disappointment. The script was horrible, the act was sub-par (usually coming from heavy weight like Raukeke and Lane), and the editing and the effects were ridiculous (blowing cars etc). Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I could not believe I could not believe it, I could not even enter the word, as his talent was so misused. 3 years ago I saw this movie trailer and wanted to know later that it was a serious problem with the movie .......... B-movies all the way ... ...... disturb you until you get disturbed No ........
