Sometimes called "catchfire" or "backtrack" is not very good. That's bad. Jodie Foster has already won an Oscar at this time. Why does he agree to do this? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / abduction relationship is not credible, even if it is a common emotional event in real life. Worst, this film features Hypon and Foster, a scene where a boat under Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means that the bridge may be closed so that the bridge can open. I had to wait for that bridge to go down many times, almost all of them live. It's not a nice wait. This image has created unnecessary bridge-waiting and it is a bad place for the world.
