It looks like one of the worst movies. I'm sure I'm looking worse, even though it slamming me. <br /> <br /> There is no ridiculous ridiculous, stupid stereotype jokes which are not funny again. I had a captive audience on a plane and saw this film. It was a complete waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in the previous movie, but it's not the same. Similar to Queen Latifah, she was outstanding in Chicago and stopped it, she was very good, but the role was horrific. <br /> <br /> I credit the failure of most script's bad writing. I firmly believe that you can not save a source, untouchable script with the appropriate actors, this movie is a point. Nevertheless, this film should not have been enough to participate. I am very surprised that some deer so bad can be discussed, created, released on the theater, and promoted.
