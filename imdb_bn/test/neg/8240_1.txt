There is a lack of real lack in this season, however, as long as we can set up stories to return to our mood, without season 6 highlights and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of natural hybrid style in this season and if you find all the garbage filled in each episode in this cut season, you probably had the value of the real story of 6 episodes. <br /> <br /> Side story like Pauli's mother, is she or she? Was boring and had no other purpose other than searching for his character. I saw the anger of his wife at the Carnival Pausali, but there is no benefit. <br /> <br /> And it's okay! There was no real purpose in this side story, and the lack of finishing. If they are going to finish these stories in the next 6 episodes, I do not want to see it, because it's not really worth watching. <br /> <br /> Speaking about this season of frustrating is a good word and its end.
