No, * Hit * Undoubtedly, the former leftist-scholastic-activist-pundit is not annoying (and barbarous) romantic-comedy about Christopher Hitchens, although it is certainly made for a fun movie. A gentle little English, cigarette and a black-colored tooth, from guinness to advice - and a comfortable political commentary - to a boyfriend male: "When you talk to him, look at your yawes, and destroy! And remember: Calling '-Cosmetic' makes you a real anti-Semite! You do not get anything directly, you are generous pantywaist? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Instead, we will have Will Smith Pease The success of which has remained a secret to me at least, I am visually alone in this matter: Smith is the strongest person in Hollywood to write this: Americans simply can not help their money throw them. On the other hand, I can not hide his skin, a scene here Negligent by (spoiled by trailer) where he enjoys a strict allergic reaction to seafood. We know Smith His blood, overs, will bring back the profession's good looks, because he has a fat cat-actor (Kevin James) to make his own fool. When we start a dance like Zakas, we laugh at (Sisi Music Factor's "Arabi dances no!"), But why strike the straightforward dealer like this? I've been working with several straight-handed accountants for a few years, and I can tell you that, if Norman Mandela's memorable phrase "tough people can not dance", then not even straight-bank accountants. Did I take all of these very seriously? Or - and here's a brave thought - perhaps the authors can not contain a logically depicted character to save their lives? <br /> <br /> In order to talk to the writers, they are interested in having a selfless idea about Smith's love: a tabloid writer (Eve Mendes). Since Tabloid Cripps deserve the love? I'm the universe, anyway? Here everyone on the IMDB is actually reliant on this trip. All you have to do is raise the bar in terms of entertainment prices for all of your people, or I'm just an apple on the side of the garden. (I, and about 150 million other patient lovers and husbands.) In any case, I can imitate Smith's hit and give some gentle advice to my male readers: When you drag * to hit * See your good half, the movie "Hey, it was pretty good" after the end. Do not be supernatural; It does not bother about - he knows that you are lying to him. Give it a little disappointment, like the movie was better than your expectations and this is not really a time of disappointment. But what am I saying, Ah, Falas? - We know all the moves of the dudes. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
