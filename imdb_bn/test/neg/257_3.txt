Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown in 1932 - a vague actor who played his first film. And, because he was an unknown, the movie he gave him was definitely a B-movie - a fast film with relatively low expectations. After watching this, I can see why Bogart has many years and another film studio why he will take the family name before it becomes a name. Although the film is not terrible, it is certainly not good - it makes curiosity more than any other thing when it is seen today. <br /> <br /> Bogert is a pilot whose company has a dream to build a plane engine. However, when a zero-rich playgirl comes to her way, all of her dreams seem to catch up. One of the characters in the film said that two combinations are like oil and water - they just do not mix. bogur is throwing his committed career, his sister going to full speed of the road in Scancvill - a lazy person who is looking for him to sleep with a rich man is seen so that he can get tons of cash Pieces! Baggy has no idea that her sister is not an actress she claims, and later can not understand that she loves the rich woman who leaves her for the same person whose daughter's daughter .... sister of bogart! This leads to an end that is all reasonably enjoyable. However, what I saw is one of the longest scenes! So far, the rich lady is not going to marry a cowboy sister who is sleeping with her (wheel!) But now she is poor and no good for bogart, she is going to fly herself and kill herself. Finds the compartment, navigates on the plane to the foot, closes the plane and crawls the lungs to take control of the aircraft and save it! This is so stupid, stupid and ridiculous, I found myself laughing loudly. Until then, I could score it 4 or 5 - it compressed a movie in 3 (how a reviewer has passed this to me) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A talking and stupid film. On top of it, it's all wrong for Bogart, the action hero at the end and the simplifying boyfriend, a great match for his personality, which was so surprisingly created in the early 40's. Manny and Strongly Wishes Good Man - One of the best actors in America but clearly out of his element here. <br /> <br /> The way pre-codes love movies and their adult sensitivity, they might want to see it. Everyone in the film believes in former marital sex and cheating and practicing - what you did not see after the code of hardening and more moral production was received in 1934.
