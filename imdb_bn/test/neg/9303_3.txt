The book is great It's one of my favorite books ever. On the other hand, the picture is surprisingly vague and bad! When I heard playing Dameon Replay, I knew this product was destroyed. But I do not expect it to be bad. The actors go around and work very ornamental. Except for the law (and even he is guilty of playing some showbiz), here all the actors are near amateurs. Should not be considered as speaking Italian and acting to move his arms or hair. Damon is miscast. She is very tough for a character that is supposed to be a character. Forgot Paltrow and Hoffman still plays another kiss. Talk about type casting. <br /> <br /> This script (actually written by additional directors) is not truly apologetic that it completely exchanges every detail of the book, and many of them come up with themselves and none of them work. ! Jazz music element is completely wrong! I think that in the late 50's, Italy's idea of ​​Malílea, in the early 60s, images of Roaming Chetty unemployment spread throughout the countryside and spread to a large extent. Yes, Minghella is a true dreamer. The film is a clear bleeding. The silly scene that drives through narrow streets full of mirrors when ripley. Very ridiculous Yes, we get points !!! Every point or detail comes across a mile, so much so that visitors give an inaccurate idea to the audience that they have mental powers. We know, for example, the Blanket character presented at the beginning of the film will return only after complex issues. And soundtrack, at times, completely inappropriate. It does not have to be when the trick. The film goes for all sorts of long and dull instructions. There are many annoying characters populating the landscape (many were not that book). This picture is bad! Really bad <br /> <br /> Clearly, Mingala's son told his father that his novel Ripley is his favorite. Mr. Mingalera then ordered his son to favor grace. Well, what the director has achieved: Gifted Mr. Replay, with a hiccup's desire, a strictly made movie for 12 years!
