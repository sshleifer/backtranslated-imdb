It's a serious film about black revolutionaries and is not really an action film. Billy D is bored with racial racism, who decides to take things in his own hands. Though it is fairly subtle and realistic, without character absorption of characters, it is not yet attractive and deliverable character, although it is actually not sympathetic even though it is maligned by the images of white authority. It is hit by a very low budget. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see it as a good picture of the social problems of the 1970s.
