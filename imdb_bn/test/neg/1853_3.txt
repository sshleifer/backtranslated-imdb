We saw it in an essential basket at the local Asda: Â£ 1.50 for the DVD. All the cover covers the entire cover, which is how it is "mountainous", and it was a well-established cast, we thought it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> We bought it, took it home, inserted into DVD player, sat back and waited for fun ... .. and waited ....... and waited. .. and wait a little longer. <br /> <br /> Some 90 minutes later, although it felt like 3 hours more, the credits were rolling, and it was over. <br /> <br /> How to get lockdown - even $ 1.50. God knows, Cain, Richardson and Gumbon wondered when they said yes to this tactic. And for the dying: I've enjoyed a lot like Black Books, Death Shawls and his Comedy Tours, I think she was out of her depth in this film. He tried to play very hard for a laugh, perhaps thinking that his black chest would work here to preserve the character characteristics. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it has come back. After a while, the gags fell flat, and then it was just irritable. No shame because I believe that the right part can be a very good movie / character actor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, actors actors, fail to play !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
