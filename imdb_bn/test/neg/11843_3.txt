I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where it was included. Whatever it turned out to be a "void version". In addition to the low average quality and small scenes, one thing that was really weird - soft sex scene. It starts with a close to 2 large nipples. After about 2 minutes there was an expression on my face "boooooooooooooooring!" Put the word. Quite perfectly. Do not raise 7.5-minute concrete like Microsoft (at the moment the term is a bad choice.) Away from entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more "Man / stupid, what are they?" <br /> <br /> Lucky, the DVD was irritable and I got my money back.
