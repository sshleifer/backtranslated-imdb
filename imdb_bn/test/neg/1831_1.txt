Anatomie horror genre is not very unique, in fact it is not even awesome. It reminds me of my American cousins, the horror slashers. It is a copy of any other horrific slash and is not an American to add it as a German movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, Antomi is very anticipated and annoying, its conspiracy is not intact and consistent. It's got stupid scenery which is not even fit into a horror movie genre. Amusing sex scenes with pop music and lazy women in underwear Why do they need it all in just one movie? They should instead make a cheap German adult movie. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie because it is very annoying.
