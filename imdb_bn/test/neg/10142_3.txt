I like quite a lot of character in this show since I started myself without Robi. She comes off as a holier than your type and is quite a big bully. And that's because he is in every scene and every episode. The van became very vague in the next season, as is a fool of his former soul. And Kyra is sneering and sad to walk around. If you ignore Reba the first 3 to 4 seasons are quite good. Finally, it's quite dark .. Repeat every time Barbara is walking with a statue, Reba means its meaning, but the poor Olab Barbara Jane suddenly wants to like him in Rebe, so Barbara Jane told Rebecca how wonderful she is to every episode. I think Roba looks very clear to see self-esteem problems and wants to be seen as these forgiving saint. Her really a shame because there was such a potential other than her show.
