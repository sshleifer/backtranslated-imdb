This experimental silence film made by an independent British film company in Switzerland is originally considered as the first film of Paul Robson. It is very artistic, shots often seem meaningless in the story, which are difficult to understand due to lack of enough inter-headline. From what I've collected, Robson's wife, Ada, is in an inter-racial love relationship with a white man named Thorne. It does not disturb the bar / hotel cigar-champing owner who resides in Thorn (and he seems to have a homosexual relationship with Bermaid), but an elderly woman has expressed the city's point of view in an intertitle: "If I have a way, we'll give Negro here No. "Thorne Bar is called" Nigar Lover "by someone. Ad tried to reconcile with Pete (Robertson), but eventually gave him up. Thorne's wife, Astrid, closed deep end, brandishes a knife, cut Thorne's hands and cheeks, and died in some way. Thorne must be assassinated because we learned he was innocent. As Pitt, he got a letter from the mayor saying that it is good for all that he left town. So the film is nothing but much more about racism, but during the uploading the owner said to Pete, "Sadly, they think they are right, so we too." The title means a mystery. It can refer to Adah's line of light-skins (border-headed Negro) or main character behaviors.
