A group of bone graduates who go on to find a missing crew of mine workers in the Nammi Desert. When they were discovered, they were no more than clean bones and they did not die for six hours. The story is exactly what you are interested in. The characters are good enough, and the performance is quite good. <br /> <br /> During one hour and ten minutes when you find out the reasons for cleaning the bones, you hear "Oh, it's really stupid." The movie is destroyed by bad writing and an exciting end. Until that point, the movie was quite good, and it's a shame that it took a bad turn. So I can not recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
