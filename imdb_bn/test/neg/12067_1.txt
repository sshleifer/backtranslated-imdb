Cover case and prove that so committed to enter there. As the slasher cook I hope so much from this. But, what the hack is going on. The movie is awful. The direction, the plot, the mystery and the cast work is so amateur. I even used it in a home video camera to shot it. Lucky that it still guides me to provide some good moments which lets me like it. Thanks for the so-called "Shibir blood" bad package. <br /> <br /> 1/10
