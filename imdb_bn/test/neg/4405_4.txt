I really wanted to love this movie for all the reasons - this is a spontaneous, interesting and perhaps a big problem facing today's world and interesting works (like I used to live in Linda Grant in modern times) Also, the block I liked told me that he watched the whole year that he had seen the best movie, so with this recommendation ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was totally tired and the seats in the movie were comfortable, but I worked hard to identify with letters. Once I thought of my head that it was a series of serials, I went with it, but it frustrantly created a sketch like a movie rather than a movie. I like the idea of ​​a restrained, almost silent Mais N scene against these idle moments - sexy girls, red balloons and Nizam Muslim fighters. But personally I think the film has been hidden. I'm not saying everything is story and plot (this is not true) but more dialogues also helped.
