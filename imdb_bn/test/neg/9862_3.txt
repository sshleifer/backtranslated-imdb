I am writing this note as a movie exhibitor as a chess player. I saw the 1997 Caspov-Deep Blue Games on the Internet. I know something about the issues raised. Other chess players will come along and find out whether this movie is worth watching / buying and I am talking to them basically. However, I'll try to ignore those who do not "in chess". <br /> <br /> This photo is about Gary Kasparov and the 1997 built-in custom made computer "Deep Blue" However, the first image you see in the movie is not Caspov or Computer, but "The Turk". It is an "automaton" which was built in Europe in the late 18th century and won chess against all workers. I put the word "automaton" in quotes because it was because everyone is now a fake. <br /> <br /> If you do not like to watch "the turk" but you can not stand in favor of the movie, because the "argument" is the time of the screen Kasparov, presumably more, both the latest footage and some old movies B / W Footage Repeat "The Turk" Repeat every few seconds was the assistance of "Deep Blue" to Kaspov - that it (some degree) was a fake computer, which IBM did fraud, in which "a man" worked inside the scene helped win it. Kaspov believes not only, but filmmakers also believe it. And so about this chess game or programming chess computer is not really about a movie. It is a campaign piece about a large corporation that supposedly misuses a helpless grandmaster. It's really a lot like "negative advertising advertising" because it works on evil music and uptake cameras and surprising sound effects and innuendos ("We found out that locked doors were behind") and always present "Turks". <br /> <br /> Most people in the Chess community strongly believe IBM did not cheat and this is the work of Gary's work. In the beginning, to defeat "Deep Blue" Casparav for humans, it seems that you will need a person who is better than "deep blue" and better than Kasparov. Since there was no person, a bit suspect from the beginning of the whole idea. Furthermore, while this movie was created, there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could defeat the powerful grandfather. Today, much more than the 1997, we grant that the computer can do something that you can not expect. And we beat a guy in a computer chess that is less likely to take it as a human tragedy. (And in fact, the following line is that Caspova has defeated himself with two wrong mistakes, including a resignation of 2 in the game with a resignation). <br /> <br /> To play chess, you are rarely seen among them. There are few comments from masters and commentators that they will say briefly how they went, but in reality you are rarely seen in any strategy or tricks. Naturally as a chess player I took it as a big draw, but I think non-players are being cheated too. For example, imagine the baseball movie, where you rarely see a game - just a commentator tells you that "Game four, White Socce defeats Astros with so many scores." No one would like to make a movie like that But here, for example, we have been told that Caspova made a bad mistake in the opening of Decisional Game 6, but we were not shown the position on the screen, or why it was wrong, or what it should not be said. Instead, or something. We see Casparov in a few seconds to hold his head in his hand, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw this DVD, let me warn the chess player about the DVD, Jacket promises you that additional analyzes include games with "analysis." Does this grandmaster analysis seem like interesting to us? It is a version of Chessmaster that analyzes automated computer voice synthesizer which tells you to break a piece And a leaf is cut off and you are in "Caro-Can Defense, Main Line." Blahhhh.) <br /> Someone may come along and say, "Well, clearly this movie is non- Matching the player dramatically for the player, and so it is not wrong to be indifferent to it. "But in reality it does not work very well to reach the non-player - it skates on some points which are really young Tyai wants to explain. For example, it says that Caspova could achieve "Permanent Check" in the second game, but it does not explain what it was (or what was looked like on the board which was interesting). It came back to Kaspovo-Karpov matches but did not explain why two of them were or organized them etc. I did not need this information, but I was aware of it. If you do not already have a chess experience there are some places where you will get confused and this is just an error in the movie. Finally I can not recommend this movie, which, like "The Dark" itself, which purports it (a documentary) but also a stage illusion more.
