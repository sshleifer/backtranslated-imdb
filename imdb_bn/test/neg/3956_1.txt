Over the years, I did not laugh at the theater. The only problem is that my throat smile was not intended to be raw film. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad CGI, absolutely horrible, absolutely terrible * acting * and enough GIF references make the whole thing absolutely nothing but cheese. <br /> <br /> As a gamer and a gyak-type girl myself, I have recognized all the obvious game references related to this movie. Geek STUFF, which was dropped into the background only as an eye-catching (Steimay Poster, from ThinkGeek.com to T-shirts and j -list.com), and the movie was not redeemed. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was very bad, and a bit of a TV-B-grade grade ci-fi channel created from midnight. Do not expect more than that and you have a great time. Just do not drink soda or when you get the best line you will spit it all over: "Why did you bring this game in our life?! Why?"
