Energy starts off strenuous but tired soon to see annoying and watch. This plot is about an ancient budget doll which is owned by its owners. The idea is "fair enough" and this film was fairly entertaining when it was done better. But the first ten minutes or sooner it becomes annoying; We do not get any good death scenes and want to hear talk loads. Finally, one of the dead in the dead died in front of two daughters, but it is not very fun and obvious. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend getting a horror or a slash. As the fan has little to achieve it.
