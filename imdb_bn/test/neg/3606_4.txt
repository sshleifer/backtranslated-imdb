Emmort's new Grove cast has returned for Disney Pictures, but this time Spoklite Kunk (voice by Patrick Wurberton), who is not Izhma (Artha Kit), Hechenman. Crock has started a new life and is very happy about his role as a restaurant chef. When Krank is coming for his pop (John Mahny) to come, the words go gently. Crank is worried, because he knows that his life will not affect his sinner. A thing that he always wanted and never received is a "thumbs up" from his dad. An explosive in the restaurant and a giant cheese explosion leaves very dear to our favorite hero in a problem and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracy Woolman, David Spad, John Goodman, Windy Malik, April Winkle and Gatelyn Green.
