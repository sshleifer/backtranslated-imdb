Everything was wrong in this movie and I do not know why I finally got annoyed to see it. It has been more fun watching the paint dry. I even loved de-tok to cry loudly and it was a lot better than that. Here's a basic plot for you: A Redak has been stabbed by snakes of 13 murderers, and by snakes of painful killing killers who kill innocent young people. I lost hope in the movie when it did not make me afraid, when the murder was bad and BAD CGI was blood and the CGI snake. Petboard slit characters hold hands on his feet and kill it, and it does not allow it to be torn by a tree and when bad people go down the water like a shaw of a rose, it gets worse. I'm still upset about why I'm bored of this. I guess because I'm a horror movie fan.
