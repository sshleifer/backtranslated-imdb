<br /> <br /> This film is incredibly vague, it wants to cry a man, is thicker than the 5-year-old peanut butter and in the same way, it brings ridicule from your heart, every single joke was a bad time and it was a good time. Had not been fun. <br /> <br /> This movie does not see, there is a real opportunity you can not enjoy to go to the comedy again ... what ever.
