WARNING: These SPOILERS can have !! <br /> <br /> First I see many Lifetime movies and they are just that .... Lifetime Movies. Something great (really), some good and some bad. Unfortunately this movie falls into the next section. It actually started with some probability .... The single, divorced hard-meme (who left the workplace at 2:00) cuts a person while driving from work to work, and just say that he does not accept it very well. The phone started immediately with the call hand and broke in her house and trashed it completely. So he goes to his mother for the night, and the next morning morning his mother's car was flown. This seems to be just a pain for the butt for our heroine who copes it by going under the shopping of lingerie and jewelry !!! So the police keep him and his son in a local plumber to keep a safe and what does the mother do? He went to work on leaving the goat alone at night in a cat Motore room and ordered him to order the pizzeria !!! I could not believe it! Then it gets really stupid! And the end I just got angry because it was so ridiculous and generally. Very bad because it seems to have the possibility.
