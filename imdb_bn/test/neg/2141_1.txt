I could not get on how terrible this movie is. My eyes want to jump from my head and my ears awaken blood from the sound of a terrible awful soundtrack. There are four children and dogs and they escaped to a hospital, then two cars and buses were stolen. Nobody punishes them or punishes them. Acting is just so terrible it sounds like a directive video for the social studies class. I can not think of anything that I like about this movie. There is nothing. Even the dog who loses his dog wants to vomit me. When he got a dog behind the dog, the dog opened the door. Perhaps the dog was trying to run away from the movie. Then there are some horse fry in the whole mix. It was the pain of watching this movie. Then the old boy says that there is no crime to be together and they all embrace him and love him. Theft gas is a crime. Two cars and a bus stolen is an offense and it is going to be a teenager or something. This movie will avoid all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
