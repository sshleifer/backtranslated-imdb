I was watching this DVD, I was thinking that I can see a picture of a painter, Goa, but the film was all without Goa. The film complained about a young woman from her family through Human Inquisition, because she practiced Jewish rituals (only the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is tortured, humiliated, driven by a poor script (it can not be believed by JC Carrier that I can not believe that this verse ** is run by Mr. Mills Farman) a religious man and centered around that young man Ladies and all that <br /> <br /> Oh, and Goa, I have forgotten, playing full roles - it can be John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Jakuim, Jose or anyone else's role. Very disappointing - this is a movie that will be forgotten forever (if it still does not happen). If you want a movie about the Holy Investigation, rent "Rose Name". Spanish painters want to see a movie about Goa, and I do not know what I can rent. Maybe a director of a good qualification is not yet in order to do it. PS: Spanish painter, Goa - The title that has been lost in the plot - pictured by a Scandinavian actor, something that makes this movie more difficult to take seriously. Maybe next time we have to send Javier Barden to the Norwegian painter, Edward Manch's biopic!
