"Crown of gold" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see it with my friend and I still want to see that we were "due to Win-Dixie". I must say that this is my fault, because I agreed to see it with him. Due to being a fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Corrie was ridiculous) I hope that it was not like critics because critics have said it. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into film I was led to disaster. Funny and annoying efforts are funny little children of seven and eight years mourning with laughter, but the rest of us roam on the screen of mistrust. <br /> <br /> This movie seems like boring and strange to me. Even to me was wonderful, as I like the "scary movie" and "amazing", two films I know are many people who are candid and objectionable. But the fact is, "the son of mask" is not funny until it is ten years old. <br /> <br /> This picture contains lots of CGIs, but it can not save this trash. Anyone who allows this movie to be big screen is probably considered possible considering its original success. Unfortunately, it does not have any of its first smile, fun, or excitement by creating a comedy in the original movie. Anyone who is thinking about seeing me in this one is offering a "mask" to rent. 10 out of 1 stars are generous to this awful mess.
