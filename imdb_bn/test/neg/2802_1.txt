I was at Blockbuster and I saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The cover art looked great, the plot was not bad, and the tagline (the outcome of what you sow) is very good. But on that day I was stupid, because I did something that I should never have done. I rented a "straight-to-video independent horror film" to walk with my very best rent, I went home, popped the Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it started. After completing the movie I will see the trailer (Bad Idea) but I went ahead and saw it. Now for review. * Potential spinner * First off, played by "kids", and when the scene is talking 2 (main characters), the light is draining, and the building looks even fake! Now they go to this house, where Shani Connel (I think he is the main character, I have no difference) relatives lived there. Suddenly, one by one, they are all dying ... (gasp) a killer scarrow! Well !!!!! Scarecrow is probably less budget definition, and scarycrow looks so fake that the scene is so fraudulent. It makes dinosaur sounds and everything! And then to the end ... they shot a square -cock with a gun (which seems to be easy for God and it seems to be purchased in the local family's dollars) and it's for a while and after ... (gasp) Blows UP !!!! !! <br /> <br /> <br /> Save yourself a bit, I'm telling you this movie is being sold. If you want to pass for half an hour see the wall, because the wall is shown A + fun compared to the disaster. Although it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: F if there is something less ** F - ** I want to give it.
