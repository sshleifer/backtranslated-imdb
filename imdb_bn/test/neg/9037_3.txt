Another movie that made the story of Beach Age worse. I especially remember the scene when Brian said that he had to leave the tour and other boys would call him a traitor. I was not going to do that and at the beginning of the film, it indicates that some scenes are reactionary. A movie about Beach Age will not be that way because many things happen anyway. Sadly, this film gives a wrong picture about the boys who are not familiar with this group. Hard-core fans like me knew that this is not a complete story and that's why I gave it a low rating 3. But I have seen the best movie about these beach boys, there is a bit more to say about other movies. If you want the truth then I recommend Documentary Endless Harmony.
