This event reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons" where Smiths was fired only by Mr. Barnes and forced to live a painful life without being unemployed. He did everything he had done while eating dinner and watching Comedy Central. This meant that Comedy Central was a painstaking TV channel for sad people, which was nothing more than their time to occupy. "Mensia Mind" is a little better than most programming in Comedy Central, but it still serves as an example of why the free-living fighter for the channel's low-quality filler. <br /> <br /> The truth is, Meniaia is a fairly well-comedian who has thrown tricks, soft balls, racial jokes and casses among man's deceitful trends, based on race, gender, or economic condition, or combination. Two of these features are out of two. If you've heard this joke repeatedly or by one of your friends at work, believe me, you heard the comedy that has passed as "the mind of Mensychic". Carlos tries to make fun of the current event, but lacks of creativity or originality. It is not to say that Carlos is not a washout all the time. I found some of his skits funny, his rap video screenplay such as an oil sheik. If you're happy, your all-time run-of-the-mill comedy, you'll probably enjoy "Mensychic Mind". For those people who are tired of repetitive, pedestrian comedians stay away, trotting out the same old-time-jokes jokes.
