This movie was a fairly youthful game that went on forever, but never did it. It was simply boring to see, so actually I could not really get into it. This film is not a horror film by expanding imagination, it can be one of the videotape covers. Instead, it's an exciting type movie that lets some elements of Horror make the movie more interesting. Of course, this film does not help everyone. In most cases, I remember that this movie was like a movie called "The Deep" in the 1970s. Looking for treasure bunch, talent group that sort of. There are supernatural twists on it, but I did tell you the truth I was so bored when watching this movie I zoned out so I could not really tell you what the miracle element is. I thought it was a footprint under the sea so maybe it could walk a little bit, or maybe I think instead of Lucie Phoscissor's "Jabber" film it seems that it was a horror movie which was set on a summer island and that it was unexpected as one It was much more entertaining. On that day we learned a valuable lesson, not to rent a movie based on its cover art.
