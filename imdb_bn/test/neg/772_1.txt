Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea too, very wrong gone. As far as horror movies go, and especially with the flow of tin movies at the moment, a movie about a bunch of participants on a mysterious fakak show is something that can make you so much fun. However, the authors decided to create a very straightforward, very boring, very common story about five teenagers who became part of this show when the furious Abbott graves transformed them into frees using their harmful machines. <br /> Five teenagers have been selected one by one, until the last man is left, his 'punishment' is that he can not join his friends and thus 'become lonely'. What a load of garbage! <br /> <br /> "Actors" is really poor, there is no comedy in this movie (and it could have been so funny!), there is no ghore (and it can be so important!), there is no work, and there is no big deal. (And it could have been so much!) <br /> <br /> The director failed to make the task even more interesting. His experience in the soft coar has probably been clearly disabled by any creativity, since all the shots have the same, very few edits and similar to the little movement. Overall poor overall. <br /> <br /> I am not usually inspired by nudity in the movie, but I believe I was the only high point breast of the film.
