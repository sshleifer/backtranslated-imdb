Slowly, along with his frustration Climax that weird film that drags and plods (I really mean PLODS). You can finally expect some sort of fifth, but there is no one. Milland and Snodgress give both painful performance; Indeed, the oddity of the movie can actually be the only thing for it. Generally there are some unreasonable parts of the atmospheric score (like music during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a real horror fantasy scene that involves a .... a gorilla.
