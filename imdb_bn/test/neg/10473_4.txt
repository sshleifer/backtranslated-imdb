I do not really know if this science is supposed to be fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least at least. However, really bothered me, there was a lack of story development among the characters. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old daughter (Clarus Bryant) is stuck with her for the summer, and they do not spend 30 seconds on the screen together altogether. <br /> <br /> Hot Native American (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) is obviously the hats for the Sheriff, but they do not spend any time together <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, inexperienced stories, but when I personally am in Florida, bad developers have their opinion Like to get it. <br /> <br /> This was the only reason I lived with this. It was original. I have not seen anything like it and I am a sucker for new animals.
