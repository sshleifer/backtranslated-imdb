This movie reminds me ... how can I write to the director and all the characters privately without this, who is truly proud of being an Australian as well as making films. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? I told you a story .... <br /> <br /> I found yesterday DVD in this local DVD and here I got a vague memory of reviews during movie releases, so I thought I would give it <br /> <br /> < For any reason, I have decided to look at 'special features' before watching the actual movie, which I usually do not do. 'Half way' stopped, because I had enough cunning, 'We are not so nice to combine such a tough traumatic film like so raw scripts. <br /> <br /> <br /> movie? Disgust Complete the development of clich√©s and charitable characters. Actors? Good acting guys, you are Australian and I congratulate you. And, like a football team, they are just as good as their trained trainers, unfortunately there was not a great script to work with you. <br /> <br /> I think this film actually looks down on a lot of things, and it's like to cover it. I have seen many reviews here that do not mention much as soap. Finally (and forgive me if I do not say this word correctly), I was very disappointed that there was no hopeful overturn. Yes, we all know that life is involved in hard work, and yes we know things like lawlessness can happen, but I think it's really hard to praise a movie, which is not part of happiness. I believe that there is a responsibility to keep some directors there. Otherwise, about the movie about them and their feelings, they made it for themselves, not for the audience. <br /> <br /> Which I think is why this movie is not so great. The special feature specifies that the director wrote the screenplay for 36 hours, after the last attempt of his life. Well, it may be a cathartic for him, but after knowing the story after writing the film, it feels selfish. "I'm afraid, I'm going to write a movie about horrible feelings". (Note: I read an interview with Andrew City and understand why something must be written to help him with Thaluri's own problems, but I believe that there is a line in the film that can not be exceeded - this is entirely the line of film making. Needs, and I think this phenomenon happened here <br /> <br /> The manager through his own admission The was no technical experience and unfortunately, you can see that this movie is nothing more than one twelfth of the media project. <br /> <br /> This film should be read in school for any recommendations, or it should be seen by all the teenagers - it is not sure. Because there is a very dangerous line in the end. I am also in a place where I thought that 'no one should face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, I think that this line can be influential on a young audience which is weak, the window of the mind. Discussion can be there for promotion, but again, it does not fully reflect any possibility of release or happiness in this story. In fact, it indicates that more grief may come about. <br /> <br /> I did not see an elephant, but I found it, that all the comparisons here are given. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>} I am glad that you are proud of what you have created, which is the end of all life. This is not a movie I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Oh, I often showed time frames as a collision path, it seemed like it was an interesting way. <br /> <br /> But the whole "you can see it silently" - we already know it.
