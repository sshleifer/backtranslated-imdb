Jessica's strong flurry de los, will meet Gordon's love, how will the ancient evil stop before it can be destroyed? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. It may be - the basic story is interesting and fantastic, but the acting is limited and the whole thing comes very slowly to keep the interest in it. Jessica is very innocent - it's almost boring, and Gordon, her love interest, wood, hard and completely cruel. None of the characters are very likable, and the less budget is painfully obvious. A rushed end does not even help the subject. Avoid it until it's MST3K version.
