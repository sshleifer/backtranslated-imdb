I bought this video on a throw-out table in the video store which hoped for a good cast as a reward-winning British sex comedy. I think I should read fine print. I rarely write a panning review, but it goes here. <br /> <br /> These actors can play games with gay roles, really much more worthy movies. This comedy actor, a very cruel joke with the public going to the theater and the expense of all the nice movies that contributed to their wishes. <br /> <br /> I repeat: Rigging about spoiling the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personality with this overwhelming trashy flick? Can the references to Austen Classics 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' be anything else? How much political statements were there to create this melodrama using these stars? Did we just want to take it as a lay-down maess that all actors are homosexual and thus their on-screen roles influence our lifestyles that they adopt homosexual sexual behavior in our mouths? I'm sorry, but I do not think so. I'm not one of these.
