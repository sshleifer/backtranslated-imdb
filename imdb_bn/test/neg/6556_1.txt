Especially if you love horrible movies. When I first started looking at it, I could say "I hope there is a dance stream." Two main characters dance not only to celebrate my joy, but started to break as the main ghost dance. And above all, Sherman Hemsley singing break songs (songs not mentioning songs) singing. It gives me a little sadness that he broke up because of this movie, but I did not like him as an actor and he should have known better. Even the director will not accept credit for this movie (and you have to check out some of his other films!). <br /> <br /> A note of caution, though the author really likes jokes, um, male lower area. For example, one of the characters discovered a book called "Grooming of the Darker Species". I'm not really kidding. And that, to me, the film is the most annoying part. Otherwise, find the most vague video rental shop in your city, get a movie, invite all your friends, and laugh till you cry with the ghost fever.
