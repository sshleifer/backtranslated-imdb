I have to be honest and have to admit that this film was not anything for me, except I am completely annoyed. This is a burden of a plot that revolves around the mysterious murder of several young women, which is associated with the discovery of body over 40 years old. This story does not seem too insignificant, especially when Rheibacocks (played by Tommy Lee Jones) started his conversation with Confederate General John Belle Hood (I never found the picture of that.) Jones was right in his role, though I thought he was It really started to see his age here. Jolie was conceived terribly as "Goodbye of Baby Foot", I think it is like a picture of a local population. I used to think that I did not just do Goodman in this role, although I would admit that only because I'm not more than John Goodman fan. Wherever this mixture appeared as an FBI agent, Justina Machado, although I did not really understand what the FBI was involved, which meant that only my attention could travel from the screen. Although it is explained, though, I missed it completely. Fortunately, this is a fairly small film, so you will not waste too much of your life in it. 2/10
