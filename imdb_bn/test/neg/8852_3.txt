After finally getting it from Amazon I was so excited to see "Pulse", and I had to say that I was frustrated. I think I was probably very hyped. I had hopes set by his fans that could only be met. After the other Asian horror love, I thought that it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story slowly and slowly. I'm a dreadful fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody insane of "The Devils Rejects" and I likewise love growing increasingly "a story of two sisters". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had no idea what the characters are doing and how they will help them solve their problems. It seems that if the director had closed the plot in one or two sentences and the rest were inappropriate by our actors. "A Story of Two Sisters", which is more similar to a plot line, "Pauls" ends up very less and leaves me feeling frustrated, confused, and uncertain in character attempts. My last statement about the plot was his inconsistency. At first it seemed that the story is going on in the spooky world and the means of running away from them is the Internet. That's an extraordinary original idea. I like that. But plot drones, plots-holes, and vague events are heading behind their heads, it seems that the director has switched to some mysterious story (ultimately clear), which is not enough just to be effective. <br /> <br /> I realized the discomfort of the shots and the setting was deliberate for the viewer to be shameless and isolated, but the atrocity of the film was only grainy, intensified by the density surrounding the galaxy. I thought that there was a certain feeling of spirituality with the movie, but my attention has just gone in and out. <br /> <br /> The work of some characters is a little ridiculous, and perhaps if I was more excited by the story, I would be able to postpone further mistrust but also to make myself unsupported so were some of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the reason behind the specific letters was absent and contributed to the contradiction of the plot. Perhaps it is the reason for the incompatibility of the plot which characters do suspicious things. To be honest I really do not care. <br /> <br /> The acting was modest. Of course nothing but nothing awesome. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said, do you know? In the end, especially if it covers more, I used to enjoy this movie almost (almost). Whenever I was showing the website it was quite uncomfortable, as well as some of the geological features faced our two main characters. The events that happened in these horrific run-ups are very unimaginable, annoying and truly gratifying for me "WTF". <br /> <br /> Now there are some things related to DVD ... Magnolia's release comes with "Pulse" subtitles, yes, but subtitles closed. They do not say the character's words at the right time. It may sound nit-picking, but it bothers me a bit and it can disturb something else. I think this is the only North American film to be released even though you both see or see dubbing (sleeping !!!). I tried to like the film, I really did. I wanted to keep this picture with Hippers ... but sadly, it became flat for me. If you are looking for another strange Asian movie, I can tell you "audition", "shatter", "story of two daughters", "strange circus" and "mortar" - all of them are my palette.
