The only thing I hope is that this picture was not an intelligent, talking motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This picture is just terrible horror. I gave it 1 star, of course, I mean I enjoyed it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad battle corography. The only real actor of this movie, Martin Landau, who is certainly working well, has played villain, though the character is your ideal cardboard cutout bad CEO / villain. Even the so-called "Plot Twist" was not even a shock. <br /> <br /> There was a lot to have fun in this movie, I enjoyed it a lot. And it was some impressive car debris stunts. <br /> <br /> Bad movie is good? Check out this one, ouch. Want a good movie? Not here.
