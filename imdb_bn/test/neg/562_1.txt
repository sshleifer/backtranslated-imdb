By the end of the 40s, at the end of 40's, by the end of the 40's, with the help of Bougert, the spectators were able to eat nostalgia at the end of the 30's. It fails unfortunately for several reasons. First of all, using reasoning like bogart and reasonably speaking and using his behavior, there is absolutely no lack of charisma or performance skills. This is really clear when Sakie does not imitate a scene from Baughart's films. Secondly, the character of the film was not able to work with actor Bogart. There is no one in this Peter Lor or Sydney Greenwichite. Surely we treat with performance among Victor Bueno, Olivia Hassie and others of George Roberts, but they are not the only ones (or are not given enough time at the screen level or missed). Third, "modern" humorous attempts are all gone. All the underwear jokes in Marlowe * will never get rid of that extraordinary cap and trench coat (even if bogurt) * almost * ever. Not only funny and really will drag this movie. Fourth, I did not hear any secret theme on Mitchell's side. Finally, the bogurt (and other classic actor works) is a matter of fact bogus fiction. Bogart almost * never * played straight hero, at that time he was a hero. She played complex characters. This movie turns Bogart into a trigger-happy, moral culprit. Although it was true for some movie characters, Bogert's characters rarely fit the bill. It is a movie that makes people in the movie of the past irrelevant, it seems that it is all right, "good people hurt the bad guy and get the girl" shit with low production value.
