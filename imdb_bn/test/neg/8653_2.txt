I had some expectations from this movie because 1. It was a production of Yash Raj. When the songs were shown on the first TV, they were very interesting. 3. The star (??!) Was new. Well, you must say that I could not sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lip-what the artist thinks ????!) Tries hard to look cool but sadly fails. I can not start her acting (if you can call it). 'Clavage Queen' Tony is crying and screaming all her, she just wants to pull you down. I think Uday was slightly more tolerant than him! She needs to send seriously the role she plays from her sister. The story is sad ... the same old effort and tested sources. Of course there is no originality. This movie is worth watching. Why my wonder was made in the first place!
