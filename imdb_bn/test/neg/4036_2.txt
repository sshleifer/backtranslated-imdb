I was terribly miserable for this to see this "B-movie" completely. <br /> <br /> I want to say --- save your time and money !!! This is going to be the worst B-movie ever, it should not be called a B-movie, like a movie! Because it fails in all aspects of making a good film: The story is not interesting, not all actors are thin and all are not trustworthy, it has bad side and action sequences are so fake, it's almost fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo is just full of stubborn lines that a respectable person can not be fun at least a bit. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to focus on the men, but all the women in it are so absolutely unattractive, especially that old wrinkled things come towards the end. They tried to appear sexy in those weird, awesome clothes and they sadly failed !!! <br /> <br /> Even some ridiculous B-movies will laugh at you, but it is very painful to see !!
