Italianians are frustrating and suspicious of the film's imitation "art" unmatched master. How they do an innovative, earn money and adopt foreign ideas, maintains a fundamental conspiracy and only involves complete activities, sledges and political mistakes. But when the non-Italian origin is already difficult to overcome in terms of a prominent infamous film and shield and controversy, what to do? Well, I guess, you just ignore everything in the context of story-building or stylishness and concentrate on creating a porn movie entirely! The release of Richard Fischer's successful slavery "Mandingo" inspired a year ago, but the makers were too lazy to think of different titles, you can not expect anything that is remotely similar to a descriptive depth, character drawing, indecent environment or cross-cultural relations. Related thought-provoking statement. "Mending" is a pure and just sexual attempt, in which the plot develops itself in the last ten minutes, in other words, when you have already taken care of long time ago. The character of this film is to combine the frustrating bastards, which must be expected when dealing with rich and unexpected white populations planted in South America. The elderly and supernatural owner of the place, a widow (who probably won a couple of "Muscle of the Year" prize), who worked for him exploited and abused the slaves. His grandson, if I understand correctly, his cousin (?), A real bitch of a woman who roams around the house to get together with the crucified slaves. When the owner of the owner comes back from Europe, when the vessel is destroyed purely 25 minutes, the plot is a little overdue. The handsome young man has had sexual relations with the rogue woman (even in front of slaves, how can their mother tongues "show" it?) But eventually she loves the girl of the Crocodile Preacher. Her romantic choice definitely makes madly mad women with anger, and she will change the life of planting forever which plots revenge an awesome cruel work. Hey I realized the intro of this plot, really the word "mandiga" is like an interesting movie! Well, I did not raise anyone's expectations and I apologize. This is an incredibly annoying and violent movie for the struggle, but if the themes appeal to you, then check the default "Mandingo" check. Much more than ill-exploitation, this film is a truly insightful portrait of mankind's darkest history pages and it also has real-world movies, real actors, great music and captivating movies. There is nothing in "Mandinga", absolutely nothing to give.
