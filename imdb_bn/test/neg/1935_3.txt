When I came out of the theater in 1996, I saw it. Remember that I was already familiar with Eliass Wood's work (well, he made the stuff before the "Ring of Link"!) And the film's merchandise tie was beautiful enough ("Flipper" water gun was also common). <br /> <br /> Adult's old movies and TV shows were reminded and Nostalgia's request was seen by their children, who were excited because it was a movie, a dolphin and a dumb boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was not anyone hoped and seriously flopped. You know a movie when a boy swims through a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a dolphin is afraid of the shark, and the goats - Instead of getting the water out of the boat - floats thanked dolphins for saving them for five minutes ... apparently He does not think that the shark is still there, perhaps even below it. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. She looks tired of old, crusty and recycling her Croc Dundee shtick. So far no one has remembered Hogan very little to "Crocodile Dandi", and I had hoped half that he suddenly said that he did not know what was the hair dryer for the fishes of fish / social mocking? <br /> <br /> <br /> All this is really a poor "family" movie which is amateur and often difficult. When I saw it in '96 in the theater, I hated and now I hate it.
