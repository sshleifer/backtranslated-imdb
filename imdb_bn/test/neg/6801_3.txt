After initial presentation about the turmoil of the 1960s, Diane Arbas (Nicole Kidman) may be forgiven as an early flower child. The film itself deserves this type of latitude. Due to the lack of character development, motivation and character behaviors, desperation makes desperation frustrating. I sat in observers and waited to explain some of the wicked acts that I was just allowing Shenberg to show me in a story which was another comedy. The few events that were presented did not match the life of Diane Arsace, which did not help much to clarify. <br /> <br /> The art of washing his life in the normal life of Dianna was completely opposite to the bright colors in it. Lionelera 'awakening' life! And the trap door stairs were an excellent demonstration of Diane's efforts to innovate in his existing family (but I do not see that the trap door in the roof of his dining room can connect directly to Lionel's apartment, from which two flights to the stairs). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is a little too much of a character that goes beyond a sentence or one comment to understand a character development and relationship. I liked to see at least one of Diane's photos. I will not wait for the sea.
