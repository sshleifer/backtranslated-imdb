This story is a mess of Ted Brice, the only surviving American pilot of the crash of the Allied re-plane crash in Belgium in January 1944. The title will move you to think that it is basically a story of the Belgian Armed Resistance Group, but it seems to be a retreat only in the context of a stupid love story between Ted and Claire, who accepted Ted. Claire's husband, Henry is a committed resistance member, but in the absence of Henry and his will, Ted decided to give shelter clear, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> The conversation center retrieves the flat area recorder below which contains the navigation code and the locations of the targets. But in the opening scene, we plundered the Belgian crew, and the members of the resistance group. Instead of waiting for the arrival of the Nazis and the guard of the plane, why did they not restore precious items? And the whole thing about the transfer of TED outside this area is carried out using secret instructions and code words when the transaction can only be a simple exchange. Ponderous music effort, but this tepid commitment is failing to lend some weight, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> At first Claire is dedicated to Nursing Ted near death and when Ted's recovery begins, she is physically involved (Henry is running a resistance business easily). Julie Ondon does a good job as Claire, but she affects a French accent that I often do not understand. During his reaction, it seemed a little weak - when news of hanging deaths of several city members was reported, he responded that the local grocer was thought to have come out of the peach. As Ted, Bill Paxton just seems to be reciting his line; Its performance is so unclear that it is embarrassing The proof of a true American pilot could be such a flat personality, but it is not for the movie convincing. I do not understand any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most painful thing is that Ted and Clare worked like lovers on holiday. Probably, sexual liberation from such a heavy situation can be understood, but it is difficult to disclose completely ignorance of the seriousness of the situation. Initially, Ted was worried about coming inside a ghostly house and Clayer's house. But he did not come to the house just like the development, with Clare's loud music, he played the game of baseball with the local people, and eventually went on a car trip to the nearby town of Clare. <<br /> <br /> The little boy seems to be the most committed to his role, but he is void by the script. He has an uncanny ability to be important events without being aimed. And when he delivered on line: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone hanged, they look like dancers, but they are not finding the floor." <br /> <br /> You think it's not a painter and a thirteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> And oh, the scenes can show that the Nazis are quite bad <br /> <br /> This photo is about brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" about Polish resistance, or French resistance equals "Lacombe, Lucien" By comparing it, it can understand how neutral it is.
