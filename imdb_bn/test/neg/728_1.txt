I sit and tired of several attempts to see "Gilmari girls" in this program. It baffled for me that I could not have my fingers on what I was about to do. Even a young woman is not going to become a baby boy in life? What is the daughter more than the girl than the girl? What is it about a rebellious rich girl and her disobedient daughter? What is this show about head? Finally, I just do not care. Cast wants to scream me. Writing is not "smart" or "intelligent" it's syrupy and tedious. <br /> <br /> Why did I see? Because I heard so many good things about this and I did not see the voice of an opinion until I saw it. The knee-jerk reaction is generally wrong, so I have seen a few times. The first time I saw it, I saw 12-year-old daughter and 40-year-old girl acting like a mother. Perhaps it did not attract me. I have never liked any of the "Frankie Friede" movies - it's a bit similar to this. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who sees this show every week. So I asked him, what is this program? A very bright young lady, revealing she can not usually give me a direct answer. So I asked those who asked about others - they really do not know. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is going to be a TV show which is similar to "Art House Movie" Many of us can not get it, but people who try hard to find the meaning of the one that does not really have it, can only be "hip". Yes, I found Loren Graham's Lorelai boring - shuddering, shivering, destructive. That's a full hour. How nice. And the rest of the cast is almost as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is hockey, the fold of the men, the grandparents are annoying, and sadly I do not care about any of these characters or care about what they do. It's like watching the dry paint on the wall.
