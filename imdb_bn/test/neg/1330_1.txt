This movie was terrible! My friend and I have been so annoyed that we are moving fast through the last half of the film to see what has happened. It is usually a sports thing, he wins or he loses. Only a remote interesting thing when a person refers to someone as a waag-e-tab-le That would be a line of my friends and I reminded us to waste this massive chassis cliche for many years
