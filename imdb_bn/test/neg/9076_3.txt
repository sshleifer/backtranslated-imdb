Other reviews talk about how much this movie has done, especially in terms of nudity in the male front. Well, those who have watched the nude actor frequently in Grande Ecole and expecting something similar are frustrating. Within a few seconds of the Judo team locker room, the side of the side of two leads lasts 15 seconds in the shower. There are brief moments in comparison to female lead. Many of these movies are focused on male listeners, but those who indicate homosexuality in their two men (their best friends, one of whom has a girlfriend with three ways) will be disappointed. Even there is no indication of being interested in others, even they do not even know that the other is an army of men. As a movie, Douglas Fouadies is strangely uninterrupted; Visitors get very little knowledge of how these three young people, how they feel, and how the audience behaves. The original cut has been removed for about an hour; Perhaps this picture looks frustratingly backward. Grande Ecole, which promises a French film more than that.
