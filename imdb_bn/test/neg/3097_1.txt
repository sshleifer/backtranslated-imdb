Stay yourself a benefit and stay away from this film. 50 crore in 10 minutes If you want to work hard, do not rent it! If you want to see any other independent film then <br /> <br /> I never thought I saw Burt Reynolds in this film. It's the thinnest plot line ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even Haaslehof made better drug addiction. I'm not better than to hire a hul hogan or dolph lundgreen, but do not want to bother you with more information about this vague movie. This should prove to me my points, if you get my drift. <br /> <br />
