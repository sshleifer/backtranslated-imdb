Yet another version of all Gangster Flickr meat-another additional promotional campaign due to the classic "Godfather" and Media Circus. Director Ram Gopal Varma's 13th Hindi film government, his underworld trilogy is the weakest, the other two excellent-truths and companies. Churchism, the magnetic personality of the two children played for the first time on the screen as a father and son, certainly a treatment to see. Not only strong performance, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest score point here for which Verma should be praised. However, the same equation of the two is absent with other characters in the film. The reason - other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. Volumes usually represent Bollywood Baddies. A character attracting attention is not a big boy guided by Keek, but is unable to retain half-baked characteristic. . Drama and conflict are survived by excessive use of closed-shots, which create a environment that accurately brings clastrophobic effects. Hunting score (Amar Mahile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikh Lalwani and Anup Dev), together with bold, pink backgrounds, impressive by the powerful images (Amit Roy's camerawork), contributes to the visuals of the rumu style. But there is no lyrics in the film though there is an overuse of music. But can the interest of the "intelligent growing" audience today be on the shoulders of only two actors and strong visuals? I do not think so. Of course, the audience "maangey more" and fails to provide the film here. To add a new dimension, in an orientation, the maximum prerequisite is the screenplay, which is lazy here, is not crisp in places, and so the speed usually decreases for most. Ultimately the audience is very ordinary, very little drama with very little surprise element is the subject matter. Top stunt director Alan Amin Ghani is not in his best form. There are some scenes for different scenes - a minister is unhappy about the government and the boy is wailing; The government was shot dead in a very amateur manner in prison, the government fled from the back of his enemies, Junior was inspired to kill his father easily, a boy secretly assaulted Junior, a police commissioner, who entered his father's house and killed him. To create more contingencies needed for the back-bone which requires a more realistic, hard-heating approach. Dialogue is so weak for such A Prime Minister's government is watching an amateur line that tells junior ?? "And Joe is not the commissioner of police. Government people completely disregard government work When the government talks about arbitrary negotiations with his family about arbitrary negotiations, he still finds little. In fact, this image follows graphically similar to Ramu's own production- Aach Tech shadow. Describing war between good and evil, on the other side of life - law, police, administration, politics are completely ignored. Of course, more content is expected. Here the film falls short and the average rent can not rise above. Dear Ramu, you are laughing at your bank now, there is a need to delay your film production factory, before it's very late.
