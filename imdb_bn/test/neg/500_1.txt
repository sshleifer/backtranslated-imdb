I saw this last play with an open mind. Sorry to say it's still bad. First of all, the movie is not very loud and you can not hear what people are saying. Especially Richard Masour's pronunciation is bad. What is French chick doing in this photo ??? Her worst miscasting Walken's makeup is weird. Harvard scenes are vain and are not needed. Unlike Kristoferson's character and I wanted to kill him and go away. Meanwhile, the Walken character dies very quickly and easily (despite makeup). The colonists are all stupid. You get organized in a bunch of hicks, people are coming to kill you !!!!! John Hurts is the character of some humor but all that is available. <br /> <br /> I have nothing better to say about this extra piece. The only good thing is that it has ruined the director's career and killed the United Artists. <br /> <br /> After all these years still strap.
