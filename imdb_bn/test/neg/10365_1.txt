This movie has kept a perfect movie that tries as a stoner movie because the characters are looking for the pot but none of them is the only rubbish of smokers. Thomas Hayden will not run the film, especially the film which is a waste of the film. Those who liked this movie have made good comments, but here some people are not just watching and watching movies, so they think that any bad movie sucks good actors and throws them off the film. <br /> <br /> I think many people are getting upset because the film tries to look like a final weed movie, when I sometimes see the worst movie about weeds. I hope that the director will stop directing the director like frogs. These even weeds can not make this movie fun or entertaining.
