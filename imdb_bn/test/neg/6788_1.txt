This will be the worst show I've ever seen. I always like Chocolate Norris in the movies, but because of the Little Miss Marker's Sheryli Temple, a black side kick is threatened, why do we have to be politically correct? I also think the show was limited because you can kick and attract a person face to face. I know an African American who looks like this Trivate man and kicks his butt once a week, he sees all the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is a man and all the qualities he has got, I think ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
