This is really a two-half film. Afganistan works in detail before the attack by Afghanistan in the late 70's, the relationship between life and friendship of two children (a special authority Pashtun and another Hajj Hajra). Young actors play a strong role and watch Afghanistan because they at one time exhausted the current situation. <br /> <br /> The real problem comes when we move to the next stage of the story where we join Pashtun as a person living in America. Old credit to his young friend led him to return to his homeland and this incident really broke. The central adult character is definitely thought to be sympathetic, but actually comes as wallowing in wimpish and self-pity. It's really hard to care for him and nobody can help but it seems that this is a really interesting story we can not see - his boyfriend's friend <br /> <br /> <br /> Once he returned to Afghanistan The story became very bogged down in a series of highly conquaded coincidences. On most occasions, he often moves his childhood to this childhood soon after (though he is not looking for him), which has created chaos since then. This allows him to encounter past demons in a way that is simply very convenient to be credible. The resolution of the story is also carried out with a horrific, damaging feeling that reduces the film's ability to make any serious points. <br /> <br /> While starting to see their letters and their misuse, living life as a symbol of a state separated by world politics is actually seen as a film that is involved in a wide political debate. Instead of describing self-exploration and healing reduction of one's character's emotional journey. Unfortunately, this character is so inferior and it is difficult to engage itself in the story, although the opportunity to create truly interesting films about Afghanistan has been lost.
