This awesome action ?? Sci-Fi movies are a shit. I spent 90 minutes in my life which I have ever seen, one of the worst movies. The story does not make any sense, the screenplay has a lot of flaws, the characters have been poorly developed, the unknown cast is awesome, the lead ham actor seems old for his role. I was inspired to buy this VHS, which has a fantastic cover, and see this frog due to an unreasonable IMDb user rating and some "ten stars" reviews. I have just verified the author, and each of them has just a brief review ("L.I.N.X.") and nothing else being issued on IMDb. Why are they promoting a junk? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L. INX., Conexo Lettell" ("L. INXX Lithal Connection")
