I jumped for joy to learn the last of these shows. The characters of this show were extremely annoying. None of them was a singer redeeming quality. Damon Wayans are probably the most permanent one. Kishan Campbell ... Kishan Campbell He is boring as Martin. <br /> <br /> Children are very annoying. The oldest is a fool, the oldest girl is a stuck-up brat, and most young people are frustrated to hear hear. <br /> <br /> I like cute little boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
