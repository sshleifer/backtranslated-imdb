Gently entertaining and self consciously cheezy - but perhaps it could be what? One of his most vulnerable roles, and he often dubbed the word sound. McClure believes it is very cheesy, but who can blame him in the fallout of this movie, whose ancient dinosaurs are considered to be "common in color" of the 19th century on human rule, but not enough, and unfortunately this script carries on the racism of apartheid. Literature section in films. Good attempts from the actor, but a weak imaginary production.
