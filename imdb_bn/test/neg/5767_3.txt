I'm not saying terrible movies love. Big budget, low budget, big name actor, no name actor, it does not matter. And when movie comes to trial, I am very sorry. But this movie is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Actors do not show little or no emotion while supplying their lines and acting I have seen that much less budget is worse than Flickr. As the actors stop killing, you may care less. Very few Gore (I do not know what any other critics have seen in this film, because there is no reason, because it is not) and special effects are always poor. They stole a lot from many horror movies (Zipar Cripps, Friday 13th, Leprachun) and still do not help it. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, I have seen at Showtime and do not actually have to pay it to see it or a spot waste in my Netflix queue any extra money. There are many good horror movies and I suggest you see this big letdown instead.
