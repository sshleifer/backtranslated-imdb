Yes, I spell that exactly. This film is so anticipated, the actual word needs extra characters as an example of predictability. From the moment the main character and situation is introduced, it will take us to this plot, where the figure by number. Fourseding was fine as two tons of slughammer. You can take many pieces of dialogue and eventually hope it will play a role. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Effard did a great job of reducing the role and Abigail Breaslin played an excellent role. This did not bring anything completely new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was tepid and smiles weak and a few. Of course, if you have nothing to watch it is a good movie, but you will not miss anything in its absence.
