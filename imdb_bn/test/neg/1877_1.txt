I live in Mexico City, so trailers for every part of the trash from these stupid Mexican filmmakers have to be hurt. Do you want to compliment a Mexican guy for making great movies? Take a look at Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devils Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I do not really like his movie but I respect them). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> If you respect your brain, please avoid this piece of **** all costs. Be more intelligent to watch some wedding videos or watch the reality show in Britain. I got more IQ than this 'film'.
