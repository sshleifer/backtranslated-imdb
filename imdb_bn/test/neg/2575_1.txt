Most people forget that Seagal has an action movie form. This movie was simply no substance. Very long, drawn out, and annoying. The scenes were much more than them - the camera will often focus on something for a long time if absolutely nothing happens. Cure for insomnia. Most of the pictures are the worst pictures (I like her other movies). 1/10
