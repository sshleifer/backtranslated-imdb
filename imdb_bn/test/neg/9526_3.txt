A person who knows the film ship and some other ships, I can not even see the movie as a movie. There is something wonderful in a movie, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them are in the existing ships - certainly in the scene of disaster, and a certain house under the deck. But about the stories and dialogs I can simply call it big shit. Such a real ship will not be like the ships. It is no surprise that this movie had a bad effect on the existing ships - if I did not know well, I was definitely not tempted to travel on a sailing boat. Certainly, after the sail for the Europeans, I propose to switch. Then, too much mental, a lot of American part that I could not bear. The picture is really great, Ridley Scott is no wonder in the film, but if you can avoid the text it will be better.
