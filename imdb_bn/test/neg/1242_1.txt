Maybe I'm here alone, but this is a shit show. I'm sorry but I got to know about Lil Bill Bill Orlee (which I did not realize until a few months after this show, and I got honesty after losing her appeal) but I gave Shot a fair shot. Spike tries to make it difficult to do something that is to say, he tries to be a man. Fox was not even bothered to hide the strings while taking her out of the box that came out of her. Her sketches try hard to work, she does not feel herself funny and the writer is struggling to write material for non-talent host. There is a lot better TV here to waste your time with this event, and Fox has had some good time with us, but you have to get your F $% * ing together and instead of some original "I too" network To try to be.
