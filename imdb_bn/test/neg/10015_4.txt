The Earth has destroyed a nuclear holocaust. Well, some parts of the world, because in Italy somewhere, the pure barbarian survival band - those who survive without radioactive pollution - they hide in a huge palace surrounded by soft soils, waiting for the next chance to suffer from unexpected bloodshed. . One of the final executives will be the victim, Alan (William Mang, who is not observing much like Cart Russell), and his efforts to threaten legalized hunters, led by Edra (Marina) Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to beat former NYPD police Sam (Woody Stroud), who is mostly hanging for his student moral support and for drugged meat. The Stroud is the best thing in the film, though it does not look good at all and it is only about one-third of the running time. For the story, it combines elements of better films and stories, including ten Little Indians, Most Dangerous Games and New York Access. The final executor runs along the right pace and provides reasonable entertainment for the fans of low-marginal workers.
