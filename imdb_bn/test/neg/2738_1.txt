The script of this movie is different from others, most notably the core, another bad movie. Why is it not clear why Louie Perry does a lot of work, but beloved Le Commander Warf (Michael Doren) resigned to do just that, sorry <br /> <br /> I can not really imagine a plot tower that is not coming one mile away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Lava stream at the beginning of the film, introducing things at very low levels, indicating the upcoming global disaster. And it gets any good from that point.
