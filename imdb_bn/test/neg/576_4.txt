This picture is a mysterious love letter that turned the life of love into 4 people. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting, and the movie could have been fun. However, this image should not be a romantic comedy only. The letter is unexpectedly launched first, so it gets confusing. Helpful characters come and go without adequate reasons, as they exist only for a specific scene and then disappear into thin air. Pacing seems very slowly like 90 minutes and 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was romantic and fun, but this movie has been visually failed.
