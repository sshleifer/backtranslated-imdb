When I first saw this movie, I did not know its title. I realized that it was with the same name that Chedacea had been in Chevy Chase, so I thought this was Cadetsac 2. When I got to the end of the movie, it was Cadetsac 2. They could do well Dan Acrooyd I thought bad. The whole story was bad. Call this title by another title, but do not call it CaddyShack. You give a bad name to that great movie. When the daughter of Jackie Mason saw the first she saw her wife. How old is this girl? Geez How about making this movie a little credible? I was good at Cherry Chase.
