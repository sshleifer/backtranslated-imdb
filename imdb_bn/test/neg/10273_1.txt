I have relieved the next reviews - all have positive reactions, I started thinking that movies (and life) of my burden are completely different from everyone else in the world. Everything in this movie was lying to me ... characters, dialogues, manipulute soundtrack, authentic description, all of it. As soon as each scene was uncovered, I was thinking, "People do not work like that." It is steady heavy hammer and maudlin. In one sense I think this movie blames you for liking or like it, because it deals with serious and real people and problems. But man, it really does not work for me.
