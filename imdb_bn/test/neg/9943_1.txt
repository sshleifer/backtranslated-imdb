I watched hundreds of Kung Fu movies and I heard some good news about this film, so I decided to try it. What I've seen is the worst show I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to get the views of every musical person in Hong Kong in this picture. Everyone overacts point of stupidity There were also civil civilizations of Canaan Barbarian. In this movie, only half-evolved men are shouted out to every scene and foolish women, who have no self esteem. The character of the narrator should be killed for too much sucking ... he was not really worth saving. The whole film was a medderratic mess, terrible acting, bad direction and bad work. They should name this movie only with 'Stupid One-Sammed Guman with a Blade'. Here's a question ... Why do some directors use quick chit for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortage of actors. Each view was closed and quickly cut without the flow. The film tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost ridiculous Please stay away from this movie, it's a taste for your kung fu movies ... or any taste in the movie.
