Well !! This movie contains Kathryn Zeta Jones. This is a hallmark television movie. This is a Thomas Hardy novel. It's Catherine Jette Jones. She is the only one who works better than the Human School Theater Class. Oh yes it's Clive Owe. I'm not British, which means almost as Thomas Hardy's novel. He is without "Bourne Identity", and I like it. That just wraps up all of the folks in it. That was really all that. I'm getting repetitive, but I like Siezagez, so I finally stopped it. The computer tells me that I do not have 10 lines and I'm counting them. I always count 11, but maybe it does not like my style, but this is my opinion of the film.
