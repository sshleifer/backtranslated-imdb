Margaret Mitchell spins his grave every time someone saw this mess! Fine clothes and sets can not begin to enjoy the remarkable performance of Joan Halleley (as the title character) and permanently as Timothy Dalton (as Rite). Worse than even acting - and perhaps partly explaining it - the script, which is surprisingly cliched and expected. The brutally bad script you score a score that you have to cring, and you've got a disaster that I do not want to see from a viewer. Scarlett is simply amazingly lazy, and I can not imagine how it's made, it's much less in the video.
