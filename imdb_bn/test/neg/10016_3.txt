Many people are standing in front of the house, some women crying ... standing in close clans and speaking in silent voice ... some people are coming and discussing how sexy they can be to today's girl. You will soon find that someone in the house Someone is dead ... the dead man's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, sitting next to her friend, Roti Sahaji Ta It gives the idea of ​​making it easy ... The son of a dead person is talking to someone on the mobile, the girl is busy with her makeup ... her mother is advising her to wear salwar kameez, but she can see a lot of good people when she is very People are coming to their house and so on with the jeans and t-shirts on the slave chemistry ... another boy asks for the end of all his mother's actions and He should not expect that he should get out of the office ... then the camera gradually focuses on the dead ... the face covered white cloth is slightly disconnected due to the wind, expressing the face ... its unique khair ... suddenly the alarm The ring and he got up in bed ... Is this his dream or flashback? The film will not get the answer till the end ... Well, for WT comedy director Dibakar Banerjee! Later you can not find anything to do with this scene in real movies, and so everything that is clearly stated was a dream. Is this a film comedy? Well it is supposed to belong to that category ... but it is not actually !!! There is nothing that can be remotely connected to comedy in the movie !!! The director gets more messages that nobody will get justice from the police !!! So everyone cheats will have to cheat !!!! Or forget about trial !!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla are okay ... There is nothing to say about other sectors ... Bad script destroys everything ... Even the unrivaled khair acting is not successful even at least making one pipe vasal ...
