This movie is by far the worst movie, the story line is weak and never seen what happened after 20 people gave up their hands. This is really my bug. It drags on and out over no annoying, very annoying. The only good thing was Cast, Oo, a lot of big time actors and actresses. But besides this, it was terrible, terrible and annoying, please do a favor on your behalf, do not see it. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10
