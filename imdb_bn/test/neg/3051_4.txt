Before joining Oliver Hardy, there was one of the many silent comedy Stan Laurel, 'Mood and Sand' was a ho-hume dictation. The story is misguided - even though it may be due to modern day editing - and humor itself is not all inventor. <br /> <br /> Potential plotlets have been started and ignored; For example, he never succeeds for Stan's commitment to the philit de solay payment that he had with her. The character of Stan does not seem very centered, but before the development of Lorel and Hardy's reputation, it was a critical criticism of his work before the development of Stanley, so maybe I had the expectation of this expectation. <br /> <br /> I firmly believe that all silent movies should be saved and seen, and I am happy that this one is still available. This is not just a great film.
