I found this DVD in stores and figured, why some indy film support and see a cool awesome flick. Save your time and money and pass this one. Acting, script, everything with this picture is actually everything sub par. Not really a lot of stories, and there are no character development. As long as I did not take care of what happened to the film. Everyone is supposed to be college age, but they all see them in the middle of thirty years, the woman who shows the mother is not pushing 40. Actually the worst part of the film is that each scene shows a master shot. No edits, no inserts or close compromises. Make yourself a favor and avoid it.
