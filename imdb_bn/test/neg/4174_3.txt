The idea of ​​the movie was not very bad: a horror movie shot in a grape shrine in Halloween. The worst part was the frustrating camera work, ten million shots of powder and corn, and this man walked a half-and-a-half hour walk. Oh, I'm sorry, "Mother." I chose this movie because it reminded me of a corn mazar near a living, and I think it was a great idea for a movie. But considering everything, it seems that your average Joe can take the same idea and can run a lot more with it. Bill Cowell's performance was not very bad, in fact, I did say it was quite good. But his lack of talent from his co-star did not help his efforts. Here is expected to be easy to swallow her next movie.
