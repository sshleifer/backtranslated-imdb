I was soon drawn into this movie, because my surprise was a lot, because I was not intended to see it all. Now I did not want to. Suspension begins, as a result of the hit-and-run questioning whether the guilty character will accept or find out (or now, there is no number in the old days of film making)). This plot has already been done - there is no plot - but it absorbs the first half with the tension involved, the extra complexity of the fall in love and the motivations. The film then left the hit-and-run and fell in love with two unexpected, sufferings. The plot has two tracks - hit-run-run and unreasonable love - there is not enough of each other, and they involve the same characters, it is not enough to justify departure from the original story. Line. The screen authors should choose a plot or another. At the end of the film, in the middle of the second funeral of the film, I started thinking of myself, "Now, what does it have to do with hit-run?" The filmmakers can think the answer clearly, but I think the film was plotted and was executed foolishly.
