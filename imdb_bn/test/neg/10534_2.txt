Steven Segel's film career is inspired in horror movies. As soon as I realized that they were more absurd than Jean Claude Vandemme, I was unhappy with each of them. Does anyone else notice that he never gets hurt? I mean, give me something to root ... the fight for a tough fight with a bad guy who is scary. Quarterly years and he is still filming the same war scene. War scenes can often confuse you from your hero that can not work. A seagull film's dismal performance of acute danceography has its painful lack of performance in the relief. Worse yet, he wofully out of shape. Just what we need, is a fat strong who he thinks of a leading man. In these movies, there is no one to retain cinematic quality recovery in the ninety or so minutes. Unless you feel like throwing an hour and a half hours of your life, do not see it.
