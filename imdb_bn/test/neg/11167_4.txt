This is the script and I know what you did last summer in a rip-off of the already violent Hollywood movie. The story is classic, some high school students misfit class bust 'is a fantastic try but something goes wrong. Terrible mistake When you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it happens, if the film is scary, it is not good. The actors are quite right and girls are cute (after all, they are Asian) so I will give five out at mojave'o'meter.
