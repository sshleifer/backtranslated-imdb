I saw it as part of a Vampire movie marathon with the intention of research, otherwise I would not see it all the way through the way. A first scene of the vampire bunch in the very bad wigs is probably to get electricity by several slow moving weapons operated by a slow moving van Helsing wannabe ... with black and white ... the rest of the motion set film for the whole, with a voice. War scenes seem ridiculous, if the performance is not so bad, the dialgies will be fun, no tendency for the plot can be understood and bites of production prices (the heroes are clogged from the spike coat. <br /> <br /> I have some bad movies (B-Rothbone, or Raven, check out the Magic Torch with the youngest Jack N.), but this one is always my vote for the worst Gets
