Matthew Aldrich This is a name to remember. This is the person who takes the finger on the keyboard and comes in one of the worst scripts of all time. Footstool Predictable Insult of the intelligence of the people. <br /> <br /> Is he the only one to blame? Of course not. Ronnie Harlin has taken this disrespectful excuse for a script and made it in a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and starred it. Lots of goodness. <br /> <br /> This is Dennis Richards of film scripts. There is not enough space for the universe to correctly accurately acknowledge the true horror of this writing. <br /> <br /> In all, Samuel Jackson's career is incredibly novel and the method presented is very creative, but at the end of the day, it's just all the trimmings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Package the way you want - Writing of rubbish is still written in junk.
