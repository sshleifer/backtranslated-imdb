In short, my friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside of the theater, which share our favorite gaffe, plot isolation, ornamental rock, and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I think the story is inappropriate and Dino embryos are still found to be used as locking from Jurassic Park to Shaving Cream Canter as plot lines are unused. The edit was poor and no letter added any sympathy or feelings. In short, there was no mystery and romance in this movie that the first film was provided from the point of view of the story <br /> <br /> Even new dinosaurs were less and far away (although I really enjoyed Piotrdactil.) We have received several new species Short shots and only 2 were really involved in this work. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former childhood placientologist, lack of any real scientific material (it can not be realistic, but logically, such as # 1 and Malcom's disorder created dinosaurs in raming) was also frustrating. <br /> <br /> In short, to make the film visible, there was nothing but an excuse to slice the dinas into something. I hope the filmmakers will not fall into this trap again (though I have seen clearly)
