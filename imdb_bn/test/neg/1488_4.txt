Like many Western Pennsylvania buffs in history, I was really looking forward to this very energetic PBS program produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. Anyway, I would say now that I was somewhat disappointed. In a positive sense, I believe that this film has done a perfect job explaining the basics and describing events of so-called French and Indian wars. In particular, the presentation of Indian perspective was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it was certainly stressed over time. Alongside the positive side, the combination of stories and action scenes has been done well and has been somewhat better than this general document created in "Expert" Interviews and Photo Styles (a La Why Burn). On the negative side, many battles had some "staged" appearance and many important aspects of the war were ignored. I was very disappointed and frustrated about how successful Forbes' successful campaign against Fort Duusen compared to the previous failure of 1754, due to the failure of Broadcast 1754. In particular, I was somewhat unbelievable that there was no mention of the kernel Henry Bucket, a Swiss tenant in British service who was most responsible for the success of Forbes. Finally I could not believe that the end of the Bushy War of 1763, which began as a repeat of Broad's defeat, but the victory of the battle of Pontiac was won by the decision that the children of the same kernel must be thanked by the rank as the most successful British commander of this war.
