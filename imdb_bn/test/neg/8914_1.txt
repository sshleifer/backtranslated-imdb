TDY is probably the worst piece of direct hit trash single in direct video selection. They have taken a scene from The Order, played by Genie Claude Van Dam, and are personal favorites for the Van Dam B movie comedy. Segal has done some good things in the past but he has read very little in my book and probably will not be marked for any other underwear or death until he is sitting and spending a very good brain storm with himself. <br /> <br /> It also bothers me that he did not do much as he did in previous styles. If you are ready to see a trash can or a movie fit for glasses, then conclude all of this, then rent you died today.
