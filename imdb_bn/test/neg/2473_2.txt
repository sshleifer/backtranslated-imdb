I can not believe I'm sitting in this movie! It was absolutely terrible, and fully deserved cringe, and yet I sat through thinking it was good to get it. It is not, and I have lost 2 hours of my life. Smith will be very good in action movies - I love him, Robot, State Independence Day, and Independence Day - and I do not think he can cure the whole film as a romantic lead. Then again, the script was intolerable horror, and the dialogue was so sugar. <br /> <br /> I used to like everyone except Albert's character, even the one that I got was with heavy hands. If you want to see a modern feel-good romantic comedy, look for something like Guy-to-House How to Lose or Harry Met Sally within ten days. The 40-year-old Virgin left me with a smile on my face. I even loved this song and the song above - and yes, I know it's sugar, but at least it did not take itself seriously, and was sweet. I do not like the lead female leadership - and I was not sure about chemistry between him and Will Smith. <br /> <br /> I think there were two scenes that I liked (and of course not ending, which was boring and unbelievable!) - When calling her Sarah when she did not give her name was quite sweet. , And - no, sorry, I like about this whole picture. Do not waste your time.
