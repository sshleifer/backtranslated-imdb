I absolutely hate this movie Although the movie wanted to send some sort of social message, it was completed in a clich√© raided and melodramatic like Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> The role was also terrible, especially Charitine and her son. It is one of the problems of Dominican films, they use celebrities that can not attract people only. <br /> <br /> I'm more ashamed about the positive reviews here, which sadly denotes that Dominicans instead of giving us honest and critical opinions, condemn what has been done here, which will help in quality based on our film industry.
