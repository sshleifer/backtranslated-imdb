Despite the great cast and the potential of the story, the film failed in many layers. I was sure that the director was a beginner. The film has been edited very badly, shows many important and annoying strikes, it has a very visible cave and there is no suspicious environment. When this question was repeated in my mind, the question was: "So what?" I care less about the hero and can not happen to her. It is not that the story is not compulsory, it is just given. The movie tells the story. Duration It's like an actor who destroys his lines, I do not know what he's saying. The movie only tells events that happened without any spirit. And the director's blame. She does not know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable. (And believe me, I'm not someone who wants to die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy. Conversely, I especially like slow movies.) So I was sure that the director was a teacher. But for my surprise this man has had many years of experience and he has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant in the wonderful productions. Then he guessed back to a bad year then.
