This is just a long advertisement for "The Death Tunnel" movie. Although it is an interesting history of the Weaverly Hills Santorum, the whole ghost theory is above your explanation. The more "Ghost Orbs" you can duplicate with dust in front of the flash camera and "Istoplasmic Mast" burns only cigarette smoke camera flash. I did not see "shadow people" until the picture was drawn around the blurial distortion of an image. No scientific explanation is proposed for phenomena, only unusual. Perhaps these events are only to be believed, so make sure to plan your viewing on Santos in Louisville, Kentucky on your next holiday.
