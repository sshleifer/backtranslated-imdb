Why do they publish this movie on us? It seems as if they were to refute the film Ana Rice and make this film for every surrendered Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the plot work undertaken in interview with the vampire, separates the plot of the novel, and Stuart Townsend is drunk. <br /> <br /> Stewart is not our Lestat! Our brat princess, our adventurous rebel with humorous sense. A second rate of stewart, Dracula's annoying rip in black skin. He does not know the book or the character of the book ... is he uneducated? Tom Cruise is Disclaimed and he still made a point to read books and love Lease and love. <br /> <br /> Do not let yourself alone, it's "stand alone" vampire trash plain and not easy.
