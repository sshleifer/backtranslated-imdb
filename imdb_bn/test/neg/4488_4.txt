This movie was a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks was a great romance writer and this movie had the chance to grow as a notebook, but the notebook's dream team had two separate sets. McAdams and Gosling, but here it is flawlessly thrown by the minor acting of Channing Tutam. <br /> <br /> I felt that his scenes were unusually disrespectful for his performance, different emotion scenes were lost because he was a weird and helpless Leaving the situation, Amanda Sefred simply drops the ball to the tatam Has given a great performance and has lost the mood and can not recover the scene. <br /> <br /> This story is worth throwing right, but what did it get is a beautiful boy who can act. What Tatum should look good is, more about its physical capacity in the movie, though horrible, GI JOE, step up, and fight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Like me on the kingdom Adam Sandler. I gave him the same opportunity, I did not see him here as the sum of his past roles, entirely by his performance in this film, which was sadly a nightmare
