When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "Well this hack sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and returned home. I was shocked when I entered my DVD player. <br /> <br /> Everyone, nobody told me it was a Mexican movie and spoke Spanish, the good thing was subtitles. <br /> <br /> Second, it was naked, naked naked! As I have no background in Mexican movies, so I saw when you can see my shock. Eat! Virgin eyes, no * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the way upwards. <br /> <br /> Fourth, Howdy and Kike were mixed again, so sugar. <br /> <br /> Fifth, how the movie ends It's a BAD, BAD finish. Why was Mr. van der Lind's sudden approval for Mayor's election, because his daughter knew how to throw a party ... Bla, Bla. I was optimistic that it was not easy to accept, the director might have grabbed it. <br /> <br /> After all these bad things are abhorrent, good things come here. The film was actually a little fun, and Mariebell was painful in the kitchen and all, the attitude of Heidi, poetic with the word of Valentina. I really like the song that Valentina made about her daughter's friend. They were just so, for all that, and other elements which I did not mention.
