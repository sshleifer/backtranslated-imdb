I sold and saw - new - for $ 6 for my local store and I said, hey! From Blacksport, an action film and dragon with the dragon with that guy, indicated by the dragon - and it's cheap! So I bought it. Oops! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen and I saw some dosage. <br /> <br /> You know how movies are deliberately like Campi, Evil Dead 2 and Dead-Alive, what's great? You know how movies are considered serious but you smile so laughing loudly and want to see them again like LionHart (old van dame film) or a vampire of John Carpenter? This movie is not ironhart, they are not even among them. I do not know what filmmakers are thinking, but it seems that this movie is about time to shoot, for a budget, and no script is mentioned. (When I'm on the script note, let me tell you that there is no line in Yehang's film - the only reason for getting the first billing in the box is that he is the only actor in this movie that you (unless you are a Jackie Chan fan, but you recognize a bad guy And you want to call him Jiancollo!) <br /> <br /> From '92. At that time, T2: The Day of Judgment came out, so you know that At 80 The camp era has ended ... but not much of it. After that, you think of the 80's Chuck Norris movie, high school comedy, and Jason / Freddy Sutles, a perfect pupil. <br /> <br /> Topics: <br / > <br /> 1) Someone in the picture can not make the beans. Richard Norton is your nearest rich and playful, and say Yeung looking properly ... and cocky. Everything else is horrible. <br /> <br /> 2) The scenes of martial arts are forgotten - white boys just shut their shirts to many muscles, screams, runs in Britain's rhythm, takes Briton's Lee, getting punched by Britton Lee, then falling down. Even the final appearance of Boloos is frustrating short, and creative about designing my moving socks (and equally weird). <br /> <br /> The rest of the action is also unfortunate, the appearance of the guns came from the K-Mart's toy division, and in fact they set fire to a caption. When someone shoots, they roam a little, then on their clothes there is a brown-red liquid split. Briton Lee definitely shoots beside him, but you do not see it all, then you see that wound that day ... was worse than cutting my paper! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, the girl is wearing a wound, then they kiss, then the next thing you know is that they are talking after listening to bed. is not it? What? Apart from credible development of love interest, it is completely ignored for the development of any type of character. Remember how did Bruce Lee's characters need to have sex with someone to be cold? <br /> <br /> 5) The car's chair I saw so far as bad. It looks like the director is sitting beside the handheld camera, because two cars have broken into the street, oh, I do not know, about 30 miles an hour? Do not try this home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Really bad writing. Here is a scene for you: Lee is following, so she follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but his car is very slow. So when she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their car and there is a gunfight there. Lee has killed two bad players in the league, but the third is shooting in Lei, when the girl runs around Lee, so the bad guy goes away. (Hu?) Then the girl's car stalls and she can not start. He is now involved with Li and he is coming with her. He told him that they could not leave the car because bad guys found him. He firmly believes in the way he will deal with this problem - so he beat the gas tank and beat his car. (And remember that they are sex the same night.) Hu ?! <br /> <br /> 7) If you look closely, in more than half of nightclub shots, dancers are very compatible music. Dancers are very coordinated with each other (apparently all dance clubs in the '80s read dance). DJ Booth has a daughter with a microphone, but she does not do anything except dance. Bouncers are telling people without their lips that "take them out" At one stage, only bouncers Lee and Steve are inside the entrance gate, but with their back! Also, apparently, if you are a major character in the film then you can go directly to the head of the line. Lee is being followed for the first time, but he will not notice 'second time - even though it is the same guy in the same car. Girl, however, notice. Bad people follow twice, but they never notice. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the bad guy will give the car back to him, even though they showed him where he is working twice. The girl goes to the care of her child during the time of her childhood, when she closes sexually with Lia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
