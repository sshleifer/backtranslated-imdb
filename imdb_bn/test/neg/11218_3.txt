Actually there are good reasons why a person's risk of being completely insane by seeing this show. Breasts are beautiful, although they do not have anything real, but they usually come in pairs, which are good. The beach at your screen is a very comfortable experience, because it is not very worrisome about taking it easily and eating it with rubber sharks. It's always good to keep in mind, David Hesselhoff is a god. Not God, but a god. There is not so much about his acting skills, since no one is there, but his chester talks a lot. Also, this series does not contain any kit that is good, because Mr Hasselhoff said in an interview that he was always gay that he was gay. Naturally, he can show it as stupid, but considering the statement he made recently, it should not be surprising to anyone. <br /> <br /> In short, such shows, that people are completely innocent. It gives us a lot of things to watch and laugh at, which many deliberately humorous shows really do not really give us. I want to say that Borott does not fall in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, this is not a great show, it's really awesome, but I enjoy watching it. It's basically like a B-movie that lasted for a ten-year period.
