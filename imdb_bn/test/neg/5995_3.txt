This should be rock. VH1 has been removed from Traditional Devices (Whitney Houston, Selen Deon, etc.), which made so folly in 2003's show. Sadly the step taken backfired. The show had no MC keeping the show together. In December 2003, Queen Latifah performed a fantastic display. The Show featuring Lady Patterson labeling Lady Marmade's terrible representation, featuring Patty Labels, Syndy Loper, and Jessica Simpson. Ok in the studio with some control they can make all the great sound. <br /> <br /> However, why are they competing with each other? Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre face expression when she sings that I've ever seen! Cindy Luper also played the girl just wants to have fun. That was not bad but it was very impressive. Was still the worst! Syndy and Patty label together for the Cindy Hit hit 'Time Better Time'. It was acoustic, and did not fit with the rest of the show. Yet they did not have to emphasize on both shocking animals like screaming. It was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has a style of her own and although she can not compete with vocals on several divas, though she certainly can sing very well. Debbie came out to play Blondie's # 1 hit 'Rapture'. With some lovely voice. He really hit the notes perfectly. She looked stunning. Rapper Eve provided a new, but sadly inferior rap. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a teamwork with new coach Jose Stonn. They performed Blondie Hit 'and Way Way or Other'. I think the style of Joss has misunderstood and cried out to Debian. When Debbie tried and failed in conformity with his mellow style, it was a bit of a problem. She should just let Joss get her with her inappropriate warballing. This track is full of Blundy. Blobie's huge hit 'Call Me' was the final track on Debian. It was quite poor. Debbie is not guilty because you just can not hear him. There were all kinds of tragedies by listening to this show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also made several songs on himself. They have been quite good. Ashanti also showed two insightful cover versions to perform. Firstly, he did Diana Ross 'I'm Coming Out', and then Tea Khan's 'None'. He is not a diva! He can sing a level but he has no presence. Why not just be the real singer. Chaka was even interviewed on the show .... <br /> <br /> Gladys showed the knight and did a medley. It was very good. She was probably the best bit of show. I do not know much about him in an acting actor of Las Vegas and without his experience and the class really shone through. Patti Labels played her 80's hit 'New Actuated' at this time. It ended and it was okay but it was very little late. It was a big ugly. Good luck the next time VH1 <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a widely edited 55-minute version that was shown in VH1 in the UK. If this was the best bit .....
