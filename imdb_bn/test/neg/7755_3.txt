It started as a good sketch comedy. The first few shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really interesting was that Mariah Carey took off on Beverly Hills 90210 with imitation and hair fighting. Delta Bark vs William Conrad was also good in heavy weight fight. Unfortunately the following shows exceeded the comparatively fast. The text becomes obscure and so predictable that the program has achieved a tribe following the youth era. Nothing was getting fresh and the repetition skits were annoying. An example gun family (or what it was said) became a weekly feature. This sketch was not all that fun to get started with just having a regular feature. An example of a sudden fall then started a quick commitment.
