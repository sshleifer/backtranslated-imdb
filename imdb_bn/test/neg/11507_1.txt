Disney has recently done the OMG ... most of the new shows really suck. Zach and Cody's suite life is quite good, but like other rooms, like WagonR, wizards of Waverly Place and strangers are unknown. <br /> <br /> Naturally sadi fools and fools This is about a teenager named Sadi who loves science and grows and goes through her daily life. There are his friends Margaret and the rain and his old annoying brother. All boring and stupid In particular, Margaret who thinks the most popular girl in the school and thinks she is so beautiful ... worse than that. I hate all the seasons of this event, it is terrible in every way. (Although the first season was good). <br /> <br /> If you think your life is valuable then you will not see this pain, it is painful and stupid
