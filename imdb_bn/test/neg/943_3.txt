I'm not saying that there is no reason to see this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing extraordinary about this except for the complete ridicule of the story, not to mention that there are enough plot holes to cross the carnival cruise-fishing boat. Obviously it is not supposed to be a realistic movie, it is supposed to be funny. Sadly, this mostly fails on those calculations. I admit that I laughed a few times, but mainly in a "holy sh * t, I can not believe that it is stupid". <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie then 'one thing is missing.
