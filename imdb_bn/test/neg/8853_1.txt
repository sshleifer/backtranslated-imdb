Cairo, or Pauls, which is familiar to English speaking visitors, was set up in Tokyo and Sunny Plant Sales activist Michhi Kodu (Comicio Aso) decided to ask his friend Taguchi (Kenji Miyuahashi) to work on his computer disk. When he goes to his place, he gives him a disks, but then he himself unknowingly committed suicide. Meanwhile, a student named Raisuk Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently entered the Internet and is receiving the messages and pictures of his monitors, so he asks what is happening on computer computer, Haru Karasawa (Koyuki), he really does not know, but it seems that where people die When the man's spirits are fulfilled and they want to go somewhere else and the calculation of any place in the world Good, is not it? These spirits do not like to share, so they commit suicide or convert them to ashes or something else, I do not really know that these movies have become a mess ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written by Kiosi Kurosawa and It was directed and I said to the right of the bat, I hated Kero, I hated everything about it and it was a sand Herr has proved beyond the shadow of any American filmmaker as the Asian film to create something. The script is a lot of mess, the scene does not give any idea to a different movie scene, which is not made in any logical sense or interpreted in any way, and I'm sitting through this year, the most perfect boring movie in Cairo. Within two hours it has to sit in a real sense, I really wanted to go forward faster but if I am not doing anything else fair, then I stuck it hard and I did not really want to. Much has been wrong with Cairo, I think the filmmakers were going to a strange hesitation and deliberately incomprehensible feeling, but those features which I did not properly do is despise a movie. Then the whole Internet thing that I could not connect to it immediately, I used to use the internet all day and it is not something terrible at least to me. Even then, as a film in Cairo, zero entertainment prices were paid for me, perhaps I'm naughty but I like some pictures that make me a little intelligent, to see me and not give birth to me. <Br /> <br /> I think director Kurushwaha as much as I am concerned, heals the final insomnia, if you feel comfortable sleeping in the DVD and you go to sleep fast within 10 minutes, I guarantee you. I think Kairo was not too scary, the whole internet thing was ridiculous and for scary you should get some penis enlargement pop-up ads, which is now scary! I hate this movie, I hate this picture, sorry, I'll have to double the key point again. Since there is no work, forget about tension or gore. If you have a very nervous nature, there are probably some scenes that can reduce you, otherwise it's all the way in the kid's friendly PG rating staff. <br /> <br /> The image looks so neutral and annoying, the camera is sitting there for a very long shot, and when it is removed, it moves very slowly, it has all the styles of a Mexican soap opera . Since Cairo has a sub-title, it is difficult to judge real performance, so I will not be disturbed, it is difficult for some to care for them when they do not speak the same language and they do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Kaira is crying, I hated it and it is so easy and straightforward. Because it is an Asian flick automatically it is not good and no story is a mess, it does not make any sense, and it means a complete bore, if it was a person, then how would it be properly trapped people. American production By the distance of some of the worst films I saw this year. Keroe got Hollywood Rebuilding Pauls (2006).
