What deal with these ethnic crime groups copied in Italian Mafia movies? All of us like Don Vito Corleone, such as Godfather know, now we have this Mexican, which is just a copy of the copy. I can not see why other ethnic groups have mimic mimic and Italian mobsters, but make sure that they look stupid. They seem to be Wanabee Italian. Mexican prefers to view their own ideas and instead of copying concepts from Godfather Trilogy, their culture and how they like to see it. The film was frustrating, acting in Mexican and trying to be Italian is not my business. After watching it, I'm going to see the "Real" godfather so that this movie is deleted from my memory.
