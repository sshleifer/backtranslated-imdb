I felt super trupers very mildly funny (I had a great police academy like Reepoff), and I hired it to look better. It was not. <br /> <br /> The text is terrible and the painting of this image is even worse. It does not seem like the whole thing in this movie, or it gives us a reason to wonder about any letter. <br /> <br /> The actor, who played Felix, is completely stupid. Perhaps due to his participation in the dialogue. In short, this movie has gone wrong in so many places. <br /> <br /> I think that from clerical films, independent filmmakers think that they can create visible scenes in the long-sighted dialogue, where the characters are trying to be funny. But, in the clerk's dialogue, the story goes down, it disappointingly reduces weight in this movie. Films should have a decent balance of performance dialogue and conversations, and it does not always work as a temptation for movie makers, such as tempting, funny conversations, and also as tempting. Especially if they are not good at dialogue. I'm not interested in saying this, but even "Extreme Hast" was even more interesting than this movie - and the movie was so low that it was shot in the video.
