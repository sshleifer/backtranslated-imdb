Idea is great, great time wasted by judges. <br /> <br /> Why do people make fun? If the innovators say the truth, and many of them say, they have spent their lives on the invention, on the other hand, rejecting the idea without making fun of the person at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> English professor who is a businessman who claims to be a businessman, after wearing a suit does not make you a flock <br /> <br /> < > Last but not least, the big guy who sits in English and crier. Wake up people, there is no job and inventor to discover yourself for yourself. An inventor is not a work man. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add something like Simon to America's statue, they thought it worked there, it could work here too. The topic is different and the concept is completely different. <br /> <br /> This is a good idea and if they only change the judges and remove their behavior and attitude they can do a good show of it. <br /> <br /> Just stop fun of people.
