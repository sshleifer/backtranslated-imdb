If the movies where the virtual reality characters come in and they are male boys or women's eye candy you like it, then perhaps this movie may not be a complete film waste. Not to say that most of the vast population will get it free, little acting talent and even a script less. Yes, Ethan Massey is beautiful, but this is the only positive thing I can tell about this disaster.
