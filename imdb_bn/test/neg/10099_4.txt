Enjoy opening credits. They are the best thing about this second rate but the unreasonable time-killer, which features portable performance from Eric Roberts and Martin Cov's preferences. However, the main part goes to Tom Lee Lee Thomas, who seems to be somewhat lesser for such action, but occasionally, sometimes managed to manage Bunty-Rupert intellectuals. For the first time we saw him bereaved, sweaty, and involved in the favorite "BEFAC" activity - cutting wood. After that, there are seven scenes without his shirt, in which he has hanged his wrist and hung a La Mail Gibson with electricity on "Lethal Wipon". However, he can use better script, but the manner in which he reveals the truth about corruption and violence within the prison is never credible. There is also talk about millions of dollars which are apparently tied to this investigation but can not be explained. There are a few plus, though. "John Willow" is a funny game in the name of the "John Wilson" secret, and co-star Jodie (Ross) Nolan has shown promise as a prison, who is initially shown hanging by the wrist and punched by a burly guard. One final note: the film's low budget is responsible for the "excess" deficit. Despite the impressive size of the prison, it holds about 12 prisoners! (Note: Cast credits are not very helpful, for the record, sticky, abusive guard who uses Jodie Nolan as a punch bag, operated by Bill Fishback, and a young, fair-headed guard who runs Tommy Lee Thomas played by electric shock Marc Cheney. Is done.)
