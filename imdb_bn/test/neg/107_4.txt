Low budget horror movie If you can not raise your expectations too much, you will probably enjoy this little flock. The start and end is quite good, drags in the middle and does not seem to go anywhere for long periods. We add the atmosphere but see the planets running on insane not to advance. Quite a bit of a bit. I enjoyed the performance of Bill McGee, which made him so credible for low budget pictures, he was able to carry the film when nothing seems to have happened. Nurse Charlotte Beel, played by Jesse Lee, is ready to be willing to slap her in the end so her character played well! He makes some really stupid mistakes, even then these low budget movies make it so good! From the place I went away, it seemed that it could be a good idea to leave! If you enjoy this movie, try the committee since 1988, which is basically a tie in this movie.
