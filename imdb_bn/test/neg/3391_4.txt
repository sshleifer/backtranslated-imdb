Some of the greatest and most horrifying movies are comedic humor, but when a movie comes, it does not come as a "classic" but laughing laughing laughs, the critics can completely slag it off. This film laughs me a couple of times, this discipline of contacting this movie and how it has been shown. Two main lines look natural and together with credible and this really helps this film. You have the whole route for them and smile with them, everyone has friends like this both. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's cool, awesome and really good shot. Inspiration from film load (complete theft), most notably Duel, Zippy Cripps, and perhaps Orange County with Jack Black Elaich. But really you can go to any road trip wrong movie and take a reference here. But so, it's not trying to win an Oscar, but only gives a good level of scare and smile to the audience and that score is 10! Obviously it does not get 10, I give real-time understanding and scores like 99% of people in IMDB. This movie can not get any emptiness, as many lazy idiots offer many movies and it does not get a 10 as fun. This is a great movie for anyone who likes humor and likes to fear. You really can not get that easier than that.
