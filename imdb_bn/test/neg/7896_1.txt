The film starts relatively well and it seems that when African American passengers file an air case for negligence. A scene which sucked her pet dog engine and is really a sad thing. But how does the picture's image make it difficult for a strange humorous attempt to reflect a lack of irrationality or really a tragedy? After this point, they definitely ran out of the idea. If you stick long enough, you will be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. It is essentially to reflect African American pop culture and smoking stamps of aircraft per second, a very racist sequence of toilet humor and many more. You will think that there will be some joyful consequences of only three white passenger onboards, but nothing will happen. They have been added to show how they can be treated primarily primarily and they will take the hood after they behave. To avoid.
