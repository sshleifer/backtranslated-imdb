It was the first feature film for everyone involved with Tech Tech Tan, so they deserve credit for closing it. But this picture was painful on his side, his style was titled, his acting, and extra politically correct. The plot was in all places, preventing any direction from developing it. Gangsters get involved in the story, even though I'm not sure that the film has added more than the other movie without their illusions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In his research, he was brought back to fulfill his dreams of managing the Rock Band and with the necessary expertise to move to the top of the Malaysian charts (rather than the children's compound). At the beginning of the film, there is a hint of a conflict with his traditional father, but once gangsters are involved, this part of the story is vaguely dropped. <br /> <br /> The film strives to take a mixture of surprisingly diverse varieties in Malaysia. Unfortunately, how these aspects have been applied to the film seems to be very fictional or neutral preacher. The Maya women have a beautiful view of a beautiful traditional dance on the beach, but the way to combine into vision plots seems way forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting was somewhat closing as amateur, and the male lead was especially unconvincing. The female Malay Lead was a significant exception to leaving the most positive signs. The film has an open gay character, and although he has provided some interesting moments of the film, he is a bit of a joke. But the film was merely a notch above a common local television soap. Sadly, this movie, which is not least objectionable, has been banned in Malaysia. 3/10
