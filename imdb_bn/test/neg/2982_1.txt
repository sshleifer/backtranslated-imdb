People of ABC forgot to research their biography ... many scenes were just wrong! Actor was very strict to play JPI, there was no personality. It is very clear that the film was under the totem poll program, this step is so low budget The script is terrible. Like Conversation: "You must follow the rules" "No, people are hungry." Lame Also, the film was jumpy like a crazy event from event to eventual fit for two hours. Terrible! A good use of your time would be to see a PBS documentary in JPII. Also, CBS has kept a mini-service in JPI which is far from ABC JPI was a wonderful man, and I think my grandfather could catch this ABC movie and think about how he really was!
