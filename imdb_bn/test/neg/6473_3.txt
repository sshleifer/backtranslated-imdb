But I still enjoyed seeing him, so I gave it 3 instead of 1. Its expressions are invaluable. Other cast members (eg, Michael McKean) are really slumming. The cat is a little ridiculous in itself. In addition to this, the film is packed with all the cleanies, much longer car chases. (This is also the movie that has become unnecessarily crude at the moment, even then it was "family".)
