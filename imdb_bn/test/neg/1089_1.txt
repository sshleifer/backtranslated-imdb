We have given one star of this picture for the terrible, however, it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching this at Channel 5 at 3.30am, and we could not stop the laugh, so maybe we could give it 10 for an entertainment price. Right from the beginning, the 'Manik' thought of the right minded people was relieved with curiosity, we were laughing. Does the nuts landing party look like the characters of Dark Crystal? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste it for you, but you must be stupid. For coming to see it, I do not think its quite clever for double bluffs. <br /> <br /> We will be the worst / best film we've ever seen, if we play the 'spot clich√©' game, then we will now be lost by now.
