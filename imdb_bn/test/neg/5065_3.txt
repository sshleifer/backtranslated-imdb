The controversial German journalist Jueta Rabie, who was drowned in the ruins of Estonia, kept this innocent "thriller" together to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Saderland is definitely always watchable - but it's just three scenes. She distributes her material completely - as you can ask from a professional. Also, the main leadership, Jurjen v Chn Bhav, sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is bad. The Swedish minister's secretary (or whatever he thinks - he does not seem to be listed in Cast), the acting actress is very bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice ideas and the story is really interesting. The final screenplay should have been re-written a few more times. Some scenes are ridiculous - especially the last scene. <br /> <br /> The image is about 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes long. Presented as a 60-minute TV-film, it can be really interesting. As a two-hour feature, it is provocative, annoying, stupid and stupid fools. <br /> <br /> Jata can be a good journalist in Ravi (her estimate of using Estonia for Estonia to transfer military military items from Estonia to the end.) Recently, when the Swedish army officially said that they actually used the ship for Estonia ), But as a film producer she sucks. <br /> <br /> Directors, writers and actors suck more. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this picture 3/10. I'll give it a 1, if the story is not quite interesting, Donald Switterland is in it and it has real stock footage. <br /> <br /> But we 'see even the boat dive! Which movie is like the Sindh Ship? Like a Wearoff movie without Vertovlove ...
