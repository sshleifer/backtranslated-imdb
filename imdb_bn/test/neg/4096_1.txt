Well, I was not expecting anything good for the hatred of this movie. I made Steve Carroll boring, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there is absolutely no reason to get a signal for it. However, this picture was even less than my expectations, even when I did not have one. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think of Tony Danger with Disney movie Noah? Well, let's just say that Ivan stopped the Almighty film in many ways in order to be justified for the film. In fact, Ivan the Almighty had the same plot outline as Nuh, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was actually nothing but a carbon copy of one of the best films that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Another word, was that someone became stupid, unblemished, lazy, single-paralyzed of Bhante Cykes, which was literally literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and much more dragged down the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen the movie ten years ago (Noah), I have seen Ivan the Almighty ever to be the most anticipated movie. In the first 5 minutes I started out the whole movie and finally realized that it was tearing Noah to the left and right. At the conclusion, if you are not sure whether Ivan wants to see the Almighty, and is already getting sick in United Hill, he is playing the same role in any single film, Bruce has liked the Almighty, and with Steve Carroll an expected, Do not want to see dry, ornamented movies, trying to work like Jim Carrie, so please do not see this trash
