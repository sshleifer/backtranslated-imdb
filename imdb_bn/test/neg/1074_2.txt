I got caught in the AFI Fest 2:37 at Los Angeles. This is the first film of a very good shot (although the DV format starts showing itself in the outside scene), and I am sure that it has a good intention to show us the "dark side" of high school - otherwise high school. But there is no written or straightforward commitment to the promise of the filmmaker's promise. There are many letters, but none of them is more than a plot. "I have no depth in these caricatures beyond the misfortunate X, I have problems" machinations. Men and women's felt role in this story is surprisingly annoying. <br /> <br /> Let's start with men. Your stoner has a lesbian, a gay boy, a boy rapes his sister, and Mr. Peoples According to the need of stereoateip, all gay men are sexually active and women must be violent towards themselves. Naturally (or uncertainly stereotype is assumed), the character of two male men, women, punch and beat themselves. I am perfectly fine with these characteristic features, if the stereootypes become their head, or the letters in some way cross them. Nevertheless, and there are all of these characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Next, ladies. A young woman wants to be a deaf housewife, another sister-raped brother's pregnant rapie, and the girl kills herself (I'll go later). Again, I do not think the filmmakers need political correctness (I was out of the job that was a case), but I think it's just fair when it's more or more of that character or story. "I am a teenager and sucks life" is used in the archetype that is used to express something about that character, "I would be happy as a clam." But nothing is new to reveal! Nothing is flip, or change, or is not sublimated. Finally, the girl who killed herself is called this nasty and extremely sloppy story.We tell a 5-minute girl to sit violently through the killing, whom we For 30 seconds through the picture, we've followed all these other stories for one and a half hours, and now we have been invited to torture for a character which is not part of the story, it's cheap, exploitative, and vicious. , You have to achieve something like that. You can not purchase it only by credit. So this suicide happens, we get from the letter I did not know that there are stereotypical opinions of gay men and young people already in the house - I did not know how to get wrap-up, but the film did not go down, and the film ended. I already knew that the children with disabilities were mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors, and leaves are really some excellent views. Oh, and the nastiest deus pre-machina I've seen in a while
