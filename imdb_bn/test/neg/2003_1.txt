It is very rare that the movie is so vague that I have allowed the use of negative scores with IMDB. Actually, I came back to this movie and I can not really think of a movie which is rarely going for it. Acting: Your joke is right. Instructions: No. A plot: no. If there is no serious film on this film, there is nothing for it, it is often for films of this genre, but most of the movies in this genre like they are comedy, and you can smile on how to get rid of almost unfortunate characters and situations and almost your time. This movie is so empty, that it can not even accept that purpose. I will give this -1/10, three points then I have shown any movie. I really think that the staff involved in this film will have to pay it for 83 minutes. I do not have much to say about how bad this word actually is. No one should again watch this for any reason.
