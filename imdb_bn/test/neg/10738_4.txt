All right, this is a lovely hug-and-miss-it-joke (when the dead are coming from their graves, old names are called "horror" director Jack Tornia and Jean-Everborg's graves are featured in the graves) and morally corrupt Repo / Con / right-wing villain Destruction is on target: Violent skanks promote morality etc. But why are these soldiers anti-Republican? Because they have gone to war, most of them should be Republicans, is not it? Why did they kill their enemies or kill them? Why do they want to vote against Republicans? Why did this story create a movie? The question was never answered ...
