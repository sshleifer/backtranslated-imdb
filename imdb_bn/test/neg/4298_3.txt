I did not feel the knowledge to go through so much trouble for making a movie like this, and then throwing out books in history books. Without the authenticity of Richstone's death, there was not a single accurate description of any film, which I eventually was grateful, so I did not need to look back. Such a movie insults the one who knows something about the history of WWI. <br /> <br /> I will release the flying flight of Fokker DVI in 1938, because Blue Max did that, or the 209 Squadron will attack the other flying flying flying flight of SE-5. One thing, they initially called Pfalz D-III an 'old albertus'. For others, all of them have Bose, Gearing, and Wolf. He was the only one who was VS and after Bolek died, he joined. Richstone was not arrested for blaming Boehel for his death ... Marvin, who was confronted with Boleck, was recognized to avoid British aircraft pursuing Reichtoffhen in Boeime. When Richstone was wounded in his head, it was an attack on an AF-2D-Sitter attack, and he did not crash in the turbid to fight the soldiers, and no one ... Warner Vos did not die on that day. He died on September 28th, WWI's most epic war. <br /> <br /> Manfred was small, not like the actor, who responded to everyone else. His brother Lothar was never at Justa Boleck, who was in charge of Manchester J. when he joined Squadron 11. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Manfred was shot by Brown in the film and then made the perfect landing shot. An explosion occurred in Richtone when Brown was chasing Reichtofen May, and for a number of years there was a large amount of information that Richmond was killed because of the earthquake, not Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was their chance to watch flying scenes, which was as good as 'Blue Max', except for the other, I would not see it again and I paid $ 30 for the tape!
