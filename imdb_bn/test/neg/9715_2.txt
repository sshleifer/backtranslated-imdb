Very bad Mike girl picked this for her dramatic salutation. This movie is compiled by a committee that can not determine whether it is a comedy, drama, suspense, or a wizard. It starts playing, then gets faster, and in the end, soon after the death of one of the main characters, the whole family is standing in the house behind some laughter. It is completely strangely and impossible to string together. The acting is extremely incompetent, older professionals draw your attention and then they look younger and less experienced actors playing high school. This film has shown me that it is probably difficult to create a good film from the first run and the actual commercial fares that are seen in the Art House. This will be a good film for a film class analysis. Plot, character, theme, compatibility - they are both faulty or absent from this film.
