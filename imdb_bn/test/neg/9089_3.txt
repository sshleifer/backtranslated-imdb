Strictly for these dear fans. Because he's a great, funny guy, it's not more than a B-movie. The script is horrific, it always moans constantly about the crime and ridiculing the prisoners of war. It maintains balance between comedy and melody and does not fall in the face and falls on the trial. <br /> <br /> Firstly 30 minutes rather untimely, uneducated Vietnam during the prisoner war ?? The guy is playing basketball at one stage ... how much you can pants to your audience? ... that prison is boring, uncomfortable and can sleep easily already. <br /> <br /> He is not considered "hero of war" for any reason to return to the United States. Yet he certainly forgot publicly and was frustrated by all kinds of damage. Or are they really? We must find out soon. to yawn. There are boring clich√©s: Her sick mother, she never meets her little girl, falls in love with a high-end prostitute hero. It is very strange how the movie goes from tragedy to slopstick at one moment. Not all works. <br /> <br /> Overall, it only disrespects a bad comedy and prisoners of war. This guy was a very good stand-up comedian because he played some good movies, and there is no reason to be bothered by this stupid, unclear, weird comedy in the death of MS. But if you like Richard Love, he might be thrilled by reading 3 hours of grandmother poetry.
