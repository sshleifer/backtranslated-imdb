'Reba' is going to be transformed from many good sitcoms to the many 'family-based sitcom' hints of why it will be easy and correct, the fact is that the show stereotypes from the repetitive, full funnier and more groundbreaking shows, and the lead star completely out of its element. Although I'm sure Mrs McIntyre can sing and there is a fan base in support of it, it has moved away from reality due to the shooting of Syncx in Junkyard and after moving the ball to the next Lucile. <br /> <br /> Reba himself does not have any presence that he needs to establish here, so that he is considered to be a woman born to his wife. There is no real connection to the character after observing several episodes yet. I could care less about his event because his whole character could be MIA. Reba McIntyre has no presence on screen and shows a very low vision and most 'family oriented' programming to show a show around him: pushing the whole seatkom of men-fools / women-something that does not appeal to anyone, but who can not afford the cable. <br /> <br /> Time is a waste. The only good thing is that it has better production value than at least your standard pack ripoff.
