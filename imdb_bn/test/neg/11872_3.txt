The detonator is located in Bucharest, where a former CIA official agent named Andrew Smith (Wesley Snipes) was named after a weapon trader named Dmitry (Matthew Leach), something went wrong, and Demy has found that Sony is working for the US government. . Most of the people of Dimitri have been killed by Sony, so local Roman police forces have become dissatisfied, the top man Flint (Michael Brandon) has decided to send Sony to the US and simultaneously defend a woman named Nadia. Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is being sent back to the US. However, it proves that Nadia wants to fulfill a contract for Democrat and his football club owner Joseph (Tim Dueton) who wants him to kill millions of people in Washington ... <br /> < br /> This American and Roman co-production director Po-Chic Long and The Detonator crossed any shadow of a doubt that Wesley Snip Action film star has joined the club of the backwash, the generic Eastern European locations, Action films, iyepa snipesa Jean Van cloud Damien, Steven Segal, dalapha lundagrena, rugara estates and joined Chak Norris-like brightness. Snippets were given some credit, because he had a little more time than resting with extraordinary plaque: Trinity (2004) is still fresh in the psychological mind of many films (the next film that he made is straight from the DVD) but it will soon be It was to happen later, as I mentioned many snippets have retained the fame of some great movies and you She looked at her career but she was better in worse films. Recently the movies of JCVD ​​and Siegel The Detoetter are pretty scary. Martin Wheeler's script is predictable, annoying and as anything else outdoors. Detonator is a movie that you expect to play at the non-objectionable cable TV channel at 2am. The Detonator Clichés are compelled to snuff out snippets in situations where they have to protect a woman and at first they dislike each other, but eventually they love, CIA's closest friend is betrayed by her. Nobody is objectionable without a diameter of the book, it may actually be a beautiful man, the character of Snipes allows to move around Bucharest's shooting, killing people and running, as does not matter and he is not arrested, the action is bad and forgotten, the bad guy The owner of the football club, there are so many boring soccer terminology and there is also no interesting one-fishing. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing for some things. Up, The Detonator looks cheaper with a car chair, two of which do not seem to be more than 30 mmp mark. Ok, the action scenes are relatively good, but they rarely and completely forget about snippets and bad guys shooting, and instead snipes the bad guy to death and kill him. There is a half-decent car crash and explosion but there is very little other. It seems that The Detonator was shot at a Romanian football stadium, I think I saw the game for 90 minutes instead of this picture. <br /> <br /> Detonter with the estimated $ 15,000,000 budget is reasonably well made but really that will not happen. Bucharest set and illustrated in Romania. Acting is not too big, Snippets just do not seem interested, and it seems that he is just for the money for which I do not blame him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Why Sony Keep Making This Thing? There is no recommendation, there are many good jobs to rent.
