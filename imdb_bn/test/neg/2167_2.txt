"Crab to Tales" is poor, hateful, tasteless, offensive, humble and graduate. But okay, I was ready for all that from my previous trombah experience. I was not ready for what it was, stupid, unfunny and annoying. Films like "The Nuclear Class of High" have rarely remained intact; In its place, we mean ENDLESS FART JOCS (the point where you start thinking that Lloyd Kaufmann is going to Sanen, thinking that adults have heard the overwhelming pronunciation!) And a cruel, shameful exploitation of the audience, which is essentially the time of investment and a "movie" That is, even Kaufman should not be the first to reveal itself. Oh yes, there are plenty of female nudity on the display, but let's face it: The average pornography film probably offers better stories, higher production standards, funny comedies and more respect than this ugliness. <br /> <br /> PS: Kelly Powers AKA Suzy Lauren ("How to Make Your Own Movie" in a blonde lesbian student) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
