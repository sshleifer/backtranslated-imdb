Idiot goes to camping and eventually dies like idiot, yes Camp Blad (or "Bad Camp Bloody" if you're not worse than bad guy than bad movie), so bad that actually looks quite depressing. And it has all the elements to be a perfectly bad film ... <br /> <br /> Terrible acting-check. Bad scripts check. Spindle Effect- Check the Originality - Double Check. <br /> <br /> It does not try to be different, and is fantastic, with the help of each predictive image. For example, this movie is open for couples to have sexual relations, so they are definitely dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying things is that this movie is actually two growing, how and why just bothered the mind. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
