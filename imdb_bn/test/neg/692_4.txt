* Possible speaker aadhaar * <br /> <br /> I'll just say what is not mentioned here before (and I will continue this for the residue of my WWF / WWE comment). <br /> <br /> If you are going to match a women's title, it is rather interesting than squash to keep at least the current champion. I think Rudas could not manage an intense match, but they wanted to become a legend in WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought, the killer bee was lost in WrestleMania, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, one year after the departure of B Brian Blair and Jim Brunel was back in a canvas. So I did not understand for a while that they were a top tag team, even top competitors. <br /> <br /> I love Bill Frarluck in the war state. He really came here himself, created a Kaki Hill character in a pre-match interview and even made an elimination of war royal. Along with Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation who has paid tribute to wrestling (anyone who remembers Dennis Rodman?). And what was with the Heart Foundation's ridiculous green tights?
