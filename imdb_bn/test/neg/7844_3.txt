Bart Reynolds starred Gaterer McCluskey, a former convict who was freed from prison, who helped Sheriff in a corrupt small town. Lead-backed Reynolds has often accused critics of foarding the performance of this 'good ol' boy; True, he's on steady pilot across. But on his day, Reynolds knew how to do good work for himself a low-key effort. Growing and handsome, Reynolds comes to the audience wonderfully as much as he can without break; He also knows these back-ends and movie stars, when director Joseph Sergeant supplies an easy speed and intense ambiance that makes the South alive. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and supporting actor Ned Batty and Bo Hopkins habit (normal). Dean Ladd is fine in a small part, and real life girl Laura Darna may be thrown into the background. The 1976 "Gator" Reynolds returned to this character. * **** to 1/2
