Calling this movie will be a disaster reduction. I do not know where to start! I have questions though, and many of them. Want to imagine this script that I want to know? Who gave their money to make this movie? Who was in charge of casting and costuming? They should all be sued! I saw this movie in my local library catalog and I thought "hey! Great!" I saw two FOG movies made by Hollywood and then realized that there was a version of Bollywood. Exactly to me, which will be a bit rough! The comet is about four friends (actually only one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is beautiful Queen (India's first Messi has played). World, Aditi Govitter) and the director pays no cost to let you know about this. The script even claims that he (the character's name is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lips and Rani Mukherjee's hair. If you want to be free for Barf, at least this moment you have not seen the movie, poor like me. : * (<br /> <br /> Simran, however, threatens one day's death from a contestant's uncle, who asked him to come out of the competition so that his nephew had a better chance of winning, but Simran's lover did not allow him to do the job. And thus he won the patronage, so that his former college classmate Tania's crack-cocaine-snifting uncle came after him, but his cousin Kajol, Immerse the culprit with the help of Simran and list both of their lovers to get rid of the body. It is difficult, but eventually they are very close to doing it. <br /> <br /> A scene from a Hollywood movie diabolics, where the body of the pool is hidden It can only be revealed that the body is absent and it is the Hundunt's conduit and where is it? When the glow ends, the movie successfully steals the scenes' I know what you did last summer, I still know, Scrum 1, Scrum 2, Scrum 3, Murray he wrote episodes and Mr. Antioon, Colombo and Scua do! <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Simran said, Each ring is able to ring and it is the best It likes to give it. <br /> <br /> Tania tries to kill herself because she does not win beauty competition? WTF? Though Aishwarya Rai won the Miss India, she did not even try suicide! <br /> <br /> 3 In the pool scene, the children who fall into the pool easily disappear for recovery. And the ball is very invisible. <br /> <br /> 4. The blue-colored blue lenses of the raw blue-brown switch from the blue to brown scene, when his body is re-sponsored, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one dies in this film (strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram enters dirty dirty pool, the camera shows our actions under a water and miraculously transforms the pool into the form of the Olympics and clean and clear for the day. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy stomach-dancer takes place in a pseudo-orgasm drenched song and dance number coming in the age of. It was quiet for some Bachelor party, but they are celebrating the victory of Simran! Hello !!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Samir, Simran and Kajal can not dance and do not lip properly. But do not blame them, acknowledge that there was not a coroner for the number of dances. <br /> <br /> 9 Nothing in the movie is not a dancer, they just want to act and do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> 10. The film was played out like no script was out. The director or director who was very drunk while filming this junket! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photograph was published without his consent to the magazine, he went to the police headquarters for the arrest of the police headquarters, yet he received death threats and did not hesitate to warn the police. <br /> <br /> Of course. This picture was a painful experience for me and I avoided it in every way needed and possible. Bollywood will be very embarrassed to make such a film.
