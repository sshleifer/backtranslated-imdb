Last night saw the director's cut ... it was a free rental, even for watching this effort at the "dollar silent" I had more money than the dollar. Anachronisms (modern telephones) was not boring to me, it is not tricky, more budget than any other budget. "Non-traditional" welding I found confusion. If I have to close the story, "What is the queen doing black chick / pulling?" Then the storyteller failed me. Again, my opinion is cute and annoying, and very film-school final project-ish. And if you're going to shoot black and white but for the stomach, at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color. There was no use of light in the light, no shade of gray, no depth, no textures ... just black and white only ... annoying!
