I was studying in the magazine, about some of Asia's most important, bloody films and I immediately went to Netflix to stop my thirst. Boy i did wrong This movie was one of the worst movies I've seen. First and foremost a plot that I saw from the plot (see: "Revenge") has only become $ 14.89 and an event to spend the special effects budget of waste studio time. They should not have kept their money and their time was not wasted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a major plot junction occurs, Tetsuo 2: Hammer is given a new identity and I buy it. A flashback is given which can answer our questions, but I think I've started Showtime 3:47 and have dropped the ACID. The film is in progress and spirals outside the control by the effects of Chess graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> Do I feel bitter about this movie? Yes I saw Iron Man? No Had a Plot? No Was it so emblematic that I did not understand? No Had a body hammer? Hell out beats me So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Although I've enjoyed many fun for this writing and laughing about this picture, I would love to see if you want to laugh !!!)
