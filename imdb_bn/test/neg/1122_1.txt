When I found out that there was a Christmas vacation 2, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and saw it as soon as it came through the letter box. I love all the national Lampon movies with Chavie Chase, and I'm sure he was not in this one! I could not believe how bad it was, you thought it was impossible to laugh at a national lamp film, but believe me it is! . Perhaps this picture was a good idea in the hands of cousins ​​Adei as the main character, he started reading on my nerves from the beginning of the film and the film became completely unclear midway and at the end of the film I lost my brain and could not remember what had happened! .
