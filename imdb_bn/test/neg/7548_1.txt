A huge sound at the bottom end of the Future Tower! However, Ad Edison and Rick Maill have been able to create a film that rarely raises a titter. Ten years ago, Rick Mayal's madness and arc were funny, now they are just boring. <br /> <br /> The picture was promised - though Britain's most awesome hotel is not a new idea - but it failed to deliver. Savings Guarantees from Seven (Spaced, Big Train) Peg and Helen Mathew have a decent performance and the film is only 90 minutes long. Sorry, guys, but you've really hit the bottom
