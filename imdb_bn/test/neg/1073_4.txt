I could not relate to this photo. I am amazed that people are commended for being so realistic. How many people were victimized in your school? How many closet lesbian lesbians were? How silently did you commit suicide? Hmm Well you know even if you did not have them. But actually these are explosive problems that we never face. And there are still many teenagers with fine issues that have been searched. But hey, where is the 'entertainment' here? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But can anyone else commit suicide after being neglected and unconscious? The filmmaker decided to commit suicide to make this film even more exciting. And the graphic nature of suicide is making it more exciting. I do not buy it as a real life scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problem of other students is not entirely related to me. It is condemned but it has been done for death, we all know that it is going on and it is actually the matter of solving it. Homosexuality homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché gets rolled out. Truly things, thats a lot of clichés. I guess the end of the beginning. That assumes that if an expected was unpredictable. You've got all these letters with explosive problems, and apparently there is no one. And I thought, what is the point of this character, if he does not commit suicide? And of course ... .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One thing I would say, and it is a gift to save the film, it does not commit suicide. Suicide is very graphic and watch is broken. This is a powerful scenery (irrespective of how it is descended) and it dismisses suicide as a simple option. But the film is not really fantastic and stereotype has been used. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but certainly not a casual 17 hour long festivals in Kanase ???
