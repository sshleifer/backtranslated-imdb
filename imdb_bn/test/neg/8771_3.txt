I'm a Christian, and I saw most Christian movies, but it's a very bad one. They try to do it well, but it's very hard for them. I think <br /> <br /> - You can see that the film has been heavily embedded in many places. - You can almost think that the film itself was left behind in this movie. I think they will be much more. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor, and acting can be even better. The story is not very bad, but it has been well. The only plus I give, the story of this picture, but I can not fully rate it more than 3/10 Instead of "Look Back"!
