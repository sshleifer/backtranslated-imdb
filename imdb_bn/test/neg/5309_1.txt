I can rarely give a rating of less than 5, but in this case I have to weigh. Elmore Leonard is a wonderful writer with many wonderful, complex books, real characters, crisp dialogue, stimulating plot twists. Based on his books, films are based on Humphreys (Paul Newman), Mr. Returns again with the Magnificent (Bronson) and Out of Site (Cloney / Lopez). Even when it is done, some measurements are coming up with at least movies. This one, .... This is not just a suitable link for catalogs. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (why do not know, because they are very capable people here) and the story is managed with stupidity. Characters are rearranged, chemistry missing, actresses and actresses wrong cast. <br /> <br /> Elmore Leonard is really a great storyteller, I hope someone who does not know his work will stop reading his books because they saw this frustrating presentation of his story. <br /> <br /> The story is a series for getting a shot. If you do not see that movie then do not see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the first time should not have created a negative impression since I forgot how frustrated this signal was. Fortunately, I think the film that appeared in this movie rarely seems to be. They probably expected something more. Get the real real and great fun. I like Trivola almost always, but he is very good at Tarantino's pop fiction and the previous gate shirt. He was clearly incapable of enjoying what he was doing. <br /> <br /> and I have a pre-production for the release of Freelie Duck, another book from Elmore Leonard, 2008. I hope they can turn it off. <br /> <br /> Read the book. They are almost all great.
