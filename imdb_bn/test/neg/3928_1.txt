I do not care what someone says, this movie was a shit. Whatever it was for the camera work that was done very well. I've heard many people talk about the conversation ... it sucks too much. Yes it was honest and true to life, but so, how can I talk on the street or talk in the fast food era. What did the dialogue well in films like Paul Fiction and Gossford Park have been the real dialogue, which takes time to think. Another thing was that the director should not have kept himself in the picture. I believe that male characters can be very strong, but instead it seems weak. In fact, the movie revolves around male characters, and then in the last 20th century, it disappeared completely. I do not think the girl of the film is completely boring, in appearance, but in her poor need. He says he is loving a man, and he is actually jealous of him the next day, how he is alive. The final thing: the word was terrible, and I hope it is just something that hits my theater rather than actually shooting the final film. There were constant words during several scenes and it was actually moving away from the conversation. Again, good work was a blood work as a DP, but the actor who played the former man's former girlfriend did a very good job. These two things have not been able to finally save the terrible movie, which I refused to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
