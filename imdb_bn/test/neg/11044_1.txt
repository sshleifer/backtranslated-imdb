This movie was the longest movie of my life experience. When I was managing director of Chan-ek Park, I was revenge, the whole movement was violent. Old bill is paid in only 1 hour and 55 minutes but it seems to take at least three and a half hours to tell this story. I would say that the English dubbing was done very well and the film is easily understood. I felt that the scenes were unnecessarily long and there were many repetitions of dialogue. Also, if your annoying voices are upset, avoid hi-jong kong (he plays m-du). If you are looking for a movie to spend time and others feel morally higher then stay away from it. If you do not want to see a movie filled with rage, bad conversation, unnecessary war scenes, serious torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, it's not a movie for you.
