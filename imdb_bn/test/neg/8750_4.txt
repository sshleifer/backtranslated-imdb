For all its flaws, I would like to be charity towards "things". Here's a funny, weird, clutterophobic Hitachoic style story. Writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you like British perspective) Robert Bloc, or who wrote "Tryphid's Day", and you might have such a nasty, uncomfortable little spook story that was the best <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One such story needs a voice like Sturgeon that can bring out interesting stories of character in good light. His classic story "The Widget, The Wuzzette, and Buff" can illustrate how he can combine an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and make him the most fun, sympathetic with the space of 40 pages. And interesting people you've ever met. A good writer, with some selected words, sometimes tries to tear his emotions to "see" some bright and memorable events. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie where most of the things are annoying and unlike ever created characters are created to communicate together in lumped and unconvincing "Where did that come from ??" The moment that is just false. (IE Blond psychic girl declaiming "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull set and tough actors. I blame the director for the 'harsh and shallow' part. This is not all the third rank character actors who have big time, but they are 'real' actors, and a good director can have earned better performance from them. We are unhappy with the lesbian overtones which are uncomfortable to the viewers and feel absorbed without any benefit. (If I have absorbed the sense of my basics and are guilty about it, I would like to work better than this). And we got almost a hundred annoying build ups in about 35 seconds, which I have ever seen in the worst anti-climaxes. <br /> <br /> Good thing about "Things"? Um, well ... some shots of war criminals were closed in silence and his instructions were quite effective. The wicked and intelligent widows considered life to be true (even if I wanted to put a throat in his face). The first scene where the large, "plain" bird hands turn quietly owed cowboys and assassinated him, because the plot took the problem of establishing a bigger man as a fairly sympathetic character. And as I said earlier, the idea of ​​an invading army of the past is good to bend the members of isolated communities against each other and it can maintain a lot of interest from the actual merit of a poor performance. <br /> <br /> Which is definitely this. But, as I said, I was interested in charity, because the director could probably work for a bad budget, time of consternation and the best actors money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge the far-flung trial of "the cave", "wrong turn" or "wax house" 40 years ago. I hope they support our generation of waste in film stock charitable towards our own taste.
