Mystery Science Theater 3000 This "Gem." Unable to fetch any redeeming quality for a display. <br /> <br /> It was like an 80-penny-like chess pirate copy, you could buy VHS from an arcade at the 42nd store. Buy the whole ruins of Disney and stop them all before. <br /> <br /> But wait - all sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a bad film. This picture may replace water boarding as a human method of interrogation. <br /> <br /> No, I'll take that back - I like water boarding. <br /> <br /> This film will be reduced to the only credit of being threatened in the Middle East by the most painting of this movie.
