When a killer call is to be the biggest ripoff ever released by Asylum. It's a sexy criminal responsible who often receives a wonderful call from a scary voice asking, "Have you tested the girl?" Naturally, they have been detected by police (after performing some unnecessary tasks - hanging while calling "he", waiting ten seconds and dialing * 57). Sound familiar? Yes, I hired it too. <br /> <br /> Well, it should be done. And I hesitate to say it, but it can be more entertaining than the Big Screen Cufffst if it's not for a big mistake, instead of acting in the B-Movie Reepoff glory, it tried to make some original. In addition to trying to sympathize with the character rather than having fun in Chile, Campi. You think, this could work with a talented actress. But he was not. Sure, he looked good, and he cried, and cried, but. . . Oh well, whatever <br /> <br /> <br /> then the horror ended. It was not terrible that it was terrible, it was terrible. That point was up to pacing up (about one hour) campy, clich√©d, and fun. Then it goes on the other side and it goes away from an incognito, funny slash movie, to a sexy "teenage" movie Hostel-Esquier Gore / Borfest. <br /> <br /> I think it's "Oh well, whatever" section. The main actress flubbed a line? Oh well, whatever, I do not think it's like reshooting. We forgot to motivate the killer? Oh well, whatever, I do not feel like rewriting it. Panning completely through half change? Oh well, whatever, I do not feel like shaving off fifteen minutes. Continuous error? Oh well, whatever, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie (Camera, Chess, Predictive, Campea Splatter Movie with Sexy Cast), then you'll be better at the end. Finishing is stupid, it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not a campie or chessy or fast. Actually, the character did not have anything in five minutes but it was tied (and it was not behind the DVD because it is not a mockery) and screaming at home, and screaming. . . Anyway.
