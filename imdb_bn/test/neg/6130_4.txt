Before doing anything else, I must admit that I have seen the first episode of this show. If I had the time, only if I see how the season is played, it may be considered watching it every week. However, from the beginning it was clear to me that the version of Martha Stewart's "The Apprentice" is not just "fit". Martha Stewart Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child's domestic diva make the career of being a happy homemaker. Her nervous legal problems and her personal image from the next prison began to reflect the real roughness of her character. Sure, he was forced for some time, and made an interesting question about what this whole series means to be a woman in business. Will she be cold and tough? But it was true, while coming out of Stewart Prison, for his efforts to come back to the public, though he was definitely war criminal, he was never going to take viewers' interest too long. . Probably a genuine return to work he returned home peacefully and he often waited for a year or more after the ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, he fiercely entered the overkill with the 2 series at one go, the other with his famous Syndicated Day series Martha, a lot like his old show, but with more mainstream, famous guests like Bate Middlemore. Of course, his peak Stuart was not even mainstream, so the American viewers were not immediately prompted to take his protest on Real TV. Maybe America wants to return to Stuart instead of returning to her own. <br /> <br /> The program was originally a tiring repetition of the "appententis" of trams, which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, throwing, and the fire-fighting decisions of the trams (often controversial - that's likely). The letter bit was definitely clich√© but at least objectionable. Stewart never said, "You are fired!" - This board refers to the message board - especially annoying. While trying to make producer Mark Barnett as his hero, Stewart should be praised for his conduct honestly during the prison, but the fact that anyone watching this can say that he is trying to show the show that he is basically a good businessman. Again, not the mainstream, the approval and identification of Stuart's Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump's lack of acclaimed, charismatic "strong". Yes, this may be gender-biased assessment of his character, but I want to say more about the nature of his business. <br /> <br /> There is no shock that Stewart has been fired, but I am surprised. If they really intended to end it for only one season?
