The movie is superb for Venezuela tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranah Nice scenery The only brightness that was seen during the long and annoying motorcycle racing was. Finally, when the Caribbean sank, then a professor of Hollywood. There is no specific story. It turns out that the diamond mining from the easy riders from Venezuela's scenery is going off of a rip and a cruel hunter is going crazy for some reason. Very low budget movies that can be pictured anywhere with Venezuela's outach. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made very good films. Like all actors, all of them must have at least a bad movie. Do not waste $ 5.00 on DVD.
