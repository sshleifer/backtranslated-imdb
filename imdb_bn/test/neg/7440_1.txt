It's a shame that they do not believe the original enough based on it. <br /> <br /> "RoboCop 2" adopts original concepts, imagination and original letters and replaces them with all the recommended stereotypes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Somewhere in the middle. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / <br /> <br movie, and then there are tones. <br /> <br /> At a happy price, Paul Vernovan knew how to be directed directly with attitude, where you fear a good gentleman's comic attitude and sensitivity. The most annoying violence will be entertaining. Kershner (though he's a "Star Wars" Siegel direct DIID). And after the scene the scene crunches you, look away or just tone it down. <br /> <br /> And what's with Robocop? He will be the main thing here, right? But all the scenes where he does not even show up, and they are so half-conscious and horrible in any scenes that you are not a partner or he does not know what the parsy-cyber does not know - because he is all boring. <br /> I I have never seen such a fast fall from grace. Why does Hollywood do such bad sequels? Purpose? Why; Are the filmmakers going out? <br /> <br /> <br /> One star for "Robocop 2" only; FX is not good but the story even tries to match them.
