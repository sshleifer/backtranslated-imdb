I admit that the horrors of the 50s are not scary by today's standards, but what is it? When you see such a headline, you look forward to looking for blood and blood thirsty animals. Instead, we do not drink any blood that is to take any animal to the earth or to maintain peace in the world .... Yes, what people wanted was that. <br /> <br /> The overall story is coming back to a better astronautic life and being one with animals .... But the title is really the movie killing. The devotees were made more happy on the night of Bihar because there were no bloodshed in it. <br /> <br /> I think how the end of the 50 films left the room for a signal but did not introspect. . The movie I saw is not the worst, but it's almost finished. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
