I found it a double feature DVD named "Scream Theater" and it's no doubt that one of the most horrific movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad ones. They are talking about "non-stop party" outside the school, and three girls (who are teenagers), so they all talk about the "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the girl's house, whose parents are the most strict sleep party. Meanwhile, a psychiatrist escaped from the local buggy, where a girl's father works and loses with a sharp object and plays after the green scraw and open eyes ... I guess he will fool him. Of course, he got a bone to choose with that particular doctor and he goes to his room, whose position is apparently common knowledge. Meanwhile, some mobile phones are slamming under insurance and threatening girls, and certainly showing selfishness and starting to thaw. And that's about it, as heavy metal chuggs along with background music. Or, maybe it's not, but actually, that's what you need to know. Unless you spend your time in perpetual stone or drunkenness, you will not be interested here, and you will probably be humiliated even if you lose most of the time. 10 out of 1
