Ali Ji was initially funny. Her interview was fresh and original. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the most part. The film claims good actors like Charles Dancing, but their genius is spoiled as stupid acting 2-D characters. It's not 'terrible' but it's not funny at all. It can be said that this movie was the last bases of Ali Ziey's comedy. Then he ran steam out.
