Since I bought the DVD, I saw a lot of the way I came out of my wallet's obedience feeling. <br /> <br /> In this plot, Kirk Douglas worked as a successful novelist, who was hired by Larry Day, a secretary, fell in love, and her marriage. Complications have occurred. <br /> <br /> Douglas is generally considered to be an acute actor, which is extremely dramatic, sometimes a protagonist, sometimes like a mouse. He is not bad at this thoroughly ridiculous part. The problem is not particularly comic and nothing else. <br /> <br /> A dozen "quirky" characters come and go - most prominently, as Keenan Wynn Douglas's friend who comments nothing but nothing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it can still be retrieved with some flash in the dialogue but there is no one to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not clean that bar. Think of what I think as a fun line here. Douglas is just hiring day and wants to get him to the beach and to seduce him. The day is annoying and commenting that he did not listen to a writer working at a beach house. Wynn asks Douglas's previous book, "Last year's love." Yes, of course she did. "Well, most of the 'last year's love' was done at the beach house." Haha <br /> <br /> Night cast, including support, but a failed comedy. Television has had good sitcoms.
