Sadly because it is definitely trying to be successful and obviously it is not an opportunity to fire because of the absence of a clear feeling of purpose. Drops with Spiceys are unclear failures in the Irish comedy, like a thief who keeps the police and their competition as a kind of hero in his own mind, this flick tends to be fun while trying to be fun, when it's a bit annoying to be more interesting Trying, and forgetting the horror or tragic or respectful, it takes a shot at those attributes. The "simple criminal criminal case" is a strange screenplay, homemade aspects, passenger executions, slim stories, poor wrestling, medieval acting, and finally lost between themselves and frustrated mediation has sink into a mire. Pass this one. (D)
