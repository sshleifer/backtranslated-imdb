There's a thin line between being in the theater and just being plain. Forceful acting. Takes the force. Forced plot Even compulsory photography There are people who say "the film came from Asia because of this" but I am not seeing any compulsory elements of seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a thin line between fiction (and every work of art, its way, fiction) and unlikely. More personally, I do not think of anything with the movie, it does not accept me anywhere, and I can not believe in the imagined world. It does not seem right, it does not click on anything or just click here.
