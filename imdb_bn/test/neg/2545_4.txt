This movie has some great special effects, which divides the Japanese islands into degrees, which will humble Godzilla. Two leads also make up-performance. In addition to this, it is a bit ropic in the storm of a devastating disaster. Incongruities in pensing are bizarre. At one point, our hokkidoo is submerged in the rest of Japan between the sea and the pyroclastic ice, Osaka is burned under a huge tsunami. Yet people from other parts of the country are still touring the sights and roaming ice cream when another tsunami rolls out ... Kosanggoo even moves without any interruption, even with his cream shirt traveling a long distance without a single crease. Other people burned with their mouth, ripped clothes and mud-streaks started with. <br /> <br /> The film is tangential and insulting in Japan. Kusangi's sacrifice in the final evening with Shivasaki is never seen in this story. However, unfortunate PMs musings about Japanese mentality and temptation of death, and Japan surpassed everyone and there is no friend at the last moment, indicating a dark paranoia which concerns Japan's concerns with their condition. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that the final sequence is a rip off of Armgadon, edited with a cookie cutter. Finally, my own special bug-beer - product placement for heavy elephant cigarettes. This time, it's crazy (-or-he-he?) Scientist Toyokawa who gets to be a poster boy for Japan's tobacco. At one stage, he was able to handle a phone box size of less than 5000 meters above sea level in a smaller size. Gimme a break
