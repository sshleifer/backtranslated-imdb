Clearly, the phone that was commented on the movie was made by someone in the crew. I have never seen a movie that is insulting to see talented actors or audiences. During my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only I have ever gone out. Bad humor, bad joke, bad mess, bad editing, bad plot etc. <br /> <br /> Note the producer: Finding people based on race is never fun. You have tried to be politically correct by including all the nations, but you are still hunting the nation-based people and it is sick.
