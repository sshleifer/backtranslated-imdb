Do not tell me that when you know that a movie cover is run poorly while running. That said, anyone saying this is the worst movie ever being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely confusing. The film is "what it is." And that's what ... a decent budget ($ 4 million, I guess) is a series of studio. The film is not terrible, but it will be frustrating for fans of the Road House. And who brings me to trouble, like the dance dance was not without Swaz, the road house is not the same as the other. Depending on the depth of the film carrying depth, character, and likability. I think the lead has been thrown badly and if the producers want to make a signal to the picricks, they roam backwards. Along with other cast, there were outstanding actors like Will Patin who could not come out with paper bags with sided players. On the bus, what I saw looks like big characters. Allen played well, despite being not as believable as children of kids. The DEA agent for the first time was Sherry Hot and a good actress, but her part was strange and steady. The authors miss all the opportunities for adding full story and character depth and interest. Instead of selecting for a base one dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, script ... I got a bad feeling when the credits were rolling, and there were three script writers separated by "and" and "and". It looked very amateur. And that was what was written. I heard the original script was good and then a rewrite has been completed and the hard core started sucking. There are some deceptive parts of the film to watch ... during the first secret meeting, under the obvious medicines table. "Hey, you have to meet the bar in a crowded Nude, I'll pull the blocks of coke from my jacket and you can cash money, then we will slide them to the cocktail table" WAIT! "When you look at the left and the right, make sure that no one can see!" Secondly, when someone shoots in the chest, I love him and then you see him as happy as 10 minutes later. Especially during the war scenes some nasty edits are made at the end of the movie, and when the main character is walking through the door and running as a sponsor. Which brings me to the reality of DEA training, I can not get both technical ... But the door does not have to be the criteria for jumping ... not even the ordinary female agent, the men who work on them, like the weaker fields, the weaker sections, to produce it. .. boring! Thanks for the heir director to see the autocrat. There are other stuff that I can learn in a school course ... Spread up fight, check dialogue, recycled story ... etc ... but all of you are just ex-m Applegate, he made a bad ass such as Mr Patrick Swayze that lacked the humble genetic ease. He thinks of me as one of the five foot actors, who thinks he is a bad ass, but like Van Damnit he is a real bad ass (Van Dot's Chuck Jitto) and he "badassdom." Therefore, I think the film's main Lynchin If you're a bad ass, then you do not have to try, you bad ass. Example: Swayze! If you're such a nice boy who tries hard to prove that you're a bad ass in other things ... well ... your audience, average zodiac ... why do not you rent this movie and if they're like this Write reviews.
