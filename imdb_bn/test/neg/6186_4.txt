Coltrane and Idle are a robber gang member who doubled their leader's cross during robbery. They hide themselves and hide themselves in disguise by hiding in a nun school to avoid being identified by the police and the police. It's just a bit of Catholic humor and slopstick but the script is a little thin like a sunny. Although a good shower scene though ... one to ten scales ..4.
