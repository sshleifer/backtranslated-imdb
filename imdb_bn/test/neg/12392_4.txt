Grosse Pointe was really the average film below really average. His Hitman theme is very dry and like a romantic comedy like a hit man thriller. Acting is very normal. Performance is extremely embarrassing with many characters that seem to be 'disabled' and that really bothers me. Whole reunion and 'Wow, I have not seen you in 10 years!' The ingredients are very sticky and many scenes just drag them, especially when they are in the actual reunion party and the letters greet them with their former classmates. It has just been executed very tacky, dull and weak. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Akroye, like a rival killing, is very clear. He seems to be appearing only at the very beginning and at the very end, the 'last final sound', which is very hip-up but not all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very medium Most of the songs in this film were very bad in the 1980's and without exception of two or three exceptions. With most of the Duff listening to Duff songs on the film, the film adds negativity to it. <br /> <br /> How small things I was annoying and they were very bad as the very low order came and went very fast, the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was made in that section, the half time You have forgotten that the character of Cusack even exists as an infected person <br /> <br /> Even the comedy thinks it's funny Chose; But it's not. I do not smile once during this movie. Of course, I smirked again and again but thought of my real fact was the best point when I realized the movie was over! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The high (but badly wrong) IMDb rating I've seen fewer movies than this movie, which has a low rating on this site that tells you that there are better movies. Do not just bother this one.
