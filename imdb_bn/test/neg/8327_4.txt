The only place in the interest of this character, as an advertisement copyrighted Danny Lee, is that although there is a nice cast with Chou Yun-Fat, Karin Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fu-O and Alex Man. The CYF plays a quarterly player, who wants to have peace and a lot of life but do not give up Alex Man, who has made the entire psycho who is angry with the CYF. The CYF tried to escape from Malka but did not help. When his family flew from the bits, his Crony dead or turn coat, injured and broke, CFF returned to Hong Kong to take some serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It feels much better than The CYF looks well-dressed and tears on the handsome, kind, grimaces and couples, but in other ways or another you just do not care. Andy Lau looks great, but with that. Kareena Lau is a small, tiny part that was beautiful, but before that the head gets the bullet so that it ends. Alex Man is a cartoon villain that he is so much on top, which may sometimes be confusing, but the writing here is so flat that he came across as just a garden-brown nut. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is very good - though he's just a little hug on this dark (literal) and basically boring movie screen. Rent it <br /> <br />, do not buy it. Or just completely avoid it. <br /> <br /> This is a series of "Rich and Pramus", although it was clearly illustrated together; This is the first release of the CYF box office.
