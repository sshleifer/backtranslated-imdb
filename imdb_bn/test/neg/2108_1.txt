I thought it was broken when I saw it at the store, but I realized that it was just shit, I can not believe I stopped it, as we all know that the snakes were not frustrating, they were Python and Gardner, Acting Long and Oms I still can not believe in the end if you see it but keep an eye on it till the end, after 6th I was not really sure that the producer of this film would fly this title, the only time when it was really flying, so I threw it in the trash ... just for the laughs it was, it was stupidly sunny, only Do not buy the rent
