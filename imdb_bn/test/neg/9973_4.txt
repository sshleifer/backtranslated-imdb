I was looking forward to seeing this picture and so I was extremely disappointed when I found this complete and complete garbage. Acker's side can be both heavy elephants and cliched (can you get more clash than in Paris by night?). The male cast seems to have been completely chosen for their Egon Schiele's agst-ridden self portrait porterslance. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal that should be the primary focus of such a movie is almost obscure. What remains is a turkey melody that takes an age to start and takes more time to finish. The only advantage with this type of movie is that it can help you understand how good the gadard and trophy are.
