This movie starts awesome and gives you breathtaking. Most of the acting is seen as well as Patrick Soze (with his Texas Tour, everyone else, like British - even listening to Muslims). And proves that he can not work. You can live up to the first battle scene where they all live together until the pieces fall. Why Patrick Swayze battles Baddies with an ax when he stuck his sword in the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> There are more misplacing of the sword after a few minutes, and other people know about people they should not know about. Other critics have mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. Finally, I was not aware of war scenes, sure, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest lotdown.
