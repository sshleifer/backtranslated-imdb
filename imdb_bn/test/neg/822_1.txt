Do not tell me this picture funny or a little funny This is a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ali G Chanel 4's Ali Ji show is just fun. After watching his performance, I can say that he is not ready for movies. With more like a Daft script, or any saga, there is nothing to keep you entertained. This boring, unrealistic character film is completely a complete trash. At the end of the film, Ali Ji gave a lecture. He mentioned that if you hate this movie, then people say it is good. Speech can not even save the film, perhaps she knew it would be a stinker. I want to give it 0/10, but the minimum starts 1. Overall, this garbage will not waste your time.
