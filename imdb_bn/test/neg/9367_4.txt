I present this presentation 4 they rewarded. They are all for scripts, which have gone out of recognition in places. What could possibly be said? They took one of the best plays written in the last century and systematically looted its heart, humor and humanity. I do not really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best work with simple aspects and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of stage versions have their insights - and insights - are gone). I blame the director a lot, who hesitates to find ways to weaken the script. This TV movie has many unexpected breaks, strange rebuilt moments and weirdly re-imagined line-readings, which sometimes I have forgotten the love of this game. I am not one of these people who think that gifted dramas are inferior to the film (completely opposite), but this particular talent game is heavily served by this title. Now I hope they will make a real * movie of this game. The world demands it.
