Completely agreed with other reviews. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked at one review of another site and saw that it was not even a real seagull. After this slowly back and forth from the remote TV, the jaw drops lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of the photo is out of budget. It does not even look like a freaking movie. If I see the footage 'Home Video' from a documentary, then I hope it is. Summary: Avoid, avoid avoiding. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> 5 minutes full of shame for watching myself and I hope I have saved others from rent or ownership.
