The film was released in 2002 and was highly anticipated because of the promotion, but after the producer died, it was released in 2003. <br /> <br /> The film is good but not the whole of the overall <br /> <br /> between the Queen and the Azaar The scene is fine but the other scenes are not handled properly <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to Hollywood, and although it was planned before the liberation war, Pata is lost <br /> <br /> Mitchell Luthria is completely frustrated after the wintry dies. <br /> <br /> Music is good but there are many songs <br /> <br /> <br /> It's been annoying and it seems like the queen is very good
