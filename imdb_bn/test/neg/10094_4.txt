In short, this film is about a gang war in the 1950s. Deuces leader Leon, his brother Odie's gang started on "Junk". He pledges to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival party is just leaving the prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> This film did not really do it for me. "Good guy" "Bad guy" was no better. Very little was shown that Deuces really cared for the community. I think the author is going for realism here, but I did not think I was winning any side. No letter was liked, or even able to draw my sympathy. <br /> <br /> Plus there were some wonderful dialogues in love between Annie and Bobby, and the performance was completed in full.
