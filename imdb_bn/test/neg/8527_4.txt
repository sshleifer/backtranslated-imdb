"Messy" for Danny Pang and Oxide Pong director of "I" and its consequences and responsibilities like "Americanization" of American film "rivalry" set in a farmhouse.A family set-up of four steps from a run-in-the-scenes rural North Dakota. Almost immediately their Teenage daughter Jesses under sunflower farm ghosts.Of course, her parents and the police are skeptical.Admittedly well-filmed and there are two or three effective visas But there are many ghost stories of the intrigue on the 'pie' effect. Still the plot is a carbon copy and the last anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful.Scares are very low side of a trend towards CGI.Overall, "Messenger" is a pretty scary horror The movie is not only 10 deliver.
