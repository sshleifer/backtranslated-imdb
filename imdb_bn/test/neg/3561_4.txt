This picture is about a sad wife, who lost her husband through suicide. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, due to the nature of the film, there is no excitement or drama. Without some important emotional moments, everything in the film is very easy. The sudden ending does not solve any mystery, the film certainly does not deserve to see it more. Addison Wall may have been better suited to wall content, a more intensive care program to help Edison get it affected. Instead, the film feels very incomplete and non-compelling.
