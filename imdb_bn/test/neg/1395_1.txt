So where is my fridge trophy? I seriously expect a banner and confetti that to drop from my ceiling for a whole 30 minutes of shit watching. Comedy Central is actually trying to fill the ineffective chapel of a chapel with a disabled person disguised as a disarmed man. Dah duha naa !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that when Mensia does not blur on the fifth line and laughs at her school, she only observes exaggerated, which feels a lack of humor. Have you ever seen the speed of a drunken man in a speed? It's dah duh! Even midgets and half-naked hot girl Menaia's talents manage to mislead from the lack of independence. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wet reaction", because he has constantly and illogically declared that he was, which makes him the most fraudulent. <br /> <br /> If something good is about Mensia, then its effort. People clearly have no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the face of a hungry aligator, God knows that he is trying.
