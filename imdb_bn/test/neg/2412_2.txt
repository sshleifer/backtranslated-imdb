The best thing about this movie is the poster artwork of the HR result. Anti-Nike protesters who looked like Punk Rakkars in the late 1970's and became non-violent in some way (their leader, excluding "splatters"), captured the cities. The ladies turned down on the punkers and hunted to make some violence on the boys. Bad acting and bad plot then actual victim, descends on you, viewers. I gave it a "2" because some sex scenes give it the potential of MST3 at least. <br /> <br />
