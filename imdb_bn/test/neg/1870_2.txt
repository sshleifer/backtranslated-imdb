I do not know why IMDb listed all the Ghoulies as the theater of the movies. They had direct video films. The same with the puppet master series Why have not anyone noticed this yet? Okay, the way you've got fierce across Gausses IV, probably being hijacked through the abandoned video rental shop since 1993. You looked at the discount section ... See the back and front covers. Do you expect Showshank release? There is no need to critically review this film. This is the fourth guhi picture! I bought the DVD for buying 6.50 because ... it was 6.50 .. I knew it was not a Kubrick element. And I was right. In addition to an extrador DVD, there is no trailer, there is an unknown film for the film. <br /> <br /> This is actually the star of the first gally star, Peter Leopis ... who did not really get many 'big' roles, which are different from the two films. And I do not see why ... She is an actor very bad and makes fun of her. But if you take a major role in Gaussian movies, then Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Apart from his stupid sidekick Bobby de Coco, who had very little harmony with Al Pacino (very young), he did not have any of his acting ability ... totally stupid who is just painful to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - certainly a porn star, I do not need to look at that. Though she looks quite sexy, her costume, her character and everything she drags to the credibility of the film, which is no easy task for such a film. <br /> <br /> Then Ghoulies have themselves! Who's given us down to manage. The third one started talking to them, not wrong. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of being dolls, this time the grasses are really in the quad. Filmmakers decided to run an extra mile to insult movie viewers. Also, there are only two of them, and they are not the main highlight of this movie, because it does not appear too many. However, occasionally they are amusing military ... and they are not evil at this time. <br /> <br /> It's a really funny thing, it's amazing that I was actually able to enjoy it. I do not know why ... Some black humor is actually funny, though the script is mostly available. Imagine your only threat to Satan that he "will kill you, slowly ... in pain ..." <br /> <br /> But at least not in the moon during the moon, no one was involved. They did? Yes, very poor and cheaply produced movies with 0 production prices, but Papette Master 1/2, Lonmoyar Man 2, Christmas survival or even Ghauli's third rank is not very bad.
