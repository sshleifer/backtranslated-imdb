Jack-O (1995) was a real bad movie, we're not talking about the SouzaFest X 100, no entertainment price, no budget, no gorge, Z-grade actors etc. This film was a terrible addition to the horror film industry and shoulders. Has been created !!! I was the only reason to buy this movie because I knew Linna Quigley was in it, and of course, she's her compulsory nude shower scene, which is lovely yes, <br /> <br /> < br /> But for this picture .. I fell asleep on the 40 minute stage and there was no desire to end it, it's just big time. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I'm very much interested, a mood fan, I love low budget horror, I love it all, but I hate this garbage, so I think you know about "Jack-O" You must know everything. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, "2" for the 2 minute Linna Shower Scenery, the movie itself is a total Zero !!!!
