I love Lucie, but this movie is so bad that I feel embarrassed for the first ten minutes. . . And it just got worse than that. Luceille "sang" of the ball, trying to think that it was more fluid through the use of painful and soft focus, reached my reading glasses. This is a bomb that gives bombs a bad name.
