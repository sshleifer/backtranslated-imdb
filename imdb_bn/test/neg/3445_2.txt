OK this show is the worst night of night @ night. I love many events at night @ nick and I love them. I was very annoyed when this event took place at night @night. It's a boring show and it's corny. All the time I saw out I found an episode of a little funny. This show sometimes has some of the most unfunny and stupid joke. This show sums up terrible. Offer to the new Prince of Bell-Air and George Lopez. This show is not annoying and tricky at least bits. This show should be canceled before long. I do not think there are some great classic shows as well as Nick @ The Nightmare. This show lacks cleverness, good joke, and style.
