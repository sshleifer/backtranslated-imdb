This review contains a speaker --- <br /> <br /> This movie is an American ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls for the daughter of the colonel and becomes the most hated hatred in the post of "People's Hero" at the end of the film. These pictures are highly greasy and very badly researched. This is good for people who are not concerned about the development or realization of the plot. Good for children under 14 years old. Military error in this movie is ridiculous. I think during my three years in the military, our personal needs did not need to salute or call NCO's "Sir", this film did it in various stages. Cornell hair is a very long way in the ear. The length of the male sergeant's neck was against the military protocol. In the post, the colonel was almost the only officer. Walking around the post is not shown or another officer. Your blatant condemnation branding sword against the M-16s was against the soldiers, but rather made worse. <br /> <br /> The people of this movie are returning. Michael Dudicoff is not really bad for an actor that he has only shy scripts. Ninjas were more delightful than dangerous. Avoid this film
