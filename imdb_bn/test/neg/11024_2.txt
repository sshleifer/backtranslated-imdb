Imperfect, molly-codled, self-compassionate, authoritarian Jimmy Stewart is married to Carol Lomord. After having fallen into difficult times, he has a disgraceful, erratic, passive-aggressive, over-carrying mother who is terribly desperate of an epic SmackDown and endures an infrequent crying child. No discernible end trowels in movie failure and squalor Do you want to see a couple bicker for ninety minutes with his mom? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby. The film failed to explain why we want to tolerate mother from hell, or Jimmy Stewart can not become a pair. Who wanted to see this? Who wanted to watch Stewart and Lomber without smile or curiosity? <br /> <br /> This is absolutely boring and unnecessary.
