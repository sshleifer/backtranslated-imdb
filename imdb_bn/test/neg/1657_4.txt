Very slow, dust, mysterious film. Miley Cyrus was the Italian genie Jean-Luc Gorded. Of course, how tedious, repetitive, joyless and a person's life can be empty, but I usually do not go to the movies to find it! The plot (as it is) is not satisfied. Why an excellent hotel receptionist (exception of the film's disenchantment) is rarely interested in moody, chain-smoking, silent loaner, who bothers me with 'deep' thought. It is very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character. Someone shakes him by the throat and 'snap it from him!' It seems like to say. His brother's character of many more people The last is unintentional and confusing. Everyone in the movie (when I saw the movie) they almost slept how they mocked. Of course, this will not be the Hollywood Bruce Willis-Style 'Shot-Up' and 'Crash-Bank' feature, but some power and action will make it more exciting. Ever one of the best Italian films? Pleease ... an industrial house, the best of curiosity.
