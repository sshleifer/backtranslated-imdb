The first two of these movies were very good in their own way. The first was fairly fatal, the second was a satirical success - and the third is always to go out of the woody woodwork, we always like the natural stupid iron comedy in the film. The entire point of this movie was that cheerleaders are fairly vulnerable, which usually knows enough to continue a common conversation, and the amount of comedy in this movie. Haha There is no discipline in this movie, there is no theme, no symptoms, there is nothing to entertain with half the brain (and sure, I can not sit with it all) ). If you're kind of entertaining by fart jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations <br /> <br /> 10.
