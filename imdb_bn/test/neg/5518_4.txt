Completely recycled film footage, music and ideas pieced together, this film can not really be called "good". But for me, when I saw it as a teenager, it was quite funny. (I did not know the battles outside of the stars before.) The past eighty-five SF wave and this particular effect of the time has received some nostalgic in the opposite observations. Its trashy old fashion look and its proximity provide a specific attraction. To enjoy this movie, I advised to focus on parental relationships among the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I like the idea that a bunch of scanderras discover a hero's heroic qualities after being reluctant to take care of the caretaker challenge.
