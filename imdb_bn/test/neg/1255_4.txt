Wow, I'm only one of the greatest poker tragedies and I'm talking about the great Stu Ungar premature death. This picture was terrible to say I'm sorry. Absolutely terrible Filming history is a real tragedy. Well I can be a little harsh but if you have interest in Stu Uniager's life, do not even think about coming closer to this. And those who are interested in his life have made the most of the part to despise and create new scenes of innovation. I saw this because of Stu UniGar, but nearly 4 attempts to finish it myself while trying to see this work, but unexpectedly painful
