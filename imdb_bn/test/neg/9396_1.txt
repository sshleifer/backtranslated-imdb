This movie was supposed to be based on a non-fiction book. আমি নিশ্চিত নই যে স্ক্রিপ্ট লেখক তাদের অভিযোজন লিখতে পড়েন কিন্তু ইতালিতে ফ্রান্সিস মেসের সত্যিকারের জীবনযাত্রার সাথে তার কোন সম্পর্ক নেই। Instead, it's a weird story that gives freedom to bind people at all times. Note the following example: <br /> <br /> ************************************* <br /> <br /> <br /> The speaker details ******************************* /> ​​* <br ************************************************** <br /> <br /> Bash number one *****************: Lane and her husband cheating on her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Venture Lane is a native Italian town and the streets are requested immediately by each man. <br /> <br /> Bash: Number three: Lane horny city is saved by a pleasant gentleman from the male. After one afternoon in the afternoons of love he falls for him. Later he wanted to know that he was already attached and cheated with him. <br /> <br /> Bash number four: For this, you need to expand your horizon because the references are of course in the film. Her lesbian couple friends invetro (SP?) Decided to have a baby by fertilization. I said that most of your lesbian relationships play a female role and play another male role. In the film, after the woman became pregnant, "male" decided to leave the lesbian relationship because she could not handle it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, there was nothing to do with this film that it was supposed to be the book.
