After completing the heartfelt novel of Heart of Darkness, I went to see the film, which was completely and absolute disappointing. At the beginning, I hope that the movie will help keep a jigsaw puzzle together. However, even though I used to read the novel, the film still did not understand any sense, so I can not imagine how much I would lose if I had completely excluded the book. It seems that the authors have chosen their favorite parts and kept them in movies and dropped out something that could help the audience to understand the meaningless plot. This horrible movie did not understand in any sense, and I firmly recommend strongly against watching it, because it will not do anything except you completely annoying and embarrassing.
