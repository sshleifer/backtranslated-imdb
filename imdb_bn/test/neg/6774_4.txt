A mysterious mystery about a telephone operator discovered as a railway tycoon kidnapped girl. This discovery comes with an effort in his life that has destroyed Charlie Ruggles as "crime defender". When everyone ends up in the title position, one of the efforts of women's lives becomes dangerous. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your tolerance for the ruggle and its nonsense. I usually like Raglas, but there was something about this role that surrounded me wrongly. Indeed I think it did not help that the mystery was not so good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep watching you. Yes the final on the train was breathtaking but it was not created for everything that went before. Search is not worth it, but if you put it on it try it.
