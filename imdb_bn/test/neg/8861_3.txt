... when this was the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> What a sister Sunny is an effort, but never really pull it off very well. Some good ideas have been cast, and the actors makeup and clothing were just fine. <br /> <br /> I hope a lot more, unfortunately I could not sit through it, I closed the video halfway through, and the tape emerged, I went to the rented shop to get my money back ...
