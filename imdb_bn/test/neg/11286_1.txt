Cobb in Sucked it. I did not learn anything about the person that I had not heard before. Performance was above. In search of women in Rano, Kob and Al are a scenes of driving under a snowy street, where one of the worst concepts in recent memory. It's just plain stupid and unentertaining. The flashback sequence was terrible. And they used the same sequence over over. If I see Cubal's same shot as civilian again, I would have been sick of physical illness. By seeing this movie, we can learn what was in the Kobb era. We do not learn anything about his relationship with his players, nothing about his day as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, 'they do not like him'. I thought when I used to see this picture, I would learn something about the era of baseball that Kobb played. Instead, I found how Kobe hated everything and everyone and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (sorted purpose). Kobha is depicted as a liar in the movie, so any of his stories are considered correct? Who knows? Who care? No one will be bored after watching this piece. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure that your VCR's quick-moving button is working, because you'll be tempted to use it again and again. Hope somebody will make a good movie about Tie Kobe. I liked this picture as much as I liked it - I could lose it. Now I know why I got to rent it in a free section of video one. I'll ask back my fifty cents from the video clerk, because I could not get back to the time I see this trash. Oh well, maybe I would be thinking about a movie that would feature Robert Wuhl.
