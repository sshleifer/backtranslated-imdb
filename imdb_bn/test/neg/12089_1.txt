This film had a great consistency and it could be an attractive aspect of racism, women's perspectives and male-female relationships at the beginning of the last century. However, it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse, the story of love was completely unbelievable. Acting was for the most poor, confusing aspects, but all the screenspaces and stories were the most existent. What I liked about this picture is how dark before the light of light I got a sense of how lightly a candle finds out.
