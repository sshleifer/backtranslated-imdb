But it's not. The plot is not that bad at all, the actors are all terrible so it will not be decent. Instead of a good starting point, the plot just drags and many of those victims "I do not believe that he is so stupid" is often going to things being used in horror movies. I was disappointed to see some of the main character's decisions. It took too long to reach the good part of the movie. Expectations are great but you can not spend more than half the movie. It's a shame, since it got the perfect exposure to be free before the hello halogen season. Even I think it's going to get at least a siegel, if not more, perhaps they will be able to build a solid plain plot that eventually releases something modest.
