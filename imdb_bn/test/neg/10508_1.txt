Do not avoid this movie. Just because it's so bad that it's absolutely sunny. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen but it is so bad that my friends and I could smile at every moment of this movie. Sometimes we have really debated that this purpose was bad but we are not sure it is not. Characters have not been found anywhere, as it has already been established, apparently changing the scene in the warehouse, and Vampire Assassin finishes nearly 6 climatic fights with the enemies before the head reaches the Vampire. You will also be able to enjoy the only and only face of Vampire Assassin because he has never changed his expression despite his explicit effort. So if you want to see a movie that laughs at you ridiculous, I'll recommend it as long as you go with an open mind. Do not expect good movies, expect the worst ... and worse than that. I would like to buy this movie seriously and put it on top of my comedy movie selection. Next to the right Anchorman.
