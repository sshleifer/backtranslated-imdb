This film is poorly written, strictly followed and leads to bad performance and dialogues of Leeds Jason Patrick and Jennifer Jason Leg. Believing, trustworthy, but weaker (drug addict agent involved in narcotics) this lily finish is better than flop. Enabled supporter Cast (Sam Eliot, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this image. <br /> <br /> This movie also has the greatest "love" scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the soundtrack has been overwhelmed; Especially rebellious, non-hungry-substances "tears in heaven" otherwise legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely unreasonable since the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2 10
