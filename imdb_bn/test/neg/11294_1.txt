I fully understand why this movie was made. Lambs' silence is an incredible movie - a shocking thriller with a fantastic story and high jump-factor .... <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this movie is made ... and why Anthony Hopkins In horror and dissatisfied films, Hannibal agreed to review his role as canble. <br /> <br /> There is no possible way to hide the film rather than watching it, but for those who love you, do not lose your money, do not read. The film is absolutely awesome It is so bad that Julian Moore's transformation from Jodie Foster became a non-issue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only way to truly enjoy this image is to set your watch and leave the theater in the film for two hours, because at that point, it is quite interesting adventure. Hopper and Foster comparisons between Moore and Hopkins, and other character performance are quite good. But in literal sense of two hours, the film is nothing less than a Chess D-grade horror flick ... it's sick, and it's stupid and crew-like, often running from the time of the movie, and ended in a day together. <br /> <br /> <br /> At the unhappy and surprising end of Thomas Harrison's book, to rewrite the initial concerns of director Ridley Scott ... and, really, look at this picture and read the book's end. I do not know what's bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your money or give time to this movie, unless you're ready to go out for two hours , Because it will be your only way to be pleased with Claris Stirling and Hanbee Larker Saga ... the first film has kept such mystery, and waiting for it is a lot better.
