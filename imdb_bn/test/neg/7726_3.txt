I was in an expedition to watch Uwe Bowling movies that they were really bad. Bloodthirsty first saw, there was no complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and in fact it got 4 ratings out of 10. Later, the first house of the deceased movie was. Now that was horrifically bad. I could have stood for ten minutes, and could go a little faster, and that was it. I could see where I was going, and I did not need to look at it for just one in 10 ratings. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to Siegel (which, however, was not written by Uwe Bowl, but mysteriously written by the first person who wrote incomplete), and it was higher than the original in IMDB, I thought I Give it a chance. And I actually managed to see it all. It started with some interesting references and cool lines (like how the president got the order of his vice-president!), And according to the performance, it is better than the first-half year. Here we got a lot of coolness like the hot hot Emmanuel Wagiera, whose coolness is in the league with Curie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Yavelin Lily. Man, I hope some matrices-style movies come with him. And always interesting, super highway Victoria Pratt. I love the athlete women. And, Nadine Velazquez (Katinalina of "My Name in Earl"), who played well. <br /> <br /> The story was not over, and the action was not big, and the end was frustrating because they did not succeed in their mission. Oh well, survive at least two mains. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actors make it watchable, but there is no real substance There are. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 3
