I'm all about walking dead, but my mind is still walking, frozen death is uncertain. Sadly, Chiling has not helped me to make up my mind. If it does not happen for the first 45 minutes, it gradually hits the "film incremental" button. There is no idea that the well-designed zombie was too late until the show and the director (there are rumors to hold this image). Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassed / recovering in fashion. I will give film credit before the T2 is over with the volume frozen by the liquid nitrogen. Mr. Show Show DVD offers an extended promotional reel for 8-minute long and I really recommend to fully see the flick.
