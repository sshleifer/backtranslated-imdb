It is true that the comedy works best when related to stuff. But even though, some attempts are needed to make every effort and even the most miserly of the audience can laugh. When I look at the daily show, I've seen it all "It's funny because it's true" because, but I do not try, but I do not try and often they are not funny or just try not to make a point (I'm mostly in the interview section This notification). The Daily Show started as a news parody, how they became drunk by definition, how the media used to proclaim their own news as oppressed and stupid news journalists and anarchists and they tackled science from science and sometimes in many areas of politics, Then John came along Stewart ... and it all went to hell. The first years of Mr. Stuart's reign were Thriji Golden, although he was very funny, but then came along with 2004 and there you started to see a huge opportunity from the show. The show's humor has gone, Colbert left, Steve Carroll left, most of the show's best anchors were left, and now it's mostly about John Stuart and the show is going from a parody to a semi-serious news show, mainly in the evening, but with some gags here . There is a problem finding out what to see for those who did not see and what to watch on the wire, I will give a brief description of what I will show (at least until 2009): Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (unless they embrace the views shared by the Democrats ) Stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocritical, whoever is standing by the conservative belief, is evil, corrupt and hypocritical. Man-Made Global Warming Theory People who suspect are evil and stupid; -Vote Democrats; There, I watch your time save 25 minutes, watch something else. Initially, I hijacked Shoke for the producer's own personal political agenda, but when I actually saw the interviews, the scene became clear about this scene (I mentioned above), but I'm going to be in it. According to June Stuart, the funny picture of The Daily Show is that you got a random field quote because of the ridiculous reasons of Bush, Cheney or a Random Republic because the best. John authors set it up in a specific context, set up joke and since the random quotes in any way distributes the punchline. So, unless you get «in the context», it is totally weird as bankable humor. The Daily Show also hopes that when you are talking to a politician and talking about another person in another video, you are laughing again and hoping that the authors are expecting you to understand why this will make you funny. Well, because John said. Now imagine the daily show that has been using countless times a week for weeks and what you mean is a smile that is now a 25-minute continuous stroke (yes, even in the Louis Black Segment). First, these jokes were inserted in some strong efforts, but now less than that. And in the interview I have ever seen that bias has the most strange ideas. John Stuart Bill O'Reilly calls on a blame, but what he does when he shows up on shows and certified republicans and completed conservative newsmen who show up to every single actor and democracy (before John Kerry, Obama today) As Bill Kristol? He puts them on the tribunal of some crimes as if they are being charged with any crime, that anyone who is standing in front of Bush has been portrayed as being misleading, such as the person who does not communicate with the reality and says that he speaks to America's majority, anyone Actual treatment for the conservative person, unless they have similar powers with Democrats The shares, however, so it is an endless festival of love. But still, it does not matter, in the eyes of people you have gone wrong before going to mourn and still are wrong. If you get some kind of remote-right wing you get that kind of treatment. Now you have to think about what you can do with humor. What would happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
