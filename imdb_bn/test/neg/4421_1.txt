This image is a hodge-podge of various stupid cliches. For example, he falls in love with boy-mood-wealth-wealthy and college students (a very used backdrop in recent Indian commercial films). Sexual victory is a male chauvinistic glory. Climax is predictable (many vomiting ads in several movies). Like many other recent commercial Hindi films, these films are associated with the incompatible insertion of songs, which probably contribute to the success of the film than anyone else.
