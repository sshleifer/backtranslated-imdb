This film is absolutely scary and awful. It's not a budget, it's not a budget movie that makes Ed Wood's films look like an industry. Acting is dishonest but bad sets and props I have never seen then. A common subway train is used to transport people to the evil area of ​​the killer mutant, there is a bullet in the Wide Stroud, and the fighting scenes are shot in an unused jackfruit cage. 80 seconds Italian Video There is a grief that you expect from the ugliness. No talent was used to create this talent. And the interest of women's love could be a huge Bhind-Italian flavor. This movie was quite awesome for more than 80 Italian standards, but I think it came at a time when there were not many movies available to the video or viewers. This piece of punk has no entertainment value and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. It's actually the most stupid listener and humiliation. I'm surprised how an actor like Woody Stroud has finished this Turkey in the world?
