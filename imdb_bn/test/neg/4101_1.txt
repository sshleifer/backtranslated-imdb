What could be a good story was that the ridiculous time was destroyed by the travel scenario. If there is some change in the past without evolution and human change, then the time machine will never be built. If some of the past is brought into the present, then there will be no effect on the past. <br /> <br /> I really want the movie makers to run their ideas to a real scientist before completing the script. Even if you suspend the reality and estimate the time travel, you have to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> It was a great time with the top performances of OTOH, Ben Kingsel. Other actors seem to be doing all the good they can do well. This writing left them blurred in the air. <br /> <br /> "Future to Future" managed it better.
