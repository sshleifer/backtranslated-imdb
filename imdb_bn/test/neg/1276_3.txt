If you like the story of a fairy tale "real life" adventures, see it. If you are not young, kids like movies, why not see it? :) If you are a parent going to see a movie with your kids but you are better at choosing to smell! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie was a little funny and it was a bit of a good thing to be on the premises for the event. But after the type of characters, settings and the kind of interesting types of possible conflicts, the story is slow. When the same things are less or less the same for the third or fourth time, the word "predictable" seems like the same thing as random LP sections or the ads you hate. And the end of the plot ... * Oh smile ... poor, poor, poor!
