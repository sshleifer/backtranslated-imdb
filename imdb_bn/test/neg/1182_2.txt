I stopped seeing halfway through this film through. It was just terrible! Annoying, entrepreneurial mistress. A complete lack of way of showing the screenplay of Normann Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Releases. A movie does not have to be historically correct, but the true story of Ed Gene is far more interesting than this third-rate melody, which is not fully prepared for any good reason! Why Hooder is a cartoon sadist depicted Ed Gin In an attempt to show the injury given by his mother, the recycled style only has weak exercises. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed up. Fortunately, this story has a good film. Ed Gin of 2001 said this story efficiently and gave some real coolness, because we did not see a sick man under his control. Steve RailSack, who played Ed Gin at the time, is famously famous for the filming of another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His ed was stone. One to see his picture. Avoid this mess.
