What is the waste during watching this movie Poor photo quality, poor sound, poor performance and definitely not based on actual events. The deputy's "girlfriend" overacting so much, Sheriff did, it was more comedy than horror. Deputy 911 tries to call emergency phone calls ... PROBLEM ... In 1957 the emergency number did not exist. This is simply an inconsistent inconsistency example. <br /> <br /> "Scary" outlook diminished. <br /> <br /> I thought that actors played the most respected actor in the whole film. I could see the mental disturbance in the film of his character. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... it's just not!
