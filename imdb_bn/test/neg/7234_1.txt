Best wishes, moviegoers! I have seen Octopus II, I think of the underlying lamenant of Octopus / Croke / Dino Horoscope. Many filmmakers can blame poor performance, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plots, because it might blur the OCD movie. These reasons may indeed be floundering, but the underlying difficulty of filming an OCD movie is the heart of lameness. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even with the help of shiny movies, you can see that many films (OCD sub-generals, that is, before they are completely annoyed with the film) are only half-dark forests / half-dark caves / half-dark depths of semi-dark holes. <br /> <br /> What can you do, you ask? I would not recommend surrendering impressive styles, but others need to search Avenue. We will not really go back to "fade-to-black" that many people have been killed. Or can we? If we can not reach the goal of reality, we need to compensate in other ways such as plot twist, endundo, and photo-chaunity. <br /> <br /> It will be cured through the patient and alternative methods of OCD sub-genre, so common, lameness,.
