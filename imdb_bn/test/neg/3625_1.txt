I strongly dislike this show. I mean, basically the school is honest, and rich, and I doubt that the boarding school will be so cool. And why do they suddenly let girls enter the school? Is not that a little weird? However, Jamie Lin's spear can not work. She always has the same facial expression, which really bothers me. She is basically passionate, and all people feel like her. <br /> <br /> And he does not want to follow him? It's not that hard! Really! None of this show is a real life, and she is not "a girl like me" because most regular girls do not have to go to boarding school, do not wear designer clothes, and do not live on the beach. <br /> <br /> fake fake nets.
