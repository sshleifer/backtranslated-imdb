This movie is so bad that the storage was not good either. It's really terrifying. In a tongue compared to a disaster movie, they were serious, but they were serious. Made for TV, but that's not even worthy. It contains all the clich√© and sugar plots moment you can imagine. Hey, will he live from the dam? Will his wife accept that she still loves him? Do they run away before floods sink? I can not explain how bad this is. Dreadful predictive plot that makes you fooled is so fascinating. The bad effect (although being fair I saw more bubbled water fused). Bad script Sad actress Unbearable So bad that you will probably get drunk and see it.
