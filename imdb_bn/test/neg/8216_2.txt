All right, do not make any mistake - this is a pretty horror movie, but I really thought it had some obscure scenes and that now and beyond its unfortunate budget. At least it is funny in the strange spots and it is a definite air of frustration and discomfort (a face flowing scene, part of the bride dressed). <br /> <br /> This child has been in my "so entertaining entertainment category", and for that I give it a star. The effect is terrible, abysmal acting, and the whole thing looks like it is shot a day. You love that toy ship very early, too! It brought back memories of childhood seeing it on TV late in the night long years ago. Although alpha DVD printing seems to be weak and although it was an old television broadcast or something directly recorded, I really liked it!
