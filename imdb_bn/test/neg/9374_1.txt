After some very old Dutch action flickr like Lake and Van God Loss, Gerard Verage wants to create a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, a big word for the blaster class brussinma. He is not a real international person like George Jong (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He was just an Amsterdam iron person who sold some soft drugs and made some money. These issues are often flown away by the Netherlands and this movie is just another example. But still, the film can be very nice if the story is okay. There is a big shock in the time now: one day the Klas is just an ordinary drug-boy, the next shot seems to be a big player in the drug scene. No one knows how to do it (except for reading books). Actually bad, non-Dutch filmmakers see one of the worst actors in the Netherlands: Chanel Janzen. When you think that he finally gets naked, you see a stand of the model. So: Bad acting + bad Montage + shit story = D. Dominie. <br /> <br /> <br /> I've warned you.
