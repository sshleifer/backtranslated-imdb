I accidentally rented this one. I lifted up the video and looked back at the "Shameless Blair Witch Rip Off" thought. Then, in a moment of helplessness, I caught the 'Francisville' test. It was something else. My horrific film was far more intimidating than any offer to get home and realize my mistake. The annoying character, the bad acting, and 'we saw the Blair Witch project and the same feeling of' feeling 'of the fast moving direction would direct you to credit directly. I'm not one to blame film makers for laziness or frustration, but after this celebration I feel the need to warn everyone: Do not waste your time, you will have life.
