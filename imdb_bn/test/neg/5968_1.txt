If this picture is only indecently poor then it will be fine, the problem takes it seriously. To summarize it, there are a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no lead and all questions raised are unsuccessful in finding an answer. Overall, the film is very repetitive and annoying (I fought several times in African countries and was very painful to see all the links on local sorrow and despair, but still have no idea). <br /> <br /> - The question raised is pure manipulation and the fact is that they are not any questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I am not a filmmaker, but what is the issue of raising, for example, the question of smuggling weapons, if the only material to the audience is the local reporter's statement? The director is not bothered to show at least one order, where he is waiting for the airport, after landing the aircraft, the heaviest people who left the area were trying to spot the truck. <br /> <br /> - The story of fish takes less than 5 minutes and is only supported by a sequence where the director film is a documentary showing during a local conference. What does this guy do any work ???? <br /> <br /> - Absolute poverty is always shown in continuous continuity, but where is the point? One hand can go anywhere near Africa in Cameras and unfortunately shoot the same pictures. Where's the big news? <br /> <br /> - Reflecting on the killer friend and colleague prostitution images and the weeping prostitution, the most deadly mental skills value these days can see on the TV and on TV. <br /> <br /> - Parallel parallel between the two million hungry and fish exports is parallel to parallel to the country, there is absolutely no flawless, unscrupulous and unconvincing, but in general it is to use the audience in anti-Western and anti-Western sentiment. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after the publication of an Academy which has published a very detailed comment on the film, which has been working in Africa for decades, for a detailed detailed investigation of the journalists. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The sun's dry fish waste and everything collected by some local people is not meant to be eaten by humans, but it is exported for proper meaning. The purpose of feeding animals. I think I'm not the only person that the director gave the right opposite advice. <br /> <br /> - Arm smuggling is a fact (but again there, where big news ??), but the way this film explains the problem. If the empty planes flying in the Wan district are involved in smuggling, they actually unload their inventory in different parts of Africa, then leave the wand for fishing instead of empty the trip (i.e., that they actually empty the vacant place muvenja ...). <br /> <br /> - People eat fish locally, contrary to the advice of the film (about 40-60% are out of the lake) and thousands of people live with them. It's about Good for them! This is a private business that will take African nation out of poverty, not western wailing and endless foreign aid. <br /> <br /> I can not see the success of this movie!
