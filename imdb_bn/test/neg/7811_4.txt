It was stupid. Adam Sandler is a sort of film. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting parts but not funny. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some actors <br /> <br /> There were some mother-in-law. Night live people movie But if I do not recommend this only then nothing else will be good. And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
