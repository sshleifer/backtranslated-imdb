Cats and movies never begin to see such an attitude when it is not as good as it is, it is not strange: "Son, it's becoming harder than ever before"? Can anyone afford to rent this movie high? Or even remotely positive - Expectations as "House of the Dead" are a series that is generally considered to be one of the greatest bad rituals of all time to be released. The original unrealistic reputation of the original has actually been a great benefit for the director Michael Hart because it was really easy to cross the predecessor level. And how shameful it will be for the bowlers to bowl, is not it? Is it easy to accept straight-to-video seqlines without its Star Power or promotional campaign, rather than its own intense video game parlance? If anybody still suspects: No, "House of the dead: Dead motives" is not a good horror movie but yes: if you are also sure to find the first and even valuable rent in search of inhuman search then splatter with gory butchering loads, sleaze and stupid humor Film There is no real connection to the first movie (other benefit) events, and this section opens in a college campus, usually as a ranked sex comedy set. The male Brotherhood Club plans to attack a sister's house, especially with huge nipples, blonde cocks live, but when the party interrupts an insane professor (Sid Hig!) To drive a girl to her and turns her back towards her lab her in zombie. It is a fast spreading and deadly epidemic, but the government is not worried, the government sends their best scientists and soldiers to the campus to prepare and seek out the living and bring blood samples for their antibodies. The most common thing in this world for the squadron seems to be hunting the bodies, they are also known as their Hyper Sapiens, but their continued growing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most difficult soldiers. Inspired by director Hurst James Cameron's "Alliance" and his most famous classics in the series? Of course - the trilogy of Romeo's death in George, especially "Dead of the Dead". He thankfully did not make the same mistake as the Uwe Bowl, who inserted the footage of the actual video game in his film (Why?!?) And exaggerated using * little * CGI techniques. Hotad 2 has heavy images of violence, such as fatty female bodies and detailed statements, but it is sometimes not annoying or frustrating. Naturally, there is little bit of softness to enjoy and there is every horrible awesome clich√© feature. As long as the story writer Mark Olman does not try to explain the source of zombie epidemics, the film is very enjoyable. They are walking dead bodies with their brain hanging brain, so we do not have to know what causes their death. Especially when a blonde is explained by sorority whore, which is definitely not a final one does not mean all medical conditions. Just avoid cats, sweetheart.
