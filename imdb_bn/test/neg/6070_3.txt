Trite and unoriginal. It is an immortal boyfriend and a person who has seen and decided to mix them together, and in this process, the plot of the other sources from other movies is to steal the other. Like most of today's historical movies, there are some incompatibilities as history can be used to best understand history, which can be understood in most cases. For example, for the rest of Bithovan's life, others needed to understand what they needed to say, so other people needed to write it. Of course, there was a pain to show on the screen. The script, although some quoted lines are filled, does not contain the feeling of time, and seems to be contemporary rather than with some bad acting. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at but he still has a lot to improve his craft. Ed Harris does not work for me as Beethoven and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for that. Overall, the musical maestro's life is not a very good explanation. Well just find yourself a copy of the immortal boyfriend. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
