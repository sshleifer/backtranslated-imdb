It's a shame that such a loom plot should be broken into beautiful locations, the documentary style report was removed for some lengthy lengths. A small film may have made some more excitement, and more charismatic lead could not make its lines so much fun. The female lead also was not allowed to work enough, as a result of a beautiful but annoying affair. Although it was created in the end, the lead actor's release was too late and should be released before the movie. Not terrible, just a pity. Unexciting but early hours satisfaction TV schedule is quite nice.
