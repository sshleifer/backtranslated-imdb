Sadly, this movie was possible with such deliberate cast, but everything was so bad thinking and weakly executed. I do not think I've ever seen a movie where every scene has flurry aloud, as it was here. Also, I've never seen a "Stoner" sexual comedy which at least one can not laugh, but pain has not given anything except this pain. Last time I was surprised to see how strange the comedy was about this wonderful "Big Mom's House". After the scene, these movies will make your brain jelly. Goofy and fool can sometimes be fun, but here, fools and stupid viewers are used as torture devices. An absolute, rock-bottom bud
