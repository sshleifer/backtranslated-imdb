Take me: Usually the routine of video effort from Disney and the lazy straight. <br /> <br /> Disney will certainly fall in love with Family Films tradition which is family dog. Many cinemas have dedicated themselves to the story, which only centers itself with their best friend. Disney has made itself a fist. They literally made a boxer who dogs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said,. It is not correct to see anyone who is seven years old. Perhaps young people would like to see Lady and Trump II: Scam's initiative, even they will grow up and say that it is the best family entertainment that is never seen. I guess to be fair, I can say that it is a rental heir, but it's not something to say. <br /> <br /> This series basically highlights the remaining parts after the so-called classic. . The Lady and the Tramp now have a kitten in the catchment of the catchy spaniel dog ... and a mischief called Scam, a chip from the old block. Instead of the home borders, Scam wants to escape with the other junkyard dogs in the city, as one of the good ones in the street, as his father's own past unknown. To capture the real characters, it throws the same dog / rich dog love story inversely. One of the scandap angels junkard dogs falls for one (and who does not have such a word and sounds like Alice Milano?). Replay of the famous Spaghetti scene! In addition to the "intelligent" factor, there is no store for any listeners in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Stuck with the original <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** 5 out.
