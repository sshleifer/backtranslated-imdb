Never remember the serious reasoning gap, do not remember the characters of unknown character, do not miss harmful writing, and you may like this movie. The original character Alice was considered to be respectful, the heroin you want to protect is heroin (or in this case, save yourself), but instead he only makes gates, and makes a surprise, actually what all the belleries is really stupid? His busy mother had obviously needed to spread the confusion that the ballet company's evil spirits shouted to an artist, director / villain, ready to rob your poor, innocent, young woman from your perception. And the broker! He is not only an unknown, intelligent, counter-junky and a pathological liar, but within a few months. Just like the author, he can suddenly find out the details about the ballet and see how much they are growing in two hours (commercially). <br /> <br /> Believe me or I'm a dancer. It is unreasonable to attend all the dance forms of the "rebellious" or "resurrection" of Anorccia and Bullymia. In fact, teachers are so scared that a girl may take a better chance than a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my class will actually be considered minority overweight. I'm not saying diet can never happen, but as soon as it is portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem was that the film was ultimately the type of writing. Her closure lover was probably half-hour of all the screen time in the first half, all was well. Other supporter characters sheer props, the story had more decorations. If given the right conversation, it was a complex subject of a psychological problem. As it turns out to be a female show, and Kimbery McCullo does not have the chance to run it. <br /> <br /> This movie "Insight" is really a ballet film that goes behind the closed doors of the company. To a dancer, it is a very insulting film, which informs Bullina as stupid and parents as pushy and ill. These adjectives more accurately describe people who have received it in the air. 3/10
