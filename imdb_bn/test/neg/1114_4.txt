In 1913, Carlton Mine, in Adytouen, Pennsylvania, used poor children to search for a mine cruel owner and after an explosion, a group of children were burnt alive. At present, Karen Tieni (Lori Hururing) spent the long-term terminology after spending her husband spending time in treatment. Without any means, she went to the old house of her husband Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Morez) along with her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at night, and Sarah has heard that the area has its body. When Emma becomes a friend of Mary, she thinks she is a fictional friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombies and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah leave behind her closet. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a bad movie: Acting is good; Make-up is weird; And cinematography and music scores are excellent. However, the story, and the resulting screen, too weak, is really a bad collection of clich√©s. Reasonable at the beginning, with a widow moving to a home in a remote location, because the family spent all their resources with their parents' illness. But when he comes, accidentally attacking people without any consequence of little zombies, for example, do not search for missing people in the family. Then the mischievous Mr. Carlton came to the place with the most disgusting attitude, which would normally die in the end. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after Mr. Carlton was killed. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says she's tired and can not walk, it's a stupid line I've never seen in a horror movie. My vote four <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hairy"
