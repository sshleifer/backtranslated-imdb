Friends, what can I say to you? I am Bulgarian I can not remember how many times I can speak to Americans, and they may be together that there is no short formula for Bulgaria, but they say: "There is a war going on, is not it?" Or "I have never imagined that there is internet in a place like the people of Bulgaria" Bruce Campbell's "Screaming Brain the Man" I was enthusiastic about this movie because I was a Bruce Campbell fan - "Evil Dead" Trilogy and "Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was fully shot on the position of Bulgaria, the second is "Alien Apocalypto" which is almost unreasonable. 3) I enjoy excellent b-movies <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy city where they drive, waves around illegal guns, and you get killed anytime Can go. And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than humiliation. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Sich have created a great team, Bruce is specially made himself - and this is all about. There is nothing else to look at here <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
