Corey Heim is not going to be regarded as the best actor of his time, but at least movies like "Licensed To Drive", he has more in his element ... combo humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dean Quotes's book "WÃ¶rcher" is one of his previous works, and is still probably his seratum. Sadly, this fantastic story of a brilliant dog, a satiric mutant and a genetic test has been misinterpreted. Acting is so useless, you can think you are watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about dogs, you would be good to see "incredible journey", "kujo" or even "champs" ... well, maybe not "champs" <br /> <br /> If you have read this book, then avoid this cost to avoid this movie. If you do not read the book, read it and avoid this movie. Thank you later on <br /> <br /> A few good translations of Dean Quotes are "Romance", capable thriller thriller.
