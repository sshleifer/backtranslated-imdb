Now, this movie I saw is the worst! It's just a disaster. I really think it's a sick movie, I just waste my time watching this cheap shit. I believe that nobody will create such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. There is nothing learning from this movie, it's just a hollow sick evil fix I do not think they can make it worse, this movie has achieved its title as the lowest monstrous king. Acting is a disaster, meaning ... Oh well, no sick pain and sorrow mean no endorsement by the sad child at the end of this movie and killing a wife which is another blow to the film again. . Benefit yourself, you actually have some self esteem, keep away from this horror !!!
