This film brought a completely new meaning to the orderly "paint drying" because it was 'to see the paint dry in the middle of a man-made'. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this picture of the portal on the west coast, which I visited. This is a kitten beautiful place and a whole new level of black-and-white beauty has started. That was the only good thing. The story was remarkably extravagant and in reality you have some stories. <br /> <br /> A movie crew comes out of the film and has to wait for the whole crew. Well, wait a wait. I can wait for the 15th bus at Edinburgh's Princes Street, I can spend hours on a remote railway station somewhere in the middle of the afternoon on Sunday afternoon. But the wait was boring and yes, this waiting was very annoying. <br /> <br /> The image goes back to the resurfaced America with the suppliers, which does not spark the whole thing. After several arguments, two happy bullets come out from which wait and wait finally, finally, and not before. <br /> <br /> Yes, if someone does some surgery with me, then you can see this movie again. The colorful movies that I can reduce them to the screen.
