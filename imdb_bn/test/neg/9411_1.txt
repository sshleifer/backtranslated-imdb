Very poor script and acting. I was surprised that the director could believe in his cast with his empty story which does not tell us anything new. All "counselors" and "talented strangers" are among the clich√©. Characters' are not even attractive nor sympathetic. Artificially it is empty and trivial. The colors are very transparent and light. Only posters can be interesting. Al Passino tries very hard to give the depth of his character with no success. Too bad because sport betting could be a really interesting topic which can be related to many. But after 20 minutes before I left the theater, I could not make a complete comment on this movie. Everything was so expected that it was a waist ...
