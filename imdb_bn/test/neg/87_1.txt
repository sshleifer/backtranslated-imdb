I can not believe the high marks given on this image on this site. The text is incredibly bad by revealing the text is coming at the right time and the heroine is trying to escape. (Do you just hate it when that happens?). And acting is so bad that you can get a splinter from all the scenes that kiss your eyes. <br /> <br /> A nuts hold their hostage, children are out of the open screen, so he shouts. Instead of screaming at this moment, he was brave enough to destroy Windows just a few minutes before to cry out to these same children for help. <br /> <br /> He was finally free and alone from home. His chance to go for help, so what does he do? Wanders around the house and lies down. She locked the basement, away. So what does he do? It takes a little nap. Come on! Most of the movies roam around the buffalo and sit in the wake of his sleep. Four times! What? Why should we pay attention if a writer is really annoyed to write a real plot? I think it was basically a game for radio, so they actually sat on the side of the heroine instead of actually being a screen writer and instead of actually taking any action. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely impossible, horribly written and almost ridiculous acting. Pay attention to this movie at all costs!
