The last part of the story - all the killings were a joke on the main character and nobody actually died. Yes I know Sports Wolf has done it and it did well, but it is not "Sports Wolf", it's "Scrum Crane"! Although "characters" do not die clearly, we see their death (and in other ways they are killed), even though these "killings" will not happen as someone will see them. Mr. Director, if you see people kill you, then someone will have to see it, if they are off the camera and the character dies, then it does not work - and in the end I like a few scenes but your end has ruined the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is very horrible (especially the child who really believes that he believed his friends that he is playing with his dead grandmother's brain). Half-baked (though you're half-baked, you can choose the movie) only because I gave this movie 3 because a) they actually created something b) they were released and c) they shot in the film. Yes you're reading right, they The film stock for this shit (at least) $ 5,000 is lost. Sorry, if they make a dv, they can make better cash and other writers go through the script and earn some money to make it better. <br /> <br /> I have made the director something in most cases) but the actual statement in IMDFB is about how the "original" movie is going on. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if its meaning is bought to see it, if a friend has this, then it can be a fun movie to lend.
