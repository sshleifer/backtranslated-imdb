Weaker aspects, weak plot, great songs, I wonder why Woody Goswami is in the world's first place? He tried to reveal his talent a lot (mostly skin) but failed to print. <br /> <br /> The music was not that impressive, only one song "Jhalak Dakhlaja" was audible. <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, Well they finally tried to justify the title of the movie, but it did not understand. <br /> <br /> There were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which is more annoying. But if anyone is Dino Morari fan, but go ahead and see it.
