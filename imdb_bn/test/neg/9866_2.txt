Bootlegs almost drifting around, sometimes thinking of an urban comic book legend, as the first FF movie everyone fears as fear is too bad. I think Marvel Comics does not present it now, which version of the 2005 theater was released earlier this year. But this is a reminder and the last wave of the bad, low budget Marvel Super Hero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, Most TV Films). 'Low budget' is a very easy description for this FF photo. Originally a fund, super powers were limited to show shot (Mr.Frenchtastic), kosi-animation (torches) and fads (easy to disappear girl). Thing suit was not bad and probably half budget; The part of the face was almost certainly sure. Acting? Alex Hyde as Reid- White is quite good; The other three are okay, as JJ, the man sometimes works like a spaz for listening off his 'shining' mood. The dialogue is comic-book style, and it ends up floundering by supporting cast which tries to work it out. Dr. Doom has become mild and strange ridiculous and a case study that can not work or write in two main Henman dialogs. <br /> <br /> Plot? Not so good It was quite faithful for FF's original story (more than the next big budget version) and even non-budget looks again limited, for example, the actual crash landing, how it kept the elements necessary, they discovered their power in an isolated area - the best part of the photo , You have to wait a full half hour for it. I found the odd music out of place; When 4 of these cosmic rays get danced, a kind of songwriter is heard as it is a religious experience. But the rest is frustrating. Even in addition to the budget, the story may be in addition to the character of Jewelery (similar to Mole Man Villen of the book); It spends a lot of time with her and her underground gang, as well as the blind Alicia. This division is the celluloid waste and very annoying. Claymatic struggle with Duo and his men begins fine, but torch races fall into the horrendous world as a laser beam (great animations but a cartoon). If they are not frustrated and do not get disturbed then Fans can laugh at FF FX and intelligent tales.
