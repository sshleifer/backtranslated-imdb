It was so bad that I could not even review it. So I will make some sentences about what I have seen, and it will be up to you to make a decision. <br /> <br /> With Captain Kirk, hat and Tuby Got, slamming Usemet's El Capit√°n. Spock meets Halfride on Hovercraft like him on a floating skateboard. Kirk Falls Fly down the spock, catch its inch before Kirk Ground hits the head- the first. <br /> <br /> Later, that night, spoke, Kirk and McCau were eating beans around a campfire. Like spock beans. After that, Kirk and McConke wrote the song "Row Row Ro Ro Roi U Boat", and Spok wants to add harmony in three ways. Do not want to sing Spock. And later that night, he disagreed. "But life is not a dream, Captain". May I leave now? <br /> <br /> Okay ... talk about half of the brother's voice, revolt against a useless world, violet planet. The planet's enterprise land, and the ohura, fifty-five-pound push and weighing two hundred pounds, the native lures with his bare legs. But they can not mock a brother, who claims to be able to find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnaps the crew and enterprise. They went to a planet where there was a big beard, it was claimed to be God, Kirk, spoke and Macquay were burning. Spock's siblings, it is not God to understand - but really a form of yourself - or something - joins with apparition for it to destroy and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Coming back (referring to what I was wearing, a clip from Kirk was wearing a Rock T-shirt?). With Spock playing some awful Vulcan guitars, they "Row Row Your Boat" songs, this time harmonizing as three credit rolls.
