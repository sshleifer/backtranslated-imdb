As actor and director, I am a great fan of John Tarturo's work, ILLUMINATA is a great disappointment. Although the film has some charming moments, it is flat on the whole. Worst, the film is confusing. Where is the movie set? Italian group in Italy or New York? Why bother making a historical film if failing to publish a setting? If you want to see the well-made, inspirational historical film about the theater, then see Tim Robins' Crad. There are many more in this movie, among which John Tarturo has a great acting.
