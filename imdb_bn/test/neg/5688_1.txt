The film starts with a 30-minute battle, with the interpretation of human psyche, war, history, and then throws 2 actors into a jackfruit hole. They run around this lawn straw / desert area for about an hour shooting each other. That's it. With the change, Â£ 10.00 must be spent. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After one and the other, we started crying one by one. <br /> <br /> <br /> Comment (Let the observer determine what is happening). Remove some of the awful CGI. Add some techno rave music to it. They can only retrieve it .......
