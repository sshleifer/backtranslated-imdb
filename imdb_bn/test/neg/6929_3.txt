Most of my life I liked the book "A Little Princess", and a movie was very excited. But I was scared at this adaptation. Not just acting wood, and this conspiracy is a slow mix of spices of books, but the theme is all wrong. The real theme of the story should be that when a girl behaves like a person, she can be a princess, like Sarah when she gives 6 beats to the beggar child, even when she is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems like that all the girls are the princess, which makes Sarah's work very cheap and looks like it should be written on the hallmark card than appearing in this story. There are many other things wrong with this movie - many are for listing, but here are some of the big ones: this story should be set in Britain in the mid-1800s, not during the First World War. Sarah Mitchen worked hard since the beginning, when she was released, her activities became less surprising than the start, if she was sweet from the beginning, as she was supposed to be. Somewhere it is mentioned that the beakis are black. Sarah's father * does not come back, she's dead. This is his closest friend and associate of diamond mining who found Sarah and brought her back to her proper place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned, even though they are the sources of Sara's resources. <br /> <br /> All the things that Sarah has faced, she always works like a princess, which she can do, and forgive those who hit her. She will not be called Lavinia a "snotty face two face". Such a thing completely out of character for him, and completely undermines the philosophy that he is behaving well. Whatever is the key <br /> <br /> This screen is by the worst adaptation of a book. Sometimes the intriguing (and notable exceptions of "Ela Enchantment" and "Anne of Green Gable of Containing Story") book has been written with excellent and skillful, so I do not understand why the director felt it needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would recommend that you want to know about this story, see the 1987 edition, which is a lot better. Or better yet, read the book. Your time will be even more valuable than more than half of this version of the film.
