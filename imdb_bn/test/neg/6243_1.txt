I hate it when people in the movie theater speak again on the screen. This is one of the main reasons why stopping DVDs or videos. I saw the clearing in DVDs but if I had seen it in movies then I would have to stand and scram "he is still dead, you too die!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The horror movie that features Mr. Redford. Legal Eagle, Havana, Insane Offer, Close Up and Personal, Sneakers, The Last Castle, and Spy Games. If Robert Redford asked me to invest something, then I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to the audience is the worst. Say you are being kidnapped and your abductor has a gun. She kept it with you for most movies. You started the table on her and started strangling him. She kept strangling on whatever you do until she was dead! Just stick to him for ten seconds. Stay with it! At least ten minutes. But Bob stopped very quickly, went away and forgot about Mr. Kidner ... .. He got up, found the gun and kept it on our hero again. At this moment I'm going to shoot Robert Redford. I wanted Kidnapper. A few times more. And I wanted to shoot him as well.
