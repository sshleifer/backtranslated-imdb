The opening scene really got me to watch the movie. However, after more than 5 minutes, I was already gouging my eyes. I did not say that I just did not understand the word, acting by a mentally challenged team could be better. A highlight of this movie was a punk white dwarf. However, I did not connect to the African Americans the two children had a white dwarf connection. But I suppose anything is possible. Also, why was Robin in this film? I'm not sure I added anything to the artist. Overall, I strongly recommend that you close a cliff before renting this movie.
