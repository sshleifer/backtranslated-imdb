It is still another masked-intellectualist, "Let's see Nasaki a real bad" movie. Nazi was quite bad, no doubt - most of them already know. However, that does not necessarily make movie every movie well. A discovery of "The WNSE conference" invention was even more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls on her ass between two sections: Documentaries and plays. It does not cut as a documentary, the movie is very "staged" and the presentation is very "common". It is not cut as a play, the characters are very shallow and very easy "solution". Another issue is the tagline: "One of the biggest crimes against humanity is just one hour." The final solution as the film shows at the Wannsee Conference was nothing to meet with reaching a compromise. SSE has already taken this decision. The sole purpose of the meeting was that all the key stakeholders were already forced to surrender themselves to the established plan. There was no decision or plan at the Wannsee Conference. Only threat and forced (some need less than others). <br /> <br />: There is a tendency to start a thing (though not in an exceptional way) that shows the film, people's culture and aesthetics are an attempt to hide for themselves that they are terrifying. It is seen in most "leaders" and politicians.
