The first rabakote was a bad idea of ​​violent intelligence and violence. It was a fine line of walking, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well, they made a sequel. How terrible it is (Potential spellers are ahead - even though it may spoil me). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo director is not the director of Irvine Carson. He clearly could not understand the basic intelligence, and this makes the horror over-off-the-top painful violence seem really bad - and the bad is very annoying. Even worse musical score. Leonard Rosenman is an old man of another era and does not match images in the heroic, light music screen! What was he scoring?! Great American Hero?! Worst, he completely eliminated Robocopa's theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a superman film without John Williams fanan, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is a collection of ideas that are not just gel. In the beginning we saw Roba "poking" her old wife. Fine, good idea. However, they absolutely drop it after. Then, Robo has a stupid concept of reprogramming company to be beautiful. That is thrown for 10 minutes and then immediately dropped. Or, the foolish idea that the 10-year-old drug lord reminds his son's voice - again, a weak motif that has been shown to be a little over twice and has been omitted. It can work in a comic book, but not in the film, and Frank Miller was unknowingly inexperienced and threw every idea in the kitchen sink. It does not work perfectly. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to appreciate corporate batches of this photo and personalization of the police. That's the best part of the film that's consistent with the first. However, basically, the elderly was a tough businessman to earn a profit, but at the end it was finally fair. In this picture, he is just pure evil in his desires for money and power. You can not change the letters just because of any reason. And the character of Nancy Allen in this photo is vain, and the first was essential for Robo's self-investigation. He is just as unrealistic as violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> and violence, yes violence. When I enjoy many violent, bloody films, they enjoy it and a story is about to say. Irvine cursor bits have been shot in pieces, sliced ​​into pieces, tortured for torture and tortured, and people's desire for narcotics. I do not know when he will stop. We really need to get up to every last innocent bystander (even trying to help others) to get the shot up ???? When we see bad robot shooting again and again, guess it! Instead of Mr. Karsan has proved that he has a lot of taste for this type of work and pop art has broken into pieces, it is a hateful message of violence for any young person to watch this film. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be a message and I certainly do not see rabcop films or alien or predator films. However, when you go too far and cross the line, then most of what you should do should be questioned. And for this film, he died as a result of the death of a drug addict in a narcotics drug, "It still sucks".
