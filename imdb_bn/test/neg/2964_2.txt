My wife and I both feel much better than this film. When we hired it last weekend, we were surprised that we are watching the same movie in 22 years or so ago. We both agreed that we were probably recalling the TV series, which was forced to remove the plot lines in an hour's interval. This film has cast lots of loose threads, as mentioned here by others ... basically the story line of each major character has become unsettled. <br /> <br /> Like the title song though.
