Other critics seem to hold high honors this film. To do something created by an 18-year-old movie student, I'll tell to the Bravo, but this is not the case. If you want to see a good movie about Graffee Sticks in the documentaries. It is pictured with the same quality as a digital home video. Two main characters are frustrated actors and again if it was a student film just fine. The plot follows a perfect sketch writing sketchboard graphic around Portland. He is joined by another and they scale the scale together to create the industry. Then comes the unnecessary lesbian love scene. Then there is a debate between them, which is sometimes not discussed because the film is about dialogue like Charlie Chaplin's picture. This film shows gravity street artists look their form well and shows the music beautiful but overall I will not call it as a movie.
