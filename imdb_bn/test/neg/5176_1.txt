This is probably the worst event of Kunky Gangster, which has brutalized the British film industry, because MacKay Garee Richie lock stock and two have published barrels badly. This "True Life" story by Carlton Leich (K?) Is something wrong with this genre, which is a real horror script that "Can not", "Folk Cun" and "I Will Die, I'm Fading Canning" Similarly, the two deeply identifiable cast members are similarly deeply deep in their depths. For some reasons, the film assumes that we have heard of these people and I do not answer the answers to the S-sex and we want to be interested in some less life. Why? Despite the DVD cover blogger it is not goodfellas. The story centers around football fights make bouncers a gangster, whose friends end up getting a shot. Hu is totally uncomfortable that this film is the only small plus for this movie. Through all the scenes of activity, it seems that the camera was tied with a piece of string and people were roaming and when somebody never heard of some stories and did not really matter anything, it was still a waste of time. How people think this movie is violent, though it's a great movie symbol, and although most of the great movies show violence among them, it's just an excuse to show what FX can do to the people. Overall, this film reminds the British film industry why it has been timeless, and as soon as we stop financing these unfortunate abortions better.
