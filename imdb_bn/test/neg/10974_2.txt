In 1997, during the liberation war, as a well-publicized creator of Gaia Pierce, it is surprising that Flynn could fail so badly. It's so famous that counter welding is not so right. FLYNN was a stumbler at the box office and did not end the movie screenings in Australia ... even LA foreign policy ...! In the first few minutes (probably by Guy Pierce), FLYNN from a dreary nude scene gets off from a fairly robust and interesting start. Sadly, FlyNN came out of steam after the first 35 minutes, and with the entry of Hammy Steven Burke into smuggling to New Guinea (he wanted to play the role of the film, and to play the role, he wanted the role of Matthias), the film is a television rather than a major movie biography. Believe it or not, like 70 minutes, it's annoying and you're happy to see it. But such a promise! Pius Flin! But the film created a rebellion in the box office and, unlike the bait, sank without any trace.
