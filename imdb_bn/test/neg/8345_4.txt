Volcano is set up in Los Angeles where a small earthquake is hit, the O.M. (Emergency Management Department) Mike Rocher (Tommy Lee Jones) decided to spend his vacation and decided to move inside, once he found that everything was ok but then went to the center of the earthquake where seven underground workers died. Severe heat of a fire or some kind. He is not sure what Mike could think, so he is a geologist. Amy Barnes (Ana Hech) brought things to try and explain, unfortunately after the earthquake, the huge underground river of the lava river was released and La Breta was passing through the pole, Lava was entering the city streets and going to learn the fire. Mike, his man and the emergency services are trying to stop the lava river to spend their jobs and try to save lives as much as possible ... <br /> <br /> This second big budget disaster is set by Mick Jackson's Discovery of Dent Pick (1997) With the 1997 Dunt Peak (1997), the idea of ​​an explosion volcano revolves around, before Volcano was released for only two months or more, and Dante Peak There was at least no such excellent composition, it is better at least and more effective than wolting. The script here is completely meaningless and it is not actually in reality, which appears in the underground rivers of lava and then disappears quickly, the permanent inches of different characters from the lava river are still not affected by the heat (then the man begins to melt around the metallic seats around him But he is perfectly healthy, until I know that human skin is metal Heat is not resistant, is not it?) And it continues to happen, flying helicopter will in reality be impossible), at the end of the road a simple blockage will stop lava (other roads and other aspects below), on the street A perfect groove will be able to thrive and then a huge building will run out to create a huge dam and when Kelly walks in her car to see Lava Then he goes out just like him, but for some reason only he stands there and he burns two firemen and waits for his father to save him. At this stage, his legs have been caught, despite having combined these concrete blocks in less than 20th century, he does not do such a great work that melted lava a bit and loads more like a huge building lying on Tommy Lee and his daughter. Then both are being fined after. Tommy Lee and Anne Hei, and at least among the city's officials, were romantically romantic romances, although their characters were not scary, even before they had been confronted with Tommy Lee and Anne Hey, before breaking their awesome label. Some bad texts that drag in Los Angeles together, and sometimes shameful moral moments, black people and semi-racist policemen warm each other and greet each other until finally and when he says that everyone feels the same, it is a worthy and definitely an attacker We are still trying to say what color it is and we are still at the time of crisis and we all are people We can get rid of it because it brings together people. I said, it seems that it is so bad in good movies, it is entertaining and it comes along with a decent pace, but does not expect anything in reality or any human drama. <br /> <br /> I think a film like waffle can be seen as an update to the 70's disastrous movies like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but with huge budgets working on modern influences. Nobody can stand out of it without saying good effects, and surprisingly forgotten pieces, certainly some influential explosions and there are some river streams flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but some other. Generally, the vulcan is not very exciting and sometimes funny, funny and completely ridiculous, but it does not work the way the makers work. <br /> <br /> It's a bit open with an estimated $ 90,000,000 budget box office at $ 15,000,000, it looks just fine and there is plenty of fire, but nothing is standing, and almost all the forgotten movies are vaulted. In Los Angeles, I think most of the places featured here were shot in their real-life locations. To get something better than Tasty Lee Jones, there are some deadly conversations and ridiculous pieces that go through the course. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a disaster in the sense that a disaster is a bit of a disaster in both sense. It is valuable for some strange smiles and its ridiculousness but it is not great and I do not doubt that I want to see it again.
