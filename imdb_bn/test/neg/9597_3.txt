Although many Delivered fans are delighted about his work here, I have to pass. As a socially prominent member of the British Smart Set, his British pronunciation is basically unattainable and his line text seems to be just as good, line-read, and his emoting trans-pundas. Basil Rathbone, usually a fine actor, seems full off of the killer and speaks with a weird sort of thing - something like Italian in his case, although we can not be sure. The script managed to keep its specific ethnicity hidden. He further hindered this script which is one of the oldest film diseases, which requires surgery to do anything with the nerve. The only true entertainer, Kai Francis plays an enjoyable math, which ruthlessly consume men with the Rothbone, and then spit them out. He pulls it off with his unique aplomb. He is the only living thing on the dead sea of ​​this picture.
