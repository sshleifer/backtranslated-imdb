This movie will be easy to make fun: A call girl shot by a North Korean spy in the forehead, but survives. His knowledge of bullet bound in his brain makes long, as well as for penis. His unknown, he walked away with George W. Bush's clone finger in his purse, a key that could unlock the ability to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a pen, and at least a few people will be shown up to the drama. In the past four years, I was not sure how to watch this four-year-old film in New York, but I do not really expect much. It sounds like a light and playful pink flick, but it's art-house pretension and really incredibly annoying. Many pink movies have succeeded in their artistic desires in the past, but the desires of this movie only create the time that raises tensions between sex scenes. And then sex scenes are not even good! I've seen some amazing stuff in dirty Japanese movies. I have never seen this country create anything with this neutral sex. The spice channel is more fantastic. The only beneficial thing in this film is the main actress, Amy Kurdoda. Otherwise, this genuine torture.
