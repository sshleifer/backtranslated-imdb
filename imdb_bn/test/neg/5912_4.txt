1989 is already a year where Eddie Murphy was no longer hot and soon began to forget movies. Fair enough, Murphy was also the first year to manage his film, but it was also the first and last test. Marley and Richard were great to see two best black comedians together with Pierre, even "Harlem Knights" you can not make any calls with success. Do not blame it on the actors because they each played their role as you expect them, even if you are again facing Marie-Lisa. The worst thing from "Harlem Night" is both the scene and its terrible decors. Everything is set in the booming twentieth century and everyone has their profits from the forbidden club. Sugar Ray (Priyar) and her adopted son Kiki (Murphy) are collecting 10000 dollars a day easily, but they must soon come around the corner to demand their share of public and corrupt police cookies. Sugar and Quicksi do not pay their money and have those who have their own plans. You can certainly see "Harlem Night's", but if you hear the name of the moment, then avoid it well, because there is nothing more than paranoid to see some good joke after this movie.
