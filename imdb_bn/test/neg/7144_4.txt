I finally hired this video to search for it for a number of months. Initially, I just wanted to see it because I was outside and outside Blue Pearson fan (Patrick, Jobel's boyfriend, lead). However, the film is standing very well without taking the lead (though she is doing herself very well in this movie, she is still featured by three main female characters). It's a cruel, intense film, like Brights well-sorted - clearly a "chick flick" and it gives the discontinued setting almost "wuthering heights" amour to the movie. The movie is full of tension and finish, shiny, yet inevitable. I'm glad I saw it, it was worth the wait
