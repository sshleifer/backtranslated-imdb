There are many errors with this movie which some are hard to choose. Let's begin with silly and annoying songs. Like "raid little cowboy", it only made Clinton Spilsbury's city-slicar look stronger. The songs of the musical accompaniment of the intelligent kid running in the background of the movie hit any credibility or speed for the story. <br /> <br /> I saw the media campaign before the film was released, and I saw Clinton that Spielberi was in interviews with several TV shows and had very soft, sweet, lilting voice. His body language is not exactly what Clintton Moore and Lon Ronger TV series fans remember. SpielSabri performs like a debut after issuing a ban on producers for forbidding to attend other events like Contecures and Real Lone Ranger, and Clayton Moore does not help things in conversation. Client Moore was not allowed to sign as "Client Moore, The Lone Ranger". He could only sign as "Masked Man". This move was incredibly linked to SpitzSabir's impressive attitude to the unrealistic propaganda campaign, which very quickly said that the movie will be forgotten after the movie is out! Sadly, despite the film's total flop, the company owned by The Lone Ranger declined to lift their injections against Claire Moore, and she was not allowed to sign anything other than "Maaked Man". "And she could not have her black mask in any public appearance. In Spilsbury's diva personality and negative publicity in the movie, it certainly does not help to make a good impression on the public. The film was finally published a few weeks ago, the news spread that The voices of the film's Spellbirds were dubbed by James Keech because the producers thought that Spielbear It was not as strong as Savoy, who was the last nail in the coffin of this era and comedies. <br /> <br /> But Murray Haggard described his way through this film. Clearly, the producers hoped The hoodwinker of Haggard (one of the country's outdoor outlets) adds credibility to The Lone Ranger in Spilsbury. Jagger's description was just another annoyance that had to deal with the audience. Sometimes Haggard rhymes on his description, and it sounds like some weird Kiddie movie. Combine the accompanying descriptions of "Ride Little Cowboy" songs and any credibility of Spilsby is destroyed by Haggard and Soundtrack can be done. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horses and others, as mentioned, had a lot more personality than the Horse Spilsbury. In fact, because of Spilowsbari's alleged attitude during Philippine, it seems that more talk and screen time were given to Horse than the expectations of Tonto. Tonto takes charge and is often the leader of Lone Ranger instead. I hope (or hopefully) Billy will create a video like Jack Tanto's brother (this will make the movie even better). The horse is not even more interesting than Spilsbury, but he also said and has a better view. Stealing the Show from SpellSabby is probably an event in Horses. However, since the film was so bad, the horse did not get much recognition. In spite of Spilsbury, Horse's film industry has a very productive job. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last negative of this movie is the Lone Ranger Powder Blue Fest. The component that was selected for Spielsebird was usually the naturally wedded client Moore's look. Only the spellbayer's color choice shows more brilliance in its role. The comic book version also showed red shirts and black pants to The Lone Ranger and the alternate option helped spielsebare to look more firmly as The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Supporting casts mostly match their performance. They all saw that they were working on the mountain of television and nobody thought of being very believable. Even Villeneuve, Covendish lost his edge because of the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. He has not only played a terrible act, but it is clear that the production and the public have badly affected any opportunity for the poor and the poor. Even if he is a great replacement for Claire Moore, I doubt that this film has done well due to other reasons. Standing in it, this film is a sad way funny.
