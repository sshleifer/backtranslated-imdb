I thought I could get a few smiles from this long painted film, but sadly disappointed. Almost all of the filmmakers are trying to get a pass grade, spending most of their time, even trying to open a book or accomplish something. The film depicts Teacher and Principal Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs Stark), "Labor Painter", 2000 as completely stupid. I know it seems to be a comedy, but it does not make me laugh and I think the whole movie was full time! However, all the actors gave excellent performances and it was a tough task to try to make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie! College is the only way to study well for quality education!
