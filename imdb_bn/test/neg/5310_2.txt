That movie was completely amusing when it was slightly flawed. About half an hour to cool, I started to start the Hollywood Homeside Flashback. But guess what? This is bad. Even the number of dances is bad. I like most of this movie cast, so it seems bad for me to write negative reviews but I feel compelled. Rock, Andrea 3000, and Vince Von had a comedy. Others began to determine who was acting in a movie. I think Travolta is very bad because he came from the same movie with the same Chilean Palmer of Git Short. She was completely consistent in the role, but the character of this movie is so different from the original that the character stick out like a Orthodox thumb. I'm going to give this movie 4/10 because I like actors so much but there is a conversation about a specific song in the movie that I do not believe that the actor really says it. If you want to go to film this weekend then there should still be some Oscars. That would be a good way to spend your time.
