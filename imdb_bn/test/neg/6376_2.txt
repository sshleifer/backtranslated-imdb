First, the title "Daily" is a LIE. <br /> <br /> Every "Daily Show" program is opened with an on-screen visual on the date created, after which a pause and opening announcement is made. For many days when they are reusing a daily show, they slip the tape and OMIT the date and start with the announcement of the opening, the show will give a new impression. That's a lie. There is no mention of it being a rebroadcast. And that sort of shit is a small indicator of how sticky and fraudulent this show is. <br /> <br /> Also, it is only 4 nights a week It's mostly "not daily" - Monday to Friday - Another disappointment but I'm grateful. <br /> <br /> It is very sad that many foolish youngsters use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. It gives them unfortunately ignorant and worse - misrepresented facts. <br /> <br /> Although it is liberally leftist, though politically, this event can sometimes be fun. However, its authenticity is less. Facts and information often finesse the authors to fit the agendas. Where is the story gone and it is often difficult to start writing fiction and comedy. The results are designed to persuade and influence pre-digestion, re-established information. It is called "propaganda". <br /> <br /> Remote interviews have been significantly compressed. <br /> <br /> When it really bash God and Christians, then I'll lose - which often it does. However, you will not hear anything unusual anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If John Stewart and Company attack anyone other than Christians, it would be considered a offensive attack. Explain the source of the name in the credit.
