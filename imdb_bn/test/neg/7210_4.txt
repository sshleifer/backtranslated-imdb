The only sequel to the classic Roadhouse's only name is the DEA agent (John Shake) is coming to rescue his uncle (Will Patan), when the uncle assaulted by local drug drugs, led by Wooden Indian actor Jack Busey. The gang girl wants to take the people for the next time. Patrick Swayze is sorely missed here. Schaech is not a lonely actor and a donkey kitten believer as legal. Here the battles are intermediate and almost as strong or rogue as the fight in the Roadhouse. The last is equally weak Some handsome women keep things away for a while. There is a great fight between Daisy Duck-type, which works smoothly with both boxing and weapons, and a painful child of Bushy who works smoothly with sharp application. Shake colleague was wearing a small dress at the beginning, but unfortunately he never came back to the film. very bad. She did my full attention to dance a short lap for Schaech. If nothing else happens, Roadhouse 2 is closed with a strip club scene which is heard like a real strip club, in a rare case of a movie. The rest of the time is wasted.
