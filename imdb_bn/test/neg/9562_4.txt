The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eating dogs where a gangster will be killed to show a sign of weakness because they are responsible. I have no problem with showing Ganesar's human body, but soft, ridiculous, buggy goes far away from male. The film is enjoyable but not only light entertainment and the biodiversity of a person who is exciting but extremely dangerous and horrible. <br /> <br /> Acting is all good and direction is very difficult. Position and era are very well represented and the theme is very interesting. Did Bagzi really want to kill Musulini?
