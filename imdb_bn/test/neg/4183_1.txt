This ... thing. Oh god this thing I can not even call it a movie. Something that is something in a movie Go anywhere. There is something like a plot or something similar. I do not know how I do it. I really do not. First I tell the worst movie ever in the dark field. And I thought it was Then the pirate island of Ghost Island proves me wrong. And now, in the third row, another film crosses the responsibility and duties to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (laughter) Okay. Dark Harvest 2: Make. The Lord is awesome Let me break it for you. The male sensory girl has been in danger through some of her witch mental powers from her law 2 Poppron, and apparently to find them on the field of monkey. It is, of course, the smallest underground area of ​​all existence, which is the size of the crystal, the ear children, and the size of the swirled Karnaphuld. The main character, whose name is Shami (the awesome name BTW) then goes through a corn field .... Some ghosts find girls, talk to them, and ... drive through a corn field. Dig a time ... and run through a corn field. And incredibly sad things? I'm not really going to drop anything. That's mostly the whole movie. The only thing I can find out is how do they go after two policemen who want to arrest him ... I do not know. Pretends to be an actor. I do not care by this point. She gets away and is in police-by some killer offscreen. Holy crap is a killer? Apparently yes he started around 4/5 movies. But wait! Then he run away for a while and there, you guessed it, running through more butter fields and digging. Then he would save his daughter, where is the end. Hussahah <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this movie is that it is boring. It's incredibly, loyalty, annoying, annoying. I can not explain how these events brutally dull. Nothing is, the letter is as interesting as a root canal, and it's just a few and a half. The only good thing to come out of this movie was that we got our illumination due to the state of near-nervousness in front of us and my friends to enter the overdrive to keep us alive the effects of narcotics on our moment. During the upcoming fest, I made the wall more enjoyable and when my friend is a fraud, he found a new passion for violently smiling while floating on all the floors. This is the madness sort of bring to this movie. It's just not bad. It's bad for your health. The cover looks awesome with a horror SquareCro killer photo that I would consider to be a dress for a totally awkward voice, but it was always the most confusing box. It does not fool you! Do not watch this movie. See a good corn cinema. No movie about corn is good. Just do not get it to you! No! 0 out of 10
