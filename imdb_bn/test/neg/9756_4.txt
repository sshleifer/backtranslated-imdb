I'm going to the film about the right prospect, I've liked this movie a bit. Like most of the critics, I totally agree that the plot was thin, clipped and I could predict each plot twist from the beginning of the film. However, the dancing sequences were very well done and I really enjoyed the combination of classical and hip-hop dance (which both I enjoy watching)). The movie music / soundtrack was also very good, which was more portable in the "drama" scene. The Lead (Zenna Dewan and Channing Tutam) was right as an actor, but their dances throughout the movie were impressive and messaging. <br /> <br /> For everyone, if you want to see good dance sequences then the movie is valuable, and this movie is much better than "You have delivered" in terms of plots and plays. Then again, that does not say much, is not it? = P.
