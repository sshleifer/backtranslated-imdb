The sad and unnecessary sequel from an extraordinary classic. An American Werewolf in London, regardless of, a jewel of a movie: ridiculous, tragic, romance levels and very, very British, I would rather stand it and agree to save the queen while filming ends. Then this hatred came. You know that when you become genuinely unhappy, you will be in real trouble, when you are killed you are happy and really start enjoying Lycanthrope. Tell the truth, folks, I had lost almost half way through this CGIed travesty before living and turning off the bend. Absolutely unfortunate and some time a garbage waste.
