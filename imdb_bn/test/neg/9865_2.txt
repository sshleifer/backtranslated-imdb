Yes! This movie was cast, impact, indifference, excitement, and of course, all the way to being fantastic was bad and we all know that four heroes were a little more colorful than these new four, but it still has a fantastic burqa like this, a real stupid trash Which I knew if anyone did not want to see it, I am sure that 3 or 4 good movies can be made with the budget, but not I am very pleased that this year the new version has fully demonstrated how best to be made with four good stories, Jessica Alla is one of the best actors of my favorite actors, otherwise she completely forgot it but thanks. The new one was nice when I saw with my friends in the movie but this old boom has to go.
