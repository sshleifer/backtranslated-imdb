This is a parody. This means that they do not have any characters, these are the most readily available, and the movie relies entirely on the quality of Jokes. <br /> <br /> There are several good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones. If anyone wants to be fooled by all the conversations, have fun. <br /> <br /> You see, American Pie 2, My Favorite Teenage Movie It contains a lot of real real characters. Perhaps joke is vain, but there are some types of people in all. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. Jokes really fun! This movie is not: Every scene is clearly arranged as pure parody, so there is no character here, so there is really no room for any sympathy. Very, you know the original movie, you know the whole scene in advance. Not very funny and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from being completely disturbed, where in reality I was watching the movie where I was from some teenage comments. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my personal highlights of the movie were a very small appearance of Melissa Joan Heart in a scene. Sigh He is very cool, he can not be real. Hmmm, the whole movie is worth?
