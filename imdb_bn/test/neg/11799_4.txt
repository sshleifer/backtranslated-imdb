Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and imaginative film. I want to see all his pictures. I did not find it for 3 years, unless I unexpectedly found it on YouTube. To speak the truth, I want to see more ghosts and less discussion here. It seems that Ted's crisis was in 1999-2001, probably money. This time, its features show more like a few budget drop mesh junk films. But I did not claim to be bad manager at this time. Everything happens. The last few have some nice unclear details and mysteries, but the whole film was a long relentless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Only true fans of TED <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
