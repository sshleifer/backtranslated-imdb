A good friend of mine said, "A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." There are exceptions: intelligence agencies It's a pretty simple movie I've ever seen. It's worse than plan 9, worse than UCA flat. It's terrible. Talking monkey gets old after about three minutes in the gag, and I have all that has faith. Make sure that you have a bunch of people around Banana, the worst movie ever to revive after you go into toxic shock ever since.
