I saw this movie on a public service channel yesterday. They were notified of it as a terrible movie, and so I was drawn to see it, and I was not given down. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19 years old to try to uncover the legend of Bearserker Vikings, the castle of Denmark, to go to a excavation site in an old Victoring. Something strange happened: there is something in the jungle, and people are disappearing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> There were so many places in the movie where the Hollywood-style exceeds the Danish reality. It really played and drama look ludicrous in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You will not interact with characters around them. It feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark and it removes the credibility of the movie. At one point when you hear "Old Denmark", it sounds like modern day Swedish. Really bad research, considering the director from Denmark. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Where you are Nomatter, the sea is 50 km more and the civilization does not have 500 meters. And if you are in a fortress, going to be tourists everywhere. We can see many visits to the forest of the film, and sometimes, we can see that the North American vegetation (?) Seems like the story did not appeal to me properly because perhaps the acting was so bad. When the characters first look bog animals, they are not even afraid. I guess their performance skills were insufficient to show realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected turn, but I did not really care because it did not affect me. <br /> <br /> The caterpillars were cheap, but they were scared. Unfortunately, they fail, when we reach the castle castle, the forest stands out to get them to look their best. Also, there is no horrific view, because bog animals are mostly standing around. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In violation of the facts, the film is your ideal b-glance. I guess people from other countries can enjoy it. Unless you know the reality, it does not matter. Just as I think America looks like a big action film set, everyone can think of Denmark as a forest with a fortress .. and some living people have a crotch ..
