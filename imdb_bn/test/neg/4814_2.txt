Get rid of stupid lines that you want to see in such a stupid activity with a dead heroes. Vietnam Sanders is extracted an extract from Vietnam by his friend Harry Quotter but captured himself by the enemy. Ten years faster and Harry now has brain-controlled Russian operators in the brain. His new Russian high profile acted in a rivalry with Ivan Nicholson's inconsistency, which I did not try once to talk to Russian pronunciation, but with his stained teeth, it is similar to another gas station assistant in Kentucky. Even more strange is that he was a dialogue coach for this photo. Soon William CIA has been re-appointed for Harry's search. He is Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon he is blowing half of South America. Some scenes are so terrible that the jaw is so surprising that this movie has no culture at all. Suddenly creating love in the forest by William and Barbara is one of the scenes I've ever heard the most incomparable Caterweling background music. Who will cut the nude in the middle of the South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the last theme of blood in Satan's cloak. No dead heroes always lead multiple murders of one shot as a magic bullet movie champion. In one scene, Harry throws his rifle behind a rock and kills seven people. I had to rebwind it and count it. It's hard to find a movie that has recently gotten full HD treatment by MGM Track this movie and rush it to see it silently.
