This good-man-versus-the-illegal-stent story set in 19th century Russia was an attempt to extend Steve Reeves's career beyond the "Hercules" films. However, even after wearing different clothes, it is still a "Hercules" film, usually with the Stilled Dialogues, Haedzed dubbing and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there are many steps, the speed is very flashy, and Revis gets another scene in the scene where he torn to the waist, tied with a rope, and gave a strong whip, which does not need to be said, there is little defensive character effect.
