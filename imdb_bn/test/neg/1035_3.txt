A frustrating documentary. Louis Kan's son, who saw his father only a young man, because he was the only member of his father's three separate families, searched for his architecture, and tried to find out more about his father. His life It sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but it ends flat and unintentionally. Sadly, the fundamental problem is that Katha's son Nathaniel is not just one of the heroes of the film --- he is also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Both Nathaniel seem very inexperienced and very close to both of them to work well in these roles. In addition, he feels like a nice enough guy, he does not have much screen presence, so he wears the only constant of film. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also came in an unnecessary and amateur amateur interview --- There are many points in which an interview gives an interesting or provocative statement, and the camera gives a little more than Nantanial's shaking and shaking a shot. And a kind of horrible "Uh-ho," that she is afraid that she has something to say about the reaction. Occasionally, I feel embarrassed to see people who were really interesting to talk about (who at least had some good time with their time) talk that they were in the interview with someone who was going to rely on them. Conversation directly. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's dual role seems to be more to hurt the film than to help both the documentary and lost boy. One of the senses that some interviews are really reluctant to talk about Kan's personality and the negative aspects of the career, perhaps it is not clear from Nathaniel because he wants to dig into the truth or just want to hear a wonderful story about his father - perhaps his hope will be that his The father really cared more than Nathaniel and his mother. As an interview his passive system may directly stem from this conflict. The only person in Nathaniel pushed his own mother, but the conversations do not offer much in terms of feeling bad kids' plays (you do not intend, do not you?) And help us understand (or nathaniel) ears or people around them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What the interviewers can contribute is Thinking more about who is standing away from the material, and one hope, cut out the parts of the documentary process that do not work, such as the strange segment of people claiming to do not work (which seems to indicate that Nathaniel is being taken to a selfish state ) Or the whole bite of hooking with the first cousin of the ear, who had nothing to add to the ear or nathaniel. Nike Bar Nathaniel tells us that he is standing near him or near a Kahan Building, Buthallah, the strangers told his father as a designer. (Ahhah, haha.) That's nice, sir, Umme? I have to go now.) I understand why these things can be important for Nathaniel and the documentary process can sometimes be interesting, but this is an example when the documentary can be personal. <br /> <br /> On one hand, I thought that the writing for the film was great! (However, for me, the greatest moment was for me when during the Kimblee Art Museum tour, compared with the voice-over corner architecture and the fifth symphony of Beethoven. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a good documentary about him. Search for a parent Nathaniel Rati sympathetic, he did not know, but I'm not sure that this is a funny story. This film does not work so well.
