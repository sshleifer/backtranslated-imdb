Changes in speed for movement in Angel; Monochrome, mawkish and rather medieval. It has been well-documented on Paris's location, but the subtitle readers must remember: faster dialogue and good cinematography can create frustration. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life." Despite its shared themes (Divine Intervention, suicide, relationship of angel / death takes place), Uson nothing to enlighten or inspire us Even the best acting, lively moments, descend into the feeling of fast toe-fingering. <br /> <br /> The film's erratic ideology irritates; The respect and respect for the soul has gradually diminished by its own violent and rebellious behavior; a "happy ending" that refuses to surrender and refuse from the helpless motto of helotas from helplessness and freedom. <br /> Ray: It looks very beautiful but delusional moral And philosophical messages are bright, where it should be bright 4/10
