Here the rave reviews of this movie will not pay any attention. It's the worst movie in Van Dane and I've seen the worst scenes of any kind. It will appeal to anyone without any depth, for which no more than gunfight and explosion will be required. Seeing it being operated by Peter Hyams, I realized that Peter is not a talent as a director, but explosion and filming are very good. However, as well as other elements of the movie needed; For example, a story. This one was not there. It can explain the horror of some recent movies of Mr. Hyams, it's actually better than that. <br /> <br /> Some people can not help thinking that something is behind the camera.
