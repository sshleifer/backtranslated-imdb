Jesus Franco was hurt or missed in his films and I would say it was a miss, that is, if you are not in the whole riddle. I would say that people have an eye for good shots, even if it involves flat women with machine guns even silhouetted against the sea. It's quite ridiculous and terrible acting, but it's about acting at least. And what about it? Well, this is about 102 minutes of lesbianism, for a clear reason the women of the hot sun are picking and pavement, and just as many pillars as you can stand. Most notable (?) Is a scene that involves a young girl who is tied to the chair and a visually German Shepherd, and what is happening is simply devoted (thanks) This is probably a scene I could have besides. As one of the franco movies I will rank it with tender flashes, I'm not in my collection, but the music is jazz and fun. 10 out of 4, YCCH
