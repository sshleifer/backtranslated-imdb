First off, I saw another critic, this movie was "fantastic". Nothing can be true! This movie is full junk !!! A moronic horror comedy that's not even a little funny !! This does not mean that it is so bad that it is not good because it is not good. It is total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here I see the DVD waste. A group of friends get together on a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video. They grab the mother and father's video camera and bring the scene to the scene. They all get a big stick outside the camera to see their mugs. They think that if they think they are funny, they would all be funny. Well, they're wrong. This backyard home video is garbage. "Acting" and comedic effects are frustrating, but I can assume that this is nothing but a home video. <br /> <br /> From a brilliant side, I have taken out this feeling that someone who wants to make a movie is someone outside. If these people make their movies and are released on the DVD, then one can do it! <br /> <br /> 0/10 - Save your money.
