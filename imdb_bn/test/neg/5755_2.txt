There was a solid film to track back to Frogtown. Well, I did that mission and it was sitting on the roof for a good time. Wish it to be kept that way! First of all, Sam Hell is certainly not Rudy Piper. She is replaced by a darling with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft spoken for the part! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. Here, he was captured three times! What kind of a hero is that?! Spangle was replaced here by another actress as well. Why do we get different characters here? This was stupid! This movie is a low fadino star and he's not even hero. In the common sense, Louake Hero is the protagonist of the film! Bad effects, poor acting, and only a forgotten film. Funny as they take a shot at Nizna Turtle 2 with the whole concert scene of this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to return to Frogtown, but when I started the war scene I cringed. This cartoon is like 3 gold! Avoid it or you'll be a singer "Middle, Green, Turtle TV Dinner!"
