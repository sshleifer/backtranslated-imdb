MST3K sheets. It's so bad that it's really worth seeing. There are some ridiculous things in it, such as the mysterious device that seems to be working for the whole movie, which turns out to be a small helicopter that carries a gun like a carrying machine and fires. Brought by a bag of balloons (they were kind of released at the political conference). That sort of many other wonderful touches. Star Charlie Shane One scene where he spent five minutes recording a conversation, only accidentally dropping the microscope into the pothomic river. If they drop Emilio Estevez into something that has never happened.
