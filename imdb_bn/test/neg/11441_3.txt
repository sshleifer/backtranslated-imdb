Not as bad as "nails" of 1992 (where Hooper plays a "restless" police) but quite bad. How could a movie with such a big cast be so wrong? This image managed to find a way out. The story was a bit stupid and Hooper's side seemed like never before. Long shots at the beginning were all boring. Lots of nonsense views with lots of meaningless dialogue.
