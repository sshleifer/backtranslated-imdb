When I and my GF went to see this movie, I did not know what to expect, but he assured me that it was a good review. So I went along with it. We got the movie and bought a ticket and went to the screen. After waiting for a while, some people did not get the door waiting for the film to start. I was generally very suspicious to get at least a few people in a film screening. The film started to last and we were sitting there. During the very little dialogue and very "aunty" moody scenes I started to understand why we were the only man there. It was controversial with the original story of a skate park from the original story to kids, the story itself did not make any sense. The child committed the crime when he committed the crime and if he did, then there is no answer to any letter, and if you wrote that letter you should not feel guilty, he should be punished. There was no point in this film. I have no idea why we did not get our money back through the film. I try to give it a chance to guess it. There was little idea in this film, and execution was executed. The writer and director and everyone who created this movie only have to understand what they are doing and stopped. It's an hour plus that I'll never get back. I'm sorry for anyone who liked this movie, but ... it's so terrible, I'm really really really bad. Oh well at least I will not have to do it again.
