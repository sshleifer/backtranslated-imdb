I did not buy this movie for my comedy price, I could not find it a bit fun, but so f ****** sad and lame it is incredible. I gave a friend for Christmas which was quite funny (on my side) I recently heard that he saw it and told me that I'm a ** ehol! There is nothing more frustrating than an over-light, dramatic, unexpectedly visible scene where the camera is sitting on a tripod and not moved ... The film's work is truly kind, and I can not only see this movie ! !!!!!!!
