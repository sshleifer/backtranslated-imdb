What disturbs me with such so-called 'science' programs, is that it has been presented as a fact that millions of 'dinosaurs' lived a year ago. First of all, no one can even test scientific evidence to prove that the world is billions / million years old. This is a shallow theory based on the wrong radiological dating process with the vast concept of evolution in the evolutionary vessel. Second, no one can prove that evolution happened. All Darwin's missing links are still missing! If you look at any fossil in the world or in the world, they are a specific kind of creature like dogs or cats. No one found the skeleton skeleton or turned into a dinosaur bird in the example presented in this series. <br /> <br /> It's a sudden hogwash. There is no evidence that the Santa Claus is transforming a creature from another type of creature. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are attempts to remove the universe and everything in it. <br /> <br /> This series is not science. This is a religious worldview that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is the science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a science fiction program that decides to accept it as a science fiction program, then see Star Trek or Star Wars.
