I had an unfortunate experience of frustration over the preview for this movie and it seemed as if it could be interesting. I am a fan of two main actors, and I even consider Matloff unexpectedly attractive, but it can not compensate for the film's droning plot. This movie tries to make social comments and be intelligent cute. I get the viewers explicitly on the socialist message, but the process must be enjoyed. Personally, how bad the movie is, I can not stop it in the middle. Some bad movies drive me to finish, but I often regret it. This is one of them ...
