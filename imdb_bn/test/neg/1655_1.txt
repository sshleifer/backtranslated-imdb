I have seen some of the worst pieces in these movies. This is my first review topic, so you can say that I have to hate this image. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I like my serious movie. I do not like Hollywood very much, I love French, Italian, Offbat America or anything that tries to sense. <br /> <br /> But it was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was totally unbelievable, although the director seemed to hang everything in the real sense. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to suggest him. Does he smoke for cold or show us his anger? This man is meant to be a former guilty mafia lawyer for the sake of goodness. Are we aiming for more care because he can meet with the most unexpected person? And he smokes ... so his deep personal issues should be there. It's the best pop psychology. At the final moment, I was almost delighted to bury the cement. The best place for him. And I was just about that good view. Or maybe it was because it was near the final credit <br /> <br /> 3 The main character from the beautiful girl is completely tired and incredible interest. She was only there because beautiful girls always have a deep and meaningful personality (shown by old smoking) related to old, sex relationships with an old man. It happens all the time. That's really bad film <br /> <br /> 4. The speed was so lead. I like the slow, I like carefully. But this was just death. <br /> <br /> There is a bunch of 5-50 other things that I can not really bother to write. <br /> <br /> terrible.
