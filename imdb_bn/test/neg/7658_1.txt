Actually this was not something funny about monstrosity !! This movie was a complete hatred. The miracle of this movie almost wants to vomit me! I think the people responsible for this movie have taken advantage of the viewers of their philosophy. They have taken a relatively decent movie series (I said good, not good !!) and tried to trim their money in their pockets. Making the aircraft! Hollywood was a way to create for this crappy flick. The worst part about this is that in 1979 no one could understand the Asynine events of this movie (like Concord's door closed some unrealistic heights or Patrols to close a window in Mach 2 to avoid a Nouvelier Warhead??!? ... .What did they think ?? ?) It was completely unrealistic or they just care! I think it's two modern This "film" writer and director, if you want to call it, really try to dry the airport dynasty with this nasty!
