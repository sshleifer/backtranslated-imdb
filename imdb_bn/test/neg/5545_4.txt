Academy Award winning actress Sidney Potier's "Field Lily" starred in the role of Lieutenant Virgil Teab of the 1967 Oscar winner's best film "The Hit of the Night"; Gordon Douglas's tired, unclear series "They call me Mrs. T.B.", "Which is a compromise volunteer with Rod Steiger." Clearly, Robert D. Web of "Bulit" scenes Alan R. Trustman and "Cape Fear" close the game. When they wrote this expected police systematic Potbly. The conversation is satirical and no letter is interesting not even the main sign In fact, it is seen in Virgil's "Night of Hit In", because things have changed quite a bit, he worked as a genocide detective for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department. "They call me Mr. Tibbas," our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department, and his wife , Valerie (repeatedly McNiaire "a change of habit"), and a family, a young rebel son, Andy (George Spell "The Necked Kiss"), and a small dot girl, Ada (spell Wanda) "Hickey and Bogus"). There is no time for him to spend with him because he runs a middle blue headgear and his wife hanging down the house and hovers on their two children. Literally, there is no wonder why this pedestrian kill mystery. In fact, the best thing about "they call me Mrs TBS" is the memorable opening theme of Queen's Jones horror Orchestra Soundtrack, more memorable than this forgotten crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Everything starts exciting with the struggle. Prostitution, Linda Town of Joy Sturges ("The Advisers"), died due to the death of bedroom bedroom of her invisible invader. Apartment colleague Melie Williamson (Juan Hernandez of "The Intruder in the Dust") entered the apartment of Joy and threw him on a dead body with bloody forehead. He briefly presented the statue and later put it on the floor and told the apartment's superintendent Rice Waden ("License to Kill" Anthony Jereb), and Waden mails Melie and Dollar phone and sends him packing. Then, Wieden Bannem informed the SFPD that the popular minister Logan Sharp ("Nevada Smith's Martin Landau") beat Joy and leaving Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corrie of "Truth Grit") ordered TBS to conduct the case; It seems that both Tibbas and Sharp have known each other for 18 years. Naturally, Tibb's wife Valerie can not believe that well-known, politically active missionaries commit such crimes. In the film context, it should be noted that when Tibbas and police study the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen', in the early 1970's, a controversial word in the film is notable. <br /> <br />> TibbS questions that Waden is suspected of being a drug crusher or a pump. Waden explains that he has no record with Joey Sturges because he is sublabeling another realty company's apartment. The TBS real estate company and the realtor Woody Garfield (Ed Ansar of "JFK") traveled away and basically O and J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a long but satisfying pursuit. When TBis proves that did not kill Woody Joy, he was ready to apply for the holiday with his disgruntled wife Marz (Penelope's "Narma Crane"), she publicly requested to pay a hooker to stay in an apartment. <br /> < br /> <br /> Tibbas keeps hold of handmade mailie and cleans him from crime, then he goes after Wadeon. Thankfully, for our Tubbs, our hero caught an evil seed in the middle of a drug business. Wadeon attacks a Tibbons pregnant, but Tibbas disputes with her for a short time before walking after long after the winters. Finally, he kept Wadden in the corner of an underground parking garage and they shot it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our hero wants to clean his house. When Andy denies, she spies him three times on the jaw. The birth scenario of this child may not always be operated today in the 1970's. At the end of the film, such as the family order, Tibet is seen walking with his wife and children. There are about the welfare of Valerie and Virgil in the conflict and how its long hours have affected them on the job. <br /> <br /> Directed in director Gordon Douglas able fashion. Surprisingly, for a movie released in 1970, filmmakers do not play the race card. In one case, when TBS searches for African-American-owned Billiard Parker, we see a mixed species of birds mixed with heroes, when they get melody and spend leaves with them. <br /> <br /> Together they call me "Miss Tubbs" in the nighttime heat "a poor follower." You think, Poitier distributes another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. All sets of fake looks and many physical violence Not: There's an underground parking lot shot out which is not long and does not end a fight.Jones is beyond the basic jazz score, the only surprise ?? And it's really a convenient challenge. Does not qualify as a big surprise to ??. Donald Medford "The Organization" The second, more action-packed as Siegel, "Mr. tibasa me" followed.
