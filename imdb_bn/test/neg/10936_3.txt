I went with low expectations in this movie, known as Owy Bowle's successor and playboy writer as a film director, and I was still frustrated. Uwe Boll finds out a way to make every movie involving bad and bad. The overall idea was not bad, a person who lacks his life as a serious killer as a stock broker. But the problem of the film is not in it, she goes directly to the serial killer from the stock broker. The film does not have a name, and I can see why, after seeing the film, I can not see why such an actor wants to be involved in this film. Anyone turned it down on their employees a favor. And if you do not see it, please do yourself and do it. <br /> <br /> I give 3 of 10 out of the Santimini
