Northbourne Abbey is not my novel, Jane Austen, but its character. This is not the movie. Some of its characters have names like this, but the story has changed greatly, and the whole of Austen Canon's most sweet people (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley's place is proud) becomes stupid and hired creep. One or two are completely introduced to the external character, and a palpable air of corseted distortion hangs it all over. I was very frustrated at seeing the first time in the war of liberation in 1986; Even today, it is top of the list of movies where they insult books based. Even Robert Hardie fans have to give it a wide spectrum. There is nothing in it, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend it.
