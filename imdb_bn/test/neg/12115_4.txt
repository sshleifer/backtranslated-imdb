The children's story is ripped off a long Hollywood movie, terrible acting, Chess dialogue, and most "up-to-parameters" sex scenes. It's just another great softcore parody! I've enjoyed this photo extensively! Of course acting is terrible, but part of that fun! The storyline is ridiculous, but some things must definitely be offered when the girls and girls of the story revolve around the scene. And because it was only softcore (no penetration) sexual scenes were a little soft. But this is the great god of short-lived Russian Meyers, who says "whatever goes under the waist really carries." I do not know whether I agree with Mr. Myers, but for what this ... this flicker gives me half-an-hour entertainment. I could give it a C +, if it could be a solid B they could see more Cast Meyers actors like girls. VAVoom! VAVoom! ~
