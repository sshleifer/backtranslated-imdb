Truly terrible movies, bad edits, horror lighting, scary dialogue and scrappy screenplay. <br /> <br /> You can not even see what is happening at the moment that this light has become so bad, I even tried to play opposite. And brightness so I could see something but it did not help. <br /> <br /> They have found a breech script, the character development is very horrible and when you rarely expect much from the Jane Cloud, Van Damme directed this movie to hit all at once. Directing and editing is very scary, the whole film follows a very tedious routine and every escape fails because it gets sidelined by such plots. . It's just untrue, weak. <br /> <br /> It does not have to say anything other than really bad and there is nothing like the previous work of Genie Cloud Van Dam. <br /> <br /> Blake, definitely the word "blame" me on this film failed.
