The film starts well enough. This is a really horrific scene, killing mother and father due to some frustrations escaping from law, and separating the innocent family living in a remote country hut. The young girl only managed to escape with the help of a mysterious speaker, when she killed two aggressors, when she covered the lower stairs. Then, after 15 years we took care of him as a drug-addicted student as a supernatural researcher living with his supernatural food and a mysterious reddish-blooded man. He has no real friends, has been raped with almost one party and has odd views which nobody else can see. So yes, life is grand. When they got into a quarrel with his mother's sister, they became more pleasurable, later, after suspected cases died in the bathroom, and 11 of their foreheads were scratched. Hmm, I wonder who the chief suspect would be? These are followed after the rapid death, all our heroin has been in bad terms with them before their links to their relationship. Could he be a criminal, or can the explanation be more authoritarian? Source: If you are thinking of a former, you picked up the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the right one, brief perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move fast in the good part, the sense that I was missing was safe but something like a middle-class suspense potboiler. But the first ten minutes took me, and I decided to give it a chance. I was pretty happy: it was definitely not an excellent composition but the acting was good enough and the script throws up the unlocking situations that I look forward to finding solutions. Well, in 45 minutes, I realized that my character started to rotate in a long sequence where the main character is rotating the library, not doing anything. Then we got a cheap fear, with one hour's quarter next to Godladegouk and her boyfriend's new lotus about abnormalities. Things got worse, like the promised start was thrown out of the window, because we got a strange plot kick after each other, then there have been such anti-climatic events that promised to the moon and instead made an old radioactive climate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a The canter starts and ends with a whale, it is not just frustrating, it is frustrating. How can there be something that begins to happen so much so committed? I do not know, and I do not care specifically. I will later suggest authors and directors: do not spend 5 weeks to write the first part of your scrapplatform, the rest will take 5 minutes to finish. When you see your project as extremist here, watch these things in the final product ... 3/10
