A complete zero out of four The worst seems to be the worst: the awful. Indeed, more sounds come to mind: ridiculous, third rate, and terrible. It seems to be one of Amitabh's worst movies, he is beside the cheap leather jacket and equally cheap tinsel foil Zoro-style masks as well. <br /> <br /> The film is an ancient Persian or Arabic characteristic non-historian for an Indian movie. As mentioned above, 400 years ago, there was no K-Mart leather jacket with Velero Straps, until all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi is cross-dressing her patent in this film. Far from being fun, it is very embarrassing to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And no match for shoddy acting.
