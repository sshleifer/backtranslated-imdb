Imagine how it was for John Agar. One of Hollywood's handsome leading men. Shirley Temple married for five years. She herself is doing movies like this. I think him "tarantula" where he was not half bad. Unfortunately, this film has nothing to recommend. The monster is reluctant and unable to remain silent. Police boring. Things are annoying. The plot is stupid People run around The fact that plots do nothing in advance. There is dance and there, and then there is no attack. Anyone who has some stupid love triangle can take care of me at least. It's not even campy or insulting. It's just no value. August may be a post. He was given nothing to do.
