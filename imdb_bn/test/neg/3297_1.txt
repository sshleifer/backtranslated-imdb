Nowadays when sitcom comes, I'm one of them to punish. I'll still test them in a short time. My observation is that most of them are not very funny even in high networks, even higher ratings, I just do not have to find their hearts in fun busting. Although some people cracked a smile, some of them did not laugh at me, I usually change the channel after a few minutes. Now on FOX networks, they expose new shows to change your underwear, for some reason they think they can make good sitcoms, mistakes them wrongly. They beat this dead horse so much that they take someone to the point of appointment, write a painful pilot through bad conversations and only find them. Let's take a quick look at the recent piece of junk that has been slow, "war in war" <br /> <br /> I saw it for about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this special episode, the girl is facing her parents, that I am now an adult. Parents bother him, "fine him, go ahead and do whatever you like, if you screw up, it's your problem", he replied, "Well I'm crazy about you but hey at least I did not get AIDS" Sunny tracks, there is no way that they can not be a live audience, unless they pay for rubbish like this) - I have found the crate as being bad for the taste. No Well hey at least I will not see any more of this punk. Take a hint fox, stop wasting your time with sitcoms. All right, you have the Simpsons but now it's really old and tired.
