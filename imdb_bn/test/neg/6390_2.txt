This movie has come to Mexico now and I have read a very good reviews about it because I decided to visit my friends and friends about it, but I was very disappointed, I can not understand how people can rate it. And the direction was nice, but a great overall story needed a good story that this flick was completely poor. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed a number of dramatic Asian and European films but they had a good story, see this movie you are at risk if you are not Eastern European but I do not think you like it. <br /> <br /> The half of the theater has surpassed my four friends, who had been waiting outside, because they were really upset. I always wait till the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> About the movie, it was very slow, sometimes separated by scene, the entire length of the story could not be shown much more. 40 minutes, but they watch the scene of coal picks like 15 minutes in the morning, making it more of a movie plus panoramic opinion and thus, until they make a full-length movie. It's a really annoying one. <br /> <br /> I recommend you listen to me if you still come back and rate this comment as useful after the ward. To help people avoid this waste.
