I do not mind the sequels; Sometimes they are better than the original. However, most of the time remains the best remaining .... Especially when you can not duplicate the cast. One of the major reasons is "The Magnificent Seven" was so popular that it is very popular Cast. <br /> <br /> This is simply "great seven", when only Yule Brenner came back as one of those famous members. Group "Great Seven." If seven are absent with six six people and replaced by fewer known actors, they quickly rush. In other words, except for a brenner, these guys have no luck! It's like a championship sports team, except for all the other options. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The crew left, is lame. This movie should never have been Basically, we care about "seven" here, we can not care less.
