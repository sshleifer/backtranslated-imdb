MST3K was a shining in Joel Hodgson's eye when I saw this one when I returned to the late, late, late show. There was a special opportunity to see it before it was bad. I do not know that with an arrow on his chest, a woman can leave about one and a half hour "at the end of the world" (thanks to her father on specific points) and then again it may take some days to get back to the fort with help. I did not know that a sword could go wild in a wild forest type and within 30 seconds it could create a hangal and flash powder bomb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> If you enjoy bad movies, go for it.
