The first premises stinks ... the little boy likes the girls' costume dress. It reminds me of Norman Bats in PSYCHO or Ed Wood at Ed Wood. The joke and the old jokes, you watched a dozen 50's and 60's movies. The whole throw is wasted. I bet people just signed in to be a Shirley MacLaine car. Would anyone please tell Sherly that he had made his best comedy in two malls for Sierra. See it ... if Andy Griffith does not have a repeat.
