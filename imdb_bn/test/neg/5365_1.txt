I was very excited when the atomic state came first and e. I thought it could bring some interesting haunting evidence. Manufacturing quality looked good and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I started to think that this event could not find evidence, but it was a strong religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It seems that in every case they see such a big strong evil demon even a camera can not learn the camera, yet everyone is afraid. Then there comes some power of Christ that protects everyone. <br /> <br /> Also, there are very few attention on other members of the team. The whole program focuses on rayon and he feels like people who give you his church papers on the street. <br /> <br /> What unusual phenomena and ghosts have become new missionaries of Christian religion, afraid to transform people? Really, this would be a Christian network. I was very frustrated.
