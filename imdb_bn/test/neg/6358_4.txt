* Spoilers - Sorry! * The first word to remember when viewing the film is 'Gremlins'. This is the only criatra movie I've ever seen from four movies, but I enjoyed it. I did not see the last two, it was not very complicated, but I thought it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) The girl met with a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they go hanging in a forest nearby. They say the staff because of their alertness and critters who meet with this weird guy. He feels a little psychic and if I was in that state, I would not talk to him. Critters stole a trip to the girl and boy's car and ended up their flat things. They are hiding in the basement and eventually kill this lazy brawl. They almost killed this fat woman and her father. They are superior and superior to the flat up until they are hidden hidden. Critters eat stuff in the kitchen (gremlins spoof in the kitchen scene ???!) And I can not remember (a good thing) but I'm sure they will go back for some / somebody. However they ended up and saved the end. The psychological person comes back and before he is killed in the last two players, he is told that he is not endangered, so he sends his home. <br /> <br /> The end was frustrating and I was bored that only the idle guy died because I personally killed several annoying characters. This is a thrilling, exciting movie about a clock value. But, if you are looking for a better version of this genre, then I recommend Grimines movies. Sorry!
