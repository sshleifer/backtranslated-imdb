So you're a demon mantis and you've been hanging in the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos and you hit it with Snowball. What is a giant mutant worm? Head for the big city! See the sights, maybe catch a show at Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a beautiful tunnel to call yourself, some painful people start attacking you !! Ah! <br /> <br /> This picture has taken one step above the biggest bug film because it has a good FX for 1957. But this is it. If you really do not see other big bugs broken, or do not see another Perry Mason actor in a B movie, avoid it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
