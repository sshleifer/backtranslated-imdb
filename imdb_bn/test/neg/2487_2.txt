Documentary reviewing the 1950s sci-fi movies and how they influenced (and rebuilt) America. Interview with Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron and Mark Hamill described. <br /> <br /> Very terrible. The "insight" given is nothing new - for example - the cold war and the threat of atomic war have affected the entire generation of children. Good duh! They tried to bring all of the 1950's big films under sub-genre - big bug movies, space movies, etc. This is good however they prefer the most obvious movies and are already in the process of analyzing death. It was great to see the clips of "Rocket Ship X-M", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The The Day of the Stood", but what the director said is disrespectful to any viewer Looks insulting. Even though it was less than an hour, it was completely upset within 30 minutes. It gets 2 for some clips, but nothing else.
