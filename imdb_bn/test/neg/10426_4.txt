This film describes the story of John Belusi, based on Bob Woodward's biography, 'Wired'. All the movies are described in Flashbaby without a growing sequence, after Michael Belusi's death, we are quite credible in the character of John Belusi, along with an angel named Belushi, but he is completely excluded from Beloquin's power, and his game only has a pale animation. . The director was not successful in continuing to succeed in more stories, which is very confused for the book does not know. But it is bad that they showed Bob Woodward that he spoke about Belua before he died. The only effort to describe the controversial story of John Belusi for this negative aspect. My rate is 4.
