First and foremost I want to say - for the record - Your film should be incredibly talked about "Mrio" when it is specifically transmitted to scientific research on fetus (animals and humans) of 12-16 weeks of age. Immune stage ends in eighth pregnancy week and from this moment the embryo phase enters the immune crater. Well, honestly, I did not know all of this, but I tried to see it, and that at least that "corruption" makers could create less. Do not worry; I just do not feel embarrassed at the details or are not bitterly exaggerated, because there are many reasons because "Mriori" is a huge failure. True science can be considered as annoying and accessible, and thus science fiction is a film that is otherwise tiring, yet education science topics have been created to be more attractive and understandable to the larger audience. The ambitious scientific experiment that depicts terrible mistakes or space missions confronting the evil aliens instead of a light year, illustrates, filmmakers generally manage to entertain people with visual effects, and at the same time teach very little significance about their science. To create a good or minimal semiconductor science fiction film, writers and managers must abide by a basic rule: Do not be boring! If they can not fulfill this condition, the audience can also read the book as it is theoretically. Ralph Nelson's production of "embryo" has gone wrong. The basic foundation is potentially captivating and even involved, we are all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn children. Chief star Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Dean Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice is Not Anime") and director Nelson was responsible for himself. For the acclaimed classic "soldier blue" and "charlie". So what's wrong? Easy. The script is irreverently annoying, clich√©d and the whole thing looks incredibly stupid because the lab scenery and scientific equipment clearly achieve any medical breakthroughs with very clear. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, played a doctor in very poor performance, who has no emotion in his research since his wife died. When her car hit a pregnant dog on a rainy night, her emotions came back and she made everything possible to save the dead animals from fetuses. He led a fetus to survive, influentially accelerate its growth process and it operated the train with a very intelligent dog. Due to his successful success, Dr. Paul Holstein believes his friend at the hospital to repeat his examination with the fetus of a pregnant teen who has committed suicide. The female subject keeps an unexpected rising at a rapid rate, however, and just a few weeks later, she is a full-fledged, violent and extremely intelligent woman. The good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the treatment of gross new growth starts to produce horrible side effects ... In the first 45 minutes of the movie, nothing is perfect, many impossible and too much of the melodramatic Mumbai-Jumbo and one or two deeply performed dogs. Impressive tricks. The second half (unreal) action and mysteries of the film are a little bit, but then the stupidity and stimulating plot-twist of the dialogue has already destroyed the potentially fictional psychedelic concept. There are some really cool scenery, especially the chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowell (a very memorable and supernatural supporting role). Grand Finlay is weirdly surprisingly and literally ridiculous, and it almost remembers Ralph Nestle as the ultimate shot because it was a common rule in contemporary thriller and Saif Fi. Along with the latest sequence, with awesome fridge frames shot, it certainly does not fit the 100-minute sound of the film. But anyway, my sincere praise and respect for dogs and its trainers. An animal with such intelligence and talent is surely worthy to show its strategy in a good film.
