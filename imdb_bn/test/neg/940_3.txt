I was not so impressed with this movie, it is quite tiring and flat. The plot line was interesting, a baby made its own college and listed hundreds of children, but the smiles were few and far away. Curiosity was not really funny and I did not have any guts in any scene. Characters were not curious and I did not feel for any of them, even fatty kids with glassy glasses, who tried to enter the frat group. This was a good first watch, but it did not blow me up and I would not recommend it. Comparing with other movies in the same way, i.e. American pie is very cruel, because a movie that was sunny. This laugh has failed to laugh!
