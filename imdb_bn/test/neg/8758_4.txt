Oh, awful! I saw a lot of movie movies on my day, but this one makes me mock with repulsiveness instead of laughing. It is definitely a crazy movie and a very low budget, but if you are able to see cheap audio, awesome dialogue, ugly girls, perhaps fake ghooping scenes and overall impressiveness of the movie, you might find some of this photo entertaining. The story is about a copy of the killer of the cat which is "5th month of 5th month's 5th day" (wah, how real), and it's two detectives (in which a brave attempt to stop the murderer's bloody rampage in crapy for better dialogue Try). The scene of killing scenes (which are made with plastic knives) is quite brutal (which is a good thing), but it is very annoying because of the continuous repetition of a clearly recorded scream (very ear piercing). For Gore, it is in plenty but it looks very fake; Especially blood-blooded, SIM, purple blood? However, if you are a fan of Gore video like me, you will see something like this in my video (I'm a secret detective ... he's going to be the best thing for this movie). Furthermore, all of what you are looking for is a bunch of stupid nudity (which is a good thing, but girls are very evil) and a very stupid hippie envelope serial killer. Sorry, but this one sucks.
