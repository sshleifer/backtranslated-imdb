It's really a re-create that has not gotten out of the stable This is the difference that is acting on a different level. The top of the game is Joan Ploite and Maximilian Shell. Every Minute View of Franks is Visible The bottom of the rock is Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can not imagine how Gilbert and Roberts could play so well with holes and plathite during their anti-magic work. Gilbert has destroyed every scene of his. As Baba knows best in the gateway. He's Anne Frank Lite. Helen Keller's run was thin but not terrible. This is sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Dam just annoying. Whose disgusting, disgusted presence hits so much trouble in Acherhuis who she liked completely inappropriate choice of sexual appetite woman. It needs to be played by a woman who can please us that she was at least remembered how it was rude. Its weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright may have played this part nicely. This was made, Roberts was in a career high, getting many pressures and many opportunities. Her performance here shows her weakness as an embarrassing actress. <br /> <br /> Most of them are with Gilbert and Roberts, James Koko and Clive Rayville, and although they are strong, they are completely unable to undo the compensation. Completed by their partners. Rayville is an impressive actor who is capable of supporting Icon performance given by Ed Wine in the original film. He gets no support from Gilbert. He drains the color out of each scene. <br /> <br /> I read with the comments of those of you who grew up with this version, with this performance. A lesson that lets you associate the version that you first saw. It makes me revisit my attachment to some inferior products that I like during my childhood. I encourage you to see the original. It has very few weak spots and head and shoulders above this mess.
