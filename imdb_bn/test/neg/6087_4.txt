How much do I love this picture? Now I'm not a bad movie fan, but I love a movie which is so bad that it's good. This is one of them. Juan Pablo de Pace has a great butt, shows fad on screen, and of course his acting debut (I believe) is not a bad turn. Billy Zane is worthwhile and Moody, although I still think there's something more in it. I felt Titanie, when Lin Winslet was roaming around him looking at his face, completely broken, shocked, and humble ... awesome! Kelly Brook is a beautiful face ... with no importance, I think it is! Seeing a really hot guy, it's brook's big bra filter, Billy to nasty foul play, happy in the dialogue, the scenery and the whole thing's madness ... I see it again - yes, I bought it !!!
