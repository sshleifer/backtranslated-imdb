For many months I was looking forward to this release. The previews looked good, the net reporting of the net was enthusiastic and the golden eyes and time-splitter were excellent shooters (by the same people). It has become very confused! There was a possibility of hedge with the Duty 4 of Duty 4 and other General Chuckles, but it looks, plays and feels like it's before 5 years or more. I played Hedge on 1080p TV and initially disappointed that the developers of the game limited the graphics to 720. There is a lack of details of the hedge universe and the atmosphere, "they certainly have run away to finish it" feeling. <Br /> <br /> The controls are lazy and complex, and I still can not find the combination of X / E axis sensitivity. There are many parts of the single player game that is very dark (visible), where you can not actually see where you are going. Why not add a torch function like Halo? Or better, night vision? The performance enhancement is interesting to use the drug "nectar", but you do not use it just as you would like to use it and again use it! Why bother? I could go with many more hedged errors, but instead I'll say I'll just say! Wait for Kilojon 2 or call Duty 4 and try to unlock the gold unit!
