I see the very first and tornle movie of death in Weaveri Hills. Can not be too bad. Then I heard that the documentary is coming and getting excited that it was a documentary because it did not have any more serious and terrible special effects. The same people have made documentary and it has destroyed its effects rather than raw. The way should be a documentary. Weaverly Hills does not need goofy effects to help with its exactly the right way. Tours $ 20.00 per person and $ 10.00 overnight for a 10-hour overnight investigation into overnight investigation for overnight investigation. Time should be set before the tour. Great place for Ghost Hunter!
