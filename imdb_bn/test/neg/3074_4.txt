The opinion of the commentator on this page of this TV seems to have been thought to be possible, perhaps it is a very stupid film, I'm pretty stupid because I can fix everything. How bad is it? It is not a teleplicle which can not even define its name, because everybody in America calls it Linda, known as Murderer in Britain and it is a bad sign, when a movie is to be renamed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, Linda and Paul Cowley meet other couples who are known as Jeffrey. They become so good that they go together on holiday (if some wives are swapping, make up your mind) and Paul sees that his wife Jeffrey is killed. Still, this plot makes a shock. <br /> <br /> By writing the above paragraph I suddenly felt a huge sense of the story and I will not say anything to keep you away from the court. It is true that the story continues after the events when I have described the things have become more unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, most of the scenes when production values ​​are fairly unimpressive with Paul Cowley playing a very wooden voice acting - exotic and interior - they have been shooting on a fog on the day
