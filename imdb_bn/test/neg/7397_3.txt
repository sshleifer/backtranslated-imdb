It is one of those films with a great possibility. Brilliant actor, a very interesting director and a hunting "Survivor" - a salute to the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: Cinematography is stunning. The beauty of Namibia desert shows itself as neutral, even in pictures. And then there is the acting. OK. Jennifer Jason Leigh has not been well. It seems that Bruce Davison has improved his character from Altman's "Shortstats". <br /> <br /> After the disappointment: Genet Macteier. Roman Boehngar And plot. Why do levings on the world choose "lear" for their play? Shakespeare does not have the full idea of ​​expressing their frustration and internal long symptoms. It seems like a face-to-face. And it is clear that tragedies are the result of "Lear". Leaving and academy award winner Anderson Thomas Jensen's script just fits them. <br /> <br /> and gender. It takes about three days, then less or all letters are frustrating sex. Dahh !! When you need a crisis in a plot, sex is always the easiest way. Genetic McTeer's part is completely ridiculous that idea, because it falls apart. The sex makes the platter immediately fall to the ground. Instead they could focus on dialogue. All conversations in the letters have certainly been done, but we would see mainly talking in their small group. Although they are said to be "lear" and the rest of the film is dead like <br /> <br /> "The King is Awake" is still not the worst movie of the Danish dog '95. However, it has been relatively comparatively unsuccessful in comparison to the Lone Sheriff's Homogen Dotmem95's "Most Recent" Italians for Begender. This is not a good film. This is a bad one. But it is beautiful.
