I can not help but forget about the unbelievable scenario of Alien, when there is an additional landfall explosion in the chest. Or even when the hunter snuck on invisible giant bewildered soldiers and cut their pieces. Both of these films have expressed interesting ideas about the characteristics of the run of the mill organisms. Keep an eye on the Chess B-movie era and keep an eye on the big people in the Foni case surrounding the killing of people in small towns. Now accept that the above two films have revolutionized this genre. The cave has nothing to improve it. It does not try anything new, and worst of all, the cave does not even gore even better. Shame on them, all of them shame. <br /> <br /> Paradeing around the sexy spandex is the one-dimensional character of the caves. It seems that they care when their colleagues witness the death. They just walk along, unknown unknown evil creatures in the dark. The plot is very easy to understand. So you got two brothers, black guy and sexy lady scientist. The rest (by the rest, I understand that those who shrink peacefully with civilization) are far more illusory than others. We have a Korean assistant, a risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist and two divers, both lacking emotion and feeling stupid to tear themselves apart. This movie has been extremely cluttered, because the black guy, a brother and a female scientist have ended. Even after the death of Russians and Koreans, Americans seem to survive this terrorism. I do not get offended if details give away. However there is no real wonder. <br /> <br /> They will find this cave to move forward. They go to the cave. They get trapped in the cave. They started to kill the cave. Among them a cave gets infected. The cave died more. They come out of the cave; Only to discover that one of them is a parasite that will turn them into a terrible monster, which does not seem to really irritate them. That lazy plot simplicity It does not even try to be original. There is even a part in which they decide that their leaders are not capable and divided. We have seen this way long ago. <br /> <br /> I know in such a movie that people are not concerned about performance, but it is noteworthy how bad it was. Everyone is just so indifferent. The Coal Hauer was especially illusory and I do not have to start Eddie Cibrian, which often much better. Maurice Cheston took the best thing in the movie. Its performance is actually decent He portrays a person who can calm everyone. All other actors are the best average. In such a show, this is not really a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For now, we go to this movie. Of course, action. Well, to express my sorrow, the actions were silent. The death scene was all boring, the whole movie was hell. There is just no blood. This is either they disappear and is found later or they die without injury and destruction. The only exciting action I had to find was that Koreans see the death of humans. <br /> <br /> It's quite amazing. The worst thing on shadows is that most things are good. A good example was that special effects were good, which they were. The only thing that is wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave, it's going to be dark. I found it difficult to differentiate between the cave wall and monsters. So the animals were quite difficult to see even. Although I liked special effects, there was nothing original about the monster. They all resembled each other and they were not afraid at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> The symbol of direct debut for the Cave Bruce Hunt. I did not see what I was trying to achieve by creating this image. He probably made a huge mistake. Almost everything in this movie is like a sting bomb stank. A stink bomb is even more delightful than watching this mess again. Only the most forgiving movies will find this apt. For the third time when I heard the word "What I was", I left all hope in the middle.
