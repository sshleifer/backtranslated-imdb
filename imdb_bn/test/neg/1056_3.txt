Sorry to disagree with you, but I found DKC series to be quite engaging. So much so that I invested in SNSIS and the game's own copies. It is in your mind, almost ten years after the initial release of Dixie 1. Graphics were ground-breaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. Music and characters are all memorable, and games bring me dozens and dozens of hours to entertain me and my girlfriend. True, the second game was better than the first and the third was probably the 'edge' of the second installment. But they offered three different games, and I enjoy them today. However, when I was a video game I was old enough to remember (and the TVs were black and white!).
