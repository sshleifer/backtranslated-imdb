Steven Sigal's movies were not good at late, but this is the worst ever since patriotism. Plot no one ever makes sense; It is never clear what the relationship between characters, who or who works for those double crossings. The film is completely disintegrated, the story seems more confusing than to carry forward ahead of each scene. Even the sequence of actions is uninspired and difficult to follow. Most of the defects must not boast the director to understand the main elements of filmmaking, but Segal still does not stop in the film producers, he must share the blame. Oh, and I've even mentioned how awful it's played by Seagal Standards. Even for the Seagal fans, it is not worth a view even as straight video sheets. It's a wider berth day!
