I'm a massive fan of LoG. I think the first two series has provided the best comedy of this country and the third series is different, but it was astonishing dark and fantasy. Seeing Tibbas, Edward and Briss on the big screen, he started to wait a little on July 3. Yet, somewhere, it all went terrible wrong. The author had no stories and no real ideas. The old England part shows the glittering of the talent that we know the league is capable of, but these scenes do not match well with the film. Geoff is very low, mostly poor jokes and Leap and Bris performance are a big disappointment. If you love the league, save your time and money and watch the episodes again from the TV series. And again. A huge disappointment.
