Well ... I like Patricia Cass. She is a beautiful lady and a highly gifted and versatile singer. The performance of this movie is more than that and from my perspective about the only freedom fighter of this movie. He captures with a very lonely health problem very slowly with serious problems. However, the shameless product location for the well known French disciplines of a hotel that I hate disgustingly about the film. The other is that the story looks long lasting without really deciding what the story is and what it wants to be. In the positive note, you might argue that this movie is not predictable, but you can also say that it is obviously annoying because of lack of composite. There are some nice shots in the movie that you can not think that all the parts do not add anything. Really, this photo is burning really well.
