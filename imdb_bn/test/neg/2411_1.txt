I am sure that I saw future killings like this: HR Gaiger's great poster And like everyone else, I was disappointed that this movie can not be with the poster (Giger said that director Moore actually requested him). I first saw at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever. I still thought that if I do not see some movies in MSST 3, then their brotherhood. When they take Splatter (Ed Neil), mutant / cyborg / psycho, who kills gang leader and blames it on frat and blames them as an excuse to overthrow them. The rest of the rest of the movie is mostly made up behind One of Frank's hands tried to get out of the mutant city (which I thought was supposed to be LA, though it was made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political elements as opposed to nuclear weapons and mutant-society for the embryo's son's society. There is talk about how Splattor has become pale due to radiation. Most people develop cancer from radiation, but splatter just shoot spikes and daughter girls. Yes, in that sense makes tons. At one point, our protagonist saved a mutant girl from two pro-nook policemen, and he showed them how "half life is alive." In the other half, it turns out, all the punk kids who dance around the bad 80s pop band. So both of our little epics are fools and dated. That's really all of it. Bhat boys roam around the house rolling around, when they look like mad people who try to kill them ... oh, and this is the future. <br /> <br /> I do not think why Dr. Dr. Murray did not make any films. This thing is a real stinker. If you like geiger, then buy his books (poster without voice of his movie), or see ALIEN again. There is no need for anyone who is wasting time in the future killing. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the film look good, but the other obscure film that does the same thing, the only bigger and better: after the fall of New York. It's crap, but it's a screen shot off in the near future.
