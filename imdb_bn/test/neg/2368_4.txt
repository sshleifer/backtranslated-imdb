Does not this seem to be familiar? Oh wait, okay .. 90% of the movie is already done in the TV series. Do you repeat the point, you can ask? Is it for the benefit of Americans who have not seen this event? Did the writer run inspiration? Or can they all suffer from an attack of Amnia, and have forgotten that they will already be covered in this place? For anyone sitting in the first three series, in any way, it was just boring. It had to turn off the 'Tablets that make your water green' part. Yes it is very funny, but to give us something original for goodness! In fact, if you can bring a new new stuff, you can forget it during Leonard Rocitor Saturday Night Feevers. <br /> <br /> The guy who wanted to replace Richard Bacinsel was right, but not half the actors. Personally I will exorcised a role as an honor to her. Or better, do not bother the movie, and only tell the happiness of the TV series for yourself. But no, they could not do it ... as long as money can not be made. Sorry, really. 4/10
