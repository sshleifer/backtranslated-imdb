I have a section that wants to give this movie a high rating. It was created in 1953, it is a very brave film about transvestite, it deals with seriousness and sympathetically (and provides a lot of information about the audience) and stereotype and hard work. The film has made it clear that transvestite is not gay, and women wear relatively normal lives by wearing them. It deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the circle around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) tries to understand the problem due to a recent transvestite suicides. So, you have to accept everybody involved in the credit of this movie as controversial (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that this movie is absolutely awesome. While trying to portray pain in Glen / Glendor (Edward D. Wood), the film falls into stupidity (and sometimes surprisingly - the era of passionate) which makes it hard to follow the story. Acting is the best wooden. Which of the conversations does not come into reality; Appears written by others by the actors and people like to look like lectures. And - worst - there was no point in living in this movie. At the next stage of this career, this poor man is one of the increasingly embarrassing roles. "Drag the strings, pull the strings," crying the character of the poor Ludosi (known as The Spirit in the Credits, but being a really crazy scientist). And what he did really seems to have a lot of connection with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic competence, the film is actually not more than 1/10. Anyway, just for the courage involved in getting courage, I'll give it a 3/10.
