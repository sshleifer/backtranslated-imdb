In Los Angeles, alcoholic and lazy Hong Kong Chinski (Matt Dillon) manages only non-qualified tasks to get horses to drink and get enough money to play gambling. <br /> <br /> "Factotam" is a painful, drunk and a boring woman who is working for a day or a few weeks, enough money to buy spirits and gambling, being fired due to her helpless behavior immediately. According to IMDb, this character is the fictional character of Charles Bukowsky, proud, and based on this story, I must not read any of his novels. Sincerely, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, it will be well-viewed if you look sensitive and heartwarming, based on the life-based hectar of the same author BÃ©bano's "Ionoid" or Marco Ferreri's "Story d'Ordinaria Folia". My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factamum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotam ?? Without Destiny?")
