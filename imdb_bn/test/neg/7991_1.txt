This movie is a total waste of time such as. I do not understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash. Oh, I liked it at the age of seven. I think the seven-year-old child may be written and directed. <br /> <br /> No scripts, no acting, just junk. The best actors are by war roosters. I think I can whip these ninjas and I'm not the one that you think is difficult. Completely intolerant and not least bit spark of interest. At the end of the first ten minutes of the film, I laugh and started laughing. This is one that will turn people from martial arts movies. Great comedy, flush the bad action.
