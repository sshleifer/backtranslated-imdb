We saw such a story before: A wife involved in marital troubles (played by Nastassa Kinsky) involves sex with a stranger (William Beldwin) and then the husband and daughter want to go back to her life. After returning home, she said that her husband finally got a job. Everything looks bright. However, Kinski said that her husband's new boss is a stranger who is still interested in him and thinks of getting what he wants. What do you do Do not say anything <br /> <br /> I really did not like the movie. It was not just bad, it clearly lacks that "something". It is most likely to pay more attention to what is happening inside Kiskskir's head. There is nothing to say about the actors (I think belvedown was a good choice for the role of a vague boss) but the characters seem to be somewhat stereotypical, acting in characters in your daily TV movies. Finally, there can be an interesting plot to be completely destroyed in the end. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie tried to look great, there was some shiny camerawork, some steel, quick cut and glamor, but in the end I think it makes a great fit for spelling. Goes for the same song. Otherwise it did not look bad. <br /> <br /> Someone may like it but it was certainly not my cup of tea. To be fair, I usually do not see such a thriller. It was felt a lot more than just a half an hour, I think it could work well as an hour-long episode of some TV series. There was absolutely no need for some of the scenes, especially the shower scenes. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: try before you buy!
