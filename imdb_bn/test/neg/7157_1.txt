Hold Spoilers! These guys scam almost, they did the lost scrolls of Judas, saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... and now? It will clearly try to destroy a religion, and be illegal. There is no evidence of them, it can clearly be a setup. How can we recognize and believe this man? Do they carve grave and say "so"? And finally they seal the tomb so that nobody can investigate there? How foolish are they, really? We believe they are trustworthy people? Who really is found in a grave of Jesus? And how can you rob all Christians like this? I think this documentary should never be made by a religious man. It can only be made by a Christian and I mean instructions and scripts. It should be illegal for a Christian-related documentary film for the Jews, especially if the documentary accuses Jesus of not calling "the Son of the Resurrection" (Buddhist or Atheist, which may be something other than Catholics). <Br> <br /> This total hacked me, a pure documentary-scam. They sealed the graves so that people do not "think" about examining things. The total failure of this documentary, how do they think the Christian people are stupid? And about the lost pages of Judas ... which was also roughly scam, they finally said in the end: "We know some people who can make such a fake scrolls and nobody knows that it was a fake" ... My God, they just said it. "Dude we could have done these things ..." Such a documentary should be illegal, it's all the Christians N and Catholics should be behind bars !!! I am not a brave, I am a former Jew, now atheist, but my hero and I always respect others' religions, when the Israelis ordered the seal to be sealed forever, that was true! Valuable !!
