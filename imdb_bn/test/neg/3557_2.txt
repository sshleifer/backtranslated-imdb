I have seen this movie based on good reviews here, and I will not make that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of some people have been brought together with the tragedy, but you do not see it. Flashbacks are 12-hour and we see the annoying life of each of these people, which is going to happen in the end. When the end comes to an end, you realize that you were waiting for a great deal of time to lose an hour of your life and that you are not seeing anything. The only connection to this people was "bad days" of all of them - but even that continuation was lost in Borodem. <br /> <br /> If this is considered a "crash" clone, it is a complete failure.
