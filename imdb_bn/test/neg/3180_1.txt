I am surprised and amazed to find harmful short reviews for this horrible movie. I've rented this "movie" or fee, you want to call it to any friend, with some friends and thirty minutes later we had to stop watching. Just because I heard the conversation, my face turned out to be a terrible taste of yeast milk. This film was about knowing as a donkey pimple. I hope I will never see that Bray-less, reggae he saw the same (Julian Nicholson) again. It was like watching the most rural pilot for a sitcom that would never make it to television, but instead of a quick but painful 30 minutes (I could all be bare) it was 90 minutes annoying.
