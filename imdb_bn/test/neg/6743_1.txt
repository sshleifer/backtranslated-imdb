Nothing is truncated to break the total piece of trash, and worse than seeing this movie, it is seen in the English class. This is actually one of the worst movies I've seen. Contrary to a theme that completely disregards it and can present it, so the story is really really dull. Thank God 80's is over, and save God who was originally born as "James Bond III".
