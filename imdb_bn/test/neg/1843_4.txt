The idea of ​​this movie was quite good. But somehow the death penalty failed in many parts. There are not many horror movies which I can think of dolls that used to be so realistic. Especially when these dolls start moving their eyes glowing or moving hands. So much can be done on this premises. There were so many scenes where there was room for tensions and mysteries. And I was really hoping to do wonderful things. But the movie could never be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is very short and predictable. I actually do this with the purpose of surprise us with some wonderful twist. Unfortunately this does not happen. Well that's not the least I hope. Cast failed to make it all credible. It was nice if it was given more background on the letters. At the beginning when we launched the main character. It seems that he and other characters are invited to some artists. But it is also clear that they have no idea that they are invited. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I get an invitation without getting a signal, then the agreement will not be easy. Moreover, most of the letters are not really genuine with actual results that you actually do not care for them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premises, which is quite scary and comes with new elements which do not explain and even not even relevant to "puppet master". Overall this movie has been a big disappointment for me. If you see see a good horror movie involved in dolls go see "dead silence"!
