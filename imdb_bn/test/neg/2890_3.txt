I have been bad in movies. It is a fiendly plot and a clinker about a psychopath. Tom Scarit, whom I really enjoyed, was quite young here. He is a creator with a passion, but his involvement in a partner whose benefits include insurance and burning. The agent comes in the mix, who drowns, her daughter, and her brown boyfriend James Meson in the insurance investigator game. Any stupid, a little careful, will know that some of Australia's nations will be torn apart. Yet, they break their way. The most interesting thing to me is that the huge hotel is being made, sometimes even after the bunch of sticks is made. Low budget, I guess. The plot can be interesting. Maybe they should hire a film editor (what?). Half of the time you do not know the characters, but I guarantee that a five million dollar salary could probably be closely monitored on the structure. It does not work. Although there is quite a clean fire.
