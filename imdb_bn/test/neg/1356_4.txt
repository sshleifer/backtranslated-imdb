Really mad Even if you did not see the original George Kiker film with Cast Castro, Zone Crowford, Rosalind Russell, Pallett Gamdard, Joan Fontaine and thousands of other stars, you can cancel this forcefully, politically correct, sad comedy. Depressing for many different reasons Meg Ryan for one What did he do to himself? His face can be very rare. That alone keeps miles away from her soft shear. Enayet Bening should file a lawsuit against the DP and Debar Messing, what is he doing here? The public's subconscious connection is trying to pass for the actress friends, completely unconsciously. A humiliating piece of miscasting Eva Mendes in part of Joan Croft. What a terrible idea! Its character is like a trans sex actor without a taste or subtlety. It seems surprising that a woman has adapted and directed this woman. I can mention that only positive things are a short but very interesting look of Bate Middle and Claris Leichman as a housekeeper.
