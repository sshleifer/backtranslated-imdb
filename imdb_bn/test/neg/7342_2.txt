I am astonished by all the good reviews on this movie and IMDB. This is $ 2 in your local video store. Not saying that it's a B-movie very liberal. In addition to the lack of a single redeemable character, the film's script is soft and lifeless, in addition to a little better than the average performance and lacking quality of 80 styles. This picture is not only annoying - it's kind of cute. (Of course, sometimes there are some light chemistry among the two main characters.) Even the final plot changes - rather, the only plot turn - does not save the film. <br /> <br /> hire "Diamond Man" if you are required, but do not hesitate to close it after verifying its worthlessness. 10 out of 2
