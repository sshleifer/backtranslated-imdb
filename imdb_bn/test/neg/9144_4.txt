Answer that The question is, what is the reason for watching this movie? I love him "My name is Julia Ross." One of the best movies of all time. Noor or whatever it may call, this is a very uncertain movie. <br /> <br /> She is one of the worst studio releases of all time. That is the "blame of the Ameth of Amity." This one has a wonderful, promising title. It has a good cast. It's a fine director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe a little tawari. Instead, it's an uninspired, routine spy movie. It is quite a total bore. At least it was me. Ms. Foch is captivating. And that's about it.
