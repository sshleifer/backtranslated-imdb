In the 17th century, Robert Doni Jr. was enough to scoff at me, but I could not believe that a great actor like Sam Neil actually took part in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I especially like Merival's "healing" for crazies. They're dancing ... and hello! Everyone is happy and they all are good! I guess I just did not like Character Merieval too much. Therefore, watching a whole film about his supposed transformation from a horrific buffoon to a great physician was scary. Also, I'm not quite sure, but I do not think the famous fire in London as well as the plugs happened simultaneously.
