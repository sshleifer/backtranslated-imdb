(Very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment. I do not know where to start, there are many problems. So, I will talk about what is good about film. <br /> <br /> Cast was great. Steve Martin provides a really fun performance of a middle-aged, high-class, bright white guy. Queen Latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black girl. And Eugene Levi, the better he plays himself quite a lot. Betty is white and gin add smart and you have a great cast - everyone really played well in their part. And watching these guys for 1.75 hours if you value 8 dollars, then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the movie makes many serious mistakes. Above all, there are enough ethnic tendencies and racial jokes to offend everyone. All white people are warm bits. All black people are gatebo ebonics-speakers. Black hip, cool, and poor with it. White nerds, tough, and rich. (Except Eugene Levi, he clearly took the queen Latifa and "lingo speaks" - so Latifa calls him "ficak." So - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know the street throat, of course, a freak. . This film is associated with discriminatory atrocities against black cast members and instead is portrayed as Sadada's body and boobs. <br /> <br /> Keep the racing card aside, see the main error in the movie: they destroy the character of Latifa. He came to Martin's house under false accusations, but Martin liked him. He is supposed to be accused of wrongfully robbing, Martin takes his cause. 3/4 We got the character of Latifah out of jail. So, our sympathy leaves them out of the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. The film shows Latifa with some visually visible scene in some places where she "no" (like a country's club or Martin's house) and Martin is trying to hide her. That's pushing the running. Then in the last minute of the film, they decided that they were finally going to confront Latifa that he was wrongly accused of bank robbery. Martin admits confession (come, unusable) from a lifier former lover to cover a homeowner and everyone lives happily with everyone. Finally (but this is a lot more wrong with Flickr) This movie seems to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. The courtyard was clearly borrowed from another Martin movie "house-sitter". Where Sonali comes to live with Haun Martin and his stadium leads to the middle-class life. See Martin and Latifa online - "You've got mail". The whole "quirky nanny" goes on as "music sound" and "Mary poppins" until the rich man corrects life. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie again free.
