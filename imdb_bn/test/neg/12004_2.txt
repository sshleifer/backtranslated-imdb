It's great as kids movie. It just sucks for the family. I was really hoping for something like Goonies which is a great movie for all ages. This movie was very important to the babes only, and the characters called each other as small buttons like small buttons. ??? Alan Cummings was a joy though. And why do people compare Wiley One to this movie ... because the theme song with the Will Winka song does not do anything like this movie, Wiley Wonka.
