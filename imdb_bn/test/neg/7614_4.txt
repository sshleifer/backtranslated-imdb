I'm still waiting for the dark Muppate film where we do not know how it ended from the beginning. I think linkclatter can test with each animation. At this time I do not really hope for such things, but I want to deeply wish. <br /> <br /> The Zone Cusack sucks. He randomly moved to a TV level created for this acting with an impressive cynic. Muppets were more than life-time. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But the whole picture was repeatedly. I used to love him. He was the only one to laugh at me (when God in Godberg gave me poison and curse). If we can not see any dark muppet about at least one PG, then there is a controversial joke of 13 peppsets and a metal-head of the animal, one with the egg-nog-chewing personality. <br /> <br /> The worst muppets. Even the annoying Christmas carol saw this one out. These muppatas should be avoided during commercial holidays. <br /> <br /> 5/10
