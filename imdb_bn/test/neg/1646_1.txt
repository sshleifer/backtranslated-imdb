This movie is one of the worst movies of all time. I'm not neutral in this movie, 100 is not below; This is a list of at least 60 or 70 points for that list. This is not just a movie that I think is a camp-like sort of MST3; It's just bad. In this really few movies I really, the hat Freddie Got Fingered bad is in the same category. <br /> <br /> So go to California to go to the story of this story (Gagino) School and come back with the crawl (Shore) and she tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tried to set up shore so that the girl would leave the crawl and return to her. It ends and the viewers can leave what they left behind. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this movie is to moly the poly shore for the camera and try to be fun; But I would say that about 100% of the time failed. Their terrible mistakes and the past aspect of farm and farming are objectionable and are not eligible to watch this movie. If you think this looks: no. At one time I saw the movie, it looks like I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you've already seen it; You have my sympathy.
