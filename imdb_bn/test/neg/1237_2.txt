I certainly missed a part of this movie ... I asked myself who is this? And, when did that happen? It takes jumping around but I keep watching for fear I was missing something and it would all explain me. I like Lonesome Dove but this movie did not make any sense to me. I love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie? Is it "what" to go to me? At the beginning of each part ... as far as visible scene - I thought it was good .. even though I was gaining the leaves through a book and leaving the pages. Although the last one misunderstood me though I think the boy was waiting for his father and made you wonder that his father would eventually return to his son's house and that his mother would be a father since she left now. I want to read the movie. I do not hope to win this award.
