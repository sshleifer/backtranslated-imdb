I loved the exotic science fiction / fantasy movie but watch this one was very unpleasant. The idea of ​​child abuses, incest incursions (live or dead), other horrific scenes, plot holes, annoying performances have made this tragic experience, the main idea to enter the mind of another person is not new to the movie or TV (an external boundary episode was better to explore this idea) . Some special effects were beautiful so I gave it 4/10.
