Close but no cigar! - What is my opinion of this photo! TAG PURVIS both wrote and operated this script which must be re-written before shooting. Occasionally, ridiculous reasons or an authentic script, the star of the film Dan Mangmeyri Jr. and the director of photography. This talent is watch out for both the future. My recommendation is waiting until your local cable station hits and used to rent a classic fare!
