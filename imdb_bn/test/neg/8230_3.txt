This is a weird movie. Sponsored it is not different from many other D-grade movies, but it stands at least in some ways. Firstly, the main killer character is really weird. How a guy that clucks like a chicken never got the lid is completely beyond me. What a member of the female parole board thinks: "She is completely reformed and rehabilitated" He is sleeping Another issue of Luther is the script / direction for Giac women. She is so sad and apparently stupid if she is mine, then I'll kill her. Tried to embrace his soil from the bed, he struggled with knots and did not think, "I can get a scissor, or a knife". Later, in the same effort to bring his mother back, she roamed around the stairs and started searching for scraps-bookings stuff in some scissors, eventually finding a knife. However, this killer definitely left the car and came back later. Bizarre Plus, the girl closed her kit for the shower scene, was so nice, though it was unusual again. It seems that in most of these D-grade Gore movies, they happily look at blood by rash, but they are very strong for the audience. In general, it works but it was boring and nasty, although bare breasts made for something that is.
