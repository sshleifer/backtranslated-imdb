This film was a relentless effort to regain an important time in English history. Although the version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the war was slightly correct, the overall historical accuracy of this film was closed. This picture indicates that the war started on religious differences, but the civil war was not in any way favoritism for the Catholic v Protestant: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never present in the Battle of Egazil, nor did he ever "save the day". Another critic thinks Crumwell was not "five members" who were removed from the house and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was honest. The producer strictly tried the way and it turned out so great. <br /> <br /> Clearly it could have been better.
