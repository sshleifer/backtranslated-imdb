"Nicodemus" is a copy of almost "red" in the sense of strange behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in the unexpected life of Clark Kent. When a toxic flower finds it is the first to be influenced by it on the way to SMALLVILLE Jonathan Kent. The flower makes humans contradict their behavior, and when it affects Jonathan, it is a little painful and violent, but Clark hinders him from doing some rash until his father finally finishes. OK. So far everything is right. Next up is the Lanana. The episode was good because the flower tried to persuade him. At the last moment, he refused him but the damage was already done. This episode produces incorrect impressions and is not suitable for those 20 years old due to adult content. The first part was good, the last part (focusing on the impact of flowers on Pitt) was good, but in the middle of the lantern's alternate personality, it was not the most barbarous and it was a bright mountain that could have been lost. I give this episode two.
