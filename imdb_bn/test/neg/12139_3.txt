Let me clean. I hate this kind of movie. I do not like anything where progressive all bourgeois English I think such literature and movies are very awesome. You will not get me read a Jane Austen book voluntarily. I said, Dr. Dr. The only reason for reading somerset mosquito books and the next image was seen for the class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Christian Scott Thomas) is a free English lady living in Florence, a free villa. Before World War II One night after dining with some of her wealthy royalty friends, she chose an Austrian refugee, voluntarily related to her, and then killed herself. The film becomes more and more, you really want to dislike Mary. <br /> <br /> How bad this movie was. Above all, many subpages and letters were discovered in the film that was not in the book. I doubt that late Mr. Mamam has praised them so much. While the characters were rich, most of the sponsors and self-centered people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could not give three things less than that was because the acting was the only thing to be redeemable. Always talented Kristin Scott is perfect for Thomas Mary's role. Actually, I can not draw pictures of someone else filling his shoes. SunPay and Anne Bancroft also supported the role, which were as good as leadership. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the pain of watching this movie.
