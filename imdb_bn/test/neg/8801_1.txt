I do not understand how many people are playing for "Half-Life: Counter Strike" when shooting games are available for the first time. <br /> <br /> "Counter Strike" is a game that does not use any imaginative ideas in its surgical. All the weapons in the game are real-life weapons, but at least one deception that allows players to access "supernatural" weapons, such as the mighty BFG of Kaka and Dual Games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player will have to reload the weapon. It can be very annoying, especially when you're near to kill the enemy, in the middle of the fire. The reloading delay felt that the gun slow down its work. <br /> <br /> there are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are four types of characters for terrorist and militant-terrorist forces. This means that many characters show each other the same way, which actually brings down the reality of the game. <br /> <br /> During the selection of the character, the game is quite sexist. In the initial edition of Counter Strike, a woman who was good for female gamers (in the election of the terrorist force) was available to choose. However, in the latest version, the female character has been removed and replaced with another male character. I was surprised at the new version of those games playing games that were frustrated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the game map is too small. The largest map seems to be a map of the desert, but it has a detailed description of its criteria. In fact, all the maps of the game have standard graphics graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Collectively, I think "Half Life: Counter Strike" is the most non-curious first-person shooting game of all time. To play a lot better and more imaginative shooting games, so why waste your time in this annoying game? You are good to play Unreal Tournament, Quake and Dual Games. Avoid this over rate and over-hyped games. <br /> <br /> I give the game 1/10.
