Do you ever think that after seeing a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, it's very cool! We have to make a horror movie for a very soon." I think it's as tough "? Well, what happened through the mind of the young Campbell brother in 2003 should be, probably after Sam Raimar's "The Evil Dead" or similar independent horror classic. This "Demo Summer", but so shameful! These young amateur filmmakers must worship the awful style and know about their classic, but almost they do not gift them talented. I have seen some strange b-movies in my years as a terrible terrible, but this is considered to be one of the most well-made pieces. And this is very sad to be open heart, because the whole cast and crew definitely had good intentions. There are no scripts at all. Both of the lip stole a mysterious book from one left and while reading some paragraphs, one of them turns into a violent demon that kills the members of the various groups of teenagers: Darks, hot Catholics, Stoners and disorders. Without it, all compulsory clich√©s, such as the hot girl, for the biggest Dark etc. etc .. Of course it is really painful to listen and does not use this annoying thirteenth emissary! The script says that it will only remain fixed until it turns to contact with them. I hate it! Some of the make-up effects have some decent decent but still spectacular and soundtrack sometimes some of the most terrible punk-lyrics. This film should not have been released ... I can imagine that it was certainly fun to be part of production, but it is completely disrespectful and does not release the smallest relief material. Even amateur-nudity, not even a bit!
