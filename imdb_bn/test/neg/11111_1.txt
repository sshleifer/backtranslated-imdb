O my God ... where do you start? "False Terror" is one of the worst b-movies of all time. This shit look like "Demon Slayer" "Exorcist". Special note: A horror B-movie has at least one sexual scene. Do not expect this one even a hot girl. That irrational mistake should start with my absolute temperament. First of all, if you are going to create a horror giant film, you're a "cool" giant outfit. The monster of this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. There is no way to make Chupkbars (yes, this is how). Not looking at the film. Please be an actor in a Halloween outfit !! It looks so cheap to make me crazy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, And the vertebrae cord of the giant horror film, again, the producers decided not to spend for the effect of decent gore.The blood fakes look fake! The person who gets cut in two, please take a closer look.This is probably the best view of the film and it lasted for about ten seconds. The finishing is a very poor scene that will not satisfy you. <br /> <br /> To act in such movies The vignette should end till the end, but in this film it is exceeding terrible.Don't fool yourself for a 85-minute cast of nobodies with no acting experience. The specification is that a blonde guy who deserves to satisfy SWAT members with curly hair She is sick He coughing out is ridiculous. He is probably the worst actor in the movie B-Horror, no fun. Also, Captain Pen distributes a terrific performance in the first ten minutes of water. <br /> <br /> There is no real story behind Chupkabars. You can find that the monster sucks the goat's blood. Why bother with this shit? However, even if there are opportunities it does not even watch. Even if it does not air on the wire. <br /> <br /> I generally support low budget movie because people involved in them try to do something different than Hollywood, but this does not mean that other people like me can accept such garbage.
