* Spoilers here * <br /> <br /> How am I starting with this movie? 'Mole man's size, living under a garden affected by the residents of a big house !!!' When I was sitting to see the first of this movie, I was surprised that the plays where potter did not, etc., but the 10-inch high globes were difficult and hard to feel far away. Because I've conveyed it for viewing because I'd end up watching even more horror movies. This movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who had gone to sleep in the first ten minutes, seemed to find a good help to sleep that I was annoyed to see it all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know the fool is stupid and menacing as it is about. They were able to travel only one person "seriously" and they killed a cat before the explosion, the end. I mention sucked to suck it?
