Note, I only saw the last half of this movie, so that you feel neatly in my review with a reasonable estimate of salt, said that the star rating was enough for me to see what I saw, much more than I did. <br /> <br /> Short, it kills an inferior-plot of Chase Chase with a wonderful predecessor (NL Christmas Vacation), only there is no Chavez Chase, and it takes place on a generic tropical island with a connection to Christmas. Lose Shevro probably does not want because this plot was dropped from the real fun, instead he got the Scottic Cosine Eddy, who was once again original, but he is in the top and plots. And acting on a very poor basis for any movie. A degree of humor attempt is generic, where contemporary television comedy even trumps it and it is considered a comedy, I doubt that I have to say more. It does not have any of its qualities to look for, but it's for failure and again, how fast Hollywood has spread the blood of past life in search of her fast life. <br /> <br /> I think I will look at the origin before the upcoming Christmas season, just to try to recover my children's innocence, while the motion picture was higher than the high budget, but stupid, garbage.
