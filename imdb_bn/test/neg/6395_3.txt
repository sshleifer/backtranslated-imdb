The film should blame the script. Lion's Stanley Donn, director of Rain Fame, this celluloid mid-life crisis is not bad at all. It's some lovely scenes from Rio de Janeiro and circling each other around each other, and Samba sounds roaring around the ocean, but there are some fifty shows in Michael Kine, which is a small teenager Mitchell Johnson that makes you think ... good, sleazy . This story is also a full stretch. None other than the old studio executive of Hollywood could not make the embarrassment green. Maybe they can use kids as little Bambo as Arm Can Candy, which they forget their fat vault, which does not hold their appeal key, their huge Larry King-style shiny and yellow cigar-stained teeth. A bride is a subject of young sex workers to be pressed on the old man, but to marry her best friend? And then to throw yourself silently? Esse! There is nothing entertaining about that. It's rather sad and diverse. Demi Moore's emerging * cough * Take notes about talent.
