But to be a bit more precise, I do not think it can actually be bad. Eventhough actors (semi famous famous) do a very great job. Director fault? Could the script be difficult for me? However, if you are behind a lot of quiet guns and actions, then this is not a movie for you, but they wander through many WW2 vintage guns. Fun sort :) Well I guess I could say more but it does not seem to be okay. If you are frustrated enough or see Hackman Freak, do not do it otherwise! <br /> <br /> Stay up-to-date and improve
