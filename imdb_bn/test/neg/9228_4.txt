What does this movie really mean? A big piece of chin. This movie is like a sister and two brothers and Clyde, who create their own party lines to nurture their victims and to trap them and kill them. But for some reason? Just having fun with it away? In Richard Hutch comes to those who come across a sensual washy female lady. A real BAD version of a female man. And she gets involved with finding those behind all the murders across LA. She finally meets a teenager who helps her find the killer and rest for your fun and pleasure. But some part of this movie which really is going to be a scene with a live garret like wearing my mother's dress cloth dresses, acting like a screech in front of her sister says that she needs him and he can not live with him, slaps him in the face of defeats. I can not believe that I had faith !!! Well, I can guess. But it is valuable to watch but only seen one of Garrett's worst films.
