Kasparov vs Deep Blue is a suspicious story, but I do not think you'd like to know it by watching this movie. I think it gives a lot of attention to the conspiracy theory of IBM fraud ... and what does this theory depend on? The idea is that at one point the computer made such a move that "looked at people". I'm a chess grandmaster or computer scientist. And when I did not doubt that this step was looking at people, then I think that any strong chess-run computer that has ever created could possibly bring surprising steps ... or lose such a machine, even like Kasparov Talent The film gets very milestone beyond this theory and is not enough beyond the person involved ... which can make it even more interesting stories. The order relies heavily on the desires of an uninterruptedly eloquent description, and the imagery of the 18th Century chess-playing machine that you see in the Corniche looks like an animated Gypsy fortunate. Also the story of the many empty shots of revisiting the "empty scene" of Casparov was slow I do not doubt that Casparov and the chess community are suffering from IBM's behavior, but I do not think it's different from any other big corporation you found. At the end of the film, you feel that Casavov is a huge crewby and deep blue programmers are either victims or deceptions. I think that the filmmaker wanted to believe in the conspiracy theories of the audience (which he almost did), then he would have to submit more evidence. In fact, there was a better idea at the first place more evidence. The whole thing left me with a yeast taste.
