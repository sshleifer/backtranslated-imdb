I would say this is a background movie. Play it background as risky towards your busy work (laundry, email check, etc.). I thought it was a film that was successful after Amy Adams was anchored. Wrong! This was done in 2009! Screens / scripts are quite frightening. I love musicals but singing is not just average and move along the plot. Ughh. It often seems that it is based on cinematography for TV movies. Am i watching tv show <br /> <br /> Even the secretary started singing. What's going on in F @ $ #? Actually he seems to have good voice. Amy Adams Enchanted was so great. Lead Actors Average. Frustrated for sure This movie was good for a lifetime, but it's about it. :(
