Yes, when I was a little boyfriend, I was unaware of seeing this picture when his mother was a teacher and wanted to screen the movie and parents wanted to see if they could see an inappropriate scene. Other than the strange trick I think this was a clear, good funny joke and in a strange scene where a girl looks like Ernest. So yes, Ernest has been thrown into prison, such as a look and thanks for trying to flee and he has more things like he is getting magnetized at one moment, shooting power, and watching the very painful final flash. There are some pairs, but there is nothing remarkable except the carving gun from soap ... I think this is my only scene, or my friend's mother laughs suddenly This is the camp and I have seen only two Ernest films and I have not been following other movies from what I have seen. Ernest's small dose was good, but as soon as this movie is too short a movie. Although the pictures have made money, I think, especially what you need is a varney and a location and a theme and your movie.
