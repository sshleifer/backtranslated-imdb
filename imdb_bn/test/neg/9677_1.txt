How can this film be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I was John Voight and Mary Steinberg, then I would try to remove it from my CV. It was historically correct as Jasah and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded in Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew Lot, came back thousands of years before birth. The Canaanites captured the earth ... really? What is the writer thinking? It was simply ignorance ("I am Noah and the beast, and Lot and Canaan and the things that come out of the school on Sunday") or they are trying to convince the greatest number of people on the planet - from Christians, Jews and Muslims, historians , Archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... really, did anyone get disturbed? Anyone who was a modicum to taste would win this one!
