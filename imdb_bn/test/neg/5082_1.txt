Actually I am surprised to see that this movie has received relatively good reviews. I'll be perfectly honest and say that I got the only reason for Ryan Phillippe, especially because of the reasons for his involvement with an actor, although I think he has proved himself in the last few years. Good actors compared to their first major roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As long as action / suspense movies go, this film almost fails in every respect. Actually, I guess, but the script is absolutely terrible and little knowledge, it's a fact that the filmmaker tries to add unreasonable references to the chaos theory, as it is someone who really believes that the film is really cute. '- But then again, judging from another review, there was something. Do not be fooled: Script does not create an annoying, derivative mess, and any other elements of the film for it. Wesley Snipes probably did not have a less interesting role in a film, and Statham is a thoroughly dull actor. <br /> <br /> is not recommended.
