Peter Cushing and Donald Plasens Legendary Actor and Director Costas Carmenciasis was behind the famous Greek Gailo-Esquier thriller Death Kiss in 1974; And yet when you combine three genius, you will get all the loads of this drill full! God only knows that Peter Cushing and Donald Plasance's choices are these cheap devil worshipers wow bark barking, but I really hope they've got good payoffs and like their resume it is not worth getting as amateur. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some kids, lead them to another party to go after them. The plot speed is very slow and this film ensures very annoying. There is no doubt that the plot has seen something in the long way and the horror style and with even the passing interest. The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout life and the film is not managed to overcome it at any time. It's really a sad and sad watch and even a little decent finishing barrels have not operated until enough to lift this film from the very bottom. Very poor material and definitely do not recommend!
