Perhaps this is mine, but this film seems like a sitel or follow-up compared to a different project. Why? When it was painted (only a few years after the war) most visitors probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to Allay, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now 50 years later, <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Destiny Fox: The Story of Rommel "is a beautiful fight movie, but how Rommel's nickname can be told in any way is not correct. Considered as the greatest general of the army, why their soldiers had so much fear of African courtship - which is missing in this movie - we see the way to treat his fame, his character, soldiers and enemies, but F. We see that Hitler was complaining about his achievements in Africa, Telling him a joke etc. So, we're missing big pictures here - this is "the story of Rommel", but unfortunately "the desert Fox person "missing part.
