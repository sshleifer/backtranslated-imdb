I expected much more than what I got from watching this movie. I do not object to literary licenses, (if this should be said), especially when there is no attempt to say "on the basis of real story". But this movie is Beethoven - a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply bound in our musical experience and I hope the film can be true at least in the history of Elemental Elements. This movie has taken such a big exception from the historical record that it can only be frustrating. <br /> <br /> My idea (because I did not analyze this film) was true. With half way, I want to see the movie at IMDB. The rest of the movie was an extraordinary different experience. It was not true with the history that I was released because it was very difficult to believe a large part of the story. To enjoy this movie, I had to recognize it as a fiction, "if it's like it" story. The film lacked this honest demand. <br /> <br /> The 9th Symphony fiction was the most disappointing of me. The illustration in the film stretches my imagination towards disbelief. I finally doubt the truth in history than his relationship with Ludwig van Beethoven and Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an actor who plays the role and knows to keep yourself away from it and it was about and for this I give it a 3/10 <br /> <br /> Those who think that this movie is better than Amedas or not, they are not even the composer's life and watching for this movie really, ultimately it's a novel novel novel - decoration fiction.
