Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a great, depressing, hard to follow, where you are finally difficult to leave after some time where it is so complex <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it on weekdays starting with an entire house at my local Twin. At the end of the film it was less than a quarter. I have never seen such a massive gathering without the emergency in order to expel people. That would tell you how bad it is. I believe it's the worst movie ever created in front of the camera and behind such big talent ever created.
