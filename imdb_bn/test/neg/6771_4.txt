I know, we do not expect much from indie film in low budget. But the concept behind it is obvious: to open America's eyes for the middle-government relationship and to keep an eye on the journalists. But anyhow its documentary outlook leads away from its drama. Protests during the 2004 Republican Conference in New York were not compelled to make a documentary about it. Such protest protests belonged to the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It was good to stick to a play format. Perhaps a slow build up where the eyes of young journalists are slowly open conspiracy.
