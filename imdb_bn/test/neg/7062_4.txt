Elementary things survived as a classic. The "The Squawl" of 1929 is a classic everything, but not as intended. The story and the acting Mellodramatic, seems ridiculous today, especially in a seductive gypsy named Nina named after Mourina Laay. Imagine driving a young couple to break and steal a young couple of Dora Charles. Countless! However, many people know, when Laay first came to Hollywood, he did a number of foreign entrepreneurial roles. <br /> <br /> Concerned about this game, "Junk" Now in Hungary (Spain in the game) he escapes from his cruel master and invites himself to the home of the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joes), who is basically present at the door. One after another, the people of the Nabawi family and their pizagin say to the English, "Nubi is not bad, Nubi does not make anything wrong!") And indicates a wonderful gift. Family son Paul (Carroll No) is related to the beautiful Ima (Loretta Young) and can not wait to marry him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fusion is stuck with its character's hallmarks - bad English, whining and hysteria. With his bold makeup, peasant and curly hair, he is not only beautiful, but in the late 1980's - quite modern, although Richard Tucker reminds him to bring his hand back on his forehead, we think we're just getting silent. </ br /> TCM Robert Osborne comments that this picture is one of his secret pleasures. It is deliciously bad but it is not bad enough to sit again. It's bad - but we have a wonderful example of how far we've come, some did not go to Mirza Lane's comedies, how limited her career was.
