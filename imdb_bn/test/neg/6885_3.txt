This episode has just been broadcast in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The sunny heavy hand touch is sick, the boy and refrain from what could be a pretty good story. I can not believe that Jerry Br√ºhaimmer allowed this episode. I saw the previous episode before this show, even in this episode where Jack made his own old voice move towards this episode. The gay kiss was unpleasant sensational. <br /> <br /> There was no continuity from the previous episode. There was nothing in Martin's dangerous behavior or the investigation of possible drug addiction. There is nothing clearly written about Jack's growing relationship with Anne. Generally, this continuation of a series without a trace is quite good. <br /> <br /> The next episode needs a significant improvement.
