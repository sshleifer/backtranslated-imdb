George and Mildred were in the mid-1970s, the seat was less than the people's house. Although I did not see the series after the last broadcast, but I remember that most of the comedy that is coming to live near the Snobbish Farmmil family seems to be pretty fun with most of the jokes, love of this native without such a boyfriend racist Gaga <br /> <br /> I asked myself "big screen version" of the program, what is this a big screen version? Certainly not a popular mid-70s or less com in the same name. For some reason George George and Milldaler are going to the streets going to the street and George has contacted all the characters from television due to the involvement of some serious gangsters who have taken some seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, confused with the film series carrier. In many ways it feels similar to the same mistake of the next harmful in the space film, that it does not match with the series
