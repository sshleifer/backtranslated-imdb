It starts like a very serious social commentary, which quickly thinks of others as clerical films, bullies, etc. But as soon as soon as it is, it is descended to a direction-less world. Who is the main character? Is it a serious film or something on Gregg Araki-esquire top spy movie? Is this a scale documentary moments inserted in the dialogue? I have no information. I saw myself watch and wonder when this turd would end. I was thinking that the result of some big shock that never came. I spent 20 minutes better with the movie through fast forwarding through an uninterrupted skate scene. Yes, it illustrates the changed landscape instead. I got the way back to the beginning. The children and bulls acted in such a way that I actually felt that I saw the authenticity of the group's friends. Wassup very staged, badly produced and never felt bad acting. Teenage cavomen, which Larry did not write but did not directly, was terrible. But at least it seemed like a terrible movie, which did not take it seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.
