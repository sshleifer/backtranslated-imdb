I felt another comment was added after a breathless gushing look. This movie was taken to see this movie as a child of my unknown parent, hope normal Normal Wisdom Jolly Rope Comedy. Instead, what you get is the worst kind of British sex comedy, where Norman (Norman!) Aims to swim as much as possible 'birds'. The norm of the norm - poorly portrayed and acted, there is no similarity to the worst kind of bi-proponent of a script and the vague indications of 'arrogant'. And all apparently the special grained film stock that was reserved for the British budget films of the 1960s-1970s. The only memorable thing is the annoying interesting theme tune that still pops up in my brain after 30-odd years. Finally, in the last scene you will see the Norman nude - looking for running sand and frozen throughout. Whatever I think - at that time my mother took me out of the movie. I saw it again many years later, and guess what, it was still terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or a little person and have an interest in his career, then you '10-foot-bargipol' rules. Believe me, you do not have to look behind Norman Wisdom.
