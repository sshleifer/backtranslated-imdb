I decided to watch this movie because I did not see the carol lombar before any movie. I'm sorry it will be one of these because, quite clearly, this is a dog ?? Even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of which are great actors. The problem of the film is simple: it tries to make a very young lawyer's story very early (played with John Mansion Stewart) who wins Jane (played by London) in an hour to meet him. What is that cliché? In a short time, this story is a series of episodes that show the poor financial condition of the couple, their problems with the live mother of the masses, the struggles of their struggle, the public's public status in the public office, their child boy. The arrival of John John Jenner (unexpected and excessive friction at home with his mother), couples are annoyed about their marriage, which is a child's illness , Thus requiring a heroic flight. The only pilot (in a fierce storm) is to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally the junior partner of the public legal agency was accepted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />? Maybe soon after the mother's death? There were not many comedy; The drama was not good, it was the best; The dialog was difficult to hear. The performance of only four main players was enough. <br /> <br /> What was the time for this long period to come out of the US recession? Many of whom have had experience of all the events portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> So, the sense of re-establishment in the sense of goodness for Selganik was understood as' American values ​​of family, relationships, valor, perseverance, and initiative? ? All against "average" backdrop of American family Which is better than Jimmy Stewart and Carroll Lamber? <br /> <br /> and noted that this film was released in early 1939; So, was planned in 1938? Soon after the start of production for the upcoming World War II in the United States. So, this kind of movie was a great helper for the general public, many people would join England in the war at that time. Many people know that Hollywood and Washington formed a helpless alliance before and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad I saw ?? As part of the incisive social-political campaign. However, I would have to look at other lobber movies to gain a better understanding of its acting range. <br /> <br /> Another critic noted: You only see all Stuart movies; Otherwise, do not bother.
