I can not remember anything, I repeat, something positive about this "movie"! The entire 1 hour and 45 minute movie can be shrunk in a small 5-minute movie! In most cases, nothing is going on and nothing seems to be left on the recording of the camera only to increase the time of the film! What you are seeing is someone walking around the background or watching TV with a specific subject or even talking about it! I just lost my 105 minutes, my family and my friends for nothing at weekends! If a movie is made poorly or the scene is not as great as any other story, at least it can debate something about it, but about DISTANT, I simply call it a "movie" because it's the motion picture recorded by a camera <br /> < br /> <br /> If you do not see it, imagine a 105-minute long movie based on two-three lines of the story! Will you end up 5% content and admission 95%! How exactly was "remote" for us at least! Actors had a great acting role to play, there was nothing special in them, they rarely spoke or showed a special passion! I put this movie in a cover section which I rely on reading behind its cover. I still wonder what was fun other than our face after watching movies.
