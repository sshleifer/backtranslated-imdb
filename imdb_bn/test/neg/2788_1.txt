Let's start by admitting that there are three types of horror films: good, bad, and totally embarrassing rail that enjoys every way through the whole way. Gorgeous Harvest promises great with its craftsman's DVD cover, but the show is closed where the show is closed. Following a disgraceful opening montage, we soon discovered that this film was very badly involved in highly written scripts, highly qualified (even for a new movie), devastating light, and even worse effects. Frankly, someone can not afford more than a villain's mask, or did they think it was good enough for Jason Bhurash and Michael Mayers, so good enough for us? Well, it did not work to create a scary villain. At any rate, this is a movie that lets you check your watch, breathe and curse your own glutability. The timing of each scene is painful, and there is a feeling of middle school full production (remember, I saw good middle school stage productions, directly in special effects). I am trying to think of some ways to finish this review on positive note, so I will give all copies of this train to the ruins of Water Coaster, Frisbee, as a wind chamber ........ I'll say "see your own", but it Be cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of this production company reviews and you'll find the same for each of their movies. They demand the agreement of the film and the audience (as please by the fans), what they did is shiny and dumped a load on our head (for which I am sure they have rarely seen it for). <br /> <br /> Sorry people, high rating and favorable reviews are clearly posted directly or indirectly directly to this post. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars because it is the lowest possible rating. Even one of them makes me angry.
