I totally agree This is "pitch black underground" and a well-made plot. I think the best scenes were passing through the paths of invisible, infinitely lesser paths, some of them were harmful. The scenery was great. They delivered the main "Alien" Tooth with CGI badboys, have been quite well done in the movie. What they have to do is sometimes not shown to a monster, but everyone is surprised and follow Jack's family crazy, and it can be a top rated hitcoach-style thriller, possibly offering medals. Not acting bad But those rubber-bets just reduce fares to rent it.
