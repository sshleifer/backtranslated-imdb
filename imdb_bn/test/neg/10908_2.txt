Another first: this French film is about my identity to Irish Roeh. Probably when I say this is probably the movie of my last rom, but I relied on Roman's monotonous philosophical conversations that I could stop immediately at the point where I could reach the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters talk about love which I did not think would be the end. Actually, what I have tried, I did not understand why Rohither is so much respected in the cinephile. He hit me as one of the undesirable petulant people who filled me with warm air. This is a sample about what her movie is, I'm not interested. I do not care much for French cinemas (usually a fault reflective and speculative), so perhaps I favor.
