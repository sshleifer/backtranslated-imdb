This movie was really stupid and I thought it was not very bad and I could bear a movie in the bed eating people. Then the part where the man's skeleton has finally reached the top of the film is the cherry. I could see plastic skeleton hand screws for welfare sakes. The brother was still alive and his hand was bare bone while moving. The funny thing is that he was still not right that he moved his hand. Without muscles, you really did not move your hands but he did. He should have been given death even before his brother extended his hand. The movie was not great but it was just right up to the hand scene. I smiled so hard that I do not think how it ended. It was something with foam or something.
