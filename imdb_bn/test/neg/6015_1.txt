What is the matter? This has not been done before, well? And again? Why does Warner Harjog waste his good talent and time with junk like this? She should not be shooting a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> Everyone started to feel fake from the very beginning. Warner Herzegou did not want to make a film on the subject of the Nice mythological - at least not on the small scale surrounded by the victims - so the plot was not believable from the beginning. Actors were definitely acting like they are acting like they are not acting. The story was not funny, the "everyday people" needed in every piece were invisible, the personality was stupid, the jokes were not funny, the effects were disrespectful and the last is not seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> I just do not see the point. This is a fake movie about a fake film. Haha Probably, those who recognize such a movie wanted to ridicule someone who could find out the real real hell, now there might be some possible possibilities. But Herzog is not a believer and is not claimed to be. There was a lot of enthusiasm about cryptosologists in the crowd. <br /> <br /> It was a miss.
