The real problem with this story is that the story does not have many stories. There are no plots to talk about. Widower bought an electric grandma for her kids. One child electric grandma prevention. Then finally took her. Then the children grew and granny leaves. Really, very little happens. This is much more than a story. Moreover, it's schmaltz strip it, and you have a story which has already been done, and better: alone. The same basic idea: Initially, a robot can not accept the love, because it only causes the machine, finally yields and comes to love the robot. The biggest difference is the lonelihood more powerful, because both the heroes and we, the audience suddenly came back to the reality and were forced to remember that the robot is actually a process. <br /> <br /> I discovered a highly blamed story that electric grandmother only * very * perfect. He is not just "human", he * super-human *. He is more knowledgeable than a real person, he has no sign of mechanism, and he has removed marbles from thin air. It really believes that he is a machine.
