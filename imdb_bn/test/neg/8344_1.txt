I saw this movie and I thought it was a stupid movie. Who believed the idea of ​​a volcano in Los Angeles? In fact there are no volcano in Los Angeles. This film should not be portrayed in Los Angeles, it should be honored by Honolulu in Hawaii. There is a volcano in Hawaii, which is a true fact that this film should be made in the state capital of Hawaii. This film should be portrayed in Hawaii because it is not the real idea and Los Angeles. Earthquake in Los Angeles, but there is no volcano. Be honest with you, this incredible nonsense and very stupid. In conclusion, I will not be disturbed with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but a fool.
