This movie looked amazing on the cover and I honestly thought 'how bad can it be?' Little did I know. The gate out conversation was impossible. It was not unrealistic, and even interesting to adopt. More natural words in the UPN syndicated television shows dialogue The story was impossible and the end was almost zero playoff. The end with the snake seemed almost confusing and on stage. The only remote character, Rose McGowell, who is silent, which prevented him from destroying Clive with extended rubbish dialogue (well, until he speaks even until the end). McGowell's nude scene is the only one or more than one after another. Really terrible. Save yourself and hire something more interesting like Barney Video.
