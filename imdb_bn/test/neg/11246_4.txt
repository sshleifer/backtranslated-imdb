... This movie movie ticket price is not just right. How can the filmmakers do not know how to make movies? Rather, they have selected Solar students of some diversity (although the reviews are not as diverse as recommended) and have separated them. The results are brutally pure, much more annoying, self-motivated, over-exposed and truly deeply charitable. <br /> <br /> Of course, this type of recognition and identification is possible only in documentary film, but there is no more truth than "Bully" here, or, in that case, a similar TV documentary. Although there is talk of sex and sexual diversity and racialism, the film does not come in a table that would seriously use any of these problems, thinking about it. And when some parts comic (highly respected) does not provide any other purpose than comic injections, but at least 5-minute limit becomes emotionally involved with the students. An interesting idea, but the thumbs down for the chain camera.
