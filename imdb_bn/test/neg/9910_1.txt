This movie will be the worst movie I've seen. There is a reason it has been created to be a MOW (Movie Movie). Continuity was all wrong (although there were palm trees in Chicago settings despite being portrayed in Canada Toronto), the impact was left to be desired for 2004. Hello "Ring lord" was better than CGI. But I guess they had money for them. The budget will definitely affect the outcome, but anyone who calls this MOW more than 2 will have to go back to film and TV school again. Next time remember that care and time does not make a classic like running for a tornado box office or TV slash hit. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that footage can be reused from old networks or approved but uses 80 footage in 2004? I have a hard time buying that.
