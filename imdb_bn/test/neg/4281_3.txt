Being a great fan of Disney, I was really frustrated when I saw this trash. The animation was beautiful, and the background was wonderful, but I believe that good animation is not created for a weak script, and weak stories. I would like to disagree with people who are not suitable for boys. Yes, there are some deaths in the film, but at least there is no death which children should express at least? But I have no hesitation. The script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes ... kind of I could expect from the movie of dreamssts. The song was obscure, morally compulsory (and without any magician.) And the character would burst into song completely incomprehensible. The letters were also cold, and I could not really raise any kind of emotion (bar irritation) to them. I am a great fan of Jungle book, Aladin and Emperor's new croaking, but this Disney movie was a total and rough time ... do not see it !!!
