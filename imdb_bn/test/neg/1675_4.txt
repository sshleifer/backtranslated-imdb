When this film was created in 1980, I was a teenager playing football as part of the audience. This was done in Muschette of Illinois. At the top of the stand was a large character spelled "Muscheyart" covered with a movie banner. The director said loudly, at some points, that the touchdown was being made. St. Charles Cuvanile Correction Center Mooseheart is a real place less than 30 miles, although I think it may be closed off recently. During a scene, they are seeing a black woman and a white man in the audience. Right below them, you can see my sister Nell's head (she was 11 at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of his head, but in 1981 I saw on TV that I could see his whole head and my sister, Jacques. <br /> <br /> I was thinking the movie itself was just for TV made for movies. Since the movie already has a story here, so do not have to repeat it. It's worth watching at least once.
