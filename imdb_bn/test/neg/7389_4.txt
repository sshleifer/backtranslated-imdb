With a bad movie, but a reel that is worth savoring. For most of the pictures, the trick is bad, the song is bad, even Dr. Field is bad Then there is a sequence with Bob Hope and his film; The dialogue is malicious and the song (a version of "Thanks for the memory") is light, humorous and delightful. Who is parachuted for this one bit? Yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents.
