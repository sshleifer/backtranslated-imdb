In the 1960s, those of us who had bad movie aficionados, were "the outer space from Plan Nine" ever made to the worst movies, and so remain for all time. To keep things from the point of view, we thought that the new car had to pay $ 3,000. <br /> <br /> As we grew up, our innocence got torn apart as we were open to movies "New York's Hercules" and "Memory Bank Overdraw", which completely redefined the "bad movie" genre. In this context, last night, my son and I saw "Eliens to LA", which considered the envelope to be a very unimaginable one generation ago. This film fails to completely fail to call "bad" (or rogue or executed), as there are other labels in English. Even if there are words that can be correctly described in this film, they will be banned in civilized society. <br /> <br /> Allian Kathy Ireland, mentioned in this title, was played by Ireland, who apparently took some time off to stop her cinematic career, modeling swimsuit for Sports Illustrated. His casting might seem like a little recommendation, until you actually see the movie. Makeup artists have made their money to make Cathy so unexpected and unexpected, you do not want to touch her at the end of a bromstick - there is no average achievement. To make this a fool, this movie has its face that will erase Meduco. Even worse than his appearance, there was his voice, which was so helpless that I failed to credit it as soon as I was born with the man. Throughout the film, I wished for a chocolate to draw his nails to pull myself in my nails. At the end of the film, Katie finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her favorite swimsuit. I told my son that if the movie puts swimwear on the swim, then the film will be better, so at least we have to see something. My son realized that if they move the swimsuit and sprinkle it in their mouth, it must have improved the movie in two numbers. I suspended his illumination of observations. If you have any doubt, then compare this drake in "barbarella", where a well-liked filmmaker shows how fantasy can be utilized in a beautiful female leading lady of the genre. <br /> <br /> This plot itself, there is nothing to comment on, because the evidence was not found. It is said that if one million monkeys typed unintentionally for millions of years, they would eventually bring a "Hamlet". By the elimination process, the rest of the time they will come up with some of this playplay. Imagine, if you, Alice, in a modern day, fall into a hole and drop 500 feet onto a rock slab, after that she gets up, gives herself dust and starts looking for her long lost father in the city-state of Atlantis. . Once in Atlantis, he climbs, wars, or stairs and stairs most of his time, and basically try to get out of the hands of a common man, who thinks there is no soldier and he will see Tiny Team. Masculine This short, as soon as it appears, is probably more than the shooting script. <br /> <br /> Plus, as well as accept the value of the production quality and the set and the clothes you can do. Smoke and smoke, you realize that it's a movie that you can actually see on the screen where went to the $ 20 budget. <br /> <br /> I began to think that filmmakers are more likely to lead to the results of "Allen from the movie" when drug and alcohol access is given during a film shooting, although in fairness I must admit that they are actually I do not know if it is involved in substance misuse. , Or the brain was dead only at the beginning of the project.
