I think this is the first time that I will go through a theater and be so frustrated. I went to see why "Asterix at Les Vikings" was one of two reasons: as the first film and the second big Astérix fan. Second <br /> <br /> The film does not fulfill any request. It's just a big animated mess and it proves that the Asterix franchise is getting worse. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was after the death of first painter Rosen Goskin in 1977. His trusted collaborator, painting Albert Udroo took his place, but the following books were lacking quality standards in the Goswami years. <br /> <br /> "Astérix et les Normands", based on the book "Asterix at Les Vikings", which was published during the reign of Goscany. The basic story is the same: Gaururiks, the nephew of AbrarCorkers comes to the village and gives Ashteriks and Obelix To become a real person, when the vikings are afraid, it comes to discover, because fear seems fearful. <br /> <br /> There are similar matches. The story is a non-stop series of laughing, sunny and delightful dialogue, which allows Vikings to scare away and escape from the gull. The movie is stupid, unbreakable, fast, authentic ... well, just give a default name and it is possible to apply. <br /> <br /> The difference between books and movies could have been better in movies. But the new ideas are simply boring in a sloping straw. Older Asterix movies like "Asterix le Gouloues", which are often better than transferring lines, move one by one more easily. <br /> <br /> Animation's other 21st-century films have quality but it has errors and no film Beginner may find fault. The best example is consistency wrong, where in the same sequence the fraction of the second followed the next day. <br /> <br /> Imagine that. They have taken animation studio from numerous countries and they still can not make enough films. <br /> <br /> The original story changes are simply helpless. And even if they were still there was no original story. In this movie of Gaururiks, there is a pet kabutara, whose name works as SMS and its cellphone (!). Grossebaf, a rebel girl, father of Viking Chief, is Abba (!) And she constantly denies her father's authority. Also a stupid Viking wizard, his cartoonist fool and muscular boy, the faithful bride of GrossSchef who was covered by decoration (his name vik!) And ... well I can not stand anymore. <br /> <We are far from original gags from original books The biggest problem is the difficulty of moving pictures on the big screen, mainly because the greatest smiles in the book come from oral jokes and visual gags, which do not have the same appeal in the theater screen. I think the biggest moments in the book were the names of the obelox inventor (which ended in 'F') and the Goururiks tries to ridicule them humorously. <br /> <br /> And if everything is not enough, some of the campaign staff have decided to write in the movie poster that there is already an existing cinematic Diane song that will be featured in the final credits. It was a new song, I could understand. But using an old song, another evidence suggests that the film is so badly created that they are ready to do something to attract filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and endless that we can not go beyond the theater. In the summer of liberation war, it can not just hurt ... <br /> <br /> Another acceptable point of the movie is how to become brave bravery. His psychological transformation in the book is not very spontaneous and credible, it is even better portrayed in the film and the motivation point is more credible. <br /> <br /> So if you do not see the movie yet it will waste your money. Instead of grab the book. <br /> <br /> Oh Rainy, why did you leave us?
