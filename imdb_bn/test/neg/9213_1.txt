Why I dislike movies, except for the stupidity of the actors, one can truly believe that shit. <br /> <br /> First, the second seat of Christ will be at the end of the word, and when Jesus Christ comes on the Day of Judgment, He will not come as he did before mankind. He will come to God's full glory like God and not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will be! Second, I saw the ever gay pride illustrated in this film, "Last night I read the Bible and it can not be written anywhere". Well, that's it. Moses said at 3 different events that men love other men, or women who love each other, such as men and women, have to be killed because they will never be the heir to the kingdom of God! If the truth is for us to follow the Bible word, then the execution will be executed, is not it? But I think wrong people do more damage than this loss ... it was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are many madness in psychological wards who think they are God's son, but after a movie it makes sense how stupid you can really make a movie.
