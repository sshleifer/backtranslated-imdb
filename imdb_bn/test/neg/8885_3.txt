This movie had very few good points, was awesome to ensure special effects and acting. But it was a movie made in a low budget so that you do not expect much from it, there are some laughs in it (I doubt if they are motivated :)). The scene where the old woman jumps down and touches the goat on the ground, then puts her in the nose and goes silently! A really stupid rasppy voice was invaluable. If you do not have anything else to look at and just want to try cash for the success of the Blair Witch project, do not bother it, but just want to laugh at a vague flickr.
