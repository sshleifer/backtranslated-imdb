Well they made a new pumpkin head film again, the first pumpkin head film was perfect for its time, a stupid, gory, and clich√©d giant flick. So how it goes, some loses their loved ones, drowns in the jungle, they get a pumpkin head raised and it is responsible for killing them. Unfortunately, filmmakers think it is irrelevant to try for the fourth episode, it is considered more suitable for adding some Worm Romo and Juliet sub-plots, among which a stupid family conflict (!!! !!!) and some amazing surprises Pumpkin head slayings, begun so far, but this does not stop the talent played in this glow is terrible ... oh so Even without half of a Southern accent should not be placed in their native attire accents and often in the slipping. Lans Henriksson is on board so surely he will bring some seriousness in the film's work ... but no lens just does not chat on the screen, the words do not completely stop the mouth with any emotion or seemingly and walk again, I really think Turned for money, then drunk and then went to his trailer to remember about Alien. <br /> <br /> This picture has a complete cack, it has no other redeeming features than the end of credit. /> <br /> Despite the facebook failures ... if you want a brain, it will let you laugh for all the wrong reasons <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More meat and originality To avoid
