I'm sorry but I agree that it was not a good movie. Yes, it looked visually well, but the story was about to run the story and I must have told the story for a long time. How in the world they manage to slip some of those plot-holes behind the critics. Good story and I would give it a high vote but I was unable to do it and still able to live with me. I've always had a fan in the scary movie, and the preview has really fooled me. All the scary scenes are shown in the preview. And why did the house hang out for the family killed? Why did the father come back again? Why did he decide to kill in the first place? Why do children only see the ghost? There are many questions, not enough answers. If I could give it a zero, I did.
