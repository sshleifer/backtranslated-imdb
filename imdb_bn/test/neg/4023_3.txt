The original story had all the elements to make a thorough gripping film. But this version failed unfortunately, even Cherry Lungio was a pale imitation of what was going on - so much that I suspected that he must be the last owner. According to the advice of Sir Arthur Con Doyle, Sherlock Holmes became a warrior? Actually it was Dr. Watson who showed a little common sense. Looked like a black black belt from Andaman Island, he could not get out of the paper bag and the old Scotland Yard could not have dreamed of what Villain was doing to feed his tea at Unemployed Street. So please have their black museum in this block museum.
