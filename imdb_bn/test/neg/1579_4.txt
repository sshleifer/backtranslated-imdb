I am a big fan of ABC movies of the week. I was only 27 years old, which means that I was not even born until the series ended, but I tried to collect them as soon as possible in the DVD. I have about a dozen or so. I was just excited to see such a wonderful thing about this movie here and somewhere else, I was really excited to see it. I just received my mail dvd today and saw it worryingly. I will admit that the first one or two phone calls give me the cripps - someone who gives the crypt of the boy's voice! But the rush was stopped and the whole divorce concubine was stupid. I thought that Michael Douglas was a rival about half an hour before the end of the film. After learning about the story about Elizabeth Ashley's story about how her mother locked her mother, I knew it was somewhat uncertain. Plus, no one could ever ask him why he suddenly appeared on the night when the fire was set on fire? I thought he was coaching to call the boy in school. I did not guess the silent boy's part or the previously recorded tape (did they ever say that the voice was really? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice?) <br /> <br /> I'm just giving four out of ten of this movie Because I actually liked most of it. Esal is particularly good. It's embarrassing because this movie has such a big documentary, but oh well, sometimes what happens when someone is very much hopeful for the movie.
