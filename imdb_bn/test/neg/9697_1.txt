This movie can be a printed epic, but the manufacturers have tried their best to think that they are stupid. Even in this movie God does not protect himself, in which the children of his child have jokes. The results are reprehensible and annoying. Only those who are not interested in seeing a cheap parody in the bible story might see the film without being ashamed. The makers of this stupid production, 'Il Vangelelo sevano mateo' (Messi according to Matthew), saw a movie of Pierre Paulo Pasolini, which shows that Bible words are not unnecessary for creating good stories; The most influential results are obtained by a sincere presentation of plain text itself.
