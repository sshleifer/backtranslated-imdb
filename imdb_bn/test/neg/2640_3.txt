In the quiet city, some girls kill a friend named Milo, one of their friends in the town, who lives on the other side of the city. After the murder, his body was found in the river and his spoken dead So 16 years later, a married girl came back to her childhood town and Claire a school teacher was scared that Milo did not die because she has a repetitive viewpoint and her friends are dying after one and nobody claims her Milo It is different. So now, he's off to find the terrible truths. <br /> <br /> When I came across this picture, I was very skeptical about it, especially when it was on the front cover of "Unconductor Builders", but behind the video case, the strange little plot outline reads, it seems right. Refresh to change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a completely different story while watching movies. It was just trying to work hard to be smart and very psycho-based, but the next version did not come well for me and it was originally a prolonged and mostly uncomfortable thriller. Hey, I'll admit it was his moments, but it's enough to cool enough, or enough to make memorable. However, for a filmmaker, a broovo, at least the story is "screen" and the shock is a rehearsal of slash reminder, no self-referential humor is clear? Actually humor is not even a hint. Although, was it very serious? Especially because the plot is rather weird, but it is not its main problem. If we get a discrete plot, I do not know about what's happening, it seems that some things skim many things in favor for frustrating and annoying sequences. No! Irrelevant scenes and java edving clich√©s that we like to watch from time to time. You can also see some of the effects of some of the "good" 70's horror movies, one is "do not see it now". This is when our main character keeps on watching a slicker his past image. Another person should be my darling "Alice, Sweet Alice", for the person wearing yellow mockery and death of hardships. Interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and many faults pop up. When the scenes deal with the childhood of the style, I like more because performance and circumstances were unclear about it, but when it leaned towards their adult, in most cases it was tired and uncomfortable and the performance was not horrible, but incredibly dumb and very There is a good way of putting it in less involved. Most of the conversations made me wonder how incredible and painful it was. You will be yelling "no soul!" On the screen, because you can not believe what you hear. Police detectives beat it! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Very sticky stuff. With some inventor and prominent camera angle and a fuzzy score that works reasonably well. Another reason that stood and Moody had a key to build in the atmosphere, it has decreasing sound effects and that bicycle bell kept a ring sensor in your ears. A calm primary school setting has been done well and the rest of the actions take place in a home. However, this realization will not be expected as any real mystery or surprise. Deaths are not happy, and they try to bother you with what happens to those organizations that are gently bloody and what happened next. This piece of villain, moderate child Milo Zyder was silently unknown, that was made an impression to start with the voice and yellow slicker, but when we came to the conclusion of the film, it lost its effect. The Chasey tag lines of the video make him compare Jason (moved) Freddy and (not this child's play) wheel, but you got to have fun with me! Right? He labeled "evil new face", yes sure. He is taught to solve some modesty and problems needed. Overall, the film gave me a yeast taste, as I have not seen. I've probably done it. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much in this blur of a film. Or, even better, exclude it, you will not be missing too much, really.
