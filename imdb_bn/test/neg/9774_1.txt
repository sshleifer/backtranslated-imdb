Actually, I do not have fun with people here, and I do not believe how many people really have given a really positive review! Oh wait, his IMDB comments section, fool me At this moment, remember that there are not enough votes to give this film ten ratings at the moment, but there are several comments on this film. Does this mean I wonder? However, scripts are scary. Characters keep vaguely running movies along with something similar to a motion, changing their personality and motivation and every view towards action. It was not even folly behavior, that was, but the script displayed pure idiocy characters beyond any fools crossed. For example: There are two corpses in the Karl desert and the "killer is out of nowhere" is disobeying the order, so he compelled everyone to travel 40 kilometers to find murderers, disobeyed orders and shot them all. When the hero shows something nasty in the dark and warns Karl, Karl considers our hero to be stupid and there is nothing there, so they are all going home. The next scene, he refused to let go of it and whatever it must be hunting down. It's just a joke. Yes, the giant is very impressive, but what people say only tries to discard its interesting points, and predators and isolated moments are very tiring. And the end ... the end!?!? Jesus .... I saw the worst movie years, and I saw Bug Buster!
