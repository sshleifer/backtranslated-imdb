The box is basically why I chose this movie and why I hired it. But I soon learned that I was guilty. I think this movie will be something like Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie contract. But I was wrong. This movie I've seen for the longest is the most cruel. Unrated version teases you into watching but you will be completely frustrated. The effect of terrible and sound acting was just gaudy. It was presented in a very low budget with the entire setting of the same building. Go out and get a Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can not believe the national lamps have named it. Do not buy it, do not rent it. Do not waste your life 2 hours on this.
