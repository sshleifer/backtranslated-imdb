Certainly not a good movie but on the other hand it will be as bad as anything else. Max's nightmare tells the story of a man, his face was usually isolated in a special flashback scene, his revenge on his direct victims and his indirect revenge on his life - especially the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays artist with his ideal flash, though limited flash. Actually, I thought he gave his best performance. What does it mean? Mitchell wears an eye patch, continually smokes cigarettes, wears a thick tonic and wax speaks to its creations. They are not your normal wax dummies, but rather some organisms controlled by serum, which makes them lose control of all their neurological functions. They become dominant zombies. I did not think if there is any other innovation here. It has some ridiculous explanations, but the plot is to serve. This is a 60s movie that has been confirmed by some cycling cameras - it's a bust town and a company. Acting medieval but Mitchell, Scott Brady, and Barry Croser give attractive passions. Wax paintings of the Baigon era of Hollywood were executed very effectively and most of the positions in the shooting were very credible. The end of the movie is not a real thing - another example of cultural film 60 or the end of the creativity of the script writer. I'm banking on the next. Despite his many flaws, I enjoyed the film. An actor was shown to be effective as an open firefly effectively acting as a police smuggling.
