The way they publish information to the audience (the movie will earn) I made myself wonder why he never said or mentioned that at the beginning that Then the whole path was probably not necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why he shot, and of course he is not guilty. It is very bad that the producer / director used Flashbacks this way, but on the other hand the movie was not valuable. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie for a rainy season, killing a big bag of chips.
