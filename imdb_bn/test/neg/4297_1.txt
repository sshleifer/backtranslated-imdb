As a flying and fighting movie buff, this is the place he's ranked below my list. It is historically completely wrong and sounds cast and they are out of high school. The acting, the scripts, the direction, the production value and the welding are all garbage. Only saving grace is some of the flying sequences. If they are fantastic, then I can rate it, but if there is something that disturbs me from something else in the film, it's history and the great people they are trying to try, it did! It is almost as if they try to write as much as possible the significant WW1 personality. There are a lot of flying movies flying in the WW1 and it's not one of them.
