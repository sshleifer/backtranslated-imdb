It is definitely a French film. This is an idealist / revolutionary / anarchist group of young people. It comes very slowly. Takes long. Closeups off A minute or more time to complete a pipe discussion with hash / opium. A group overturns a car and took a long time how it burned it. This is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so about one-third they were unreadable. (Why did they do it?) I came out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this image is not going anywhere, slow. I was not the first to walk. I went to the first film of my long lifetime. (Well, maybe second.)
