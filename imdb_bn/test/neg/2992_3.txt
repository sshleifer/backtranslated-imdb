There seems to be many fans of this movie here, but I found it boring, slow, scary, and vain. And I enjoy a lot of art-house and independent movies and so I do not expect an action movie. I am not sympathetic with both characters. The rural man was a bad guest and was not trying hard to find a job, and Istanbul was his relative humorous and stopped mentally. <br /> <br /> In an interview with the DVD, the director says that this film is about a common situation in Turkey - because of the people left in the village, there is no job and they are coming to Istanbul and are with relatives during the trying time. Find work That's interesting to myself, but the movie was not there.
