I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made and it was created by the director who created my most favorite films - "Exclibure". I was floating to see that I got a grade over six. This movie sucks. It looked terrible. It was shot within 18 days and it seems that Borman was sleeping while managing it. Arquette is not something. Only a little blight, rotten, unbearable, and probably the only fault in Boorman's celebrated career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
