I did not see the preview of this film. Jennifer acknowledged Lynch's name and seeing the 18th certificate, I realized that it might be annoying. In reality, I found this movie. I found myself riggling in disbelief through part of it. Acting violent - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. Although I do not allow scripts to interact with a credible character, I regret the performers. After some sudden incident, (there are plenty of "try" and shock to the audience in this movie), 2 letters share a beer and talk about the weather. Everything was too heavy, or it was really clear when it was tricky! Stefani's role of the little girl character was the best thing about the movie. Cool and intense. I could not really recommend this film to anyone. Without its dot, its violent, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad scripts and plain silly.
