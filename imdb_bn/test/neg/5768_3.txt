The storyline is a shocking closing claim, Jumper has made an agreement with the devil to get the gold, and it is forever forced to protect it. A bunch of friends finds gold and gets talking through old mines and they are forced to fly gold smithereens for sending back to hell. <br /> <br /> I seriously ... How did this picture win the Oscars for the movie? An engaging story running from a claim jumper directly out of the 1800's late 1800's. I love how you can not kill the monster in other movies, but they can shake it ... they can write the giant as an integral part of the movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Elm is part of the road 4 but this image is not like a 5-star classic. <br /> <br /> When the brightness of this movie is presented to a girl who never went to school, she never left. The city has learned to read or write ...... Still speaks in perfect English, smoking hot and wearing latest fashion. How was Oscar missing? <br /> <br /> Well, I've done a bad comedy, this movie is pure brown, and only if you do not have anything good to see and all spices of spice rack are already alphabetical. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2
