I can all smile. How nice. I like Jim Onnsky's movie, I really do. I mean, the shopping mall is a classic. But what happened to this man? He used to make funny horror films, which tried to be good. But it was hardly funny ... I mean, I guess, because I laugh. Villain is incredible. I mean, awesome CGI. It shows ... terrible. And there are no movies in the movie, and there are no nudity traits. It is rated PG-13. You know that a movie called "sister eater" will not be a blockbuster movie, you know that it probably will not be a smart script. A movie like this could depend on Gore ... but not so. It really does not matter, it's just ... shit If you want to laugh, check it out. But do not expect a good movie. I hope Jim Winrosky will go back to films like Chopping Mall and Gholie's Square, because this and Comodo B. Cobra is not spending
