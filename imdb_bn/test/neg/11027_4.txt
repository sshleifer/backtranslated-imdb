Carol Lomber and James Stewart have tried to innovate some life and money in this bizarre movie about a bride couple's misery. As the scenes out of the parcel in different managers, each one plays with a different goal. Some crap-cute, some screws, some musicians, and some amazing silent ones. While there is even an extended adventure sequence, the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a membrane. It is difficult to say the most inconsistent scenes in a scene, when the film is completely uncertain in the sun, and the story is not trustworthy. Only valuable assessment for fans of movie students or actors - some small portions, such as Judge Dulilit and Cruel Pilot, are also performed very well.
