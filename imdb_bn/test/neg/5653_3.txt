Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut as "The School of Rock" about her role as Megan in "Jack Black" and "Drake and Josh" in the show and she has become the favorite of Nikkeodion's public, so Dan Schneider will create a show for her. Unfortunately, it is not worse than the "Amanda Sho", which ends as bad. <br /> <br /> About three friends, Curley, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols "junior high communities" through a webcam show called "Icory". Carly and Sam are hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the Internet. Curley is also an elder brother of Spencer, who played by Sunny Jerry Trainer, who is known for his work as Crazy Steve "Drake and Josh". <br /> <br /> Tell me it, okay. This shot is not believed to be 8.3 out of 10, because it is kind of compassionate in almost every aspect. Dan Schneider probably went through about 5 minutes studying teenager interest because I see all the people who are called him "ipod ?? iphone? Ihome? Aha! Teens love something starting with 'i' and most gigas used in" drake and josh " , But they are only dry and forced joke which does not depend on generosity, such as "Do you want me to turn 60 degrees? "No, we want 60 acres!" Not only this, but if you look closely, almost all sets of shorts are used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Diclcyfyphide" which were spin-and-polished with random stuff. So that it can be different. <br /> The picture shown on the broadcast of the Iqui network is as terrible as the whole series, the conversation between them is very bad, which can be taken by someone. Because it is playing only two friends around the camera, but how do they really like "random dancing" with strange, humorous antics? And it just gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jenit Their best, is not far away. Nathan Cress, who plays Freddy, is sometimes not trustworthy, but he does a good job. The person who actually plays the show That's the ridiculous skill of Jerry Trainer, who fits the role of his "protecting elder brother" and his brilliant strong performance can make some interesting parts of it. The bad guys often do not get too often, because this event is my opinion. May give an extra star. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Make a stroll around the playground and make an illusionary trick and compassionate cue card lines on every side, because everyone has unmatched talent to suppress unexpectedly completed scripts and weightless acting. Dan Schneider has done a great job with "Drake and Josh" so it's a failure that "iCarly" is a failure. Jerry Trainer's performance saved this show from 1 rating out of 10, but it can not be just as awesome as "idiotic".
