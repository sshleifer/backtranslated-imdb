Yes, there is a "sleeping" view of the sleeper cell and I was at it. After reading "24" (like the cover of the DVD), I was hoping to speed up the fast pace. But snap ... keeps this series right along. In my underdeveloped half-awake I thought, "He ... ..." and, Pof, it will happen ... "Guess that the van will close ..." and he goes there. <br /> <br /> And so <br /> <br /> <br /> And Darwin, in extra cover, why a baby behind? Could it be, perhaps, a little bit and to supply at? Hey, who works for me, so four stars more than three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I saw "24". Slipper cell, you are not "24".
