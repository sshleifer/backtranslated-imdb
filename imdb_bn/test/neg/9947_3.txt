Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a Tour de ball. As slowly as his acting, the beach bears the stud Duke Slusarski supposed to have a place in my heart. The film came to the beach on the hopes of showing respect to the dream of his dead brother. What he gets is Long Surf hijinks. The boys are cheating, the boys are fighting, and people are going to watch the surf document with LA city in the whole city on Friday night. Duke discourages and tries to teach him how to play a volleyball game for a woman. The next time my woman will talk back, I will say, I'm speaking the ball. <br /> <br /> Come back to Simu Castle. The end of the movie has become a good drama, since the first half of the film was not really a point. Duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, he played for the best ten years. The way the scenes are shot is beautiful. You can play for this person and feel the heart of love being beach. Those five minutes will always go down as my favorite one. Fair from 3/10 bad, the rest of the movie was lam.
