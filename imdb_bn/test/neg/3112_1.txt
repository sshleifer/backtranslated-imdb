The overall story, though quite graphic, is really decent and interesting in the readership of the curriculum. However, the movie was absolutely awesome. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I was crying all the time because I knew I could not spend my time. Do not watch this movie. If you do that, bring a pistol with a bullet in it and some bullets are going with you friends. I was sorry to have something to do with this picture. I am also sorry for all those who saw the movie. To avoid all this cost, and if your mother forces you to see him, kill him. Haha ha ha ha See! I'm a psycho now !!!! IKEdbbbsss has turned me into a psychology !!!!
