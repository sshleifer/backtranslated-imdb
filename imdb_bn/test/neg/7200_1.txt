I absolutely hate this movie! I saw it 9. This is the only movie I have left out of the theater. My mother, father, and I all looked at each other during the film and knew we were wasting our time. This movie has stolen nearly 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous about it. The whole premises was very warped. 9, I was always easily entertained. This film proves that I can not subject myself to anything and can still be entertained.
