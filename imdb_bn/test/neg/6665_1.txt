There are so many logical errors in this show which are very valuable to me. 1) The mysterious goan is not existent; 2) Ubun is as strong as that, when Majin Buw does not play any role in this ceremony, she is easily able by some bad people. 3) The whole Super Sian 4 concept is frustrated and it is disappointing that he loses Super 17 (which is the worst perception of any DJ Bhilain) 4) Super Cyan 4 is not a match for Goku Super 17, but what he learned in a movie Goku is not transformed by any step he has learned. Comfort 5) Vegeta is completely vain 6) No character other than Goku has no impact on the outcome of the war 7) The series ends with a soul bomb ... 8) Goku is invincible? dragonballs absorption? Lum 9) Gotens? ... is still good ??? half pant ??? They both suck 10) Super Cyan 4 involves a magical transformation in an adult 11) a child of Goku 12) a child of Goku 13) No Super Cyan Level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with Gogeta's animation 15) Gogeta is fairly vain 16) Big bang Kammeia Anime is the biggest disappointment in history (not really logical but I'm going to Tanant) 17) The greatest character of all time <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not suppress the majority of memory associated with this show. When I earn enough money, I am going to fund reinstatement of this series.
