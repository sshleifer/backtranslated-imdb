If it did not play the fun part of Christopher's guest, then I could stop watching this movie after 20 minutes. Jokes was flat, the film was sticky and gradually, some letters were hateful and painful to watch, but the character of the guest started to laugh me, so I got stuck with him. <br /> <br /> I think there are many good choices out there
