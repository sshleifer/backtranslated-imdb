... why watch a TV drama (bill as a comedy) which is not any character likable or even funny people? I was trying to get writer David Renwick to see: Wrong story and bad trick that he had set as a "foot in the grave", etc. I acknowledge that the script has become more than maximum effort. British TV at the moment. But really ... who knows these people? They are cold bores. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentioned the scenes sitting down to see a video of women shagging his own and former boyfriend. At that moment when I stopped this event, I never returned. <br /> <br /> PSS. It is interesting to note that all the posters who prefer this series are not British, but those who appreciate most of the other countries This is ignored by viewers when it reflects BBC broadcast this series and sinks like a stone. <br /> <br /> PPS Good news for those who liked it! In the autumn of 2007, there will be a second series - though without a man's leadership. It seems that the BBC has decided to turn into a conventional 30 minute sitikom.
