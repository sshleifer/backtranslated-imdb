Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second documentary-style drama, 'The Candidate', is a political satire which is still fresh and relevant. So it is sad that 'Downhill Racer' was created a short time ago, it was shown opposite. Music ugly, and perhaps innovative ski-in sequence is now sports television coverage standards. The world of ski-EN seems curiously amateur (probably given the time to create the film correctly, but it is difficult to relate to today's professional world) and the Europeans' theme is easily considered to be Hondram during the travel period. Probably the biggest problem is the flat plot, centered on the hateful but enigmatic hero; Unfortunately, this is a great performance of Redford, which provides us with little insight into our concerns or motivations. And without a lot of a character, a character-driven film is not a good bet. I expected so much, but sadly it's a boring movie.
