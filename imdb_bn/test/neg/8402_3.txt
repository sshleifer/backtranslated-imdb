I have heard that Novo was compared with Memento because of the general truth, because of both short-term memory loss, depending on the main character. Well, it is similar to Lamb's silence and Friday's 13th, because both of them are involved in a character that kills more than one person. They can not be different from the ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo works with a company with a copier that has a short-term memory reduction. She consistently followed another lady and had sexual relations with her at the BOSS office. A troubled person who is involved with her and can not use her for sex / sex. Not saying, he has on-screen sex. <br /> <br /> Wait, there is more. There is a boy who runs in the disturbed amnesia male and it is clear that this boy has more in bumping more into her. And there is a notebook that man tries to try important things. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that I'm not for foreign films. I do not mind reading subtitles, but it seems that sometimes one of my favorite aspects of a movie goes far away: Great dialogue Since they need to be translated, or I can not understand most of the cases, I really believe they make it easy to say what the characters say. There was no exception in this movie; The conversation was just fine, well, Blah. <br /> <br /> As the story, it was interesting enough to keep me near for 98 minutes. Curious, yes, but I do not live in France again, so I'm not familiar with their likes / dislikes or living. (For example, do I think that parents seem to be able to sit in bed with their son and jog on the beach for a fool?) It must be a cultural thing. Its past and growing go forward to cure its. Why, when learned "secret", was I really like? All right, all right. <br /> <br /> I'm just acting a bit better, good looking and soft-sex sex situations (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you're not doing it, I suddenly leave this slow moving and memory-back film Have to leave.
