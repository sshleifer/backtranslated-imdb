If you are a fan of the original series, you will not see this movie. <br /> <br /> I was suspicious of the preview when IOn revealed its purpose for the killing. Ioon had no family in Syria and his adventures did not save any selfish interests. Clearly, the chip-writer charge thinks that the film is "necessary to animate the character of" bad grass "public, but there is a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You could not think of it, but more than two-dimensional movie cartoon. All of the characters that are finally resolved are spontaneously impressed with some conflict. All dogs go to heaven, and this is the same for every body of the character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only characteristic of the ceremony was the Rialik, the floating instruments in the sky. I think if you ever thought, "Yes, I like Eon Flux, but I wish it was like all the other nonsense good-bad-weird scientists like the Hollywood Hollywood shield," then you came to a treat. <br /> <br /> They did not even get the correct look. I wanted to ask a lot of a black metal bikini, but the whole setting was wrong. Looks like 30 years in the future, 400 years ago. Instead of a separate urban post-apocalyptic world, the eyes of the audience were shattered by egg-shaped furniture, wall of wooden panels, earth tones, and 70-foot-mode-squared Frutopia of plenty of plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> The world's only city Bregna says, according to the movie. The show is clear that two cities, Barguna and Monica, which used to be one. In the movie, "Monicus" is the only freedom fighter in the Hollywood story book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The day before it was studio executed, and he has never seen the whole Aeon Flux. Huge amount of inconsistency with cartoon is annoying. Using some names like Eon Flux, Trevor Goodchild, and Barguna, the movie is nothing like the show. <br /> <br /> The original bulk of the film is trying to mix green color plates in the soybean, the blade runner, Logan's run, and the tomato rider, which came in a blue brownish mess.
