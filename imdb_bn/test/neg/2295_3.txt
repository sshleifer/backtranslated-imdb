This Swedish splatter movie tries to parody / imitate American horror films like "The Evil Dead", "Grailines" and others. Writer / director / actor / painter Anders Jacobson and writer / producer / actor / makeup effect supervisor, poor Lundstrom (I miss something?) Was obviously inspired by Sam Raimi. But the camera work is "Evil Dead" and a bad copy that can be seen anywhere else. Some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this picture but I did not. <br /> <br /> The picture was rather annoying than entertaining me. It tries to combine mystery and comedy, and the final product gave me the feeling of oppression, though it was not frightening or frustrating. The combination of different section elements is very strange in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Gore and make-up effects are quite good and at least "loose Limbs" sequences were quite fun because the filmmakers did not try to mix fear and joke in this scene. <br /> <br /> You all are a weird film that you will hate or love. Fragment, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (I've been sticked for American productions)
