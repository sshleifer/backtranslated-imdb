Sincerely, I was a big fan of the 'Steve Away' trailer even before it was released a few months ago. I'm plotting a great story about how this movie - and probably a good one is saying to my friend. However - this movie is a little less than my expectations. <br /> <br /> There is a possible possibility of this plot, but how the story is produced with acting, direction and bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. Ghost does not make any sense, and with murder - it's all too early to think of the audience as 'unrealistic'. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture may be scary for some viewers - but due to specific legal reasons for the film, due to fear of shock (due to sound effects, etc.) Fear of fear <br /> <br /> You should consider this movie again.
