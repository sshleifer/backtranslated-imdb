Isaac Florentine has created some of the best Western martial arts action movies ever made. Special US Seal 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Neutral 2 All the functions are classic. You have the genuine emotion of this genre of Isaac and his movies are always related to eventual, creative and intense things, an action fan can expect for some action fans. Especially he found a music with Scott Adkins, such as an actor and action performance you can expect. It is expelled with special forces and regardless of 2, but unfortunately Shepherd simply does not live for their power. It is no doubt that JCVD ​​wants a better year than war, especially in the war, but some of whom do not have anyone else, in the final procession with skate, But he looked into his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes. Like it just does not care about anything across the whole film. And these are the leading people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br The real shame I know that we all wanted this movie in particular because it could actually be. There are some good bits, most of the action scenes itself. This film was a great director and action corographer and was a great opponent to face JCVD. It could be one that could make the smart action star back to scratch the ball-out action film parts. <br /> <br /> This shame is not that shameful.
