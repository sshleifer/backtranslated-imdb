This movie is a cyborg between yourself and yourself: half pointless / half life time original movie. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, the only purpose of this movie is: If you want you to spend the film on <br /> <br /> I did not hire this movie due to Angelina Jolie I'll explain it soon). I'm not Mrs. Jolie's big fan, though I would say her performance was fast! His empty holes and robotic acting really believed me that he was an Android hooker. If someone has a clip inside 'Actor Studio', explaining how anyone is preparing for this role, please send it to my path. I will definitely use it when I try James Lipton to commit crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> What do I need to rent this movie? Someone would think Angelina Jolie had the hope of looking after her breast, but it was not. No, behind this rental because the one on the DVD cover completely rests on the image; Jack Palense's face! Her face was half-robotic! When I saw it, I slowly entered through the blazing volcano of "Palenis", pouring waste to anyone who was quite foolish to resist. In my mind, each member of the Palenster's abducted army had red, burning eyes; A red, burning eye that saw people and saw only "meat". They are to be the resort architects ... a cold, firmly apocalypse ... a nightmare that humanity will never be spared. This is a beautiful picture which I will cherish until the end of the year. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the real movie did not rely on my expectations. No, Jack Palance was only 'one', and only visible cybernetic enhancement on his legs. Sadly, those enhancements did not really "improve". Not that far, you count walking like a polio Victim as a super power. At least they had a scene where the Jack-Trigger-happy Alzheimer's patient was shot as a patient - some people were shot dead in the hell. I was waiting for him crying, "I'm tired of paying too much for prescription medicines!" Unfortunately, no explosion was less and far away in the Jereotric rage. <br /> <br /> There was an abundance of the movie about a poorly developed love story (Ilyas Cotas, Ur poor man de Niro) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, senior Von Demo SPON). Oh people, a romio flush and silicon could never be able to make love in a Juliet?!? !! If you follow Jack Palance's simple advice, "you have to tie each other". <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what that means. Anyway, I'm sure Jack Palance does not want to explain it to me. I do not want to show him as sure hack! As a test, I ask you a significant other if he thinks that we have reached a stage of our relationship where we can start typing each other?
