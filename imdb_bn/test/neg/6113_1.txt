I was watching a friend on TV one day and we grabbed the last twenty minutes of "Going Coloss". When I say it was enough to get a good judgment on the film. The first scene I saw was the monkey, baby, fatty people, and black people, which looked like Dave Chapel, flying around thousands of feet of the wind in the wind. Although everybody was honest about the journey, the monkey seemed to be somewhat of a narcotics, where he kept pressing the word fast as the English word. Then they landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa. A heart felt goodbye where the monkey (hahaha) cried, the film appeared "villains". They were tearing their alcohol to full kadilla when the evil monkeys docked a boat in a clear boat 40 yards away in the boat and drowned their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. After watching this picture, there are new objectives in my life; Who played the monkey and knocked him with the fountain pen.
