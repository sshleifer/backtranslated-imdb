It's a sad to throw away a good idea. The main idea of ​​the movie is to travel in the past life - fortunately - it is not a time travel, but it does not have anything to do with the past or the future. (Probably they should not say this as the past life in the movie ... I'm a subtraction, guess). It is now very interesting in all places, at different places ... without causing any religious misery. However, the music should be completely repetitive, composer, sensitive and outside the place ("West"!). Music should have and should have more variety and more on where should not be. flashback romantic scenes It takes a lot of space and running time and is completely unnecessary. The acting is not bad, though the language has protected me from better understanding. <br /> <br /> I believe this A little more than minor thoughts, developing and publishing needs. In many cases because they may contain settings for scenes in the background seems to be unrealistic. Completely, I would say that this film could be a lot of choice ...
