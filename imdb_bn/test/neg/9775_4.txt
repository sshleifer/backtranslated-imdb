This horror story occurs in Namib desert in Africa. A Canadian system analyst, Jach Strecker (Scott Bairstow) is sent to an assignment for Hiraba Mining Company. Although he hated the work of the field, he found himself in a truck with an open desert war rescue unit and the wind blew. Four diamond detectors are found ... the remaining bones of their spreading bones are discovered. A long cold desert night makes its appearance in a shapely variable giant. Jack and his colleagues were frightened when their trucks were vandalized and unit members were deadly after one dead. There is no character development; Let's talk to the conversation alone. The desert set is beautiful on its own way and without some distance ... animals are like desert rays old. Also cast in: Rachel Shelley, Warrior Grey and Patrick Shay.
