I was waiting to see this movie, and it contains very interesting views from Iraqis all over the country, not just the main case. <br /> <br /> However, the film continues and looks increasingly unilaterally, I started thinking, who has edited this image. To get hundreds of hours for just 80 minutes, must definitely decide. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed a movie that shows how Iraqis felt from all aspects of these issues, but newspaper headlines, in contrast to the people's words, and despite the same opinion with everyone in the film, I thought that it was predefined It was clear that it was done with bias. <br /> <br /> It could be such a great film.
