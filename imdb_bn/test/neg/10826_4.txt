I went for some time to watch this movie. I remember the Col Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his performance is in wood, he portrayed a strong "leader" character. Same condition This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and a cave inventor of Romany, which would sink to see. The scene at the beginning was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men looting the search to explore the cave Flash is 30 years ahead, and some of our scientists and their crew have a group of divers to explore some caves for some unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> Many curiosity, vain words Women are too hot for their jobs, let's face it. I hate to see these women's lips while eating beer in a pre-cave search party. I mean, as we are talking about great sex, there were a few times with the crack and sisterhood - not a team of scientists and divers. Each character had zero personality, perhaps the exception to science, who was not one of the least young and beautiful people. So acting, though, like workshops, was not inspirational. <br /> <br /> The dialog was pretty bad. At one point in the film, Coll Hauger ("Jack"), Lead Diver - was unknowingly transformed into a singular radio emblem and remained like him. We believe that since he was mad at one of these monsters, he was returning to one of them. Fair enough But first of all, nobody says anything to him: "Your yaws, dude?" No Everyone talks about being "justified" and he will not be the leader of the group anymore. And then this guy says, "You see how he is not a man". is not it? If they really believed that he was a freggin giant, then why not behave like him? Instead, the group is divided into two groups - those who go with Jack, and those who go through their different ways, I think he thinks to be a monster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her scream really sucked - but she sends the goblin to fight like hell. <br /> <br /> The photography was fine when the camera was there. But no verb sequence, flashing the director bubbles, flashlight, find us by dark space is useful useful to confuse hell, what God knows. I wish they would show a view of us directly once in a short time. Since you want to move the camera everywhere, the film does not make the squares, the people do. <br /> <br /> If this change is made then this movie may be better: <br /> <br /> 1. Every actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the lead, it's okay to see him look good. I'm tired of seeing some 20-something supermodel scientist. Pause me, man! <br /> <br /> 2. The movieographer was fired, and instead pointed to the camera and was still sitting. This may be the fault of the director, I do not know. The zoom camera (like the Constant Garden) is getting old, people <br /> <br /> 3 We got to see goblins actually consume humans. How to bout some gore? There is nothing else in this movie. We got to see creator creatures - I felt a little trapped about him. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was very long. During refusal, sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what? It's a bit canned. In the end, all of them died instead of the black guy (Maurice Chestnut), who appeared in his character and began to breathe a little sympathy in his character. All other actors did not have any expression. <br /> <br /> I gave 4 out of 10, because after all, the acting was without noticeable error, and the idea was fairly original. I would like to see more that the coil will play a more military role - that's good.
