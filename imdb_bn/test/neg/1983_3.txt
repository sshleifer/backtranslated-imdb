I really like Kiskki, he's a great actor. I have seen this movie because I have heard that the film has an autobiographical direction. <br /> <br /> In the picture there is a symbol of symbolic piano like the strange shadow of the wall. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences: "A child sells fate, but his box is empty." This is really annoying and really not necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is about. How does the film show that Kiskski's character is about women and how she kept them under control. If there are some aspects of the life of Kangxi in this story - then he was really a fool. So do not need to watch this movie, unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies but can laugh about it.
