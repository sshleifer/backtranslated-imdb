In 1964, when the cartoon started the underdog for the first time, I rushed at the age of 7. He is the top dog in my book (accused purpose) - (ie, until Batman is a year or so after ABC premiere). Even when the Disney became clear to create the popular live version of the cartoon on the Spanish morning, it was clear to me that it was suddenly going to be a shit. Even sure to read the papers reviews. However, I made it a point: a) I do not try to write a review until the movie starts from the end; And b) do not spend a red casserole in a movie that I'm not sure of, I hate <br /> <br /> Thank you for YouTube: a) I am fully qualified to write this review; And b) It costs me a lot of time in my 84 rupees. <br /> <br /> This point also proves that this movie is not just part of the cat. It's a steaming pile of dog droppings. This is similar to the series of TVs, although it has got it properly with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> Finally, underdog is a lot of waste- and money, which I am grateful, spend t. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * ***** Outside
