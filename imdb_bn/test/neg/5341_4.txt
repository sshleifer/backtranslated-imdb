The "Black Friday" has made this plot so good, it is remembered and "people with two lives" are just forgotten portraits. "Shadow no Tears" was its title and it was good because he was a totally bad character for most of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Accident. Dr. Clarke (Edward Cain) was involved in some experimental operations on animals - bringing them back from the dead. His colleagues called him to try Philip's operation, who died. As he operating a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, the electrical chair going and soul trans migration happened. When Philip wakes up from the operation, he has a piano spirit. She is a changed person, she is rude for her family and starts hanging around Panino's old Hunt. He takes the old gang of Wolf - Philip Bennett is going in the name of, he is the former girlfriend of Wolf of the romance - who smells a rat. Like Wolf, Bennet even started to eliminate even his enemies until the score. When the body, including the girlfriend and the police member, torn apart, his own family started to be prey. <br /> <br /> But I hate those "bad dreams" movies - you always think it takes down. If he lived in character as a panno and was out of a final shoot, then this film has been good. Alanr, his mother tongue, became sad but wise with his brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, was big business in most B movies. <br /> <br /> is not really recommended.
