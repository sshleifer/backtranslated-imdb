The live action version of the dragonball through Taiwan. <br /> <br /> Evil Rand comes to Earth on the magic of the seven magic dragon balls ... the pearl of Era that will appear when the dragon is displayed and will give you the desire. Many actions and bad comedy ensue. <br /> <br /> Can I say that "the best way to see this movie is a lot of drunken but diverse friends"? I do not know. Funny that it could be a really bad but really bad movie. Come on, one of the few martial arts films I've ever seen, where you actually see the stars. It's a live action cartoon and I have not yet moved away from the show that made me terrible for the American version of big budget. <br /> <br /> If you have some drunk friends and feel like picking up a movie then see this picture. If you know it (like me) to avoid it.
