Nina Mal is not a movie nor a Chess is a bad part of a badly-soaped soap opera. <br /> <br /> Actor is not good at soap operas, I think writers and directors watched many Mexican soap operas and could not contain anything different from a distance. <br /> <br /> Leave it, go back to your soap opera so that you have an audience. <br /> <br /> Do not stop asking for our time and money, and give bad name to the reputed Mexican film industry once. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, it's a middle soap opera!
