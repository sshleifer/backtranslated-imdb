At the beginning of this movie, after closing the opening sequence of "The Lost Boy", doing bad wiring and ending the worst conversation, the film slim with the flow at a snap speed. "Contract" was highly recommended by several of my colleagues, who fully convinced me that they were playing a real joke on me. At least I hope that the purpose was and their taste is not bad! The film was not for more than three and a half years, yet much more was felt later. The story was so basic that it could be summed up in about 15 minutes. They may have filled the rest of the film with at least some other amusement or magic scene, but some have decided, (perhaps the director, but I do not know if anyone has "directed" this movie) it is going to be met some badly executed "arts" Camera shots and "boys" have a wonderful view of swimming and beat them. Almost half the way through this movie, I thought it was more entertaining to smash my head against the wall, and partly to keep me from getting rid of this terrible dirty feeling. . So I torn my head against a wall, and I then enjoyed the movie! I saw it all the way to the bitter end, hopefully it will eventually enjoy me more. No, my efforts were rewarded "how will I make you my whistle-oyuch!" I turned upside down, and then the screen writer for the poor actress and I felt embarrassed for the sorrow, who provided this drill. Actually other bad critics really did not feel bad, but even the most talented Thesonian could not save this work, and on my nerves, it worked! I give movies a chance, even bad things because they usually offer some enjoyment and this is not the worst movie I've ever seen. After finishing it, I again like to see the movie "Stithal" and WOW was so good about it! Oh yes case cases, do not bother with this movie, really, do not. Check out some episodes of "skinny" and see "The Last Boy" after the right amount of alcohol, and you'll be a better person. If you are in the same trap and see the "contract", do not forget to keep all the sharp objects away from yourself, thank you for it.
