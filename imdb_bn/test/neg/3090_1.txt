What a waste of time! I hope good from Cameron Diaz! I guess it was not really his fault in being a terrible film. The film does not capture the beauty of Europe ... and it did not succeed to guide the audience in suspicion or surprise. Conversation and statement weak attempts - Conversation is lazy and sometimes I was not able to express what simplicity seems. No love, energy, power on the screen very bad !!!!!!!! 1
