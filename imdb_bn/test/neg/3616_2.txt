I do not really think that I write a review on a movie titled titled titled "Snake Island" as a derision, but it also strikes a new low within its own abstract range, so my anger must be known. I am also annoyed to see this incredibly bad movie because only I knew it was going bad, it was really late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad films would go out of power and make me long for sleep. This movie is going to be very fast very quickly, but it is lowered even below expectations. <br /> <br /> It was written by film management and Owen Croftford, who did not come to pick another boat until the end of the big African river tour guide, who surrounded his group on a remote island called Snake Island. They become drunk, become drunk and then become victims of poisonous snake attacks who are in the mission of abandoning their island people. <br /> <br /> If my jaw falls in the last sentence of my second paragraph, it does not bother to read it again, you got it right for the first time. True, I like the features of my animal when animals (animals) get hungry people only from hunger, because they do not have any mission. This is not a mutant snake. They are not giant like what you see "Anaconda". They are just plain, daily African snakes such as mambas and vipers ?? Just have their brains form the army, take the causes, work together in the trap of humans, understand our language and even dance! Do your draws drop again? Well, it's going to drop further. People's maps began to drink around the campfire, and suddenly they fell into some type of sandal about the amount I had left in the middle of this scary B-movie. And when they dance nude and as such, snakes stop them all suddenly and start jamming along with it. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discovered those snakes, most of the planet's hazardous creatures, formed a coalition against humans for some strange reasons, which proved to be very much for my poor brain. And when I was not able to take it even at the lower level when filmmakers made it, the singers started singing. <br /> <br /> People in the movie? Well, let's just say that I have not given up life to stop the dead so fast. I could not bear it anymore. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I have to continue; You get the picture If there is anything that "snake island" is different from its other rivals, then it dares to try to be even fig and it is not a complimentary achievement. Why? Just why I continue to subject myself to this really bad movie, I guess I really do not know. But "Snake Island" hit a brand new low. It is a cheap photo that produces "Anakonda", a cheaper, trashy excuse for an idiomatic snake movie, as Steven Spielberg's "Jads" looks brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling. You have been warned.
