This movie was an interesting plot about clones and organs, but the lead actor is so annoying and you fail him like he is dead. Someone does not do anything very good at it, but when you hate the character that you are supposed to give your sympathy, the movie just fails to work. Interesting enough, it looks like a movie coming in the future is a plot that reflects it with more work and a good cast, though I can not remember anything else, but if I am the film then. It was to see. This movie has a great cellphone clone which is quite smart enough to do something wrong with his camp, where people drive one mile bikini every hour and get wrestling without any reason. Councilors will tell them that they go to America when they are ready, but our "hero" is in doubt so that he wanders and teaches the terrible truth that sends him repeatedly from the bad guy and strikes him repeatedly. He is cloned from the people to look for. Peter Graves has it and so is Dick Seargent, but they think there is something made for television which adds nothing to this movie. On the plus side, though the "Island" comes out of the film's makers, proudly can say "we think it first".
