This is a powerful recommendation for anyone reading this review that is not fairly seen in this movie, and do not waste money on renting this poor excuse for your movie. This, without peer, one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. As I saw it I saw the nightmare of this movie. Acting was terrible, and any amateur filmmaker could make more decent film. The film gradually closes the far better Sci-Fi films until the timecop or total recall (where it appears to have been derived from the title). I'm sorry, but I think there's more entertainment value next to a cardboard box for two hours here. If you have already seen this movie, then sorry for what I did.
