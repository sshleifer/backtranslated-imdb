In spite of having lost most of his capability for a long time, in this stunning and uninterrupted effort to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise alive, our legendary Vampire returned to life in Swing London in 1972. Just 100 years after his enemy van was destroyed. A secret disciple named Honeysin, who was known as Johnny Alcard (found?), Gathered in one of the abandoned churches of his fellow friends, among them, Van Helsing's elder grandson Jessica, and performed a devilish manner that resuscitates Dracula in smog fumes. Dracula's only mission is to destroy the anger of the entire Van Helsinge and harmful Jessica. This is the ideal hunting ground. Probably trying to look like this 70th film is 70! The previous six Dracula movies were set in the Victorian era, director Allen Gibson wanted to impose the truth in the true 20th century, and thus he wanted to film his film with the untouchable hippie character, 70's fashion trends and the terrible 70s. Music Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing disappointly lost this setting and their performance sadly displayed it. The opening sequence (a flashback) and showdown climax is fairly enjoyable, but in all it's a boring annoying and scary whole reverse. The best elements of these series were always the Dracula's dark castle and delightful coach races and, perhaps, they lacked in this installment. Fortunately for fans, Hammer studio's contemporaries have been better released on other movies ("Vampire Lovers", "Evil's Twins", "Legends of the Golden Golden Vampire")?). Not recommended.
