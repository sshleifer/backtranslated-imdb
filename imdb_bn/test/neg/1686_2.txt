I did not see the show until I canceled and started showing the run again. I actually enjoyed it for the first third season. Once I saw the fourth and fifth, I started becoming disturbed. The first problem was that they were irrelevant, repeating the history scene itself (Junior was a child like her parents). The second was such that they were all associated with someone (e.g. KT and Franklin). Third, when he was more foolish than Jar, he became disturbed and upset, where I wanted to go to TV and kept him stupid until he was unconscious. The fourth was the zealous Dark who claimed Clara's lover. The fifth had to be KT, she started to be very good for herself and her "lover" Franklin treated her as a shock. Last but at the Noa Gray Cab !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It's just more annoying to see Urkle and Tej Henderson a horrible combination !!! He came to mourn when they seriously jumped sharks. His character did not have any reality and the way he smiled was the sign of a clear force that Noah could not do. I have seen that the kid just wants to fool me. However, the BF. (Before Frank) This show was fun and very entertaining.
