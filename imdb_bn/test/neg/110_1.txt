I just finished watching this movie and not saying that I did not enjoy it. It is slowly and reluctant. This baby Harry Potter is playing a shy teenager with a lazy mother, and then one day asks the rude mother's baby to find a job, so that she can live an old person, apparently she has no lodging and she has started living with her family. So the child goes to work for the old man. And this old lady lives alone, drives with the girls, drives the car! A 18-year-old man could not enjoy spending time with a horrible lady in the 80's. Sorry to annoy people enjoying my comments on this movie, I can be wrong because I'm not British and understand social and their family structure and lifestyle. Most movies are made for British viewers.
