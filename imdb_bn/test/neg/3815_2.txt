Almost every level amateur actor is a horror movie - a compact and derivative screenplay full of stereotyped characters played by the embarrassing actor as the director of lack of the most basic understanding of his management. The whole thing stinks. It's like a slasher film in the eighth century, under the Crappie score and KTouch SFX, but without nostalgia of childhood, such as the need to look lonely at the cross. One of the worst horror films I've ever seen - has definitely received the most mainstream theatrical releases. I never went out of a movie in my life - I was unfortunate enough to see the 'Hachet' in the theater, it was the first. To avoid all costs.
