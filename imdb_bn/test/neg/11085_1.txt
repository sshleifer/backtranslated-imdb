My first post on IMDB (unfortunately) should not be warned to warn anyone! There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good light. It does not make any sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people are running with small caves, cameras rotating in bad corners and the screen is shouting in the dark when you like this movie. I could stop the lights off my house and scream too, and I did not have to pay for the rent. The only thing I'm afraid of is that someone actually makes this movie terrible. <br /> <br /> ... I've never rented one of the worst movies.
