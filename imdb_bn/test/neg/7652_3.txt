Very annoying, but skillfully created and scripted and intelligent, indicated with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Heart, Sandy Dennis, and especially Randy Quayed are exceptionally good. The story is centered around a young boy (Brian Madarski), where they come to eat all the food for dinner. Her parents (heart, cayad) are curious due to the involvement of school psychologist (Dennis). This is a terrific cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you like it. If you do not like parents, stay away from the movie. Advise Kanibal boyfriend and weapon. <br /> <br /> Strong Adult Themes and Rated R. for Graphic Violence
