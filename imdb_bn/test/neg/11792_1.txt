Oh why did I ever spend time watching this movie? This was given to my friend on video and I thought I would see it, it certainly would not be bad. Firstly acting is scary and we believe this is real? Secondly, this image is blatantly trying to copy the Blair Wizard project (yawn) and so very bad. So if you want to scare your life, I would recommend that Simpson's Halloween will be very awesome. However, if you just wanted to laugh, perhaps this film's general disorder would be enough. But overall I get plenty of alcohol before avoiding all the cost of this image or watching it. Best bit? His only one and a half hour, thank God
