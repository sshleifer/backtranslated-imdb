This film is not pictured as any other image of Australia's film industry and what it holds. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary talents, outstanding performance (especially by Victoria Hill), but virtually letting it out in other ways. <br /> <br /> One kind of "adaptation", it did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, it is not enough in present-day Australia), and basically, it has failed to fully support its existence, completely unnecessarily) original work Paying tribute to If the work is done (and done and completed and completed) in a body, it's Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it is not a self-motivated and vain exercise, at least some new explanations of the work should be brought. <br /> <br /> and this Macbeth fails to do. It is done, whatever the contemporary relevance of this film is. It is the same piece that we have seen countless (many!) Times before. Apart from guns and various accessories, <br /> <br /> In addition to the fundamental errors of keeping original Shakespeare conversations (there is no way to keep it), a long and incredibly annoying slow motion of the film in more tropical moments, I looked at the screen I am, though I totally tune out. I never thought I had a short interval, but you go there. <br /> <br /> I think the movie has been successful on its own, very limited condition. But in Australia, the trend of creating world-class acting talent continues, its film makers have to stop being proud of achieving limited positions, and in reality they will set enough quality standards so that they can respect the kind of talent they work on. <Br> <br /> A shame. An absolute shame
