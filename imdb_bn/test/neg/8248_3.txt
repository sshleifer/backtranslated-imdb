When Hollywood is trying to understand it like a "intelligent person", then they are very weak, it finds solid words in the word "gifted". <br /> <br /> Any genius trying to rub his excellence in every example. Sure, they hang in the bar and take the fights ?? It is not that they are like an antistiastic (generalist) antistiasting antistea nader who is never a drag. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you are a genius you know about math, history and politics, and of course you are always present in the present and a thorough analysis date of them. Cause these things, like all the stuff, y'know? <br /> <br /> Plus, you walk around with a smile all the time. You just know what a magnet son you are, that's how it is, all of you. <br /> <br /> And of course you smoke, someone who never used to smoke before, but you smoke cigarettes, it's like cold N stuff, yes. And you are different. It is understood <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight ?? You're a joke. Whenever he does not lift the weight, then a rapist who finds 10,000 times when he finds it. And whenever he does not smoke or drink beer because he follows strict health. <br /> <br /> and you give some 30 college students the date? Mini driver Well, I will not even comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the nails with the head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a day-long (otherwise, 95% among them) students of Beves and Botthead type: "Yes, what I would like is if I had a talent." But in this case stupid people and stupid writers geniuses Can not imagine life.
