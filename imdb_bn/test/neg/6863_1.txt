I will be one of the few people who own a copy of this classic. But I'm not the only owner, I'm really 2. It's good <br /> <br /> Well, when I say good, I feel bad. But I'll try to do a thorough review. I even saw 'a ninja born' which is mentioned here among other critics, to compare it. And born a neda is not really bad, but quite funny as it is. <br /> <br /> And it's ever fun. Everything about this movie is poor. Everything. Plot is absolutely stuffed (note 'keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife'). Each action order is very stuffed. Our hero Danton is more than a hero; He can bind people, take 3 bullets of cardiovascular disease 3cm away from heart, and even make a rope on the tree, when an enemy stays on it, knocks on the enemies' feet, captures him, and tricks him 50-meter spikes. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it is impossible to comment on it, but you have to roll it, especially the dents will jump from the ground and it will get worse. Oh yeah, and bad guys: As it seems, they revive themselves every five times in the movie. Perhaps it was not enough actor, but this qualification is a movie? I suspect it. <br /> <br /> How did the Danton soldier in the Vatican warfare, 'Plot', and now his colonel is hunting for real people to train for his tenants. The colonel just wanted to choose Danton, then fight back to Danton. It's just an excuse for the rambo clone, with most soldiers fighting to kill Danton. And I can not explain this plot any more, the movie has nothing else to do. It's still the stone though <br /> <br /> What could be wrong with you now? Do not start me Hand grenades usually go on to boil the actors because the size of the blast is a size. In senses where 5 people are behind Danton, the camera goes back and behind and 7. Every time Danton loads a grenade launcher in front of the same background, he is completely different. And the worst part is that when Danton pushed the plastic stones to the enemies and torn apart an enemy stone, he did not know what to do, and he died without touching half heartlessly. It's funny !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very, very funny. This is one of the few movies that I can completely recommend to everyone, if you are not funny then you have 1 in 1 million. And for the rest of us it's magic.
