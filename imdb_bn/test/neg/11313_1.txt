This morning, I thought of myself unexpectedly that the movie is available. I started thinking of myself, "Oh yes, Mr. Magu was there, was not there?" This is even more surprising because I think this film appears to be the aftermath of the controversy (apparently for the helpless people, this campaign group was frustrated). I also went to open this movie, because I'm Mr. Magu and Mr. Nilson were both fans, and he thought that he would love to play Magu. I remember even opening animated credits, because I thought they were pretty funny. Even after <br /> <br />, it's a complete blank blanket. I think it's a sad statement about a movie that it is so long, so soft and completely irresistible that you can not remember anything from it. I understand that Leslie Nilsson is not always known for being in the first-class comedy, but I saw him in "Spy Hard", "Voice Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3" and there was not a great movie, but I At least * some * came away from the mind. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank. <br /> <br /> I am surprised now that if all the controversies surrounding this movie are not actually produced by the studio, the hope of being produced at least is a small amount of interest in an otherwise completely worthless movie.
