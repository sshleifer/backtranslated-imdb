This movie is a shame. How can you accept one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and it can turn into a semi-ass love story. The whole movie was not in the story of HG Wells and it was not needed. Eloi has also made a complete mistake. They construct houses or form any kind of real society. They do not care about each other. That was an important part of the story. The way they formed a world that was without trouble or complex emotions. They were even even aware of Morlocks. I do not know why this movie was created in such a way but some stories should have said that they left alone or left.
