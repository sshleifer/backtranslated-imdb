I'm feeling very sorry! Where Luvittch-Peak was excellent, amazing, full of soul and elegance, here's only one - colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 years old, but apparently depressed) and tried to play a shy and dull feminine. Think of Jeanette MacDonald, who played the role of "widening" twice to the widow with Dan Danilo. That Lana was an operetta game though unable to sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the role of a Lehr-Oprah title, which is really fun! The only really good thing is the end of the great Waltz scene: impressive! And - after watching this scene - see the Waltz scene presented in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Have any matches?
