With an interesting determination (sometimes the lines of war were not so clear in clashes between European and indigenous people), it should have been a good film. But the story is infuriated by the director's surveillance directed with a conflict with a very bad script with his own cleverness. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural setting is beautiful and yes, this film is authentic for the 19th century historical settings. But the filmmaker repeatedly lifts the liver, adds the layer above the level of the superior musical music, not to mention soundtracks completely unnecessary voice-over, which eliminates the audience and draws attention away from the story itself. <br /> <br /> I tried to clear the director, his microscopic closeup and an endless repetition of musical design of "Danny Boy" (all!), in the episode of Time in the West, West an ace sergeio Leon To create a New Zealand version. But he was successful in creating a parody, referring to the sincerity of the story (most of Lyon's tongues were tongues), and not yet in the year 1968. <br /> <br /> Very bad.
