August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: <br /> <br /> San Connie is one of the best ever and I've been a fan since 1950s. I went to this movie because Shane Connery was the main actor. I did not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie was a little surprised. Scenes and spectacles were spectacular, but the ridiculous point of the plot was unreal. In my mind it could be the worst if it was not one of her best movies. Why is he a mystery to choose from this movie? For me, going to this movie was a waste of my time. I will go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection. But I can not see the money wasted to keep this collection in my collection
