I've been a serious collector for Christmas related movies, TV shows, holiday specials, etc. for more than 25 years. Please be careful and do not get distracted by the Sterling Review and media promotion about this movie. This is not a Muppate film because we came to know them, and certainly not for children. It was produced on a major TV network that at this time there was no surprise / consideration of their operation level. It's hard to believe me that Jim Henson's organization has become so humble to get involved with this brutality of Christmas. I remember that this review has been done for me to read that I will warn me before ruining my hard working money in this piece. Trash's.
