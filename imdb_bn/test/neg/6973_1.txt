In the room! What about this wicked, stupfying mak-u-menti about Ed Wood's cross-dressing imagination? Well, one word that does not come in mind! The wood uses raw slabs of the relevant stock footage, and then creates a "story" around them - and no stories !! The star itself as the Glenn Glen, is a regular Joe who only enjoys lounging around his fianc√© underwear and sweaters. I think Wood wanted to have a petition for tolerance for Glenns in the world which showed that Glenn just like us, just Angourate. Ummm ... all right. But then, we are some of these horny devil's diverse montage, a slave of slavery, some rude, indicative people, some chicken stock footage and finally a uninterrupted lugus, some sort of rolling, playing illegal puistmaster. Lugosi is crying like, "Chiviar ... Beijing Greenie Dragon, which is sitting in your house: She is Leitkit boys, puppies and seed shoots!" Um, okay, Bela ...: = 8 / Here's a weird, curved kind of wood leaking. Finally, he reminds us that "10 men wear 7 hats between 10 men and 7 out of 10 men". Hmmm, that must be foreign / cross-dressing / Habidashery garupth-thong !! A platoon of faithful wood-slogan-actors (either ...), and Wood, with Glenn or Glenda Lily Talbot, Deloore Fuller and Timothy Pharell, and Wood guide everyone to compete with each malicious, amateur non-talent. . All of us now know the sad story of Bella: the time when she was used for this structure of wood, she probably did Jongsing for another fix and Muhl needed it, but even before that it was not even deeper. The Buffalo view is charged with a staff footage of MooCow's favorite wood missions - it's very lazy to blame !! MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings", and the hoof hooves a copy of Gate Year Glenn or Glenda - you will not believe it! : ??
