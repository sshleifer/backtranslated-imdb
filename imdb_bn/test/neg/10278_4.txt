I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and of course I would say: I was not impressed, not all. While performing well, I do with other posters, but some good performances do not make movies like this. <br /> <br /> On the discussion board, I got a review by an anonymous poster which is some of the main points It says: "Did Pol" is a movie that raises many questions but gives at least a few answers; A movie that is more than every effort to split and classify; After a few threat scenes, a test and a conventional sexual drama. Barbara Kova and Andrea Snyder, partly produced for very impressive editing and good camera work (Stephen Ritter), consisting of plot holes and some technical slips (especially sounds). However, the audience remains annoying for 40 minutes. "Unfortunately, this is true, I did not have all the jokes in the story, the character is cold, the ambition is less people, they have many narcotics and many (inappropriate) sexual intercourse, what is it? On many occasions, the aspect seems to be unattainable, not to mention the technical aspect: The poor sound quality was extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> What's the message behind this? Anonymous critic says: "In any case, Beerman is a clear sign The two failed to make and so the movie hangs midway without any message. Thus, I blame heroism in this movie. The film is reserved and is emotional, cold, almost neutral and it does not take long to see the flaws: Shawn and Iv characters are not credible for long expansion (they clearly have problems in English pronunciation), the silent brother's character does not develop very well. Although some moments are very optimistic - where the call boy is skinny (one and only true love scene), the scene gets intense, since anyone likes to watch the whole movie long. As a visitor, one has to apologize for the opportunity given to viewers. "Again, I have to agree. I like the final scene, especially due to the beautifully held faces of Jairo Moore and Andrea Snyder, but it was nothing compared to the pain for the first thirty minutes. (Sex scenes, though, are beautifully arranged and Completely edited.) <br /> <br /> To everyone, "Did not drink tea" was not a cup of tea - a good, controversial idea is lost   ে গেছে - কিন্তু এটি ছিল কোনও সিনেমাটি আসলে কোন অর্থের সাথে কীভাবে তৈরি করা যায় তা দেখতে আকর্ষণীয়। সম্ভবত যদি তারা একটি বড় বাজেট এবং আরো অভিজ্ঞ পরিচালক হত তবে এটি একটি ভাল চলচ্চিত্র হয়ে উঠত।
