After the inspiration for the inspirational airplane shot at the moment of opening the movie, it eventually ends up in a very annoying and one-tone note. <br /> <br /> Where to start, well I'll start the character. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all kinds of and one dimensional death, which was "Victim" or "Asshole" on their forehead. No person has seen through shop owner Malik Liland Gant (outside of Sedro space and outdoors) outside of me <br /> <br /> This movie is thrills, suspense, and yes in some sense yes recreational value. It stretches itself for too long with lots of pay off. Why should it be very annoying - type of death fast letters and then half of them forget about half? All who had to go to the shop to go to reality, all are very fortunate. Here, in addition to the only decent scenes translated from the novel (War between Willma and Netai), there was a isolation and there was not much force. I'm sorry but afterwards, the death of one stop screen, a boring shooting off, and some annoying and then a few explosions did not fix it for me. The sadness of the atrocities and meaningless attitude of the book was missing. Church scene explosion was so much and badly executed, suddenly was the whole city a rebellion? It has not been created suddenly and has not been made in any way, who are these people and why should I care? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and there is no motion in the scene. I think Ed Harris and Bonnie Badelah were good actors in this case, but the film did not allow me to supply enough substance for them. Amanda Plummer was credible but truly sympathetic was extremely tragic (in the novel she was a sad and sad character) It was a very note here. J.T. Walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or layered. Very predictable <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very enthusiastic for the material that supports it. It stood out like throat thumb. Simple friend, easy. I used to work like a little less theater. I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, though. If you are going to create a movie to reach 2 hours, make sure that the disaster on these legendary novels is going on more and more. <br /> <br /> I often saw myself smiling at the scene, it seemed to be taken seriously (end-of-the-speech Harry's speech, or generally the character Hug Priest), and was bored and unwanted at other times. The director should have done more with this director privately, his outlook was very modest, and was hiding behind too much cinemagazine, which was ever stopped as a decent film. The movie looks good, but I do not think this story is appropriate. I mean, this father led Alaska, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I just want to read the book, as it should, just as you develop more recreational, layered character, severe violence and greatness, humorous feeling and a lot of tears. It's a butchered version, that does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** **** Outside
