This is a rare movie which I did not discuss with my friends immediately after seeing it. It was not particularly entered or affected by me because it was not. In contrast, it did not give me anything <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? Because, since, everything was so much that I could not take this picture more seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I got the conviction that the film was trying very hard, it was hard to be obnoxious, as if it was trying to target unusual titles between the perpetrators, but rather than telling a sure story about two women stuck in the spirits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bai-Muay has been described as "Thalamma and Luis with sexual relation". Well, it's true that the original idea is the same. Two women are traveling through the country because they have committed crimes and they know that their lives are now over, the police are going to arrest them, and they decide that now everything is finished, there is no way to keep it. <br /> <br /> Bais Muay has been described as a feminist film, where women who have been subjected to male domination in the past, have been given proper revenge for the men who faced them. There is something that I have never explained in this film; None of these women was ever innocent, because they do not kill innocent, violent men, but men make themselves tempted, what men want to do It means safe sex. And they killed women. No, they are no better than the characters they face. <br /> <br /> How easy it is to kill "heroine" and how much fun it takes to be related to each other, it is impossible for me to take it seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence I felt that sex and violence were only there, instead of describing stories, or creating stories, making excellence in disrespect. <br /> <br /> Bio-ladders left me with no impression, I do not have to worry, because it has moved so far in a real world. So built, unrealistic and at the top. <br /> <br /> I could not do anything with this movie, there was nothing to worry about, "Why did they create this terrible image?" The film has been subjected to acute unpleasantness, serving a purpose, I would like to take it easy. But since I could not find anything, since the story of the film seems not much as much as possible in a movie and shrinking ugly sex ... I filed it under "unnecessary torture", sometimes I have never decided, watch this movie again , And now I've seen it as the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not really my cup tea to rape, rape, other types of sex and kill each other, not bad. Wanted to tell the world their film ... if they want to say something ... it did not work. And there is nothing more that can save this film, because it is also pictured in such an ugly style.
