My argument behind seeing this image (though it was free), was less or less than curiosity ... little, little curiosity ... I discovered this straight-to-video "biography" and found it during the opening credentials of Mr. Gene Why Horror Icons Play Hudar? My emotions were not just curiosity, but now one of the gentle gestures of how gene changes its screenplay. There were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns in the credit (some of the serious crimes of Ed's crimes). "OK", I thought to myself ... "It may be silly ridiculous". The film started and slowly (gradually), my microscopic confidence for this film (or I was completely faded as it was "micro-hope") and I was stuck with an extraordinary sense of humiliation because I saw it in a little duck - The pile Widely known and honorable for his past work as an inadvertent serial killer, Hudder wrongly put the game here - turning Edgy gin from light-intelligent repetition, turning into full-blown murders. He was hiding at night, caring for a graveyard, killing his grave and killing a teenage girl, leaving Panini to Paninfeld, because the local Sheriff's section did not think of adjusting at least dangerous situations. The deputy and his mother have a warm little relationship that gave me a frustrating feeling (or I could have used cyanide pills halfway through this turkey). I'm not sure what the point of the film was and of course the director did not know anything about the subject. There are plenty of movies related to genetic narratives that, if the "ad gene snap footage" is not discovered then I do not want to look at them anymore. If you want more authentic films than 2001's "Ad Gene (sky in the light of the moon)"
