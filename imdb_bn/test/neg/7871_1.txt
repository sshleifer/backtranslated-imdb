It's 1 hour and 24 minutes pure borodum! <br /> <br /> This 'action' - uses movies, even using gun belduuns (HK 3A3) to suck. It was sent recycled by the Armed Forces worldwide in the middle of the eighties and is now only used by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I thought this film was bad, then I would rather see that the 10th episode of MacGeiver saved the planet. <br /> <br /> There is no gravel, no drive and no feeling. Tupperware-Watch Channel ?? This is exiting more than this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie is not eligible for '0' on the scale. Good luck next time, Belvedin. Until then, will I grow here to grow my hose ?? Is that a lot more exiting than 'target'?
