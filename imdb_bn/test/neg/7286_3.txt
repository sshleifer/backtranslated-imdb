Hi there. I saw the first part when it came out, and I think this is going to leave me so badly. First, the animation is sticky, woody, does not work, lacks naturalness - I realize that the drawing style can be some 'Atlantan' type, but it can be done with the usual Disney character ... What I want to say is see "Tarzan". If I do not see the Disney logo at the earliest, I've never been a Disney movie. Second, the stomach was like a PC game style, which is like the old search. It was not bad, but it lacks a story that captures the character of the audience and their goals. It was at least, incredible. The film was for kids, but sometimes there was a child. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the music ... I used to say it was inappropriate, but it's the perfect scene with plots and animations. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think for Disney movies to fill the count , It's like one of the only projects by the kind of entertainment, multiple beginner animator. I'm sorry to hear from you, a big Disney lover ...
