When this show came to Disney first, I love to start watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but this show is transformed in any way boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I now find the second and third fun fun, they again watch some teenagers watch. I'm that garbage hat. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadi who liked science and animals and animals. The first season was very entertaining. I do not like the second season due to most Ben. He bothers me and pisses shit from me. The plot in the second season sucks and is just awful
