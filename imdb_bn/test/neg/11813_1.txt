The worst part of this picture is that it will not be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had many beautiful movies, although there are many movies; They thought it gentle and fantastic, and the best-21st-century lesbian-intelligent audience among them would embrace the positive film of lesbians ... and yet the writers and directors are going out of the way to recover almost all the rest of the film. Lesbian repression and confusion in the boarding school, (you know, all gay love places and die). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been done again and again in the film, but something that is visible to the viewer is not enough if someone uses this casting forum explicitly. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story is upright, too terrible and determined that it was painful to engage. The main characters say it all: Rude, abandoned, talented, rebellious lesbian tough girl (well, they took a pretty beautiful woman like Piper Perebo and tried to make her a rage, but it did not take much) determined to betray her. <br /> <br /> Each of them is focused on character 3, a dopi, well-established, wide-eyed, good girl watching. I call it 'step' because he shares his thoughts with the audience with the strict, most crazy psychology. <br /> <br /> Its lines seem to be fifteen years old, even though they are trying, fifteen years old really will be really, words, you know, well ... talk. "They were listening to their crying (hearing), you know, well, well ... okay!" He is talking about the roommates in his two beds, who roam the bed beside him. <br /> <br /> He asked Graham Greene - A successful American American actor who was completely destroyed as a gardener! (!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Perabo has an excellent power level and is definitely very comfortable in front of a camera. He will do well in a decent project, so it is not in any way criticism of acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is one of the characters, to make permanent stereotypes perpetual to lesbians in perpetuation. They were his (sedentary) angry, crazy, secretive genius who could not finish mathematical problems for a lecturer. Oh, but after that he argued with the teacher who filed a complaint against "Gobbing". <br /> <br /> "This is the use of male (female) against the United States!" He says, stomping from the classroom. <br /> <br /> can all these writers come with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop? <br /> <br /> with pole and so on. Went away and made Polly a poetic dark child, who screamed with the wild forest and shouted their names. <br /> <br /> Slow motion, scientist, JESA atmosphere! Then we wrote her post on her birthday ... (Most lesbians are boyfriends-orphan orphans if you are in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one high, one with a junky loose neck tie) who travel around all the tasks (the school looks just too big for two teachers) ... and dark children / The seductress / bird girl gives tense look. Hmmmm. I'm surprised if something is good, you know ... Um, what's happening between these two teachers? Hartbrook happened, but the writer and director know that lesbians exist in a much more sophisticated period than this impressive period. <br /> <br /> I can not respect those who force themselves to sit at the last, but if you are not laughing, I can only guess you are crying. And not the exact reason. And I do not mean to figure out the Wimpy.
