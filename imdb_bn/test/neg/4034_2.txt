No film that I have ever seen before came as close to being boring and stupid as a jersey hand. And I've always had a big B-movie fan. After seeing this whole scrap, although I can honestly say that it does not even come near a B-movie. <br /> <br /> If someone in this movie relies on her life she can work. The script is so stupid that I have never heard such a thing in my life. The authors have to spend a few years to see how they can work and talk to the real life people, even then they will not be able to create a visible film because it is so obvious that they all have the power to do any talent involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can make a good movie with a digital camera and some giant toys. Also, forget about any sexy scenes, women in leather clothing are so awesome, as soon as you get awake! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
