Even I did not read Ana Rice's "Queen of the Deadend" from "I'm Vampire Chronicles", but perhaps I thought that this movie was very awful. <br /> <br /> It was wasted, plot-less, it's made in absolutely no sense. I was a bit worried about the plot separated from the book, and as long as I thought it was bad. It is ridiculous to associate Chronicles with the film in any way, because it is laughably inconsistent with that film, leave the book together. "The Vampire Chronicles" Some of the fairly simple ideas of Rice's talent were deceived and derided. <br /> <br /> This is a disgrace to all Al Rise fans and this kind of excuse for inheriting the last film of Allyah. . Indeed, it is also a shame to the fans of Aaliyah. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only possible sound effects and graphics can be paid by some. Although they might be as good as it, it was not too busy to spend time watching this movie. In fact, I have signed up for this membership for the sole reason of contacting annoying people for this film (as it may be after 7 years of liberation war) or wishing to waste time or expect much out of frustration.
