This is a very low budget movie, which is located in a valley protected by radiation effects. Cast, an old man and daughter, a beautiful visitor, a couple (a hard buy and a girl), a drifter, an ass and a person affected by radiation, contact with the effects of a nuclear explosion. An organization watching with women taking a bath to join. <br /> <br /> They have all the guns, some of them shot, some are asked to have children, children are killed, and others just move away and good, this movie. Harvey Karamen's first film, it shows a certain simplicity in filmmaking. To avoid costly sets, actors enter the screen and exit the room (that is, in the studio). The location shots pictured in the hills near Hollywood are Backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say that it is good to get out of your way, but it is interesting to see how the issues of the people were created in the 50's. .
