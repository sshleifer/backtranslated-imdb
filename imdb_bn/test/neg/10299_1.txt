Without doubt, the biggest waste of the year's film. This movie is filled with weakly structured, wicked, cruel and unlucky characters. Above that, and perhaps the worst crime, it's reluctant and widely predictable. When Bill Pullman's character gets "doodled" in the photo to change the word "Violence" from "Proof", my whole plot is captured. No wonder and there is no compulsory reason to see this trash. The only redemption feature for me is that I saw this free on my HDNet cable and did not waste any money. If I could see it in the theater then I would be really angry. <br /> <br /> Anyone who manages this thriller will really get more. It's important that a terrible, terrible film is in place.
