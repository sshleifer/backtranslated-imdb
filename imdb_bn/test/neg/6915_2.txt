None of this movie can do much. It's probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. Pianist makeup effects are very good with macromials, but this is the only thing that keeps this rate from 1. The extreme mood swings from the Hastaria in seconds through a doctor's assistant extreme mood and then forgets where he was next scene. The director gathered a number of correct elements for a crazy doctor's film, but in some ways the skeleton of the story had forgotten to hang on them. If you do not know anyone or someone in the crew, I will not even recommend giving it a sample.
