Family members. Fresh, original, and actually quite fun when the show was first promoted. Now, I stopped watching it. It has become one of the worst shows on television, unreasonable jokes, repetitive, stretched jokes, and it is hoped that every joke can be fun by including the word "anxiety". Seth McFarlane has a clear problem with himself, and he is definitely very sorry to the audience of the 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how such a thing was funny, which is different from all the other, so a "comedy" show devolve in this horrible mess. I've heard one liners seriously from a Pude comic. <br /> <br /> It looks really sad to see the great show, and continue to see the vineyard like this. Seth McFarlane's attempt has ceased, or he believes that this event is a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> <br /> I hate this event, and will finally cancel when an Irish mess dance.
