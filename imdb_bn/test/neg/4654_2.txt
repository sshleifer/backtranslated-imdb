very bad. This movie (and the rooky fools in the open) is the oldest propeller and his dog's 'cadaver', such as a lacy, as well as a boring baby whose name I can not remember at this time. At the beginning of the film, the old projector Dilibhatta herself buried herself in some sand so that the poor dog was forced to dig it. Why? He hates dogs? Anyhoo, somehow or another, has managed to strike this stupid gold, and his companion goes to say. But people are dead, and his sleazy other partner is happy to help old Jonathan in digging gold. Trying to leave the dog with the son of Giza's dead, but even the disabled mettle does not want to stay with the kids. The strange old preacher (cute reading for perfume), and the oily guy ended the old guy (surprise, surprise) and tried to steal all the gold. Plus he tries to kill the dogs poisons and too young. So I think okay that a devil and crazy Lassie..err ... SHEP end up this guy, although basically it's a child movie originally annoying. Native Americans speak without using the verb (for example, create my cam cam fire type lecture) at very impressive (ethnic slurp point). And most of it was the cost of the cast, because apparently the salary of Lasasi was too big for them to rent someone else. Dull type Not very interesting, and a hide is very dark. No way is a great movie.
