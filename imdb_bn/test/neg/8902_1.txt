The evil World Bank, IMF, globalization, and the continual repeating of Americans are responsible for all African problems? And the film is long, almost two hours, but it seems longer. The French actually captured Mali, in the country it was held for six centuries, but only peripheral boys were bad boys. <br /> <br /> No one can really learn enough about a character for what's happening ?? They are fully marginal for promotion, which goes on and on. There is no plot, there is no development of character, there is no laughter (except for bush and wolfwits, some insects, but it is very easy to cheat) and the production prices are moderate? There is no ransom there. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that the movie can broadcast such a big thing about two hours and release completely empty facts. Irish ballad "I was going to die, and then the famine came" there is more content. <br /> <br /> The movie is annoying, sub-heading is hard to read, there is no real content about film, and the promotion is continuing. <br /> <br /> leave this one.
