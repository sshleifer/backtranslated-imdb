After almost killing a large dog, a cat cat thinks itself, "Why can not I be a scent then everyone will leave me alone." He looks around Junkard and receives an idea: white color, black color and some limber cheese and some garlic ..... Hmmm The next thing you know, we have the forerunner of "Pep Le Le", although in this cartoon he is still a cat, he is a girl and only a scandal in disguise. <br /> <br /> <br /> The cat is enjoying its full status and enjoying full benefits like fragrance scandal. He is now a happy, satisfied man ... until a real fascination (the voice of Charles Boy's imitation)! <br /> <br /> I thanked the cottage for cottage. However, overall I do not take care of this French-techaph letter, stereotyptical conversation overdone and not really funny, so I only rated it as "fair". At the end of the story I do this point for morality.
