For the first time I started writing a review. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like different types of movies. I'm rationally open, and can easily say that I enjoyed a movie though "yes it was not good but I enjoyed it". I can understand the skills of great films like The Shawk Shank Redemption, The Godfather and American History X. I might like a good movie in a film like a scary, or comedy, even if the movie might not be great. I can also enjoy a bad movie which happens to humble me. Even if I do not like it, I will try to rate the film roughly. I do not enjoy Charlie Chaplin's City Lights, but I can appreciate acting and story lines. <br /> <br /> I think some people will have to take a few ideas on the account by clicking on a rating randomly by clicking on this site. Actually try to rate the movie based on how well it is. Do not affect your personal bias rating. Also compare the other steps you have been given and compare it to the movie you're going to rate. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is the worst part of the trash I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where only steals. The acting was terrible across the board. In the scene where the best of the sticky. But there was a real disrespectful story. In the first 20 minutes, we were actually a story that tried to understand and was present from the point of view to the audience. But later it was a nightmare. They try to add new elements but nothing has been explained. Really nothing is understood, Steward was dead, he was hit by the light, he was light, it was really light, it was aliens, he did not tied together the end of an alien, etc. and did not really answer any questions. Careful where we were just happy to leave the theater that was not just positive. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What is wrong with you? I will admit that 8 of us are crazy to see it, do we think "what would it do better?" And we decided to tell some of our friends that the film was good so they have to suffer and see this movie. I can say what lucky company loves. I can only see 6.5 reasons for rating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your life!
