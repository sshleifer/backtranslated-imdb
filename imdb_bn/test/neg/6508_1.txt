Perhaps it was too much weight gain Seagal. Or maybe it was an awesome act of Wayans in an action flick. Or was there a total lack of chemistry between these two main characters? Because of this and other considerations, I was convinced that Segal could never make this acting nightmare. True, story lines were good. Nevertheless, as Saigal's career and enthusiastic pursuit of the background, his physical appearance was consistent with the clear, pure, healthy Jane Buddhist living, especially in discussions with Wayan on his screen. (Then again, with "Nani" his real life was also inappropriate!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keep the ridiculous elements or situations in this story where there is no alternative to reacting to the actor in a playful way. Otherwise, after the serial killer, the wise-cracks and humorous attempts failed. Seagal guy is not a natural humor type. It did not work. <br /> <br />
