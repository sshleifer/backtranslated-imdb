Stew Alve has some Asian horror films that include technology on the story. Some of these Asian horror movies are a Missed Call, Ring and Pulls. So, the concept of the Stew Alive is very clear and obvious, but the filmmakers did not know how to put new or interesting topics behind in the STA ALIVE. This movie is completely unclear. But a very big cone. All the elements of the StairAll are among the worst categories of 'horror' films: shallow characters, nothing doubtful, stupid 'horror' that cause smile and mild violence. It is easy that it is unable to make "silent" any original or annoying. Please do not take any more time to write it. Film I just recommend you: do not see this image. I really hate it.
