It is impossible to think of what this unique adaptation is trying to do. <br /> <br /> A group of top quality actors, the main good cast (with a few exceptions) are those who perform well. Penelope Keith is the perfect and equally good Joanna Lumley as Diana as Annie Louise. All the scripts they gave were all right. <br /> <br /> Very good. The average set will be included. There is nothing like the house described in Nancharo's book, although the house they live in for the Door House seems to be uniquely seen. It is clear that the Dover House is much larger. In the latter part, the authors decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, possibly to save money, although with a little imagination I suspected that they could resurrect the silen. <br /> <br /> Now bad. Screenplay. It is difficult to find the word that is an unexpectedly bad adaptation word. Edward does not die in Britain's war, he survives, becomes blind. He makes a brief look then suicide - why ?? In the womb of the boyfriend, the wife of the intelligent lover of the boyfriend has been transformed from the lover of the young, who can rarely give up his love of tears (less emotional than a brief encounter) with tears. Gus, a man is cruel and lover in love, ready to give up his love without accusations. Walter (The Book Mujhe) is actively involved in a cruel family from a shallow unfaithful husband. Do not talk to Jesse who has made psychologically disturbed young man. Annie BD still has water problems but now without any reason. The Door House army has occupied for a clear reason other than the very few scenes feared by armed soldiers with the glory. Though Miss Montimer's breasts are absolutely delightful, I did not see how their exhibition progressed at different times. The delightful name became Nettlebed Mundon Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> Here is a series that has lost all interest in showing me this obscurity and I am surprised that these changes were made to follow the story. The image is difficult that Rosemundy Pillar approved this remarkable distortion of his book; Probably when he bought the rights he lost his control.
