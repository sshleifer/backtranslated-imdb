I like the whole set with the Caesar Palace, Roman guards, and announcers tog The voice of WWFF has been identified until this incident is marked as a "Daura Pass". Gorilla Mansoon, who finished the game by playing for this double WBPP PPV, opened it and gave it a general presentation so that he could announce another PPV. But then Jim Ross is going to make his WWF debut and JR continues the W. WFF commentary on this day. But outside of this, this program is pure garbage. Good ol scientific skills have been thrown out of the window and enter the birth of gimmicks. It was to me that the WWF toilet started to go down, and did not recover until the end of the 90's. Here is a review of the incident. <br /> <br /> IC Title Match: Suddenly (Challenger) vs. Shaun Michaels (Champion): One-Day Opener, but it was very frustrating to give Shaun what he was capable of. I do not have any idea why the WWF was immediately in Dhaka. They should realize that Shawn was in the future, and so was an Indian gimik like a very wrestler. The end of the match was very hair. Shawn holds the reference and pulls him out, then called for counting. When Sherri was having fun watching the watching, this match was just forgettable. Shane had to carry this match and it was a problem. <br /> <br /> Stevenier's Brothers vs. Headshanks: Stevens has won through Franksteiner. This match was in moments, but the crowd just do not think it. There was no heat behind it, I think it was just a match to throw two tag teams. <br /> <br /> Crash vs The Daink The Clown: Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This match sucked completely. Two very hair gimmicks Dressed in kittens and a Hawaiian bizarre color. Everyone is caught by the last surprise. In the ensuing months, Cross Hill became a face and faced with Dox, but none of the fans seem to care. Sadly, this was not the worst match for the card. <br /> <br /> Razor Ram v. Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel which is running very much against the wrestler who forgot about 10 years ago. Smile when fans come to snicker and backlund. And like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen at WM18, Heels gets loud cheers in wrestler's face. Thankfully this match was short. The right guy won, but I hope that he will completely defeat the backlund and beat Squash completely, rather than winning the razor completely by a small package. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Davies and IRS (Champs) vs. Hulak Hogan and Brutus Biffake w / Jimmy Heart I still want to know the whole story of what happened to Hogan's eyes. Well good The crowd was really in this match, but it had no flow ever. Hogan and Biffaq were clearly facing the ring rost that both wrestlers had a shelf for at least one year. Debbie, the great technical wrestler he was, helped to carry the match completely from the waste. Dibies and IRS won the victory through the DQ. But to make the crowd happy, Hogan and Bifaq played them fairly to crowd in the end. They won the match. <br /> <br /> Lex Liger v. Perfect: The best part of this match was that of Lex Luger with four hot girls up to the ring. Without that, these were completely forgettable. Mr. Perfect Geometric was born for a Hill role and he was lacking in heat as a face. And Luger is a waste of time. He does not matter what gimmick he is. Luger had the feet rope of Perfect that won through a persel. Then the Perfect Post Butt spends his butt and kicked out. The first luger knocks him out with elbow running. Then, when the perfect sensation was returned, he returned to the dressing room to get rid of Logarake only by Shavon Michaels, an HB / Perfect Fayed that could be classic, but the possibility of using the WWF could be misused. <Br> <br /> The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzalez: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What was the WWF thinking about the horrific wrestlers like Daniel Gonzales? Sure, it was his size, but I used to see Brooklyn Browser in a match than that. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That he's a giant lard ass Brett was able to carry the match, but Mr. A predictive finish with Fuji mixing salt in the face of Brett. <br /> <br /> Match Match: Yokozuna vs Hulak Hogan Here is the right chaos. Hogan does not come to the ring for obvious reasons, and Mr. Fuji challenges him in a match winning the joke title. Even the drowning HulkamiAx searches for BS.
