I saw this picture in a mother tongue on Saturday with a friend. About 70% of the theater was full. <br /> <br /> Although there are several fun lines, it is more than a drama / suspense that leaps over laughter. Robin Williams gives a decent performance as Laura Linna. Having a fan of a daily show, Lewis Black is quite good in this. Christopher Walken gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, and for the first thirty minutes it continues, then the suspense part moves and starts to hold you a little across the rest of the film. Suspense a supposed comedy movie? I know that along with all other places I struggled with this. During a character suspense sequence, crack a joke and you will hear only one or two smiles in the theater. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie became laughable after the end of the film. So, of course, some people enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie four out of 10, because I believe the comedy aspect does not work very well in a suspense / drama film and performance of the actors. Not bad, just was decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie was not advertised.
