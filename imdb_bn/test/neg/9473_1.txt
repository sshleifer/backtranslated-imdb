I looked at Roger Moore and saw that running or exercise required. He was James Bond who was quite comfortable telling the story of his fellow British Knights. There is nothing against the elderly at the age of the appropriate age, but at least 58 years old is fighting for the birds of the air, hanging in front of the train, and crumbling crocodile etc. How realistic? ? In addition to the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, vapid, and moronic, a helpless oldster involved in defying stunts of many deaths just made it so easy to smile at James Bond. By 1983, Roger Moore was clearly watching his age, and he lived for a long time when he could fight with the youth. I saw this movie in the theater, and there was a lot of sunny smiles and often. James Bond made any credibility that went after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another low point was that incredibly half of Lum Louis Jordan Evil's Axis. Jordan has helped to make the whole idea even more ridiculous. And the Russian General was a total secret. OCTOPUSSY works well as a comedy spoof similar to the Spirari like the US. <br /> <br /> The train scene in the train was a bad copy of the same train scene done in other other films by good actor. Take the Emperor of North (1972), where Lee Marvin and Ernest Bergen fought in the upper and lower part of the train and showed it thrilling and practical. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet his stunt double was clearly a small, tall and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his war scene more humorous. Moore stunts are similar to the old low-budget chip-shake Kung-Fu movies, especially with poor editing. The director seemed to try to do bad acting and bad stunt better by providing different views of the same stunt. This only accentuated the difference between Moore and his stunt doubling. Train scenes with Moore were shot inside the studio, when Moore's shot shot a double shot of an actual train. While editing their stunts, most of the bond films should be the worst. You can usually see that bond actors are not actually fighting. Overall OCTOPUSSY is one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst bond movies have the worst.
