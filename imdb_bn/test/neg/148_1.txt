I came across the net throughout this movie and I was scared of the violence and violence scenes of brutal torture. There was a relief to learn that after reading it it was not real. A person with a dangerously sick animal does something like this and goes out of faith for some reason. I am more surprised to see the movie's evaluators in the comments section of this site. This is really a very annoying film that can change your life forever. People behind this should buy justice Asap. Today they are being raped by a girl and appear screened on screen tomorrow it may be a child. Even its fake or not very very boring annoying, indeed boring.
