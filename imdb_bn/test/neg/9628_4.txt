I really do not have heart mirrormask. I really wanted more from a movie than a beautiful visual. The film begins with Helena, a young girl who works in a circus. But the other children (supposedly) want to escape from the circus if they want to escape to the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helena is willing to drop dead. Bad decisions Mother is sick ... some (probably cancer) and need surgery. On the previous night of surgery, he had dreamed that he traveled in a wonderful world of his dreams and nightmares where he "found himself". Personally personally got the shit for me in the movie as she started to dream. The primary scenes show the strange and wonderful world of circus, and then it reverses the atrocities of the hospital and the slurry of an apartment block. But as soon as he dreams of the whole film, on the CGI land, almost everything is computer pictures. The problem is that this dream should not have any of the mysteries of the world and it should remain. Movies like the Wizard of Oz, Mirrormakers think it is exciting to hear pictures in our faces and then throw them in for another image. This film has a little rhythm or reason in the design, and although some things are very beautiful (librarian is a wonderful composition) they disappear so quickly that they have forgotten very soon. Helena and her Sidekick Valentine are the most annoying at the worst and helpless. Overall Mirrormask is a bite to you that you bite and actually find Ash. Kids in the real world stick
