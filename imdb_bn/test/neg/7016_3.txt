Who was the concept of "cake" (?) To cut the ball in this picture? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby all the way. Very rarely had Lucy should sing his songs. <br /> <br /> There is no compensation other than Jack Herman's score "It's Ha Ha Young Efil", and we perform at the main Broadway cast member Jane Kennel and B. Arthur. . <br /> <br /> I think Robert Preston will have to give a song, so the lowest "loving you". <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this wrong redhead was thrown.
