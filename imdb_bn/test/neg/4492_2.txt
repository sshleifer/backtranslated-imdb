May have spillers. <br /> <br /> A innocent trailer park or maybe 'comt' is a horrible childhood tragedy witnessing white children's drugs and violence. An unauthorized but dedicated police partners attempt to take only a 'sophisticated' high-end club drug ring to be fired and chewed by high-value attorneys by drug dealers. With more expected completion, the plot will increase further to come back for revenge. Ron Jeremy was the only memorable part of a walk-on. <br /> <br /> If I were in the movie theater then I would have wanted to return. I am sorry for the poor actors of this movie. It was just awful and painful to see. The worst part was the cinematography director to keep back in the same view so that the word did not match perfectly. And it was not a codec and DVD problem but a deliberate strategy. Ughh. Two stars
