Some movies are off-bits, but are enjoyable, but many movies are simply mind-numbingly weird. "Motorama" does not fit very well in the next section. Many eventually opt for the presence of the guest and the total lack of feeling, but these two things can only take a movie, and "Motorma" simply does not qualify for its achievement. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" delights on the impossibility of the plot itself. Its main character, Gass, is a trendsetter based on a 10 million-legendary country that tries to collect game pieces for $ 500 million. While talking to adults, none of them thinks or 10 years old worried about this issue. First of all, it is incredibly funny, but it becomes incredible, especially when people are so amazed by the many boring people running (and the image of any age) around them. There is no depth in Gus, and a hero anti-hero is not difficult to find his piece of game for someone else, it is difficult to feel sorry for him when he is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The problem is provided by a slew of guest attendance, each and every misreating gass is more and more weird way. In addition to the present-day intriguing plot, more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share the lack of gauss and evenly disrespectful. The character's actions can be a little interesting, but the actors do not add anything to them, thus denying the whole point to get big names (both of them and the character are the same). The presence of this guest appears to have been signed more for a price than anything else in the market. <br /> <br /> "Motora" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but the script has very little adjustment to work on it. Events that should have lasting effects on heroes and viewers, such as the movie are about to happen quickly, it is hoped that at some point the audience may feel sorry or understanding for Gus. This can not happen, as nothing is allowed to be attached, it moves forward like a case after another in a conveyor belt. A story can be so illusive as unreasonable, and it is a major character who never develops himself or anyone else for a higher level of care, without offering little to the "totem" and trying to get rich, the offer is a bit less. Why should we care about that?
