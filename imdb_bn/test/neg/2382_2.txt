Disgust Unfortunately it's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. No character is preferred remotely, which makes this film hard to see. They are all aged 30 years old, who are not responsible for their weak life. I was able to make it within just half an hour of the film, so it is likely to be a little better then, but I doubt it. I can not imagine five as self-absorbed because they can maintain friendship with each other for ten years. <br /> <br /> Three of the first half sex scenes were frustrating, because they did not have plot relevance, and clearly an ineffective (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise shameless film. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money, and avoid this movie.
