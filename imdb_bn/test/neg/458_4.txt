After the turning point of Knight Mast Fall, Robert Montgomery (most of the time) came in his best film and performance: Here Mr. Jordan, they were expensive, Lady Lady, Pin Horse Ride, Saxon Charm, Zuna Bride. Even some of the failures were still interesting (Houston, Mr. and Mr. Smith's Rez). But Montgomery wanted to do more production and management. How did he create the performance of his latest film in 1949 - he is Kalha Langa, an indecent film star, who dragged the authorities to help investigate a young boyfriend. <br /> <br /> View my opinion This image is a minority. The opinions given are most favorable about it. I thought it was a dull, intelligent script, the Anne Blith group was not very interesting as a character in the heroine. He praised Montgomeri as a star and when he was called "call" to help the authorities, I soon saw that there was no chemistry between them. Montgomery and Rowland Winther tried, though the script was a lot of fun. As a fun thing, I remember today that Taylor is the wealthy father of Homer Bleth, and he is a fan of Winston Churchill. So she always dressed like Churchill, and we saw her wearing a floppy Broad Bremid Hat, a big cigar smoking and painter (help in the disguise of Whales's head head). This was the most memorable joke from this movie - not an actual memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery went on to elementary television and finally got attention and respect in motion picture. His last contact with these movies was about his hour of giant about his friend Jimmy Cagney, acting actor Admiral William "Bull" Hollas. This is a much better movie than this. For his overall film and television career, I will give this middle-class film "4". That strikes me as generous
