Perhaps the worst thing ever in the history of the film, I have seen Wang's side. This movie made me the worst movie of all of 2000, Courtney Soulman's Dangios and Dragon looked like an Oscar winner. This movie is beyond the interpretation of error errors. The biggest one lacks depth Not every scene is fully developed to know how the editing room works properly. It is shameful that such a miracle star and a popular popular tradition can be destroyed by this lack of philosophy. <br /> <br /> I hate and hope that some great directors like John or Lee, have decided to rebuild this image and to do some justice. I'm not sure I can rate 0/10 ??
