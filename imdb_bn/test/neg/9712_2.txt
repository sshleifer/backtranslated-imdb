As mentioned by others, can the former "Wayne's World" star Mike Mayer have any other reason to watch this film than playing a serious role? The story line is interesting but the lack of development and loose is damaged by the end and bad characters. If there was a nice nice shot in Ireland, it would give another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a small village which is clearly surrounded by the 'green grassland' of the Irene-Islam, which is often shown in Irish movies. If there was a cultural 'spice' to appreciate the "Irish persona" it would be worth watching, but it could be shot in England almost. Very bad for the mayors, but this is never failing to please the heart or satisfy anybody who ever wanted to see the land of Guiness.
