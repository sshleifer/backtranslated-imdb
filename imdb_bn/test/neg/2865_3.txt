I really enjoyed many films from Gerard Depardie and I hope I like this movie more than I do. The biggest reason is that I did not think this movie was too fun or funny - so it did not hold my interest. Also, even though he is not sleeping with the girls of his head, the idea that he is lying that he is talking about his older boyfriend is just easy! Yes, I do not know there is no turmoil and I know that nobody around them knows that he is really his father, but I have seen that his child is very bad by passing his father like her sex, and prevents the movie from being fun. In addition, I did not really like this little brat too much. In addition to his lies, he seems very involved in sassy and self. I liked if he had anyhow achieved his "coming" and punished in other ways, I did not like him.
