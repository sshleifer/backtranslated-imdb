This show is great in the environment. There are lots of nice buildups, but this shows where the fails are. There's a way to build up for a lot of things. You will continuously see a strange set up, which it really is coming out of the corner somewhat unusually and then .... nothing. Nothing over over again You hear many stories of stories talking about strange events but you see no one. They show them at the door of these people, talking about their deep and emotional sins, setting hair tools and finding nothing! There is nothing in this show that leads me to believe something unusual. I smile every time they need to practice a "fearful spirit" that they have not seen nothing as an audience. They were never to get rid of that spirit and everything was kept in a tasty little package. A show that looked so weird and so great a possibility was one thing ... nothing!
