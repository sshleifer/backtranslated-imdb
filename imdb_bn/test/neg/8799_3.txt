Very stock footage (almost a third of this 53-minute film) really reduces it. The plot is sent to John Weston (John Wayne) by Marshal George Higgins (George Hays) for sending a permanent rodeo ("ro-day-oh"), but the character development and interaction is dedicated. The relationship between bad girl (usually a latina - even the great "duck soup" [1 9 33]) and the 'heroine' polly Anne Young, the appearance of Loreta Young (hey! It's her sister!) May be more screen time. Happy ending is very rare - although at this time John Wayne actually kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting stock footage was the real Indians, the parapets of the long rodeo in Scau and the Papoos. But the best part of the film is the work of the great Yak Stunt, Yakima Cantt, who runs us from one horse to another jumping and running in the horse, you know that we are in trouble. As mentioned by others, the final battle with Villene has been done very badly. <br /> <br /> An extra, sparse, non-fitting (pseudo-classical) music video track from Platinum Disk Corporation, my platform, undermines the authenticity of the original film. (This was 'Extended Audio 5.1' in the DVD box.) If you're going to modernize and color it, then you must combine the 'Western' sounding score with acoustic guitars, 'clip-clipping' hoofbeats, harmonicas, and an accordion. Finally, we have to say that it is one of the weakest Lone Star efforts.
