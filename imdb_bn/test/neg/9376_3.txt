"De Domini" is a real Dutch gangster, based on the life of class Bruce! In the film, she is called a Chess Donator! I suspect that the events presented in the movie have something to do with what happened! But that does not really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! My crap in this movie is disturbed! It lacks the substance and style! The acting was good and if some of the material could try to root out the part of the substance! Without substances you will bring at least some style or decent action! Do we need entertainment? If the director saw more gangster movies, it would help! It is clear that he is not! Otherwise, he would not do so! This film has received lots of publicity as a small scandal and members of the Dutch Royal family around Claes Bruncima. There is nothing more to do with this scandal film! Without this, "D Dominini" would never have been successful! I'm sure it!
