For one quarter three quarters, the story gradually develops towards some kind of point of origin. Although it is exaggerated with the audience, it seems to be the viewer's nod and to remove him from the real plot, something seems to be happening. It's not so much and it's certainly not obvious. Combination of palace impressions and story-driving scenes does not add any depth or insight into the whole cast. In fact, they are barbaric because of the development of any character. Everyone just imagined and centered around their own clich√© and roles - cute, kinda headstrong girl; War conspirators, grandfather's elite. There is no difference in the leadership of the man, he is a shallow presence, which, in fact, was not needed for his strokeboard, it is not so important - it seems he was on holiday and was caught up. When the angle turns around after the incident, the movie gets completely blank for the first few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or better, dissolves - with the book Dus X M Machina, more cliche and most crude plot devices and choices I have ever seen. It's history, OK. Although the first movie is a play, it is considered ridiculous, and then it becomes a French. The drama is what they are expected to do, and there is no surprise. Although the first set of some serious opponent is literally replaced by a couple of irritated couples. Maybe there was some attention to the audience. <br /> <br /> This film does not receive any bonus for my fundamental philosophical meaning (since there is no one there) and its technical perceptions. Animation and editing are fair and so sound mixing; But it is not even better than the average of Japan's production in the late 1980's. In reality, visual behaviors seem static, non-inspired and non-original. Worst - It fails to fully entertain, even if you are not bothered by letters and all the elements. Here's going very little, and the rest is best best. Instead get a real Ghibli, have a banquet with it and keep your fingers close to this one.
