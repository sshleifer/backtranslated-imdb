Probably one of the best, most terrible B movies, such as this is so bad and random, it's very funny and I do not know how I can feel about it. I think about cabin fever ... there's just something about this baby jumping off the verandah 'pancake' yelling off the porch and intriguing that. Since many people have already plotted the plot and what I'm going to do is enrich the quality of the movie by quoting together: "I'm Park Ranger, you'll go to CI". Yes, enough? If you are looking for quality or a scary movie, I do not recommend it. But if you like this kind of movie, I guess that you will enjoy it .. I do not know how, but I think some people will want to.
