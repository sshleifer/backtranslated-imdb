Jacques has returned with his own realistic show of left-leaning fame, and it's not as funny as Jacques, but it's also astonishingly stupid! This should be one of the ever dumbest shows ever imagined. Surely there is bad reality show but nobody is as confident or stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Left Margarita makes it big, and her parents decide to piggy to Bangkok from her reputation. His crew on the left and his parents, his uncle, stupid friends live together, and the left and his friends break down and become naughty, usually his parents are fools at home. When the left parents do not get lazed at home, they are torturing the left, especially the father. To add humor, we know his fat uncle Dawn, who is constantly out of it and is never paying attention. <br /> <br /> This show is actually like a ton-down version of Jacques ... Then there is no stunt, instead the left and his friends go to the pause elements, and the hair stunts, and in the meantime the music makes the ball more awesome. This is not the least fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the cash-city of the Jacques series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** out of 30 minutes.
