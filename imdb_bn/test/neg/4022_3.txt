Was this the movie of Jack brother? I do not laugh at Holly (I'm Billy Wyder's big fan of "Siege of Private Life"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" sounds like a grand-goginnol-esque episode "Murders, He Writes" directed by Mel Brooks From the first opening credit, the worst possible kind: a montage in the movie scene). Ian Richardson is a great actor and definitely part of the look (he's a dead pigment for those drawings from the strings!), But his character is wrong and very ridiculous, he often plays sport (I thought cocaine was in the brain, not weed) in the sequence of carnival His expressions of curiosity power It is not mentioned that when he kept himself disguised as an old man, he is at the top, despite the fine makeup we can recognize him. David Healy is an uncomfortable but, the situation is not acceptable, given Watson, and a buffoon is not too much ... at least not more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mori Morrison in an exaggerated fashion fashion directly outside the Boulevard of 1930. <br /> <br /> Some pointless additions (such as the Tonga vampire tooth, the hunger of raw meat, and the turning of Dr. Mooreu Island make him the Carnival cage), and we deny the joy of discovering the mystery as well as Holmes Before we find out we all know. And this tired clinic is full: Only we did not get the infamous cafferez "Initial, my favorite Watson" (which a Charlotte would know, Canaan Dowell never written), but we face such wonderful places like Hindi music. When Holi sees the white woman in Hindi, she is not pop out anywhere. <br /> <br /> The following line: In eight years, two British TV companies tried to create a long-running series of adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. , And produced the primary TV-movie as a potential pilot. One of them Ian Richardson, another actor Jeremy Brett. Thankfully, his way through multiple episodes is the best one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Ridiculous imitation
