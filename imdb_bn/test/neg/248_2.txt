I saw it in mystery Science Theater 3000, and even the show could not really make this movie portable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects from this old movie, but I've seen it better. There are lots of spaces in the storyline that you are trying to find out even in the specific view. The cameraman obviously did not know what the tip was, and too much coffee was too hard, because the camera was always vibrating. I could not even follow the plot, but it is enough to say that in this life I have sometimes seen the worst movie. <br /> <br /> Update: I have seen "Epic Movie" a few minutes ago and decided to give this movie 2. I have never seen the worst movie ever!
