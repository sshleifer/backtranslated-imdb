Eddie Morphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination which is a great comedy result. Great prospect often leads to feeling, and is proven in this case. <br /> <br /> When Eddie Detective as a police officer, the drug contracted by Robert, they make it so much worse that they live in reality reality TV police shows. Argument is not a great element in this movie. Super-gun they sure spent it behind the second half of the movie behind it. A twelve gauge machine gun that releases a sheetmate and three big holes, will destroy a house in less than a minute (without reloading) more fantastic than science fiction. A five-pound gun, shot hundreds of minutes per minute without every minute, of course, the future weapons using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie is adult or child, so if you are somewhere, this is the movie for you.
