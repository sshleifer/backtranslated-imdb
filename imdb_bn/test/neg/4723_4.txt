Dr. Kremlan wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decided to replace a heart with a beans would cure his son (not - I'm not fun). He replaces and (then) his son changes from a weak person to muscular people, which is like a cover with a dime store mask! Naturally, he goes out, kills a man, women wear tears and damages. All these policemen are inter-cut with boring romance. Arturo Martinez and female wrestler Lucy Osorio We get the pointless female wrestling sequence that does not add anything to the platail. This is the last copy of "King Kong" finished! This (of course) is a beautiful stupid movie. The plot is a little intuitive, unwelcome female nudity (the mainstay of any exploitation film) and many graphic themes that appear to be laughingly fake (except open heart transplant). There is still this merit. The whole cast takes everything seriously dead and is not really as bad as the actors. Also the conversation was dubbed (for such a film) nicely working well with good dubbing and striking. Also I saw a nice DVD print with bright strong color (which helps). We're not talking a classic here but an exploiting movie.
