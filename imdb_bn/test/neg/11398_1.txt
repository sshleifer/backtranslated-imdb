Indeed I doubt if I have anything about this movie. For the story: Unreal and very overwhelming. Acting was very bad in my opinion. Perhaps probably Anthony Camarling will not get Roger House status status Hope some people do whatever it does Let him first work on his English pronunciation. If you watch these actors 'trip' in Paris (DVD-Extra) you probably want to up-date. Beau Dorens's suggestion: Turn off your acting career, you will not go there ... 2 major 'actors': grow up To be generous, I want to give it 10 out of 4 <br /> <br />
