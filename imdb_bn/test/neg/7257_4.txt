I hold a discount copy of this. I saw it many years ago. My only recent experience was "Mystery Science Theater" where it was completely leakage. One gets a chance to really get this movie because of all this byplay really. I love the beginning of fifty thousand horror movies. They give us a chaotic lecture in the defense systems near Arctic. They were there to protect us from this expected Soviet invasion, but due to the very simple insect threat they would be easily useful. <br /> <br /> This special one flies. For some reason, despite his exoskeleton made by the staff pallet, they can still wind off air missiles and disable fighter planes. However, it is more fun - firstly, the mandatory boring case, who saw flying things, was cooling his heels in the hospital (it teaches only one - see a large insect like a house - keep your mouth closed). I was surprised that the poor could find a bug and go home. No, this is a simple general effort. It suddenly follows the usual effort to spread the bug - and later the Russians - leave us for other possibilities. I still get a kick out from this movie and this one is serviceable.
