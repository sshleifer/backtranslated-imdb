I bought this movie scene invisible at a movie-fi convention and I was deserved to do something as silly as possible. Just make this film impossible, annoying and unwanted. <br /> <br /> I was so annoyed and upset about the lack of plot development that I stopped it to see the repeat of MathBusters. I understand that this was a very low budget decision, or at least it seemed like a very low budget decision, but it did not excite horror act, terrible plot and even bad camera work. A group of college students seem to see something in the class and something like being drunk. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if villain is not so ridiculous and the plot is something that can happen in real life in real life, it may be fun to have fun. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
