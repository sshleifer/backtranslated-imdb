I hate the book. A guy meets a smart dog, gets a damsel girlfriend, and when they are being followed by a hit man and a nude animal thing (both dogs). Dean Quantz can not really write (I read the book on my sister's recommendation, I should know better). When I saw it, (mostly out of the uncertain curiosity) I actually criticized myself that it was untrue in the book, even though it is a book that is impossible to make a good movie impossible. I'm figured it's going to make a film adaptation of bad books if they can sometimes read film makers. They attracted the man and his virginity to the interest of the boy and his mother, because most of them bored me (although I seriously suspected that it kept a person and his dog could not make it better). Most commonly; Bad books, bad movies, do not see it.
