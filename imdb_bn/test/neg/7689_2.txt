I'm a big MD fan. However, I see it as I call it. Limped along with this picture. The plot was preposterous. Access to the head of this film is easier to access than the local grocery store. Come on! Tone people have the passion of a wooden gap. Until the loose! The edit is sticky. Actors, and I use the word slowly, as if they are reading their lines in Valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. There are two possible possibilities for DDCF, but he likes scripts, "Stinger". <br /> <br /> If you want to see a better two-foot movie, then I can suggest a crash dive or avenging force. If you have not seen any of her films, then this is not to introduce you to her work. You will walk with a bad taste in your mouth and think all its projects are bad for this.
