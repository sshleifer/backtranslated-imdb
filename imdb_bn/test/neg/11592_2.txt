If you are looking for a movie that's just fun to watch, because you can make such a great acting, cheesy "special" effect and joke about the plot of general science-plot ... then it's a movie for you! Acting was bad, in fact, some actors were actually fairly decent. Special effects were not the maximum (say at least); The animals looked completely animated computer. It was a boring squawking to cover the oath and was playing only one song over again throughout the entire movie. Overall, a good movie is if you are looking for something fun and fun fun. It's not a good movie to see if you're looking for a serious one.
