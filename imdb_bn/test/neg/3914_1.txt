OK, <br /> <br /> I understand that Thomas has some doubts ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this excellent composition of celluloid. <br /> <br /> All of me. Can say that George Wendt is coming out of the spaceship with his A ** shaking me. I sometimes sit straight bolt in my bed, screaming like an old man in the table thinking about it. If the director is reading this ... I would have to give an extra to the sigail.
