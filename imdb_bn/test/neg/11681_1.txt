I rented a copy of this from Netflix - big mistake. The DVD version titled "The One-Armed Swordsman" was produced by crazy people, who thought that sequences of war would be better collected in a big chapter as part of a sequential, sequential story. Some stories were kept in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent or buy it. There was nothing extraordinary about the original story, a weirdly complex masked piece. After all these years, I love Wang Yu's main life, I love it a lot, it is a waste of time. I've made dish a detergent that made a better film than this. The spent-up DVD version shows us how stupid a Chinese script might look like, but you need to look at some of the stories to take care of how the sequence of war changes. <br /> <br /> "One Armed Torch" likes to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers, Low Leigh is beating a beautiful son, David Chiang - it's always happy to see it happen. Low works like a second-string villain, and works as a major example of why some people really need orthodontosts. He also acted as a magistrate with the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi. <br /> <br /> Another comment on the compulsory war-in-the-in-scene (two significant ones) where Wang and Chiang were attacked by a pack of curiosity barbarians who, when they saw the appearance of the cave weapon, . None of these gives any idea, but if you do not expect any transparency or general knowledge then it's okay. However it was fun to see it. <br /> <br /> Another specialty of this production is that there are no significant female characters. Some of the women's role, but they play a serious role in action or conspiracy. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of original Brother Brothers' one-armed Toro movie, which explains why he has only one hand and why he uses a broken sword, go for him.
