So we can think of it funny that this woman was on the way to the jungle - going to the battlefield - just wanted to know why her fianc√© did not travel to Switzerland? Or can we take it seriously? It's not even remote fun, tricky or entertaining - it's stupid - and so movies. One of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in movies is worse than Jar-Zaar Bungs. Dialogs try hard to be fun (almost all the time) but it never happens. The number of fun joke is somewhere in the zero and nothing. And for the plot - did they once stop us from explaining what the rebels are fighting for (not anti-government)? I guess it is not important to anyone - not even the rebels, not just in the dark letters to the battlefield in the dark. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is not fun or entertaining.
