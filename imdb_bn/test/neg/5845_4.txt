This story was a good film possibility. Opposing love for money and anger and sorrow for wrong. But the film was destroyed by the rage of Robert Redford, who proposed $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Pay for it like redford. Redford's children are in good shape and all American elegance is not respecting each other as disrespectful, threatening, cow-like. Redford's acting skills were inadequate to suppress his character. I can now see it, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. All right, lady says but you have to give me some time to raise money. Jack Nicholson has been perfect as sleazeball.
