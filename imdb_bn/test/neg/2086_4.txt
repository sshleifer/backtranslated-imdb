This spaghetti uses three American actors from Western Americans, which usually take Spaghetti Aura away. The plot is a non-violent issue that New Mexico Governor gives to all willing criminals to give them the chance to start their new life. Generally this type of scope is limited to past events, but this film seems more like a license to kill because even new crimes (e.g. threatening the governor's threat) are forgiven. Story killings are an endless discipline where almost every character is merely intended to provide the body. There are only a few lead stamina. Clay McClord was frightened by the nightmare about a childhood incident where he unknowingly killed many people. The lack of reliability of such reflection in the middle of perpetual Mahmud. For example, any character in this photo was not liked for me as compared to similar films. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak content, this film has been shot well on targets by certain customers, the set is a bit more detailed and the average of acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
