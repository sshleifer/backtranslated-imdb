The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest were predictable. This was just one of the few movies I got in my netfix instant queue and I thought that Brad Randro and Biju Phillips would be interesting to see it again from the buzz again. Unfortunately this "movie" has never happened. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and wants anything at any time (Philips). But Sonny likes the "crowd" from the boys (Ranfrough) and eventually starts hanging with them. And, of course, things like all other movies are good (or you do not ever mention the things that the film does not indicate) and then things hanging with rich children are not so good. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie is that there is absolutely no peak and valley. It's a dead living movie that you see after it, you think you could do even better. Some scenes (those with Ranfro's parents) do not feel comfortable in filming because the director and author are not following it. <br /> <br /> All the interesting topics that are completely ignored and they almost played almost to see them before the big episode (Misses Burton and Rachel Bison from the OC). <br /> <br /> The only flame in the film, and it did not receive a rating from me Philips. They needed more scenes with him. Renfro just looks like he picked up some of his character from the bullet. And, for the stomach, the title changes TS, the name.
