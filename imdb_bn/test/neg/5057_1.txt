Sorry for any spoilers that this has. But the way you want to read: I'm really surprised why Kevin Williamson is so much so much people Let's see his work as a photographer, we? Scrum 1 and 2 (as well as the next story), which I think is quite funny but exaggerated. Besides, franchise creates scrumbs, it becomes parody of horror movies and only becomes another. Then I have to know what you last summer, which is basically the same movie again. He is co-authors of Halloween: H20, but he did not have the ideas that monstrosity did not take credit for what he earned. Then the faculty comes, I can only say God is awful. (Though fun is a lot of fun). Even ridiculous, do not start me even on soap-operating Dawson Creek, how bad I might be for hours. So we get Mrs. Tingle of teaching. Above all, this one has a little uncertainty. For example: I know that in most high schools, Validicorian College is not the only one to go! The idea that Katie Holes's character would never be known as Katie Holes's character was not Validicorian. Have you ever heard of financial support, do not you? Also, I do not think you are expelled from high school or do not fall into college because of an examination cheating. There's another bunch, but I'll go to the big one now. Finishing really bothered me: They did an offense, but the teacher was just because it was okay. Great. Do you know how many teachers can I kidnap, based on that teacher? I'm sure the police never took any statement to find the whole story. Not sure if that will be needed. Helen Miron was good, she added some nice flash of a character (who had mentioned earlier as a commentator), she had no reason to do anything. And nobody else has noticed that Katie Holus could not work at all? His self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah." His last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I am sorry for losing $ 8.25 for this disaster is because it's a bit of fun. No, wait, I'm sorry to lose money: it was not real, and he was alive. Mr. Williamson, if you read this, you've made the same movie (offset some violence and / or scary things that make up the rhetorical joke and references to other movies). I count 6, with Scrum 3 and what follows), and if you want to stop I would be really grateful. Otherwise, I could just kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. OK? :-)
