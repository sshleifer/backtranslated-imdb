It's the most gracious excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I hate this that this guy is giving his own show It is a talented and extraordinary Dave Chapel trying to fill the left void, the smell of complete and foolish depression in the comedy center part He's a tip from Comedy Gold Neck Bag: Is not a punchline funny? Will that extra push in Hilarity? F *** ing YELL it's up to your lungs. Easy, no? And as an added bonus ... finish your half-jokes ... then you're RI-DEH !! Or do two-du-duhahaha! Oh man Very funny Binar ... too much sunny Wetback .... Will laugh ever stop? <br /> <br /> <br /> New Orleans are rebuilt about how Mensia is "upset", because it is near water. Genius The differences between a great comedy and a hack have not been drawn so clearly. While a good curiosity has found hidden humor in this tragedy, we have found a fine way to play a joke in which something we can both get laughing and comfort, Ned becomes clear. Remove the city. Great. Waiting, is that funny? There is no intellectual ability to find the deepest meaning of objects. Hurricane city floods, ned Levee was under the project and federal dollars needed serious ... and see! They break I guess we have to tell the way of God we do not have to be there. After all, he got a seat in the Congress. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> He was at ease with it, and above all, we laugh with him. Although Messias black people * Javan is not able to swim, * Chapel is 300 yards away with black and blind white superimmiss. You do not have to be scathing to be rigid. You will be the original <br /> <br /> Mensia and fans are like her closest gay couple who smile very well at gay jokes, they think they are in any way facing her safety. Of course, with Nader, he "hindered" all the ridiculous smiles. Du-du-duuuuh
