I think the filmmaker's heart was in the right place, but honestly, the film is really unaware. I was offended by the end of the tone and the last cop. You can not take it so lightly! After getting the final information about the film ... we see a 9-month pregnant wife and two boys as a gun and have to follow her for the next 2+ hours when she is trying to establish a new life? You can not have a character who sympathizes to do this. Can not! Note that we do not call this unnecessary lengthy film for 1/2 hours, why this person is suffering so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reaction to the word or movement - the element that is enjoying from the real Vector. We know that he has a pain in the ass's wife and can not financially take care of her and her 3 kids. What is going on in the current Iraq Vats is not seen in any study. <br /> <br /> Also, the film is suffering from a heavy elephant and completely inappropriate scores. This is a disaster. It is harmful for men's lead and sometimes some of Joe Morton's good acting. It predicts everything you are supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you completely wrong formula! Again, this man saw this brutal thing, and so he saw him getting a new job, seeing a new blonde, struggling behind counter making is not appropriate! And really, the end? What a freakin police out! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
