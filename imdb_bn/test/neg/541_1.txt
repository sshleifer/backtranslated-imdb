This tiny budget kitchen sink, Javan is a kind of movie that can be made only in the UK, before a green light is available in the world, it is necessary that a market exists. In most cases, it is an attempt to solve fundamental issues, but ultimately weakens the point of its existence, in order to ask the question, who will pay the distribution and secondly, if the market viewer is not monitored, buy or rent this image, Why would anyone bother at first place? My opinion may be for the first time to be a good creator, but it is a type of movie that can only reduce business efficiency and quality standards that only exist in a British film industry. Edinburgh review. 10 out of 2
