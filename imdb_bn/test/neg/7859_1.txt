"Heaven can wait" a crushing bore and a candy coated, lying misogynist. I can not imagine I'm sitting in the photo students today. Don Amech is in almost every scene, and, when there is no doubt that there is no doubt about his successful career on the radio, he does not have a career to carry his career. Ampe Henry, a feminist. Lubits wants Henry's sex inequality to be adorable and fun, and so he blames Amchek as far as possible and directs to run the part. The lack of charisma of Ameche and the combination of emphasis on the silence of Lubitsch is a lead character which is both deadly dull and completely icky You do not want to spend any time with these people; She will sleep you, you are her daughter, no matter her age, do not leave her alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The look of the movie is quite annoying. The scene includes static, excessive lighting, diorama-style shots consolidated after the gilded age scene, additional fox, lounging shirts and bustles stuff in Victorian parlors. There are many raffles and frills and kulakunja, so lilac and sky blue and pink, you need a drumhead. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it presents hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow on top. Contrast the message between the message and its delivery content. One of the hottest scenes in the movie, an old woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
