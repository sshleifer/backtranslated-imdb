French movie sucks! With all these psychological aspects of my God-i-cultivating special attitude! Fraud symbolic symbolic language and rude chief! And I do not mind! Leois Caracas, have you ever wondered if a conversation in a movie can be natural and vivid ??? Maybe I'm very simple to understand you? Or was it your job to ensure all the clinches of a Frenchman who could have the world? Gilliam to Two Biolotine comes to his house, mm. Denov in the film, playing: "Here I am, darling!" At this moment, I knew that he was in the bathtub, and we would soon lie to him there. Do not misunderstand me, I'm not loved, and the sex scene was the last episode of the movie. But in Berlin we say "etetate", "être-peut-être", a subliminal, self-satisfied, and the worst thing that can often be seen in French movies! Another example: He, beautiful and willing, gathered his hair, gathered his hair and entered in his wild beard, dirty young guru, shouting in the breath: "There is no escape, no escape!" Forty years after existentialist Crescent and Consort-What is new, exciting? My God, she is a woman and she loves you and praises you, will it be more natural to be happy with your life? And when you do, explain better, why !! Born French means you have to live extra life, do not run away, is that the point?
