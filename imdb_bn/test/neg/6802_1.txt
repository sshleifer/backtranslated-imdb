I do not know how this movie got so much positive comments. Someone might call it "artistic" and "nicely painted," but they are not ready for the empty plot filled with sexually impaired. I do not waste my time for watching this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse to promote strange and barbaric behavior. This was another Hollywood attempt to make our kind of life normal and okay. From the very beginning I asked myself the question of what the movie was and I saw it would change and it was very disappointing that it continued in the same vein. I am so glad that I did not spend money to see this theater!
