I actually joined this site to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and the movie came to the local channel. I was just enough before I made it about an hour through. Interested in watching the public opinion published in this movie's general-film-opinion, I saw it on this site. I was just wondering that it looked like it was huge. I needed to talk about it, and here it is: this movie is completely rubbish It was a sitting through. "Jokes" was another stranger in better shows and films, and the humiliating depiction of this humiliating character LeGuZamora should be appealed only for ten years and below. That might actually even be a stretch for that age. I'm all for the slapstick laugh, but there is no smallest point of intelligence or cleverness. I have an idea, take a bad uninspired obvious joke and let them play at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Haha Haha <br /> <br /> Add ridiculous and ridiculous time and originality to the movies you see: Marx Brothers' Nightmare of the Opera, Monty Python's The Mining of Life, South Park: Big, Longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because this image was immediately blacklisted. I actually impressed leguizamo that this mess was able to recover after.
