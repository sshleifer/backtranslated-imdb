"Graduation Day" is the result of success on Friday 13th August. These two films are rather mysterious than creative, bloody murders. If you enjoy this type of movie then I would recommend "Graduation Day". If not, I do not. There is nothing new here, just the same old killings. <br /> <br /> Although I gave 4 out of 10 pictures, I would say that this is not a boring movie. It is not just creative if it is watchable, aware about it.
