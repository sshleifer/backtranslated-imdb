I kind of had some high expectations for this movie. I always thought that Tom Seleck's less known movies (ie runway and coma), where they were under more pressure. Maybe the producers may have more knowledge about the big league baseball players abroad. Most of the players were very good for three baseballs, but there was no major league matriculation. I feel the idea of ​​putting Apple's character in Japan, to play in minors. Sadly, the title of this movie seems to be running in the autopilot as the title of most posts. I do not want to see a seagull, and hopefully, the producers will learn from the mistakes. The compound is very unique way to leave alone with this dishonor flick
