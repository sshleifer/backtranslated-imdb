The stupid horror film is about 20 events (3, 2 girls) going somewhere in the middle. They do not know. Chopper and his female assistants take part in their jungle and kill them. They test something ... or use their body parts for something. Five girls of college and two lesbians were also killed and some animosity were shown. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating. The story is confusing and annoying; Goor smile is sunny; Dr. Chopper and his colleagues were quitting quarterly; Here are some awesome black "humorous" and people only stand by them when their friends are attacked or just standing there and killing people. <br /> <br /> It was quite humiliating. There are a few plus. An hour was good in one hour and five young actors are really good! Chase Hoet Rys is great! Boych Hansen is right as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy Tamar and Robert Edmondson are also good at their moments like Nicholas. Chassal as cheyle as Jessica Best of all - he was excellent! Some of these five dramatic scenes were well played and interesting. Unfortunately the dialogue was not really for them. I'm giving it a 4 for their performance - but nothing else here is notable. Hope this actor will get their respective role.
