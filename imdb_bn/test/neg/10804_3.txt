Soultaker wrote and played Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Esteve, Greg Thompson and Robert De Jarque as David of Death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We can learn the role of solkar in this movie. <br /> <br /> Later, the youths are preparing for the summer of the college summer, "God of the World". The class of this movie is available everywhere throughout the war. Girls come from a rich class, and the boys come from fairly middle or lower class. Class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason that is not really clear or relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> To know more about the class struggle about why we are not Jack in Samarfest, Natalie encourages the date. Soultaker apparently makes an appearance, with the death angel of his boss. Here the character of Dar Jar refers to who dies and souls to be taken. It has also been revealed that Saltokar will have a conflict of character related to Natali and how he will deal with him because of his past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie has sunk in her journey to Samarfest, and Jach believes her ride home with her. While traveling around the house, Soltak played an active role because of the horrific destruction at high speed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story collects dead souls, and Jach and Natalie are trying to mock. Bring him back to his body so that they can survive. Class and character conflicts fall into the story, but never really comes forward or forth. <br /> <br /> There is an effort towards the end of dragging some plays, which are far behind and running which tend to be really annoying. This is not really acceptable, and it was good that it has been dealt with differently, in some way the play can increase but the audience can not be encouraged. <br /> <br /> The story and acting are good. Soundtrack is okay, even production value is good. <br /> <br /> In the short description of the presence of Robert De Zar, the angel of death acts as excellent. Joe Estevez is okay, but sometimes his role played a little bit. Vivian is superb and a decent work as Natalie, although probably on acting a bit in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> It may be a strange sound, but this movie can definitely benefit from some vague nudity. Vivian did not excite us a bit but was enough. <br /> <br /> According to me, it was a very serious effort to create a movie. The result, the price to see it. Do not just expect a perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
