I do not see why anyone would make such a movie. From the beginning, this film is really really bad. <br /> <br /> All of the characters are very shallow, extremely acting and awkward boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, it mainly comes to toilet humor and Even the 16-year-old executives may have trouble making smiles. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It will appeal to a film fan which has nothing. Existent smile and a plot that rarely exists, "Why is this photo made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Top 100 Bad Movies
