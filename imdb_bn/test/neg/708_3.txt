It was difficult for me to watch this movie. Stan looked very bad and sick, I thought, and Oli was heavier than remembering any other film. Although there was a gap between most difficult scripts / products where I was surprised by myself, "how did they come from here ???" It took almost half of the pictures before non-American actors could deal with Dubbing - it was also a confusion. <br /> <br /> While missing major actors like Lorel and Hardy - will there ever be great actors like old studio era ??? - This movie helps me understand why sometimes actors are "humble" in their head.
