To be fair, I do not see a lot of these shows. Perhaps it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I think it's almost running in the weekly schedule. Some shows do not have the following problem value per week. But I really tried it first, so it was not all bad. Maybe I hope to improve it, but I can not give this event 1. With all honesty I can not give it more than 2 <br /> <br /> It was not Masashi (I'm not going to type every stupid * type). And it is trying to be mash without any effort, like it just happens to be magically. What is a good guess? No magic The other thing that I can do here is to compare. <br /> <br /> Treasure John, M. D. Great show However, they were told by him, BJ Hannikut, M. D. It should be said because Pernell Roberts was just like the old BJ, but there was nothing like a Treacherous man. Keep all else the same, just change its name and show name. Presto! MASH was not the only signal to complete bomb and original humiliation. All in the Archie Bunker's Place family was a follow-up of lam. It was no heart, no conflict, no depth ?? All that made all of the family so memorable. Likewise, the month was fun because the doctors were reacting to the impossible irrationality of the war. Remove the war and you remove the drive for 99% laughter. Polar can not scream in the clinger to wear the dress, because Clinger is not wearing the dress because he is not trying to kick the army, because he is already out of the army, because the war is over. (Breathe) All jokes are forced because there was no motivation to do anything. There were at least sent visitors, to stay around and to watch the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I think, the whole program seems to have been standing naturally, like the Potter, Clinger, and the Spiral, a trio of viewers like Vaudville. It was a memorable for the Good Times, where they spent 90% of the time behind the couch and talked to the audience, they seem to be looking at natural conversations. They were not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that the studio uses unreasonable excuse that the movie of MASH Mush (which they owned) is not a TV series. Nice try, but Muqahli was the only one in the movie, and she was never deaf. I guess studio execs will do something for a bucket. A suitable sequel, something other than that.
