Spoiler !! Awesome camera work, awesome writing, unidentified plot, and numerous plot sculptures. Wonderful acting! Without Julia Roberts Those who weakly weaken Julia Roberts are disguised. Catherine Zeta Jones is very adorable in this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Twelve too much, even 12 classic aggregates for classic. And the problem is, we zoom in characters impressively, when they are in the same room in the same room. <br /> <br /> Yes, clonal food. Yes, Pitt's eating. Yes, "Jewish" is eaten. Yes, the gyke is eating. Yes, eat the body builders. Yes, Mr Sajjat ​​is eaten. Yes Yes Yes Yes, yes. Yes Ram Ram! This movie takes place at least three times. Yes, they all sit in the car, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, all of them are being brought out of jail, depressed. <br /> <br /> But as long as I was in the house, I realized how badly I got them. This is an intelligent movie, right? I went to see what, did not it? But when I entered and set my car keys in the changed gear, only I could understand: The film did not actually stall! That's right. This is an intelligent movie, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they tried. They try to steal some annoying documents or something in some people's house (whatever) and it seems to have already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they tried to steal some eggs from some museum (Yawn!), And they took it away and arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how some fairy French people have stolen before the eggs, and we also get all the joy of "entrapment", without this time the person inside the tight bitsuit around the fake laser ... is a ugly skinny French guy. Um <br /> <br /> But it came out that he did not even steal the eggs. Indeed, our heroes stole the egg, long ago, in another movie, which was a great movie to watch, they made this movie. Instead of <br /> <br /> we see a black color 30 seconds clip. White colleagues looted some of their back-packed college students. You've heard me ... Brave copper, finalist - these half-hour boring frogs buildup - they steal the back-packs of college students, creatively fight the baseball team and confuse him, and replace his back pack with a uniform back pack? What ?? <br /> <br /> I'm telling you, it was very bad, even I did not understand how bad - just how bad I would be looted - until I came back home.
