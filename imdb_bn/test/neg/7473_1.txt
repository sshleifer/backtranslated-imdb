I saw a drive at 9 years old. I remember a few scenes (where the main character is behind a guy in the Elk mask) and got horribly scared. It is now seen, my opinion has changed. It deals with a nightmare "horror" film by an Afranjan directed by Gloria Aarrame (sad) and a young, talented girl, Eli, who is sent there after her mother, the City Trump, pictured with a hammer (graphical shown) . In this film, the teenager (actually, the actors 20 percent of them) has been victimized due to peat, torture, murder, hunger, meat pushing, rape, rape etc. The brutal Hammer killings are the opening scene and it gets worse. There is nothing to recommend about this shit. The plot is stupid, all conversations are bad and acting ... less like said. How to get this sick with a GP (now PG) rating? It will now get a longer one. Worthless One last thing ... the real annoying turn is going to end in turmoil!
