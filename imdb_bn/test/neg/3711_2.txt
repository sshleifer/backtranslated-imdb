It's hard to find the value of praise with this movie. It's the worst picture ever made, but that's not a whole lot. The plot is quite helpless and incredible; It seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but The Abyss successfully decided to make cash payments. In some scenes it seems that the story was originally set from outer space; The sub is a landing gear, the craftsmen are deeply disturbed within a few kilometers depth of rubber diving suit, where the pressure can throw the case diver and empty beer. <br /> <br /> The picture is okay with the plan to recover lost navy. After that the movie took a jerk with Seren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are so. Navigation screens are made on Commodore 64 (note that this is not 1990, 1983), sub-sub-way controls such as any sub; Instead of the control console, the officers have keyboards with which they add a long sequence to control the ship's various functions. The interior of the ship is not very trustworthy. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jumped from strange to strange. Fifty welcome, you can check the suspension of your shutdown on the door. <br /> <br /> I fail to see the enjoyment factor here. The movie is not good or gently mst3k-style bad (until you reach the final scene), it's like eating a little bad apple.
