On Friday night with Jonathan Ross, they must be rubbing their sweaty little pumps together. They know that the BBC's imagination is not imagined when listening to Shona when they have Jonathan Ross with them, they sit behind the back and give half-intelligent this primetime slot command. <br /> <br /> Ross spends the most. He laughs at the grief of his ego and how much the BBC is giving him. The program is a complete copy of the many US chat shows - Leno, Letterman, Canaan and Brian, this list is underway - but he and his team clearly saw what could be done to the public for the stupid people of the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunate status - Do not have any competition? By Parkinson's reality, he was not really far too much without grooming a celebrity ego. We are not funny and chic on the British screen instead of Jonathan Rousse? Once Ross is promoting her pride, she will go to the very annoying idea of ​​rugged celebrities in the green house - so trying to communicate with each other. If there is a lottery (which often happens in these days - since no chat shows are shown - they can spend the next hour trying to flirt with them or trying to present their latest movies - their best friends in the universe) When skype had a ringo star - a man who does not care about killing an ass - Ross was actually begging for his mobile phone number (The general principle of this event is to get everyone's number for Jonathan Ross, so he can see the right company, if not working ). Of course Rango said how it is - and just told that I do not like you - the dead pan is serious. <br /> <br /> All the prizes and TV shows must be intact - it will be public.
