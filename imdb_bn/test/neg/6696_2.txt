A poor basketball movie. A graphic coach with a suspicious background came to the small Indiana High School basketball team in the 1950s and convinced the boys to break the coaches "first and then make them" coaches. <br /> <br /> Not bad issues. Photography is okay. But the plot is completely expected. No real sub-plot The movie added to make the movie exciting. You know what's going to happen from the very beginning. Suitable for 4th grade.
