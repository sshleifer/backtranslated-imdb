I want to give this image 1/10. This film is excluded from the content of ordinary movies and in Bollywood movies there is a lot of attention to the current "skin trends". I definitely would not suggest teens to watch this movie. Does it really make me feel helpless, such an amazing banner, such as Yash Chopra's film, can be such a terrible production? They may have forgotten to remember that the "adult" audience is bigger than the audience, when they publish such fair movies, their growing mind is separated and destroyed without intellect and recognition. <Br/> <br /> Overall, movies are not just for entertainment but in some sense it must be involved. Of course, this picture is very frustrating to Yash Chopra fans, especially I myself. I'm really frustrated over the plot, acting and everything else. Why are people unable to hold such posts after being confronted by the film, at least once for the whole movie? The point is clear. I want to briefly give my opinion: "Terrible - frustration - plenty of adults - lack of intelligence" substances - a lack of normal mentality - incompatible - instead of a carnoteo or templates can grab chocolate "
