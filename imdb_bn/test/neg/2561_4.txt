I think when it came, it was the first Kung Fu film we had seen around us and we were definitely excited to see it. Although the action was intermediary, but our first dog fu and our first taste was bad dubbing as well as making bad films or making movies in the Chinese people more accurately from time to time. They were confidentially questionable, but here was the price of entertainment and it was definitely taken for granted. The Kung Fu crease started and Bruce Lee and "Chinese connection" will soon follow with the hostage Wang Yu or 'Chinese Boxer'. In any case this picture was selected under the leadership.
