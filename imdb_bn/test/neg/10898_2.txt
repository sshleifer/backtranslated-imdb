I have never made it before, but this movie was really bad, I had something to say about it. <br /> <br /> I saw last year to create independent films. The worst (my opinion) of the Hollywood rally, the original trend seems to have been lost with good movies. Such films actually give a bad reputation to the independent film. <br /> <br /> Characters are annoying and ruthlessly stupid. The point is horrible, plotting is horrible, the plot itself is awesome, far away, stay away. A female nude breast featuring only a short scene, and even it was not worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The most awesome thing about this movie is the idea to visit it sometimes. I was not able to do it a 2 and 1 because the actors were visible and sound was audible - it earned one point for each feature.
