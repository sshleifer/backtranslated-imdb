This movie is a stack of trash, and it's a level of effort, and the first thing to do is to use liners out of the first one of the original things which it was down for me, which is called classic actors once, since Sam Eliot can not be reproduced in any way, I mean When Dalton phones ranks 1st and closes the call because it is cold, but when the dump is returned to the DEA agent, The way the call ends cold it really is not really the same ring, there are other but I can not get bothered to post, but I hope you get my drift, they should be named this roadhouse wannabe ....... .. .
