When I first saw my sister Zo101, we thought that it was garbage. Anyone lives in a dorm close to the rich and tranquil coast. At the ceremony, Joey is a mega popular rich girl who always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always one with good ideas and everyone is agreeing with her how stupid is her idea. She always perfected everything with her perfect figure. And he talks about carbs such as dietetic freak he knows what he knows. When he sees that his friends are eating chocolate he seized it. And there's another thing I have kept in mind that she will always look at her when you always keep a piece of Spirits repeatedly. And everyone wants to do something with him, for example, Logan wants to bid for $ 4000 and his friends are happy about what they do in their artificial life. And his friend Nicole screams a lot that freak outwardly too much. And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady 80 said that they want haircut hair here. Along the hairstyle, turn off the hair. This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to remind them that if they do not have the latest iPod and designer clothes they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumb. <br /> <br /> We hate you Jamie Lin, <br /> <br /> Good wishes Raian, and who are you?
