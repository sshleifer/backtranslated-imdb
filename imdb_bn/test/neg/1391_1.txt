Carlos Mencia is not just plain fun! Painful to watch her show Its sketch / parody is all very awesome, and this really seems like a filler for the Chapelle show, when I'm not a big fan, it's a lot of fun than this trash. Carlos Mensia gave foolish talks and he always ended his psychological work and "Dar, Darrow". It's not just funny. She often makes puns, while talking to others. They are terrible and painful. When people do not laugh, he blames them ... why nobody laughs, he is not funny. He has all the strange ideas about what he does on this show, it is amazing that anyone over the age of 3 years sees this. She is one of my most favorite things, water down every subject and it seems like a joke! I am hopeful that this racist statue can get out of the air as soon as it has entered a station that will not be bent anymore.
