I hope the matte draft script was better for this (its symptoms are - large f / x sequences (which should be before dialogue should be preceded before the presentation of characters), which can be understood much earlier, line; perhaps for the original script and running time But perhaps - in some cases, these scripts, each character is uncertain, and * everyone * exposed passages say that they are saying the word of God.
