My husband wanted to see this picture because the review in the magazine said that it is better than the fatal attraction. Well, do not like Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I have to agree. Although not for traditional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will be delayed by night when you do not want to see anything that is actually thinking, still do not want to go to bed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yongsi Butler is really enjoyable bad guy. She is not the best of the actress, in fact she is not even good, but she is perfect for this role in this photo. All of them changed from Pine to Oak, a little annoying son with whom a war criminal comes across Pinocchio. <br /> <br />: The finishing goes one or more away, with a roar, still you get the moment and then Pinocchio has a shot with his frozen smirk of wood which you forget about going for cool or just make-up in the botox That makes you wonder. <br /> <br> However, despite the fact that it is a sunny minute and bad movie, you will have to laugh with ginger to enjoy something. Do not pay for it, but if you are in that kind of indifferent tele-mood, then this is right.
