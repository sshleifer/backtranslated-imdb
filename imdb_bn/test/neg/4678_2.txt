Bad Company's best hit album is called "10 to 6". You could just turn on this album and cut the sound on this movie. This album had mostly songs in the movie. I think that in the early 1970's the elders were able to survive all the time created in the 1930s and 1940s. This is how I feel about the film made in the 1970s. Like the characters in the film, they were watching the auditions for Danny Terri. Why the movies have exaggerated in the 1970s? The only good time piece I've liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut that television show. When I was there in the 1980's, everything was fine at high school. I was old at the age of 70 and there was no such small town. It was perfectly mastered by the youth. Hippie and Philly were not responsive to talking about the inner city. At that age 70 I remember as a child. This movie was very docile and delicious. Sometimes I was falling asleep. I do not know why an actor who acted at the age of 70 was acting like this. He is probably trying to lend some credibility to it. Walking does not even show up to the second half. I think the only real thing about the movie "baby boomer" was a bad thing. All the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. I do not know what they did against their father.
