Creating a comedy is like playing a pretty thin tight-rope. It works either, or it does not. Grandmother is one of the movies that does not work. It can be a fun part, but in most cases it is simply a remarkable strange comedy from the general supporting characters of the film Adam Sandler (this is Sandlera himself, he is just a producer) <br /> <br /> Alex (Alan Covert) is a sports tester. She is 35 years old and the best tester and game player of her child-colored workplace. In order to not pay the bill, he ended up taking up his apartment and receiving his belongings from him (It seems that his roommate only spent the rent in the Filipino Hukur and did not pay the landlords). Suddenly, he goes with his grandmother, Lily (Doris Roberts loves everyone in Romand) and with his two roommates. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this film, throwing into a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, strangers from her day as Volam in Skubu Do) testers tried to complete the new game as soon as possible, the robot- The game was created by Pradigy JP (Joel Moore) who worked with Alex and most of the Matrix Neo same cloth, and non Syai, all kinds of sexual and drug-related humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the problem of the film, the real conflict in the film and it has been resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, that's not funny. It's totally mind-numbingly annoying, and only sparingly fun. Nothing really happens. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and strong oath whole tones. Actors say that you may laugh with some funny quipes, but otherwise you can sit with complete frustration, if you do not get bored with the film then you like it. How this picture became green and how Fox believes that it can earn money, I always have a mystery. No entertaining value from <br /> <br />. No actors are actually putting on good performance, they are just acting like Idiot for the camera and are waiting for the best. Stoner comedy has been done more than once, and on occasion, really works (go to Harold and Kumar go to White Cus and Dezed and Distracted minds). Here, it just makes the film for making less fun than before. Random attachment of monkeys and a pair of bare breasts do not really make the film even better. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few fun-one-liners, this movie should be solely solely missed out. It's not funny, the whole plot is stupid, it's annoying, and it only creates a terrific movie. Avoid it like a plug. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
